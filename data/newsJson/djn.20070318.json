Edited Press Release \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) Sunday announced clinical trial data for Seroquel sustained release formulation at the European Congress of Psychiatry in Madrid. \u001d  The data demonstrated that the Seroquel sustained release formulation, administered once daily, significantly improved symptoms associated with schizophrenia and increased the time to psychiatric relapse, when administered through a three-step dose initiation aimed at reaching the effective dose range on the second day of treatment. \u001d  Seroquel sustained release formulation is currently under review by regulatory authorities around the world for the treatment of schizophrenia and has not been approved in any market. \u001d  A randomized, double-blind study of 588 patients with acute schizophrenia compared Seroquel sustained release formulation with placebo and found a significant improvement. \u001d  A second randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study examined time to first psychiatric relapse in 197 patients with clinically stable schizophrenia treated with either Seroquel sustained release formulation or placebo. \u001d  Patients treated with Seroquel sustained release formulation experienced a significantly reduced risk of relapse and a significantly longer time to relapse, compared with those on placebo. \u001d  Differences in relapse rate between active treatment and placebo were large enough to require the study to be stopped early, in accordance with the study protocol. \u001d  In the Seroquel sustained release group, the estimated risk of relapse after six months was 14.3% compared with 68.2% in the placebo group. \u001d  Hospitalization due to worsening of schizophrenia was required by 8.3% of patients on placebo, but was not needed for any patients taking Seroquel sustained release formulation. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

(AP)--After many failed attempts to unionize dealers in this gambling city, more than 80% of the floor employees at Caesars Atlantic City casino have voted to join a union. \u001d  Full- and part-time table game, keno dealers and simulcast employees voted 572 to 128 late Saturday to become part of the United Auto Workers union, according to the national union. \u001d  \"Atlantic City is a real union town, but the one huge group of workers who were not unionized were the dealers,\" said Elizabeth Bunn, secretary-treasurer of the national UAW. \"The movement is excited about changing that, about bringing dealers in.\" \u001d  The union is also seeking to represent workers at Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino; a certification election will be held there March 31. \u001d  Alyce Parker, a spokeswoman for Harrah's Entertainment Inc., which owns four Atlantic City casinos including Caesar's, said on Sunday that the company will be filing an objection to the vote with the National Labor Relations Board. \u001d  The union won governmental approval for an election in February. Union policy is to have at least 60% of workers sign cards indicating their support for a union before submitting a petition to the National Labor Relations Board seeking an election. \u001d  Many of the 45,000 casino workers in the city already are represented by unions, including many service employees. But dealers are not among them. Previous efforts to unionize dealers by the Teamsters, the United Food & Commercial Workers and the Sports Arena Employees union all were unsuccessful. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d

killing Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl will file an appeal using an al-Qaida lieutenant's recent confession that he beheaded the reporter, a Pakistani lawyer said Sunday. \u001d  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who has claimed that he planned the 9/11 attacks, claimed at a U.S. military hearing at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that he personally beheaded Pearl for being an Israeli intelligence agent. \u001d  \"I decapitated with my blessed right hand the head of the American Jew, Daniel Pearl, in the city of Karachi, Pakistan,\" Mohammed told a military panel, according to a Pentagon transcript released Thursday. \"For those who would like to confirm, there are pictures of me on the Internet holding his head.\" \u001d  In 2002, an anti-terrorism court in Karachi sentenced Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British-born militant, to death and gave three other men life in prison for involvement in Pearl's killing. \u001d  Rai Bashir a lawyer for Sheikh and the other three men said on Sunday that he will study the Pentagon documents on Mohammed's claim and file his confession as evidence to prove Sheik's innocence. \u001d  \"He has not abducted Daniel Pearl, and he, along with his co-accused, is innocent...But now we are happy that this version has been verified by the Pentagon after the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,\" Bashir said in an interview with The Associated Press Television News on Saturday. \u001d  Pearl was abducted in January 2002 in Karachi while he was researching a story on Islamic militancy. Months after his abduction, the journalist's body, his throat slit, was found in a shallow ditch in a compound on the outskirts of the city. \u001d  Sheik and the three others - Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem and Sheikh Adil - are in jail and have appealed their convictions. \u001d  \"What we were saying for so many years in our trial, in the appeal, (is) that Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh is innocent and he has not committed that murder,\" Bashir said the interview from the eastern city of Lahore. \u001d  Bashir did not give a date for filing his petition. \u001d  The High Court in the southern Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital, is hearing appeals by the four suspects in Pearl's killing. Proceedings at the appeals court have been repeatedly delayed mainly at the request of defense lawyers, who often seek more time. \u001d  Mohammed was captured in March 2003 in Rawalpindi, a city near the capital Islamabad. \u001d  In addition to this and other newswires, Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal and its international and online editions, Barron's, the Far Eastern Economic Review, MarketWatch, Dow Jones Indexes and the Ottaway group of community newspapers.

Superjumbo On First Flight To US","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-18T10:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABI.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP"],"Story":"\b \u001d  FRANKFURT (AP)--It may trail the historic impact of Charles Lindbergh's 1927 solo flight across the Atlantic, but the Spirit of St. Louis also didn't have a wingspan wider than a football field or space for more than 500 passengers. \u001d  For plane builder Airbus and German airline Lufthansa AG, the A380's first flight to North America Monday is a chance to show off the superjumbo to potential U.S. buyers and to the airports they hope will be flight bases for the double-decker jet. \u001d  \"We're talking about an airplane that is representing aviation in the 21st century in terms of efficiency,\" said Jens Bischoff, Lufthansa's vice president for the Americas. \"Of course it is not just a test flight. We're going with a fully loaded plane into Washington and New York and hope to optimize all the opportunities.\" \u001d  For Airbus, which has been beset by management and financial crises -including a two-year delay to the A380 that wiped more than EUR5 billion off profit forecasts - the flight is a chance to prove that the plane will be ready when the first deliveries are made in October to Singapore airlines. \u001d  The air show Monday begins at Frankfurt International Airport when the 73-meter-long plane takes off at 0800 GMT for the eight-hour flight to New York's JFK Airport, scheduled to land at 1630 GMT. On board will be 550 people, including four pilots, four Airbus crew members, 23 Lufthansa cabin crew and 519 passengers, mostly Airbus and Lufthansa employees along with some reporters. \u001d  The flight will operate just as if it were a commercial one with full dining and entertainment services. \u001d  After that, Lufthansa and Airbus will operate a demonstration flight to Chicago O'Hare Airport Tuesday, before returning to New York and then Frankfurt. The plane then heads to Hong Kong and back, before continuing its journey to Washington Dulles International Airport March 25, with a final stop at Lufthansa's Munich hub March 28 to complete the series of flights. \u001d  Using the performance results from this circuit - flying the plane as it would be done so if it were in service - Lufthansa's goal is to match the A380's turnaround time from landing to takeoff with that of much smaller long-haul jets already in operation. \u001d  The A380, which burns about four liters of gas per passenger every 130 kilometers and can fly some 8,000 nautical miles, can seat as many as 550 passengers. Airbus has 166 orders from 15 airlines for the new plane, which has already made tests flights in Europe and to Asia. \u001d  \"We are proud that...we are now able to present the A380 to the American people,\" said Mario Heinen, the head of Airbus' A380 program. \"Both JFK and LAX, as well as Chicago O'Hare International and Washington Dulles International Airport are key future destinations for the A380.\" \u001d  The Frankfurt-New York flight is one of two A380 flights to the U.S. The other is an A380 operated by Australian airline Qantas that is flying to Los Angeles International Monday but devoid of passengers and crew, save for those in the cockpit. \u001d  Toulouse, France-based Airbus said that plane will perform tests at the California airport, including airfield maneuvers, docking at the terminal gate and ground and gate handling exercises. The Los Angeles airport, the fifth-busiest worldwide, is expected to be the first U.S. destination for the A380 when it enters commercial service. \u001d  \"The airports seeing the A380 this week and next are among the key future destinations for the A380 and following these flights, these hubs will prove themselves ready, willing and able to welcome the A380 for service,\" said top Airbus salesman John Leahy. \u001d  Lufthansa, which has orders for 15 A380s and an option for five more, expects to use the planes on its international routes, mainly to Asia and North America. It expects the first one to be delivered in mid-2009, pushed back from 2008 by the manufacturing delays. \u001d  The problems at Airbus led Louis Gallois, co-chief executive of parent company European Aeronautic Defense and Space Co., to call 2006 \"the worst year for Airbus in its life.\" Airbus is seeking to recoup its losses by cutting 10,000 jobs and spinning off or closing six of its European manufacturing plants. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007 06:35 ET (10:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

\u001d  PHILADELPHIA (AP)--Thousands of weary travelers faced a third day waiting to reach their destinations Sunday as US Airways Group (LCC) struggled to recover from the ice and snow storm that paralyzed airports in the U.S. Northeast. \u001d  The airline was still trying to find seats for 100,000 passengers systemwide whose flights were grounded by Friday's storm, spokesman Andrew Christie said. \u001d  Computer problems, airline staffing rules and other problems slowed US Airways' attempts to clear the backlog. In addition, the airline's flights on Sunday were already nearly sold out with 275,000 passengers booked, the airline said. \u001d  \"Now we are in the process of repositioning our crew, our planes and I am trying to re-accommodate roughly 100,000 customers who didn't make their final destinations on Friday,\" Christie said. \u001d  \"I can tell you the outlook for tonight looks good. We have the flight crews available and the weather is holding up pretty well,\" Christie said. \u001d  Passengers in Philadelphia reported waiting three hours or more to rebook a ticket or reach a reservation agent by phone during the weekend. Automated US Airways kiosks at Philadelphia International Airport were also down at times, they said. \u001d  US Airways operates two-thirds of the approximately 1,200 daily flights in Philadelphia. \u001d  Many of the travelers waiting for seats were stranded at the airport. Disposable blankets and pillows were handed out to several hundred people Saturday night, down from an estimated 1,000 or more people the night before, a spokeswoman said. \u001d  \"Once the passengers were rebooked and going through security, they were moving them (through) pretty quickly,\" airport spokeswoman Phyllis VanIstendal said Sunday. \u001d  There were also long lines at US Airways ticket counters in Pittsburgh on Sunday because of cancellations and delays at other airports, said JoAnn Jenny, spokeswoman for the Allegheny County Airport Authority. \u001d  \"It's just a busy time of year with spring break ... and then with that storm, that really put a wrench in the works for a lot of folks,\" Jenny said. \u001d  The storm had stranded hundreds of passengers at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, including hundreds stuck on planes Friday night as aircraft were unable to take off or find space at gates. \u001d  By Sunday, there were only scattered delays of up to two hours at New York's Kennedy and LaGuardia airports, with some delays of up to five hours at Newark Liberty in New Jersey, said Alan Hicks, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. \u001d  From Friday to Saturday morning, more than 3,600 commuter and mainline flights were canceled nationwide because of the effects of the storm. JetBlue (JBLU), US Airways, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines, a subsidiary of the AMR Corp. (AMR),  all reported cancellations. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007 16:01 ET (20:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6e2ee726f6a8e73be4d7e7396c72aa9b","symR":["WNDR.LN","GB0001218485"],"date":"2007-03-18","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Windsor PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-18T09:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WNDR.LN","GB0001218485"],"IndustryCodes":["INB","INS"],"Story":"\u001d  Windsor PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0001218485 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007 05:38 ET (09:38 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"6e3b92f5acd3cade01fd33edbe035936","symR":["5CP.SG","BCI.XX","DKS.YY","LLOY.LN","LYG","WBP.XX","BMG0691U1009","GB0008706128"],"date":"2007-03-18","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Link Is Frontrunner To Buy Lloyds TSB Registrars - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-18T11:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5CP.SG","BCI.XX","DKS.YY","LLOY.LN","LYG","WBP.XX","BMG0691U1009","GB0008706128"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","SOF","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Link, the privately owned U.K. cash machine network, heads a shortlist of four bidders to buy Lloyds TSB Registrars, the share registration and stock management arm of Lloyds TSB Group PLC (LYG), the Sunday Times reports, without citing sources. \u001d  Link is backed by U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital LLC and is competing against private equity firms Duke Street Capital, Warburg Pincus and trade buyer Silverlake Axis Ltd.

(NYSE: TXT) company, has a range of aircraft suited for a number of applications in Australia, New Zealand and throughout the region, according company officials. The company is showcasing some of its product range - including the Citation XLS and Citation Sovereign - this week at the 2007 Australian Air Show and Aerospace and Defense Exhibition near Geelong. \b \u001d  \"Our Citation Sovereign and Citation X both have cross-country range, as well as the performance characteristics suited for the variety of operations and weather common in Australia. The remainder of our business jet line-up - from the Mustang up to the XLS - is perfect for business travel up and down the busy east coast of Australia,\" said Todd Duhnke, Cessna director of International Sales. \"Business travel requirements in Australia, and in New Zealand, are different from other countries, and we think a customer here will find a jet in our range of nine different business jets to answer even the most stringent requirement.\" \b \u001d  \"Cessna's great strength extends to the training and sport aircraft world with our single-engine line - the 172, 182 and 206 aircraft,\" said Chris Bogaars, Cessna regional sales director for propeller aircraft. \"We recently placed a large number of singe-engine pistons in India and in China for pilot training. We already support a large fleet of single-engine pistons and turboprops in the region - more than 160 in Australia - and interest remains high.\" \b \u001d  Cessna has a joint exhibit at the Australian Air Show with its authorized business jet sales and service representative, Aeromil Pacific (Hall A - 1N26 and static display at Expo Way - TA15/16/17). \b \u001d  Duhnke said both the Sovereign and XLS on display at the show have proven to be popular in Australia, and in other parts of the world. The XLS, for instance, is the most popular business jet model ever, with more than 500 delivered since its introduction in 1998 to customers around the world. Combining a large, stand-up cabin and generous baggage stowage, the XLS operates from a variety of runway types and lengths (excellent short-field performance) and has a range of some 3,440 km (1,858 nm-NBAA IFR). \b \u001d  The Citation Sovereign, also on static display at Avalon, has a range of more than 5,200 km (2,847 nm) and service ceiling of 14,326 meters (47,000 ft.). Its performance allows it to operate on short runways such as Moorabbin (YMMB) Airport outside Melbourne, even on high-temperature days. \b \u001d  There are currently two Sovereigns operating in Australia; one in Perth and one in Melbourne. \b \u001d  Cessna announced in February it had won contracts in India and China to supply training aircraft. The company will deliver this year 72 Cessna 172 Skyhawks to the Civil Aviation Flying University of China and 11 Skyhawks to the Aero Club of India. Both orders will go to help satisfy the growing requirement for pilot training aircraft in both countries. \b \u001d  \"The growing requirement for pilot training we see in other parts of the region has always been present in Australia. People here love airplanes and love to fly them,\" Duhnke said. \"And as the premier general aviation aircraft company in the world, Cessna has been, and intends to remain, a big part of Australian aviation.\" \b \u001d  In addition to Aeromil, Cessna has sales or service agreements with Airflite Pty. Ltd. based near Perth, and Flightline Aviation Ltd. in New Zealand. \b \u001d  For local Australian reporters, you may contact Duhnke in Australia during the show at +1 316 519 5756. \b \u001d  Based on unit sales, Cessna Aircraft Company is the world's largest manufacturer of general aviation airplanes. In 2006, Cessna delivered 1,239 aircraft, including 307 Citation business jets, and reported revenues of about $4.2 billion and a backlog of $8.5 billion. Since the company was originally established in 1927, more than 189,000 Cessna airplanes have been delivered to nearly every country in the world. The global fleet of almost 5,000 Citations is the largest fleet of business jets in the world. More information about Cessna Aircraft Company is available at www.cessna.com. \b \u001d  Textron Inc. is an $11 billion multi-industry company operating in 32 countries with approximately 40,000 employees. The company leverages its global network of aircraft, industrial and finance businesses to provide customers with innovative solutions and services.

\b   By Anees Al Qudaihi and Majdoline Hatoum \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DUBAI (Zawya Dow Jones)--The fight for a potentially lucrative slice of Saudi Arabia's cell phone market claimed its first scalp Saturday when a consortium led by Egypt's Orascom Telecom (ORTE.CI) was barred from the license auction, with some of the region's wealthiest business leaders now expected to hear Saturday who has won. \u001d  Saudi Arabia, the last significantly untapped cell phone market in the Arab world, could net a hefty $6 billion from its latest telecom licensing round this week, analysts say, as seven consortia pitch to become the kingdom's third operator. \u001d  Orascom and a consortium led by Indian state-run Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. (500108.BY) were ejected as bidders for technical reasons, the kingdom's Communications and Information Technology Commission said. \u001d  Regional telecoms analysts Sunday suggested Orascom, an experienced and fast-expanding company, may have been subject of a tit-for-tat decision after Saudi Telecommunications Co. (7010.SA) was eliminated from Egypt's third cell phone license round in June last year, also for undisclosed technical reasons. \u001d  \"This was probably done as a response from Saudi Arabia after it was disqualified at the technical stage,\" an analyst said. \u001d  But a spokesman for the Commission reiterated Orascom and MTNL were disqualified for their failure to meet the technical and commercial requirements and it wouldn't go about \"denying rumors and interpretations.\" \u001d  A spokesman for Orascom was unavailable to comment. \u001d  The remaining consortia are led by companies that include Kuwait's Mobile Telecom Co. (MTC), South Africa's MTN Group (MTN.JO) and Dubai-based Oger Telecom. Their bids will be opened at the Commission's headquarters in Riyadh Saturday. \u001d  Some very wealthy business people are among those whose companies are left in the bid round, including Saudi billionaires Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, chairman of Kingdom Holding Co. and Citigroup's (C) largest shareholder, and banker and real estate businessman Abdullah Al Rajhi, the family of assassinated Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri through their Oger Telecom holding, and Irish millionaire Denis O'Brien through his Caribbean-based Digicell. \u001d  Saudi Arabia, which boasts one of the largest populations of all the Persian Gulf Arab countries and enjoyed a petrodollar-fuelled domestic growth rate of more than 12% last year, has the potential to sharply accelerate its cell phone penetration, industry experts believe. This justifies companies paying twice as much for the license as its estimated fair value. \u001d  \"The Saudi license is the last tempting one in the region,\" Andrawes Snobar of Jordan-based Arab Advisors Group said. \u001d  The kingdom's Commission wants to challenge the current cell phone duopoly. \u001d  Ibrahim Al Kadi, a senior official at the Commission, told Zawya Dow Jones last week that the consortia \"wouldn't be putting their money on the table unless they are seeing a big opportunity.\" \u001d  \"We believe the Saudi market is one of the best in the region with potential annual growth at 3.5%\", Talal Al Maiman, director for development and local investment at Kingdom Holding, added. \u001d  \"The buzz in the market is that the third telecom license could net as much as $6 billion,\" Wael Ziada, senior telecom analyst at EFG Hermes, said. \u001d  \"It is a fairly large figure,\" he added. \u001d  But if any market is worth it among the six-member regional Gulf Cooperation Council then it is Saudi Arabia, with the Commission's spokesman putting the cell phone penetration level at 80% and the number of subscribers at 19 million by the end of 2006. \u001d  \"This is a huge growth potential compared to other GCC countries where the penetration level ranges between 95% to 120%,\" Ziada said. \"So if the Saudi license ends up going for $6 billion, we won't be surprised.\" \u001d  MTC's Managing Director Saad Al Barrak recently told Zawya Dow Jones that the winning bid \"will definitely have to be above $5 billion.\" \u001d  Taking into account what Abu Dhabi-based Etisalat paid last year for a license in Egypt, the Saudi license \"should be $11 billion,\" al-Barrak added. \u001d  The kingdom's market is, according to its Commission, the highest telecoms revenue generator in the region, with $10.6 billion from fixed-line and cell phone users last year. \u001d  \"Such figures guarantee we will see a heated competition on the license,\" Mark Hammoud of Shuaa Capital said. \u001d  The figure is way above the license's fair value, Arab Advisors' Snobar said. \"According to our own estimation, the license's fair value is a little less than $3 billion.\" \u001d  Therefore, the $6 billion figure being touted \"would be a staggering figure that largely exceeds its fair value,\" Hammoud notes. \"But these companies are willing to go that high.\" \u001d  The industry measure of average revenue from each customer is $35 a month in Saudi Arabia, \"relatively high given the size of the population and the market's prospects,\" Hammoud added. \u001d  This contrasts with$21 a user from South Africa's MTN, $14 from Orascom in Egypt, and $11 from China Mobile (0941.HK) in its home territory. \u001d  Saudi Arabia currently has two cell phone operators, Saudi Telecommunication Co. and Etihad Etisalat (7020.SA), or Mobily, which broke STC's monopoly two years ago following intense competition from rival bidders. \u001d  The second license cost Etisalat 12.2 billion Saudi riyals, or $3.25 billion. \u001d  -By Anees Al Qudaihi and Majdoline Hatoum, Dow Jones Newswires; +966 1 291 4872; anees.alqudaihi@dowjones.com  (Maha El Dahan

Contract Delayed More Than 3 Years","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-18T18:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HAL","US4062161017"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  WASHINGTON (AP)--An Army contract to privatize maintenance at Walter Reed Medical Center was delayed more than three years amid bureaucratic bickering and legal squabbles that led to staff shortages and a hospital in disarray just as the number of severely wounded soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan was rising rapidly. \u001d  Documents from the investigative and auditing arm of Congress map a trail of bid, rebid, protests and appeals between 2003, when Walter Reed was first selected for outsourcing, and 2006, when a five-year, $120 million contract was finally awarded. \u001d  The disputes involved hospital management, the Pentagon, Congress and IAP Worldwide Services Inc., a company with powerful political connections and the only private bidder to handle maintenance, security, public works and management of military personnel. \u001d  While medical care was not directly affected, needed repairs went undone as the staff shrank from almost 300 to less than 50 in the last year and hospital officials were unable to find enough skilled replacements. \u001d  An investigative series by The Washington Post last month sparked a furor on Capitol Hill after it detailed subpar conditions at the 98-year-old hospital in northwest Washington and substandard services for patients. Three top-ranking military officials, including the secretary of the Army, were ousted in part for what critics said was the Pentagon's mismanaged effort to reduce costs and improve efficiency at the Army's premier military hospital while the nation was at war. \u001d  IAP is owned by a New York hedge fund whose board is chaired by former Treasury Secretary John Snow, and it is led by former executives of Kellogg, Brown and Root, the subsidiary spun off by Texas-based Halliburton Inc. (HAL), the oil services firm once run by Vice President Dick Cheney. \u001d  IAP finally got the job in November 2006, but further delays caused by the Army and Congress delayed work until Feb. 4, two weeks before the Post series and two years after the number of patients at the hospital hit a record 900. \u001d  \"The Army unfortunately did not devote sufficient resources to the upfront planning part of this, and when you do that, you suffer every step of the way,\" said Paul Denett, administrator for federal procurement policy at the Office of Management and Budget, the White House unit that prepares the president's budget and oversees government contracts. \u001d  The contract includes management of Building 18, which houses soldiers with minor injuries and was highlighted in the Post series as symptomatic of substandard conditions: black mold on the walls of patient rooms, rodent and cockroach infestation, and shoddy mattresses. \u001d  Those 54 rooms are now vacant. Interior work cannot be started until a badly damaged roof is repaired, and that will need another contract because it's not covered in the IAP contract, Walter Reed officials said. \u001d  \"These rooms are exactly as they were left,\" Sgt. Gary Rhett, manager of Building 18, said Thursday. \"No changes have been made.\" \u001d  The Army has confirmed the timing of the contract delays but declined several requests for comment on why the protest and appeal process took so long, even as more and more injured soldiers were arriving. \u001d  The trail goes back to the end of the Clinton administration. The Army began studying the cost benefits of privatization in 2000. \u001d  When President George W. Bush took office, he mandated the competitive outsourcing of 425,000 federal jobs. At the time, the Pentagon was aggressively pushing for increased outsourcing, and in June 2003, then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told a Senate committee he was considering outsourcing up to 320,000 nonmilitary support jobs. \u001d  That's the same year that the Army asked for bids on Walter Reed and, coincidentally, the same year the U.S. invaded Iraq. \u001d  One company responded: Johnson Controls World Services Inc., which would be acquired by IAP in March 2005. It initially bid $132 million, but it and Walter Reed's then-management agreed that the Army was underestimating the cost. \u001d  By September 2004, the Army had decided it would be cheaper to continue with current management, which said it could do the work for $124.5 million. Johnson Controls filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office. \u001d  The protest was dismissed in June 2005, but the Army agreed to reopen bidding three months later to include additional costs for services. In January 2006, after two rounds of protests by IAP and two appeals by Walter Reed employees to the U.S. Army Medical Command, IAP was named the winner, according to Steve Sanderson, a Walter Reed spokesman. \u001d  Instead, in an unusual turn of events, the contract wasn't awarded for another 11 months, the GAO said. Walter Reed officials blame several factors, including an additional protest to the GAO filed by Deputy Garrison Commander Alan D. King, a separate appeal to the U.S. Army Medical Command by Walter Reed's public works director, at least one intervention by Congress, and delays on required congressional notifications about government employee dismissals. \u001d  IAP spokeswoman Arlene Mellinger said \"it was up to the Army to decide when to begin that contract.\" The company was ready to start at any time, she added. \u001d  In August 2006, led by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., lawmakers asked then-Army Secretary Francis J. Harvey to hold off on the contract until Congress finished work on the fiscal 2007 defense appropriations bill. Congress approved that bill Sept. 29. \u001d  The Army's plan then was to eliminate 360 federal jobs at Walter Reed in November and turn the work over to IAP, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, a federal workers' trade union. But the Army failed to notify Congress 45 days in advance, as required by law, so the turnover was delayed until early this year. \u001d  Then it was IAP's turn to have problems. \u001d  When work finally began at the hospital, IAP made an immediate request, which the Army approved, to hire 87 temporary skilled workers for up to four months \"to ease the turbulence caused by employees being placed into positions or other installations and otherwise finding new jobs early,\" said Sanderson, the Walter Reed official. \u001d  However, a \"tight\" job market in the Washington area meant that only 10 qualified temporary employees were found, he added. Meanwhile, injured soldiers continue to arrive weekly to a short-handed, deteriorated hospital, which the Army still plans to close in 2011. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007

(Nasdaq:GETI) announced this evening that it would require an extension of time to file its annual report on Form 10-K, which was due to be filed today.

 (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \b \b   By Edward Taylor, Jason Singer, and Carrick Mollenkamp \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow JOnes)--ABN Amro Holding NV has attracted a number of informal merger approaches including one from Barclays PLC, since coming under pressure in February from shareholders to consider splitting up its far-flung operations and selling them off, according to people close to the situation. \u001d  But the big Dutch bank, which has large businesses in the U.S., Italy and Brazil, has been working on a defense plan. It will reiterate its restructuring already underway as well as additional details on how it can cut costs and boost efficiency with its existing portfolio of major holdings, these people said. A Barclays official declined to comment. \u001d  ABN Amro has a market value of about $69 billion, while Barclays of the U.K. has a valuation of about $86 billion. \u001d  The plan, which is set to be announced just prior to ABN Amro's Arpil 26 shareholders meeting, will include proposals to sell some non-core businesses, these people added. ABN Amro isn't engaging in talks with its potential suitors, which include big banks from a range of countries, until the plan is presented to shareholders, they said. An ABN Amro official declined to comment. \u001d  It isn't clear if ABN Amro's strategy will placate disgruntled shareholders, including hedge funds with only  small shareholding, who have publicly urged the bank to sell off its major businesses or seek a merger for the whole bank to create more value for shareholders. \u001d  Managers at the Amsterdam-based bank are convinced, however, that the depth of the restructuring measures will trickle through to the market and result in a long awaited boost to the stock price. \u001d  In 2000, ABN said it aimed to be among the five top performing financial institutions by the end of 2004. According to Chief Executive Rijkman Groenink, the reasons why ABN Amro did not achieve the objective is because the bank was too ambitious at the time and had underestimated the restructuring that was needed. Today it says it has an ambition to be among the global top five performers as measured by shareholder yield by 2008 and to have an average return on equity of 20% by 2008. \u001d  Since 2000, Groenink has slashed almost 11,000 jobs, overhauled the organization's structure and pledged to remove at least EUR900 million from its cost base by 2008, which included cutting about 900 jobs in North America. \u001d  ABN Amro has been trying to focus on retail banking with some investment banking operations, while paring its investment banking and corporate banking businesses. With operations in 53 countries, the bank has said it will concentrate on four main markets: The Netherlands, Italy, the U.S. and Latin America. \u001d  It's already been shedding stakes in businesses outside these markets. In January ABN Amro sold its U.S. mortgage activities to Citigroup for an estimated $3 billion. It sold its stake in K&H, one of the largest corporate banks in Hungary to KBC, for 200 million in 2006. \b \u001d  -By Edward Taylor, Jason Singer, and Carrick Mollenkamp, The Wall Street Journal \b

Project Slated to Be a Leading Supplier of Gas \b \u001d  SAN RAMON, Calif. and DHAKA, Bangladesh, March 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced the inauguration of the Bibiyana natural gas field, which is located onshore in Block 12 in the northeast of Bangladesh in Habiganj District. \b \u001d  Bibiyana, one of the largest gas fields in Bangladesh, is expected to initially produce 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (mmcfd). The plant's full capacity of 600 mmcfd is scheduled to be available by late 2007, with the field reaching maximum total production of 500 mmcfd by 2010. Once full production is realized, Bibiyana is set to become the largest producing gas field in the country. \b \u001d  Speaking during the inauguration ceremony at the Bibiyana field, John Watson, president, Chevron International Exploration & Production, said, \"Achieving first gas at Bibiyana is a significant milestone for Chevron and demonstrates the company's ability to select and execute major capital projects. \b \u001d  \"Bibiyana is a world-class gas resource that is expected to supply reliable, clean energy for the next 20 to 30 years,\" he said. \b \u001d  The project includes 12 development wells, a gas plant, a natural gas pipeline and a condensate pipe line. The company has signed a gas purchase and sales agreement with Petrobangla, the state owned oil and gas company. \b \u001d  Managing Director and President of Chevron Bangladesh Andrew Fawthrop said, \"The Bibiyana project was a huge undertaking that demonstrates our ability to bring online technically complex projects in challenging circumstances. We extend our gratitude to our employees, the government, Petrobangla, local contractors and the community for working with us to reach this landmark achievement. \b \u001d  \"Chevron is proud of our record at Bibiyana, where Bangladeshi contractors have performed more than 10 million man hours of project-related civil works, pipeline and gas plant construction without any major incident. At peak construction, the project employed more than 2,000 Bangladeshi workers through Bangladeshi contractors,\" said Fawthrop. \b \u001d  Chevron holds interests in three production sharing contracts in Bangladesh, encompassing more than 10,000 square kilometres (2.47 million acres). Chevron Bangladesh has a 98 percent working interest in Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar fields, with the latter two fields having a combined average total production of 330 mmcfd. Chevron also has a 43 percent interest in Block 7 in southern Bangladesh where the company conducted seismic survey in 2006. \b \u001d  The Bibiyana inauguration event was attended by Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, the Honorable Chief Adviser of the Caretaker Government; Tapan Chowdhury, Power and Energy Adviser; Patricia A. Butenis, U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh; A.M.M. Nasir Uddin, Secretary, Energy & Mineral Resources Division; John Watson, President, Chevron International Exploration & Production; and Andrew Fawthrop, Managing Director and President of Chevron Bangladesh. \b \u001d  Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading energy companies.

18, 2007-- \u001d  Cessna Aircraft Company, a Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) company, has seen an increase in sales activity for the Citation Mustang in the past few months following its certification, according to Todd Duhnke, Cessna director of International Sales. \b \u001d  \"The Mustang makes perfect sense for businesses across Australia, and in New Zealand,\" Duhnke said. \"Performance, price and reliability are all meeting our original projections, and sales have really accelerated since gaining full type certificate in September.\" \b \u001d  Duhnke said the first Citation Mustang will arrive in Australia in August and will be used as a demonstrator. The aircraft was ordered by Aeromil Pacific, Cessna's authorized sales and service representative at Bankstown Airport in Sydney. The second Mustang for Australia was ordered by a Queensland businessman who plans to fly the aircraft himself. \b \u001d  Cessna, through Aeromil, recently made its first Citation Mustang sale to a customer in New Zealand, Duhnke added. \b \u001d  The Citation Mustang gained certifications for single-pilot operations as part of its overall U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification last September. The Mustang gained full production certification in November. Cessna will deliver 40 Citation Mustangs in 2007, and ramp up to 100 aircraft in 2008. \b \u001d  Based on unit sales, Cessna Aircraft Company is the world's largest manufacturer of general aviation airplanes. In 2006, Cessna delivered 1,239 aircraft, including 307 Citation business jets, and reported revenues of about $4.2 billion and a backlog of $8.5 billion. Since the company was originally established in 1927, more than 189,000 Cessna airplanes have been delivered to nearly every country in the world. The global fleet of almost 5,000 Citations is the largest fleet of business jets in the world. More information about Cessna Aircraft Company is available at www.cessna.com. \b \u001d  Textron Inc. is an $11 billion multi-industry company operating in 32 countries with approximately 40,000 employees. The company leverages its global network of aircraft, industrial and finance businesses to provide customers with innovative solutions and services. Textron is known around the world for its powerful brands such as Bell Helicopter, Cessna Aircraft Company, Jacobsen, Kautex, Lycoming, E-Z-GO, Greenlee, Fluid & Power, Textron Systems and Textron Financial Corporation.

\u001d  (Updates results) \b \u001d  HELSINKI (AP)--Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen's Center Party was leading the Finnish Parliamentary election Sunday with nearly two-thirds of votes counted, official results showed. \u001d  The results released after polls closed showed Center with 27.2%, ahead of its coalition partner, the Social Democrats, with 21.8%. The main opposition Conservatives were in third place with 20.1% in the partial count, which included ballots cast in advance. \u001d  \"Normally in the advance votes we do quite well,\" a cautious Vanhanen said. \"Any one of the three could win.\" \u001d  A strong showing for the Conservative Party could lead to the formation of a new center-right government, and leave the Social Democrats in opposition for the first time since 1995. \u001d  \"I'm very sure that we will be one of the biggest winners,\" Conservative leader Jyrki Katainen said as he watched the results trickle in. \u001d  The third coalition partner, the small Swedish People's Party, had 4.4% in the partial results. \u001d  The election outcome was not expected to yield major changes in the country of 5.3 million that is one of Europe's most homogenous societies. \u001d  There is broad agreement among the major parties on most policies, including on maintaining Finland's neutrality and its welfare system financed by high taxes. The Conservatives are more open to NATO membership, but are not pushing the issue because of public opposition. \u001d  Marita Aronen, 57, a staunch Social Democratic supporter, said she would not be surprised if the party was ousted from the next coalition. \u001d  \"This is such a consensus society anyway that there's not much difference between parties,\" she said, outside a polling station in northern Helsinki. \u001d  In a break with tradition, the major parties campaigned on election day, trying to mobilize their supporters and win over undecided voters. \u001d  Vanhanen cast his ballot in his home district outside Helsinki. A recently released book by his former girlfriend, exposing details about their love life, has only boosted the prime minister's popularity, analysts say. \u001d  Finnish news agency STT reported Sunday that Vanhanen would request that police investigate whether the book violated privacy laws. \u001d  Finland, home to the world's largest mobile phone maker, Nokia Corp. (NOK), has a booming economy and consistently ranks high in international surveys on competitiveness. Its notoriously high unemployment rate has dropped to the EU average under Vanhanen's government - 7.6% in January - but critics say he has failed to improve health care. \u001d  Pensions and elderly care were among the main election issues in a country where the proportion of people aged 65 or older has doubled to 15%, from 7% in the 1950s. \u001d  Almost 30% of the 4.3-million electorate cast advance ballots for the 200-seat Parliament. The vote falls on the 100th anniversary of Finland's first elections, which was the first worldwide to give women the right to run for office. \u001d  The new Parliament convenes later this week, and on April 17 lawmakers choose a prime minister - usually the leader of the biggest party. Two days later, President Tarja Halonen is expected to formally name the new Cabinet. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007 15:31 ET (19:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow

(NYSE: SVN) (the \"Company\") announced today settlements, negotiated and approved by the Special Committee of its Board of Directors (the \"Special Committee\"), with the Company's former President and Chief Operating Officer F. David Radler (including his wholly-owned company, North American Newspapers Ltd. f/k/a F.D. Radler Ltd.) and the publishing companies Horizon Publishing Company (\"Horizon\") and Bradford Publishing Company (\"Bradford\").  Under the settlements, the Company receives $63.4 million in new cash (i) to settle the Company's claims against Mr. Radler, Horizon, and Bradford; (ii) to settle potential additional claims against Mr. Radler related to the Special Committee's recent findings regarding backdated stock options; and (iii) to satisfy Horizon's and Bradford's debts to the Company.  This increases the total proceeds received from Mr. Radler and the above entities since the launch of the Special Committee to approximately $72.03 million. \b \b \b    The $63.4 million in new cash breaks down as follows: \b \b     -- $21.18 million from Mr. Radler. \b     -- $23.3 million from North American Newspapers Ltd. \b        (an entity that Mr. Radler wholly owns). \b     -- $11.78 million from Horizon, $5.03 million of which represents early \b        repayment of an outstanding note due June 2007. \b     -- $7.15 million from Bradford, $5.3 million of which represents early \b        repayment of an outstanding interest-free note due July 2010.  This \b        note is carried on the Company's books at December 31, 2006, \b        at $3.4 million. \b \b \u001d  The Company has received all of the above cash, except the $7.15 million Bradford amount, which under the settlement with Bradford must be paid no later than April 30, 2007.  Subject to Bradford's compliance with the terms of its settlement agreement, these funds represent final resolution of all claims that the Company has against Mr. Radler and the above companies. \b \u001d  Gordon A. Paris, Chairman of the Special Committee, said:  \"Today the Company takes a significant step in obtaining restitution for the acts of the Company's controlling shareholders and former management.  The settlements announced today -- combined with the previously -- announced settlements with the Company's former counsel Torys LLP, its former outside directors, and former officer Peter Y. Atkinson and the 2004 Delaware judgment against Conrad M. Black and Hollinger Inc. -- bring the total recoveries thus far to approximately $185 million.\" \b \u001d  The Special Committee continues to pursue the Company's claims in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Conrad Black, Barbara A. Black, John A. Boultbee, Daniel W. Colson, Richard N. Perle, Hollinger Inc., Ravelston Corporation Limited, and Ravelston Management Inc. \b \b    About Sun-Times Media Group \b \u001d  Sun-Times Media Group, formerly known as Hollinger International Inc., is dedicated to being the premier source of local news and information for the greater Chicago area.

private-equity firm Carlyle Group L.P. may buy a reduced 45% stake in Chinese machinery producer Xugong Group Construction Machinery Co., which would mark the second time that the size of the stake the U.S. firm has offered to purchase has been cut, the Beijing News reported over the weekend, citing an unnamed source. \u001d  The report cited a person with the securities affairs department of the Chinese company's Shenzhen-listed unit, Xugong Science & Technology Co. (000425.SZ), as saying that the subsidiary would announce the revised plan Monday. \u001d  Xugong Science & Technology's shares were halted Friday. The company said it was waiting for an important disclosure from its controlling shareholder Xugong Group. \u001d  In October 2006, Xugong Science & Technology said Carlyle had offered to pay 1.8 billion yuan ($233 million) for a 50% stake in its parent. \u001d  Carlyle originally offered to buy 85% of Xugong Group Construction Machinery for $375 million, but the offer prompted complaints in China about asset sales to foreigners. \u001d  Earlier this month, Chinese Commerce Minister Bo Xilai said that Carlyle was still negotiating the size of the stake it was planning to take in Xugong Group. \b \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.thebeijingnews.com \b \u001d  -Victoria Ruan contributed to this story, Dow Jones Newswires; 8610 6588-5848; victoria.ruan@dowjones.com \b \u001d

Delaney \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Google Inc. (GOOG) said Friday that it acquired Adscape Media Inc., a closely held San Francisco company that makes technology to deliver advertising over the Internet for placement within video games. \u001d  Terms of the acquisition, which had been expected, weren't disclosed. The acquisition could eventually allow Google, Mountain View, Calif., to offer the hundreds of thousands of advertisers who currently buy online ads through its system to also buy ads that appear within video games. That would fit with Google's ambitions to broker advertising across many types of media globally. \u001d  \"As more and more people spend time playing video games, we think we can create opportunities for advertisers to reach their target audiences while maintaining a high quality, engaging user experience,\" Google said in a statement on its Web site. \u001d  Delivering ads into games - such as a virtual billboard on a racetrack or a poster in a boxing arena - is a small business, but many in the video game industry believe it could eventually be lucrative. \u001d  Google separately said Friday it acquired from the Stockholm-based Gapminder Foundation the Trendalyzer software used to generate interactive graphics from data. The Trendalyzer development team is joining Google; other terms weren't disclosed. \b \u001d  -By Kevin J.

\u001d  NEW YORK (AP)--Airlines unable to fly because of problems with deicing equipment during a winter storm left hundreds of passengers stranded on jets at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. \u001d  The exact number of planes stuck on the tarmac Friday night and Saturday morning was unclear, but irate passengers and airport officials said as many as a dozen may have been involved. \u001d  Pilots and officials blamed some of the problems on a shortage of deicing fluid and a new federal regulation giving pilots a narrow window to get their planes in the air once the chemicals are applied. The change has meant some jets need to get doused repeatedly if their takeoffs are delayed. \u001d  Whatever the reason, passengers weren't happy. \u001d  Rahul Chandran said he was trapped aboard a Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) jet from midnight until nearly 9:30 a.m. EDT Saturday, when the flight to Vancouver was finally canceled. \u001d  Throughout the night, he said the plane waited endlessly to have its wings sprayed. The pilot said the terminal had run out of fluid and more needed to be trucked in. When the airline finally tried to return the plane to its terminal, it took at least another hour to arrange a gate, he said. \u001d  \"You can't keep your passengers on the plane for 9 1/2 hours,\" said Chandran, 30, of New York City. \"They kept saying 'half an hour more, 45 minutes more.' But by the time it got to hour six, we were pretty much accepting that we weren't going to go ... At least in the terminal, you can get up and walk around.\" \u001d  The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the metropolitan area's airports, said airlines - not the airport - are responsible for supplying and maintaining terminal deicing equipment. \u001d  But Port Authority aviation director Bill DeCota said airport operators and the carriers need to collectively work out a solution quickly to what is evolving as a major problem with deicing. \u001d  Just last month, JetBlue stranded passengers on several planes for up to 10 1/2 hours during a similar storm. At the time, the airline said its inability to get planes deiced in accordance with the new FAA rules was a factor. \u001d  \"We and the carriers need to sit down and find out whether there is anything we can do,\" DeCota said. \"I know there are a lot of irate passengers, and they have a right to be.\" \u001d  The airlines experiencing problems during Friday's storm included South Korean carrier Asiana Airlines (020560.KQ), the charter company Miami Air and Royal Air Maroc, the national airline of Morocco. \u001d  Royal Air Maroc kept one plane full of passengers on the tarmac for nearly 14 hours, DeCota said. \u001d  One Virgin Atlantic flight from London - diverted to JFK when bad weather temporarily closed Boston's airport - sat on a taxiway with almost 200 passengers on board for around six hours before it could take off again, said Virgin spokeswoman Brooke Lawer. \u001d  The plane, which was supposed to have arrived in Boston at 6:30 p.m. EDT Friday, finally touched down there at 4 a.m. EDT Saturday. \u001d  A second Virgin Atlantic jet that was supposed to have flown to London boarded about 100 passengers for a 9:45 p.m. EDT flight Friday, then kept them on the plane until sometime after 4 a.m. EDT, when the flight was canceled. \u001d  \"I know that deicing was a significant factor,\" Lawer said. \u001d  Asked why the airline didn't return passengers to the terminal, she said there was a shortage of gates, and the airport was already overrun with travelers unable to escape the storm. \u001d  \"We know that there were thousands of people in the terminal, with very difficult circumstances in the terminal, and we were able to provide service, information and some level of comfort for our passengers while they were on the plane,\" Lawer said. \u001d  Virgin Atlantic is jointly owned by Virgin Group and Singapore Airlines Ltd. (S55.SG). \u001d  From Friday to Saturday morning, more than 3,600 commuter and mainline flights nationwide were canceled because of the storm. US Airways Group (LCC), Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) and AMR Corp.'s (AMR) American Airlines all reported cancellations. \u001d  As for JetBlue Airways Co. (JBLU), the airline took no chances of a repeat of its problems last month. It canceled about 400 of 550 of all scheduled flights, rather than risk leaving more people stuck aboard idle planes. \u001d  JetBlue had mostly normal operations Saturday, said spokeswoman Jenny Dervin. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007 01:51 ET (05:51 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

STREET JOURNAL ASIA \u001d  BEIJING (Dow Jones)--Carlyle Group has agreed to further reduce its planned stake in Xugong Group Construction Machinery Co., according to a statement from the Chinese company's listed unit, the latest twist in a long-running negotiation that has come to symbolize the difficulties foreign companies can face in making acquisitions in China. \u001d  The Washington private-equity firm Friday signed a revised agreement that calls for Carlyle to purchase 45% of the maker of cranes and earth-moving equipment, the statement said. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  In the original deal, signed in October 2005, Carlyle proposed buying a controlling 85% stake for $375 million. A year later, after failing to secure government approval, it proposed buying only 50% of the company, for about $230 million. \u001d  The new deal was announced by Xugong's listed unit, Xugong Science & Technology Co. (000425.SZ), in a statement this weekend to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Financial details weren't disclosed, and the arrangement is still subject to government approval. \u001d  The deal has attracted a good deal of public attention from domestic critics, who argue that China shouldn't be selling important companies to foreign investors. If the revised deal goes through, the construction-machinery company will still be 55%-owned by Xugong Group, which is itself owned by the government of the city of Xuzhou, in the eastern province of Jiangsu. \u001d  -By Andrew Batson, The Wall Street Journal Asia \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007 04:42 ET (08:42 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

The target is to control its NPL ratio to no more than 2% by the end of this year, the bank said. \u001d  The bank's assets totaled CNY700.4 billion at the end of last year, up 26% from the year-earlier time, the statement said. The bank forecast its assets will reach CNY833 billion at the end of this year, representing a 18.9% growth from the year earlier. \u001d  The bank's total deposits rose 19.3% to CNY583.3 billion at the end of last year from CNY488.8 billion at the end of 2005. Total outstanding loans grew 18.4% to CNY447.4 billion from CNY378.1 billion over the same period, the bank said. \u001d  By the end of this year, the bank is aiming to grow its deposits to CNY685 billion and outstanding loans to CNY532 billion, it said. \u001d  As of Dec. 31, the bank's capital adequacy ratio was 8.12%, down from 8.26% at the end of 2005 but still above the 8% official requirement. The bank's core capital adequacy ratio stood at 4.35% at the end of last year, the statement said. \u001d  In the new year, Minsheng Bank is aiming to develop further its asset securitization business, obtain licenses for pension fund and financial futures operations, while also improving its presence in the fund management, financial leasing, and financial derivatives areas, the statement said. \u001d  Minsheng Bank, the first Chinese bank to include private companies as shareholders, has aggressively expanded its lending in recent years, putting pressure on its capital base. \u001d  It received shareholders' approval in January to set up a joint-venture fund management company with Royal Bank of Canada and Three Gorges Financial Co., a Chinese firm created to help finance the Three Gorges Dam construction project. \u001d  The bank also plans to set up a financial leasing company, the state-run Shanghai Securities News reported earlier, citing unnamed sources. The State Grid Corp. of China and a Tianjin-based company that assembles Airbus A320 planes would be Minsheng Bank's partners in the new company, the report said. \b \u001d  -Victoria Ruan and Rose Yu contributed to this story, Dow Jones Newswires; 8610 6588-5848; victoria.ruan@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007 05:13 ET (09:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f94d915a4af4d110c5f8cfcd796b7992","symR":["7329.FR","FR0000073298"],"date":"2007-03-18","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for IPSOS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-18T08:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["7329.FR","FR0000073298"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","MED","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  IPSOS: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=FR0000073298 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007 04:17 ET (08:17 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f973d32685ec77362d7dfab55b01189a","symR":["BB.LN","GB0002228152"],"date":"2007-03-18","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Bradford & Bingley plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-18T07:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BB.LN","GB0002228152"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\u001d  Bradford & Bingley plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0002228152 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007 03:23 ET (07:23 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f983c3d49d9f943d9e040a5a025b04dc","symR":["SCHS"],"date":"2007-03-18","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for School Specialty Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-18T09:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SCHS"],"IndustryCodes":["DIB","SVC","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  School Specialty Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=SCHS or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 18, 2007 05:28 ET (09:28 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f98f1cfcdeb69c92035a55ebd58af5c3","symR":["JMI.LN","GB0007416000"],"date":"2007-03-18","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for JPMorgan Flem Smaller Co.
