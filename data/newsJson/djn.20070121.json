a vote of 2,671 to 1,440 despite opposition from a vocal group of dissidents who campaigned to block the merger, saying its terms would weaken the voice of small firms within NASD. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  The NASD said 64% of the 5,058 firms eligible to vote supported the by-law changes out of a total of 83% which cast votes. The result was a victory for NASD chief executive Mary Schapiro, who campaigned for the merger in a cross-country tour. \u001d  \"The securities industry has embraced replacing an outdated regulatory structure with one that better serves firms and investors in a fast-changing marketplace,\"  Schapiro said in a statement. \u001d  The dissidents opposing the plan had complained that instead of electing up to 15 of 18 NASD governors, small firms would elect three of 23 directors in the merged organization. The NASD offered firms a payment of $35,000 apiece if the merger was approved. \u001d  The merger had been sought for more than six years by major Wall Street firms, 200 of which were regulated and inspected by both the NYSE and the NASD, as supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The big firms said the rulebooks and inspections were duplicative and at times inconsistent. \u001d  In early November, such a merger won the public endorsement of Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Christopher Cox. The plan was announced Nov. 28, and the voting deadline was last Friday Jan. 19. \u001d  Although the dissident group had won two out of three NASD governor seats up for election last year, turnout in that election was lighter, according to people familiar with the results. \"I appreciate that so many NASD members took the time to study the proposal and to participate in the voting process,\" Schapiro added in her statement. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 15:36 ET (20:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \b   By Sebastian Moffett \u001d  Tokyo -- FOR SOME JAPANESE companies, there may be a silver lining to the nation's graying population. \u001d  The aging of society has become a byword for future economic misery in Japan and parts of Europe: As the number of retirees soars, increasing the burden on pension and health-care systems, the work force faces long-term decline, reducing an economy's ability to support the elderly. \u001d  Japan will see the most dramatic wave yet of this trend this year, when the products of its concentrated post-World War II baby boom -- which covers 1947 through 1949 -- begin to hit age 60 and retire. The country's 67 million-strong work force will decline by about 500,000 in each of the three years during which those employees reach retirement. But economists say that, at least for a few years, the effect on corporate profits could be positive. \u001d  To get an idea of the upside, consider giant phone carrier Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. NTT took on new staff 30 or 40 years ago to build out Japan's telecommunications system. But for some time, fixed-line revenue has declined, and the NTT group has taken on progressively fewer workers over the years. \u001d  The workers from the big intake are now in their 50s: When NTT East Corp. and NTT West Corp. -- the group's two regional units -- and some of their outsourcing companies are combined, they have nearly 8,000 workers aged 58, according to a chart supplied by the company. But the companies have only about 1,000 workers aged 35, and a few hundred aged 25. \u001d  Because pay at big Japanese companies is in large part determined by length of service, the older workers are far more expensive. When they leave the payroll, NTT group companies' fixed costs will fall. \u001d  Natan Ramler, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, estimates that the baby-boomer retirement will reduce fixed costs at NTT East to 1.4 trillion yen ($11.5 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008 from 1.5 trillion yen in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. (The company wouldn't provide details of workers' average pay.) \"It's very clear that NTT will be making cost savings,\" says Mr. Ramler. \u001d  But that still doesn't make the company a great bet for investors. Partly because NTT East's businesses are so old, Mr. Ramler thinks its revenue will decline to two trillion yen from 2.1 trillion yen over the same period. He forecasts a small rise in profitability -- to 73 billion yen in the year ending March 2008, from 66 billion yen in March 2006. \u001d  Future prospects, too, are limited, says Mr. Ramler, because the only way to increase revenue is through huge investments in expensive technologies, such as fiber optics. \u001d  NTT group's share price was at 614,000 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at the close of trade on Friday, but Mr. Ramler thinks it will slide to 490,000 yen over the next 12 months. The baby-boomer retirement is \"a very positive development,\" he says, but not enough to offset other problems at the business. \u001d  The same logic applies to other industries that grew quickly three or four decades ago. Baby boomers account for about 16% of steel companies' personnel costs, compared with just 9% for financial companies, a December report by Goldman Sachs said. In transport companies, such as railroads, as well as telecommunications companies, they account for 14%. \u001d  The workers that replace the retiring boomers will mostly be younger -- and in many cases hired on cheaper terms on short-term contracts. Some companies will rehire the older workers who have just retired, but at far lower rates of pay. Overall, according to Goldman Sachs calculations, the decrease in wage costs will boost corporate earnings by two percentage points a year in each of the next three fiscal years ending in March 2008, 2009 and 2010. \u001d  To be sure, paying less to workers also means lower overall personal income and, eventually, less national consumption. But at least for the next few years, economists say consumption is unlikely to be hit by the mass retirement. The boomers have amassed savings and many will get big lump-sum retirement payments. Just using a bit of this wealth could offset the reduction in income for a while. \u001d  However, in five or 10 years, Japan faces a serious labor shortage, and keeping the economy growing will require wrenching change, such as gains in production per worker, bigger numbers of working women and large-scale immigration. \u001d  Longer term, demographic change could lead to a \"potentially large decline of the potential rate of growth,\" says Tetsufumi Yamakawa, chief economist at Goldman Sachs. But first, he says, \"corporate earnings will go up because of the replacement of labor by younger generation people.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30

Says","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-21T19:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BAB","BAY.LN","GB0001290575"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (AP)--Thousands of British Airways PLC (BAB) cabin crew are to stage a three-day strike following the breakdown of talks aimed at resolving a row over sickness absence, pay and staffing, their union said Sunday. \u001d  Stewards and stewardesses will walk out from Jan. 29 to 31, the Transport and General Worker's Union said. The union notified BA of its intention to call out cabin crew on strike again on Feb. 6-8 and Feb. 12-14 if the dispute isn't resolved. \u001d  British Airways criticized the union, saying the strikes would cause massive disruption for passengers and further damage to the airline, which has been hit in recent months by security and weather problems. \u001d  The union held several meetings with British Airways executives last week to avert the strike action, following a 96% vote for strike by the 11,000 cabin crew workers. \u001d  But the union said that negotiations had broken down. \u001d  Jack Dromey, deputy general secretary of the union, accused BA of failing to enter into a dialogue with the union on compromise proposals, accusing them of provoking the strike action. \u001d  \"Our members are fed up with being bullied into coming to work when sick and with the divisions caused by poverty levels of new entrant pay scales,\" Dromy said. \u001d  \"They see customer care being cut and the airline's reputation damaged by bungling management. \u001d  \"BA now have seven days to take their responsibility seriously and work with the union to avoid disruption to services and inconvenience to passengers. We are ready to resume talks at any time,\" he said. \u001d  The cabin crew have accused management of forcing them to work when they were ill, following the implementation of a new policy on sickness pay that was introduced 18 months ago. \u001d  BA chief executive Willie Walsh said the company was disappointed by the union's decision but remained focussed on finding a solution that it hoped would prevent the strikes. \u001d  \"Despite its public rhetoric, the union in private remains resolute in its refusal to talk with us about any degree of change for our cabin crew,\" Walsh said. \u001d  Walsh insisted the airline hadn't imposed any changes about sickness absence but stressed it wanted to negotiate new ways of working with its cabin crew to help put the airline in better shape to succeed in the \"highly competitive\" industry. \u001d  Walsh said the union had made additions to its earlier demands over a return to the \"excessive\" levels of sickness absence. He said the union was also demanding a \"significant\" pay rise for its members, \u001d  In a statement the airline said its new sickness policy had reduced average levels of absence among cabin crew to 12 days a year from 22 days. \u001d  Customers who had booked flights between Monday, Jan. 29 and Friday, Feb. 16 would be allowed to change the date of their flights, BA said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 14:17 ET (19:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"262fe430c5780c32205d92fba9f4030e","symR":["EPC","EPC.XE","DE0005128003"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Epcos AG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-21T08:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EPC","EPC.XE","DE0005128003"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","XDJGI","XNMP","XNYA","XTDX"],"Story":"\u001d  Epcos AG: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0005128003 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 03:52 ET (08:52 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"265b3b6161298c0b8b1f2904a8019237","symR":["ROC"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Rothmans Inc.

Jones)--A report by the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, or CSB, into a fatal explosion at BP PLC's (BP) Texas City Refinery March 23, 2005 will make direct links between cost cutting and the cause of the blast, the U.K.'s Observer newspaper reported Sunday. \u001d  Carolyn Merritt, chairwoman of the CSB, told the paper: \"Budget cuts had an impact on safety and that impact on safety had a causal relationship with what happened on March 23. We have an ironclad case for the impact of cost cutting on safety. We will be making those conclusions in our report. \u001d  \"Complacency and disregard for the inherent danger of what was being done was at every level of the organization to the very top...The message that was communicated was that cost cutting and maximizing profits was the most important thing.\" \u001d  The report is scheduled to be published March 20. \u001d  CSB officials estimate that between 1992 and 2000, maintenance spending at Texas City fell 84%. BP took over running of the refinery from U.S. oil company Amoco when the two merged in 1998. \u001d  A BP spokesman told the Observer: \"We have always said that budget cuts had no impact on safety.

 TOKYO (Nikkei)--Dai Nippon Printing Co. (7912.TO) plans to invest Y20 billion to construct a photomask plant in Taiwan, with mass production expected to begin in September 2008, The Nikkei learned Sunday. \u001d  Output will be supplied mainly to semiconductor factories in Taiwan, which hosts the world's largest number of cutting-edge plants using 300mm wafers. Dai Nippon expects demand for photomasks to grow at a time when chipmakers, including Elpida Memory Inc. (6665.TO), plan to build more Taiwanese plants, The Nikkei reported in its Monday morning edition. \u001d  Dai Nippon has already acquired about 10,000 sq. meters of land in northern Taiwan to build the new factory. Construction is slated for April, with the plant's operation expected to begin in May 2008. \u001d  Sales at the plant are projected at Y5 billion for the year ending March 2009 and Y12 billion the following year. \u001d  Following Japan and Italy, Taiwan is Dai Nippon's third mass production site for photomasks. \u001d  The global market for photomasks is estimated at slightly over Y300 billion, with Toppan Printing Co. (7911.TO) holding the largest share of around 30%.  Dai Nippon, ranked second with a market share of about 20%, aims to take on Toppan Printing by supplying customers in Taiwan more quickly. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007

\u001d  OTTAWA (Dow Jones)--China thinks Canadian banks haven't been aggressive enough in that country and wants them to participate more in the initial public offerings of their lenders, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said Sunday. \u001d  Flaherty, who has been in China since Wednesday to promote ties and seek more access for Canadian banks in that country, met with his counterpart Jin Renqing, People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, and regulators from the financial services sector during his visit. \u001d  \"One of the things I heard from officials in China is that our financial services sector, particularly our banks, have probably been too conservative, not aggressive enough in the China market,\" Flaherty told Canadian reporters in a conference call from Shanghai. \u001d  He noted that there have been several successful IPOs by Chinese banks in the last year. \"And the comment was made to me (by the Chinese officials) that perhaps the Canadian banks should be less conservative in participating in some of those large IPOs,\" he said. \u001d   Flaherty said Canadian insurers Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) and Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) have been \"fairly aggressive\" in China and have \"met with quite substantial market participation.\" \u001d  \"So I think there may be something to be learned there from the comments of the officials, that our banks perhaps ought to be more aggressive in this market place,\" he added. \u001d  Flaherty said he told the officials that Canada welcomed Chinese investments. China is keenly interested in Canada's natural resources sector. \u001d  On Canada's part, its businesses, including the financial sector, are seeking growth opportunities in China's services sector. \u001d  \"So there's lots of room to do business together,\" Flaherty said. \u001d  He added that he hopes to have Jin and Zhou visit Canada in the next year. \b \u001d  -Nirmala Menon, Dow Jones

GBP1.7 billion. Debenhams' 2006 IPO was widely considered disappointing and the newspaper claims this has \"rubbed off\" on the company's debt. It claims that under normal circumstances, the debt would have been syndicated within a couple of months of the IPO. \u001d  Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland declined to comment.

It still has two other factories in Britain. \u001d  Jones, 66, who grew up in nearby Pontypridd, said that \"as a local boy I know how important this factory has been to the community\" in Wales' impoverished Rhondda valley. \u001d  \"I therefore urge the Burberry management to withdraw their plans to close their Treorchy factory,\" Jones said in a statement released Sunday by the \"Keep Burberry British\" campaign. \u001d  Other celebrities have called on Burberry to keep the factory open, including Welsh actors Ioan Gruffudd and Rhys Ifans, opera singer Bryn Terfel and actress Emma Thompson. \u001d  Local lawmaker Chris Bryant said he planned to introduce a motion in Parliament this week calling for Burberry to lose its royal warrant if it moved production from Wales. Royal warrants allow businesses to sport a crest describing them as official suppliers to the royal family. Burberry holds two, one from Queen Elizabeth II and one from Prince Charles. \u001d  Burberry Group, which last week reported a 22% increase in third-quarter revenue, has said it has found \"no commercially viable alternative\" to closing the factory. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 07:58 ET (12:58 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

\u001d  LOS ANGELES (AP)--The dance flick \"Stomp the Yard\"  retained its top spot at the box office for a second week, but a handful of small films were boosted by their success at the Golden Globes. \u001d  The Fox Searchlight film \"The Last King of Scotland\" was the biggest beneficiary as the studio shrewdly expanded the art house film from four theaters to 495, anticipating a good performance at the Globes. The movie took in an estimated $1.8 million from Friday to Sunday. Fox Searchlight is owned by News Corp. (NWS). \u001d  Forest Whitaker was named best actor in a drama for his portrayal of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. He also is considered a favorite for an acting Oscar. \u001d  \"The marketplace accepted the movie,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Media By Numbers. \"Having Forest Whitaker win for that key role really boosted the film.\" \u001d  \"Babel,\" from Paramount Vantage, a division of Viacom Inc. (VIAB), increased its ticket sales 500% from last weekend after the film, an ensemble piece featuring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, won best drama honors at the Globes. \u001d  The film, which initially didn't make the list of top 20 box office earners, jumped to 12th place this weekend with $2.3 million, according to studio estimates, bringing its 13-week take to $24 million). \u001d  The Miramax drama \"The Queen\" also got a huge lift, jumping 233% from last week to the ninth spot after its star, Helen Mirren, won two Golden Globes - one for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in \"The Queen,\" and as Queen Elizabeth I in a TV miniseries. Miramax is a division of Walt Disney Co. (DIS). \u001d  Another smaller film, the wartime fantasy \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" from Picturehouse, a division of Time Warner Inc. (TWX), saw its weekend gross jump 118%, moving it from 18th place last week to seventh place this weekend with $4.7 million. \u001d  The film, from Mexican director Guillermo del Toro, has won numerous awards, although it lost last week in the best foreign-language film category at the Globes to the Clint Eastwood Japanese-language war film \"Letters From Iwo Jima.\" \u001d  \"Anyone who is skeptical about the positive effect a Globe win can have on a film's box office need only look at this weekend's numbers,\" Dergarabedian said. \u001d  Many of the films are expected to be nominated Tuesday for the Academy Awards. \u001d  Sony Screen Gems' (SNE) \"Stomp the Yard,\" which focuses on a step competition between rival college fraternities, earned $13.3 million, narrowly beating 20th Century Fox's \"Night at the Museum\" with $13 million. The comedy starring Ben Stiller has made about $206 million. 20th Century Fox is owned by News Corp. \u001d  The only film to open wide this weekend, the horror movie \"The Hitcher,\" came in fourth at the box office. \u001d  \"The film is a little disappointing for us,\" said Jack Foley, president of distribution for Rogue Pictures. \"It opened competitively in a sluggish marketplace and I think it will stick around for a few weeks anyway.\" \u001d  Overall, box office receipts for the top 12 films were down 20% from the same weekend last year. \u001d  Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Media By Numbers LLC. Final figures will be released Monday. \u001d  1. \"Stomp the Yard,\" $13.3 million \u001d  2. \"Night at the Museum,\" $13 million \u001d  3. \"Dreamgirls,\" $8.7 million \u001d  4. \"The Hitcher,\" $8.2 million \u001d  5. \"The Pursuit of Happyness,\" $6.7 million \u001d  6. \"Freedom Writers,\" $5.6 million \u001d  7. \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" $4.7 million \u001d  8. \"Children of Men,\" $3.7 million \u001d  9. \"The Queen,\" $3.7 million \u001d  10. \"Arthur and The Invisibles,\" $3.1 million \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 14:41 ET (19:41 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"71a250a102c4f8cfea0e96b7438d5124","symR":["NUO"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen OH Quality Inc (NUO)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-21T10:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NUO"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen OH Quality Inc (NUO): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NUO or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 05:04 ET (10:04 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"71a771d706147824669e38601e1fd9b2","symR":["BCV"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Bancroft Fund Ltd.

 LONDON (Dow Jones)--Tata Steel (500470.BY), the Indian steel maker, is poised to raise its offer for U.K. steel maker Corus Group PLC (CGA) in a bid to beat a recommended offer from Brazil's Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (SID), the Sunday Times, the Mail on Sunday and the Observer newspapers report, without citing sources. \u001d  The Sunday Times said Tata, a unit of Tata Group, will raise its offer to beat an agreed bid from CSN at 515 pence a share, valuing Corus at GBP5.9 billion including debt. The Observer believes Tata will offer around 530 pence a share, while the Mail on Sunday suggests 550 pence. The Sunday Times said Tata could offer as much as 600 pence a share although it adds some sources were skeptical about this. \u001d  The Sunday Times also said CSN was prepared to beat any offer from Tata and said the Brazilian company has increased the size of its loan facilities in order to give it greater financial leverage. \u001d  The U.K. Takeover Panel has imposed a Jan. 30 deadline for final bids for Corus. \u001d  Neither Tata Steel Nor CSN could be reached for comment. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.timesonline.co.uk \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.observer.co.uk

BEIJING (Dow Jones)--China said Sunday it injected $4 billion from its foreign exchange reserves to recapitalize China Reinsurance (Group) Co., putting the country's biggest domestic reinsurer on track to launch an initial public offering this year. \u001d  Central Huijin Investment Co., a state investment agency charged with using the country's foreign exchange reserves to recapitalize the domestic financial sector, injected the money last year, China's insurance regulator said in a statement on its Web site. \u001d  Central Huijin's first-ever capital injection for a domestic insurer

China's reserves, at more than $1 trillion, are the world's largest. \u001d  At a meeting of China's top financial policymakers over the weekend, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Beijing would \"explore and expand the channels and methods for using foreign exchange reserves.\" \u001d  Central Huijin injected tens of billions of dollars into the country's four overseas-listed state banks ahead of their IPOs. \u001d  The state investment agency took stakes in other enterprises it has recapitalized, including banks and brokerages, though the statement issued Sunday didn't specify whether it took an ownership stake in China Reinsurance. \u001d  China Reinsurance, which had assets of CNY29.77 billion at the end of June 2006, has been targeting the introduction of strategic investors and an IPO since at least the beginning of last year. \u001d  China Re earned operating revenue of CNY12.57 billion in the first half of 2006, up 12.8% from a year earlier \u001d  Investors have displayed a strong appetite for stock of China's listed domestic insurers over the past year on Beijing's move to widen their investment channels and optimism over future revenue growth for the sector. Underlining that strong demand, shares of China Life Insurance Co. (2628.HK), the country's biggest insurer by premiums, more than doubled in their mainland China trading debut earlier this month. \u001d  China's insurance premiums rose 14.4% on-year to CNY564.14 billion ($72.5 billion) in 2006, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission also said in the statement issued on the commission's annual meeting held Sunday. \u001d  By the end of 2006, assets in China's insurance sector totaled CNY1.97 trillion, a rise of 29% from a year earlier, the regulator said. \u001d  Central Huijin is also finalizing plans to inject CNY24 billion-CNY25 billion into midsized lender China Everbright Bank Co., although the funds have yet to be put on the books of the bank, a person familiar with the situation said last week. \b \u001d  -By Rick Carew, Dow Jones Newswires; 8610 6588-5848; rick.carew@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 04:21 ET (09:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"99f746c8e21fd494fe88ca1edb6c62b5","symR":["HYV"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund, Inc.

Thailand's largest commercial bank by assets set aside 9.9 billion baht in loan-loss provisions, up from 4.31 billion baht in 2005. \u001d  Declines in 2006 earnings are expected at most Thai banks, mainly due to greater provisioning for potential loan losses to meet new international accounting standards called IAS 39, which were partially implemented in December. Full adoption of the standards is expected by year's end. \u001d  Net profit was pressured by a 2.94 billion baht tax expense. A waiver of the 30% corporate income-tax rate expired in the fourth quarter of 2005, the bank said. The tax waiver was granted to help companies following the Asian financial crisis of 1997. \u001d  However, the bank's net profit in the October to December period rose 3.4% to 4.05 billion baht, thanks to higher net interest income and 1.88 billion baht of investment gains. \u001d  The bank said its annual interest income surged 37% to 76.77 billion baht, while its interest expense in the year rose two times to 32.49 billion baht. \u001d  Bangkok Bank's nonperforming loans at year's end were 89.12 billion baht, or 9.24% of its total loan portfolio, down from 103.36 billion baht, or around 10.7% of total loans, at the end of September. \u001d  TMB Bank PCL, Thailand's fifth-largest bank by assets, reported a full-year loss of 12.28 billion baht for 2006, reversing a net profit of 7.8 billion baht a year earlier, mainly due to large provisions, the bank said. \u001d  The bank set aside provisions of 18 billion baht last year, mainly to comply with the Bank of Thailand's new accounting standards. The bank didn't say how much it set aside for provisions in 2005. \u001d  Last year \"was considered to be a difficult year for the Thai economy given political uncertainty, high fuel prices, a strong baht and fluctuations in the market. All of these factors contributed to the unsatisfactory financial results,\" President and Chief Executive Subhak Siwaraksa said. \u001d  The bank said it plans to raise capital this year, in a move to strengthen its fundamentals in compliance with stringent new accounting standards. TMB declined to elaborate on its plan. Thailand's Finance Ministry, which owns a 31.1% stake in the bank, and Singapore's DBS Group Holdings Ltd., which indirectly holds 16.1%, have indicated their support of the bank's plan to raise its capital-adequacy level. \u001d  State-owned Krung Thai Bank PCL said net profit rose 8.1% in 2006 to 14.08 billion baht from 13.02 billion baht, on higher interest and noninterest incomes.

It gave no other details of the charges against Zhou, also known as Chau Ching-ngai. \u001d  Zhou once was one of China's richest businesspeople, with a fortune estimated by business magazine Forbes in 2002 at $320 million. \u001d  A sweeping corruption investigation in Shanghai has led to the ouster of the city's Communist Party secretary, Chen Liangyu. Other Shanghai officials have been detained. \u001d  Authorities haven't said whether Zhou's case is linked to those of Chen and other officials. \u001d  On Friday, Shanghai newspapers said authorities had detained 22 executives, including some from such major multinationals as McDonald's Corp. (MCD) and Whirlpool Corp. (WHR), in a bribery investigation. \u001d  Zhou also has been the target of lawsuits by Shanghai residents who say he failed to compensate them adequately for homes that were demolished in a redevelopment project. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 06:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

That's what I did on Jan. 16, but only after also verifying that the Italian Treasury was in agreement,\" Spinetta said. \u001d  \"The moment chosen to make public my resignation was therefore chosen by the competent Italian authorities,\" Spinetta said. \u001d  Late Friday Alitalia called a shareholders meeting for Feb. 22 to name a new board, after dissolving its existing board last week following Spinetta's resignation. \u001d  Alitalia's main shareholder, the Italian government, is seeking to privatize the company in a move to help it outline a new corporate strategy and end a run of several years of losses. \u001d  In December the Italian Treasury ministry published details of the tender for the sale of its 49.9% Alitalia stake. The Italian government will accept expressions of interest for Alitalia until Jan. 29. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.airfrance.com \u001d  -By Greg Keller, Dow Jones Newswires; +33 1 40 17 17

The judge himself wrote in the warrant that the alleged stealing of personal information was to advantage Telecom Italia's controlling shareholder. \u001d  \"I intend to repeat to everyone that the only fact, real and incontestable, that I am certain of is that never, and again never, did I order illegal acts to be carried out against anyone,\" Tronchetti wrote in his letter. \u001d  Tronchetti quit as chairman of Telecom Italia over a strategy row with the government last September, but he is still chairman of Pirelli & C. SpA (PC.MI), which controls Telecom Italia through holding company Olimpia. \u001d  \"Never did I request illegal information, never did I receive or read dossiers against adversaries, competitors, people with different opinions, or even people openly hostile,\" he said. \u001d  The four men arrested Thursday are also accused of using Telecom Italia's resources to spy on Vittorio Colao, the former chief executive of RCS Mediagroup SpA (RCS.MI) - Il Corriere della Sera's publishing group - and on Massimo Mucchetti, deputy director of Il Corriere, as part of an elaborate intelligence operation. \u001d  Addressing this aspect of the case, Tronchetti said Sunday that, as representative of Pirelli in the shareholders' pact of Il Corriere della Sera, he always tried \"to constitute a connecting element among the shareholders,\" in order to guarantee the independence of Italy's main newspaper. \u001d  Tronchetti closed his letter by saying he will continue to collaborate with magistrates in order to allow them to \"search for the truth with the force of facts and evidence\" and confirm his integrity. \u001d  -By Giada Zampano, Dow Jones Newswires; 39-3487678016; giada.zampano@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 10:15 ET (15:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b65ee220f912f58b6b93c7b321e38073","symR":["CTY.LN","GB0001990497"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for City of London Trust I.T.

executive of Siemens AG (SI), which has been plagued by corruption allegations, said in remarks released Sunday that the German company's policy must be to emphasize principles over profits and that it was pulling its operations out of Sudan. \u001d  Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld, who has hired an outside anti-corruption expert and a law firm to examine and revise Siemens' own anti-corruption safeguards, told Der Spiegel magazine there is a \"zero tolerance for corruption.\" \u001d  He said this meant Siemens, Europe's largest electronics and electrical engineering company, would forego large contracts on matters of principle, and also pull out of countries on moral and political grounds. \u001d  \"We're already doing that in Sudan,\" he said. \"We have decided to pull out of our branches of business out of there - (and) not out of security concerns.\"   He didn't elaborate. \u001d  Six current or former Siemens employees are under investigation in Germany under suspicion of committing breach of trust against Siemens in cases stretching back to 2002 by setting up secret funds outside Germany. \u001d  Siemens said it identified suspicious payments involving some EUR420 million. Swiss and Italian prosecutors, who are also conducting investigations, suspect the secret funds were used to pay bribes to secure lucrative foreign contracts for the Munich-based company. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 10:07 ET (15:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d1ef031ac143ce7c62578935a29e23aa","symR":["GGK.LN","GB0005350524"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Gamingking plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-21T09:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GGK.LN","GB0005350524"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO"],"Story":"\u001d  Gamingking plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0005350524 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 04:03 ET (09:03 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d202bf8484ce3d53ee21a4ce25b7eb1c","symR":["COY"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund, Inc.

TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Consumer-loan firm Aiful Corp. (8515.TO) said Saturday that it will cut the number of nationwide outlets, including unmanned ones with automated loan machines, by more than 50% to 1,193 from the current 2,713 on a group basis to cut costs amid a tightening of regulations on loan interest rates, Kyodo News reported. \u001d  Aiful will also slash the number of full-time workers by 400 through voluntary retirement while cutting the number of part-time workers by 900, the company said in its restructuring plan endorsed at a board meeting the same day. \u001d  Aiful currently has about 7,000 full-time workers and about 4,000 part-time and temporary workers on a group basis. \u001d  The moves are aimed at cutting costs as the business environment is expected to become severer due to the government's plan to cut maximum interest rates on loans.   \u001d  Aiful and other consumer financing companies are also facing growing demands by borrowers for the reimbursement of overpayments made under so-called \"gray-zone\" interest rates. \u001d  Under the restructuring plan, the number of ordinary outlets will be cut to 213 from 820 and while the number of unmanned ones with automated loan machines will be slashed to 980 from 1,893. \u001d  The restructuring will cut Aiful's operation costs by more than Y40 billion a year on an unconsolidated basis, the company said. \u001d  Gray-zone rates in Japan fall between two separate legal cap rates for consumer loans. The Interest Rate Restrictions Law caps rates at 15% to 20% according to loan amounts, while the Investment Deposit and Interest Rate Law allows higher rates of up to 29.2% to be levied on loans if borrowers consent to them in writing. \u001d  The Japanese parliament enacted a bill in December last year to lower the ceiling on consumer loan interest rates to 20% in late 2009 from the present 29.2% as part of efforts to help reduce the number of heavily indebted borrowers. \u001d  Since a Supreme Court ruling in January last year that effectively invalidated gray-zone rates, borrowers' claims for the reimbursement of overpayments have increased. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 17:25 ET (22:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Softbank Mobile Corp. experienced another system malfunction Sunday evening, causing some shops to stop taking applications from new customers as well as requests to switch cellular phone handsets or change rate plans, The Nikkei reported in its Monday morning edition. \u001d  According to several sources, the order-receiving system that links each store with Softbank Mobile headquarters failed at around 5 p.m., apparently because of a processing capacity shortage. This caused stores to stop accepting orders, and some stores received orders but postponed handset delivery until the following day. \u001d  Softbank Mobile, a unit of Softbank Corp. (9984.TO), saw higher-than-usual customer traffic because it was the first weekend after the company started accepting orders last Tuesday for a new rate plan offering a low monthly basic charge of Y980. \u001d  Near the end of last October, a system glitch led the firm to temporarily stop taking applications to switch carriers under number portability. Although the new rate plan has delighted consumers, the series of problems may damage confidence in the telecommunications firm. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 11:47 ET (16:47 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"e18e2a30a50f1c5064e1d561e6623417","symR":["WSI.LN","GB0009250845"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Workplace Systems Inter.

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \b   By Norihiko Shirouzu and Jeffrey McCracken \u001d  Toyota Motor Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are sending more signals that they may want to establish deeper ties. But the cautious courtship between the two auto giants suggests a more modest, and less painful, approach than the megamergers of the late 1990s or the three-way alliance proposed last year among General Motors Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA. \u001d  Speculation that Toyota and Ford might be edging toward some form of alliance has heated up since a meeting in mid-December between Ford Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally and Toyota Chairman Fujio Cho. Both companies scrambled to play down the significance of that encounter, describing the meeting as a mere \"courtesy.\" They stressed the talks produced no specific deals. \u001d  People familiar with the matter say the meeting was prompted by an invitation from Toyota, sent from Toyota's top brass to Mr. Mulally via a visitor to Dearborn, Michigan, where Ford is based, in mid-October. That messenger, a friend of former Toyota Chairman Hiroshi Okuda, met with Mark Fields, president of Ford's Americas operations, and gave him Mr. Okuda's invitation to the new Ford CEO. \u001d  Part of Toyota's aim in courting Ford is diplomacy -- an effort to win what people familiar with Toyota management's thinking describe as political peace from the U.S.'s second-biggest producer of automobiles. Although protectionist rhetoric has abated significantly compared with 15 years ago, Toyota officials remain concerned about a possible backlash as they continue to gain market share in the U.S. while Detroit's Big Three shut factories and ax jobs. Analysts widely expect Toyota to outsell Ford in the U.S. on an annual basis as early as this year. \u001d  Toyota also could benefit in a practical way if Ford agreed to use its gasoline-electric hybrid technology. That is in part because Toyota's momentum in establishing its hybrid design as an industry standard has slowed. GM, for instance, has lured German auto makers DaimlerChrysler AG and BMW AG into a powerful alliance to develop a hybrid system of their own that they say is simpler than Toyota's. Other companies, including Honda Motor Co., are trying to go it alone. \u001d  Messrs. Mulally and Cho, after talking for more than two hours, ended the meeting by agreeing to meet again soon, a person familiar with the situation said. A Toyota spokesman said no further meeting has been scheduled between the two but stressed that Toyota remains open to the idea of forming a tie-up to share costs of developing new technology or joining hands in popularizing new technology. Toyota also has shared operations with GM, including an automobile assembly plant in Fremont, California, that it has run jointly with the U.S. car maker since the late 1980s. \u001d  \"So long as it is a win-win for both parties and there is a reason for partnering . . . we're open to the idea of forming a partnership. I think anyone among major auto makers around the world could potentially be our alliance partner,\" Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe said in an interview in October. \u001d  Analysts say it is unlikely Toyota would seek to buy a stake in Ford, even though Toyota's market capitalization far exceeds Ford's. A primary obstacle is the 40% voting stock controlled by the descendants of Ford founder Henry Ford. Moreover, Toyota has generally avoided large scale acquisitions and alliances with rival auto makers. Ford, meanwhile, has too many financial troubles to buy a significant stake in Toyota. \u001d  Still, even the most efficient auto makers are worried about a glut around the world of auto-making capacity and surging costs to pack cars with new technologies in part to meet increasingly stringent safety and emissions regulations. Those concerns tend to spur interest in alliances that can help bring down component or raw material costs, or those for developing new technology, to give them an added edge. \u001d  Ford, according to a person familiar with its thinking, could be interested in a joint venture or partnership with Toyota that could focus on powertrain technology such as gasoline-electric hybrid engines or on smaller, four-cylinder engines, the person said. \u001d  The December meeting, at Toyota's guest house in Tokyo, was broad-based, and some senior executives at Toyota said Mr. Mulally talked a lot about his experience at Boeing Co., where he was the head of its commercial-aircraft division before joining Ford in September. He said he studied Toyota's lean-manufacturing process and transplanted some of the Toyota-devised production and inventory-control techniques like just-in-time parts delivery to Boeing's overall aircraft assembly operations. \u001d  Being a lean-manufacturing expert himself, those executives say, Mr. Cho was impressed by Mr. Mulally's knowledge. One of them said Messrs. Mulally and Cho \"really hit it off,\" and predicted that their instant rapport may provide the springboard for a technical relationship of some kind. \u001d  \"I don't know if Mulally-san realizes this,\" said one senior Toyota executive, \"but if he asked for help or suggested a way to collaborate, knowing Mr. Cho, he would go out of his way to be responsive.\" \u001d  Ford, which has forecast substantial losses this year, has struggled to keep its engines competitive with other auto makers and in 2006 had to back off a much-hyped goal of building 250,000 hybrid vehicles annually because it realized it didn't have the capability to do so. \u001d  \"Ford came out of that [Tokyo] meeting feeling Toyota was worried that politically there could be problems for it in the United States if Ford continued to struggle, so Toyota might want to do something that publicly looked like they were helping Ford, while it also marginally helped Toyota,\" said one of the people familiar with the matter. \u001d  This person added there would be more conversations in the future between Ford and Toyota about pursuing some sort of technology-sharing venture. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fca5bc396f26905c34f99c4ea7b15036","symR":["PHP.LN","GB0007015521"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Primary Health Properties plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-21T10:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PHP.LN","GB0007015521"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI"],"Story":"\u001d  Primary Health Properties plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0007015521 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"fcb07391067c8f7e96aa7d5fc91cb307","symR":["ECV"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Enhanced Eqity Yield & Premium Fd (ECV)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-21T09:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ECV"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Enhanced Eqity Yield & Premium Fd (ECV): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=ECV or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 04:03 ET (09:03 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"fcb47d3296c2fa7a1941e410599477e6","symR":["FCFS"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for First Cash Financial Services","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-21T09:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FCFS"],"IndustryCodes":["CFN","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  First Cash Financial Services: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=FCFS or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 04:08 ET (09:08 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"fcc6191324eca9aca54e106bb0d7afaa","symR":["SWFT"],"date":"2007-01-21","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Founder Of Swift Transportation To Buy Company For $2.74B","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-21T21:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SWFT"],"IndustryCodes":["TRK","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  PHOENIX (AP)--The founder of Swift Transportation Co. (SWFT) plans to buy the company for $2.74 billion, regaining control of the third-largest trucking company in America. \u001d  Jerry Moyes, who founded Phoenix-based Swift more than 40 years ago with his father and brother, said he reached a deal Friday to pay $31.55 per share in cash to take the company private. His group, which includes family members, also will assume $332 million in debt. \u001d  \"I'm still a young 62, and I want to get back in the thrill of the hunt and get involved,\" Moyes said. \u001d  Swift shares closed Friday at $27.74 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, where they have traded in a 52-week range of $21.25 to $33.66. \u001d  Pending shareholder approval, the deal is set to be finalized in the second quarter of 2007. \u001d  Swift's board of directors unanimously approved the transaction, the company said. \u001d  \"We believe the all-cash $31.55 per share price represents a fair value for the company and is in the best interest of all shareholders,\" Chairman Jock Patton said in a written statement. \u001d  The board had rejected Moyes' cash offer of $29 a share in November but left the door open for a higher bid. \u001d  Moyes said he had considered regaining control of Swift since being forced out as chief executive officer in October 2005 after an SEC investigation into insider trading. He paid a $1.26 million settlement without admitting or denying wrongdoing and was removed from his post two months before he planned to retire. \u001d  Through various trusts, the Moyes family still controls about 40% of Swift, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. \u001d  Swift Transportation began with one truck in 1966, transporting steel through the port of Los Angeles to Arizona and exporting cotton from Arizona to Los Angeles. By 1990, the company had annual revenue of $125 million and 800 trucks. It now counts 17,900 trucks and nearly $3.2 billion in revenues. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 21, 2007 16:17 ET (21:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,
