(MGA) could emerge as Chrysler's owner, these people said. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  There is typically a gamesmanship in such auction situations, as bidders vie for an angle, sometimes pulling back from the action before striking with a new offer or plan. \u001d  Cerberus, DaimlerChrysler and Magna declined to comment. \u001d  Whatever the outcome, Daimler was setting up some general guidelines for its deal. As described by three people familiar with the matter Friday, Daimler would contribute Chrysler into a new corporation while keeping a minority stake in the business. \u001d  Chrysler's $18 billion in pension and health-care liabilities - the key factor of the deal - would travel along with the rest of the company. The new company would be majority owned by the new buyer. \u001d  This party would then contribute a big slug of equity to fund the operations, these people said. The extent of any payment to Chrysler couldn't be learned Friday, but it was possible it could be small or in fact no payment could be made. \u001d  Daimler is rushing to cut an agreement prior to renewed negotiations that kick off this summer with the United Auto Workers union, whose approval is essential to the success of any transaction. \u001d  Any new owner would also have to satisfy the U.S. Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., which monitors the health of corporate pension plans. \u001d  Daimler is moving briskly in hopes of moving Chrysler off its books as soon as possible. But it faces potentially big challenges from the UAW, which could effectively scuttle a deal by holding out for its own desires. \u001d  People with knowledge of the transaction describe the process as extremely fluid, and say details could change at the last moment. Negotiations are still ongoing and have yet to be concluded, people familiar with the matter said. \u001d  DaimlerChrysler has been negotiating with several partners after Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche announced on Feb. 14 that all options were on the table for Chrysler, including a possible sale. \u001d  In addition to Cerberus and Magna, a team made up of the Blackstone Group and Centerbridge Capital Partners submitted a second round of bids recently. But billionaire Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. has been shut out of the talks so far. \u001d  Cerberus was seen as a strong contender because of its financial resources and its ability to create synergies with Chrysler Financial due to Cerberus' 51% stake in GMAC, the financing arm of General Motors Corp. (GM). \u001d  Magna was more favored by some labor representatives because it was seen as a long-term investor, as opposed to private equity, which was perceived as interested in Chrysler only to make a quick profit. \u001d  Cerberus strengthened its bid even further after it hired former Chrysler Chief Operating Officer Wolfgang Bernhard as an adviser. Bernhard is highly regarded by his former Chrysler colleagues and was seen as a hands-on manager. \u001d  But a Cerberus bid is likely to face opposition from the unions, which have said they oppose a private equity takeover of Chrysler. Cerberus led a group of investors in a deal to buy auto supplier Delphi Corp. (DPHIQ), and asked for wage and other cuts from the UAW. That produced a contentious relationship between the private equity firm and the UAW, and Cerberus will likely back out of the Delphi deal. \b \u001d  -By Dennis Berman, Gina Chon and Jason Singer, The Wall Street Journal; Dennis.Berman@wsj.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 15:26 ET (19:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0b7dc0bf79622d30a8288242137043a8","symR":["KMT"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP KEATING Registers 11,930 Of KENNAMETAL INC >KMT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KMT"],"IndustryCodes":["IDD","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: KENNAMETAL INC \bSYMBOL: KMT \b \b \bFILER: KEATING RONALD C \bTITLE: Vice President \bBROKER: CITIGROUP/SMITH BARNEY \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 11,930         DATE REGISTERED: 5/8/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 4/27/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

Lee Partners, may win over enough institutional holders to carry a shareholder vote on the deal. \u001d  There was speculation last week that the biggest opponent of the transaction, Fidelity Investments, which holds 10% of Clear Channel shares, is willing to go along with the new proposal, which was hashed out with some dissident holders. The Fidelity rumors helped lift Clear Channel shares (ticker: CCU), which finished Friday at $37.78, up 1.43 on the week. A Fidelity spokesman declined to comment. One sizable shareholder, Highfields Capital Management, is believed to favor the new proposal. \u001d  The new offer, which is being weighed by Clear Channel's board, would give public holders the choice of accepting $39.20 a share in cash or a combination of cash and publicly traded stock in the surviving company. The 30% equity interest will come in the form of $1.2 billion of new stock with the private-equity firms retaining 70%. The old offer, which faced rejection last week, was an all-cash deal at $39. \u001d  Wall Street arbitragers now are putting a reasonable likelihood on the deal's success. At Clear Channel's current price, the stock offers a 10% yield to the deal price, assuming the transaction closes in five months. \u001d  Much has to happen, however, for the new deal to fly. Clear Channel's board, which postponed a shareholder vote on the old proposal to May 22, still needs to agree to offer the new proposal to shareholders in a vote that would take place in July or August. Then the proposal needs to garner the support of two-thirds of shareholders, a high hurdle rate considering that shareholders who don't vote effectively are casting ballots against the deal. \u001d  The benefit of the new proposal is that it offers Clear Channel holders a choice of cash or a mix of cash and stock. The equity will be in a highly leveraged company, creating a high risk/high reward situation. \u001d  One group that stands to do well is the private-equity buyers. By agreeing to offer a 30% equity stake to buyers, Bain and Thomas Lee may have salvaged a deal that allows them to effectively buy Clear Channel's radio business at an estimated nine times projected 2007 pre-tax cash flow, below the valuation on most publicly traded radio stocks. \u001d  If the Clear Channel bulls are right, the private-equity buyers could double their money in a year or two. Current public shareholders would benefit if they elect the stock option, but the big winners -- not surprisingly -- will be the private-equity types who have made a killing in so many other LBOs. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1eb7a732552a3d908f92ebc5592e009a","symR":["S24.SG","STTS","TEMAH.YY","SG1I04877995"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UK Fund Marathon Resists Temasek Offer For Stats Chippac","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T08:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["S24.SG","STTS","TEMAH.YY","SG1I04877995"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","SEM","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--U.K.-based fund manager Marathon Asset Management has confirmed it won't accept the takeover offer for Stats Chippac Ltd.

(TEMAH.YY) from taking the chip tester private. \u001d  Marathon, which says it owns about 6.5% of Stats, believes the company has strong growth prospects and is undervalued by Temasek's offer, said portfolio manager Jeremy Hosking in a telephone interview late Friday. \u001d  Hosking, who has crossed swords with Temasek before, said it's \"academic\" whether Temasek raises its offer or not as Marathon plans to hold onto its stake. \u001d  Temasek, an investment arm of the Singapore government, declined to comment. \u001d  Temasek made its takeover offer in March, valuing the Nasdaq- and Singapore-listed company at S$3.57 billion ($2.35 billion). The investment company offered to pay S$1.75 a share if it got minimum acceptances of 50%, which would rise to S$1.88 a share if acceptances crossed 90%. \u001d  As Temasek owned 35.6% of Stats before making its takeover offer, its stake needs to rise to about 93.5% for shareholders to get S$1.88 a share. It owned 79.9% of Stats on Friday, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u001d  Singapore business publication The Edge said in its May 7 issue that Hosking almost single-handedly scuppered the privatization of another Temasek-related company, SembCorp Marine Ltd., in 2002 because he thought minorities were being offered far too little. \b \u001d  -By Stephen Wright & Vladimir Guevarra, Dow Jones Newswires; 65 6415 4151; stephen.wright@dowjones.com; vladimir.guevarra@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 04:19 ET (08:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1fc258f357b2bd9c170797aff3234e4b","symR":["RIV"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder HIGH DESERT GAMING LLC Registers 99,787 Of RIVIERA HOLDINGS >RIV","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RIV"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: RIVIERA HOLDINGS CORPORATION \bSYMBOL: RIV \b \b \bFILER: HIGH DESERT GAMING LLC \bTITLE: Shareholder \bBROKER: BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES LLC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 99,787         DATE REGISTERED: 5/9/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 4/30/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

A deal disclosed last week for Thomson to acquire Reuters Group Holdings should help remedy those data deficiencies -- and address a much larger problem known as Bloomberg. \u001d  The still-unfinished agreement to merge Thomson (ticker: TOC) and London's Reuters (RTRSY) would boost theresulting entity's financial-market sales well ahead of those of Bloomberg, the privately held firm whose huge success allowed  founder Michael Bloomberg to take time off to become mayor of New York. \u001d  A Thomson-Reuters company would get 60% of its revenues from financial customers and enjoy an almost comfortable duopoly with Bloomberg in the market for financial-data workstations. \u001d  That sort of limited competition is what Thomson, a Canadian icon now based in Stamford, Conn., already enjoys with its online legal data -- the source of half of current revenues -- as it competes against the Lexis-Nexis unit of Reed Elsevier (RUK) and the Dutch Wolters Kluwer. \u001d  If the $18 billion cash and stock deal comes off, therefore, Thomson-Reuters would have improved data products and greater pricing flexibility. Costs would also drop. The companies have targeted $500 million in post-merger savings, on top of aggressive restructuring campaigns that each  already had under way. Those restructuring programs helped the stocks of both Thomson and Reuters rise smartly in recent years, and near $42, Thomson shares trade at a somewhat higher multiple of earnings than other information vendors. \u001d  But assuming that humans continue to trade and litigate, shares of Thomson should do  well. If targeted savings materialize, the resulting cash flow could make them worth about 20% more than their recent levels. \u001d  Since its start almost 75 years ago in Canadian newspapers, Thomson has entered and exited many industries, including TV, travel and oil exploration. The company began ditching its newspapers in the 1990s, and Richard J. Harrington accelerated that strategy after becoming chief executive 10 years ago. In 2003, it left the newspaper business completely by selling its remaining interest in Toronto's Globe and Mail to a holding company controlled by the descendents of founder Roy H. Thomson (whose newspapering success around the Commonwealth got him the Scottish title of the Right Honorable Lord of Fleet). The family's Woodbridge Co. still firmly controls Thomson, with two-thirds of the voting shares. \u001d  As chief executive, Harrington raised capital by unloading nonstrategic businesses and listing the Canadian company on the New York Stock Exchange. He used that capital to buy up dozens of businesses that sell online data to diverse professions: lawyers, accountants, investors and scientists. Of Thomson's $6.6 billion in 2006 revenues, some 55% came from legal and regulatory data services like the Westlaw database of judicial decisions. About 30% of revenues came from financial data products like the I/B/E/S collection of analyst estimates. Scientific and health-care data brought in the remaining 15% of '06 sales, with stuff like ISI The Web of Science -- an always fascinating record of the most-cited scientific papers. \u001d  Even though Thomson revenues grew a modest 8% last year, earnings jumped 26% to about $860 million, or $1.34 a share. Free cash flow rose 21% to $1.4 billion (which represented operating cash flow minus capital spending). That profit growth followed an aggressive restructuring program in which Thomson chopped overhead by combining 80 financial-data products into the single ThomsonOne platform, for instance. \u001d  Investors have responded by bidding up the shares about 40% since the Toronto-traded company dual-listed on the Big Board in 2002. That's not quite as strong a rally as the S&P 500, but it's way better than other stocks with a newspaper legacy, like Barron's publisher Dow Jones (DJ). \u001d  Thomson's operating profit margin on its legal databases was 31% last year. The operating margin at Thomson Financial was slimmer, however, at 19%. The competition has been tougher in the financial-data business, where Bloomberg has motored into the lead with $4.7 billion in 2006 revenues and operating margins of about 30% (according to a recent story in Fortune magazine, which a Bloomberg spokesperson said was accurate). Reuters runs second in financial data, racking up total company sales of about $5 billion, including trading platforms and other businesses. Thomson Financial's $2 billion in 2006 revenue puts it third...followed distantly by a rabble of smaller financial-data vendors (including Dow Jones). \b \u001d  While Thomson has been making astute business moves, its financial data have accumulated some bad marks from Wall Street's sharp-eyed quantitative analysts. You don't have to be a quant to notice problems. We initially pulled the data for this article's comparative table from Thomson -- but some of the numbers looked wrong. Checking the underlying company reports, we saw that Thomson's data were wrong. We then fetched the relevant data from Bloomberg and Reuters; they had the figures right. \u001d  Our experience may not have been a fluke. A working paper by three finance professors has found that almost 55,000 alterations were made in Thomson's I/B/E/S database of analyst recommendations -- changes that had the curious effect of making the analysts look smarter than they actually had been (see \"Mysterious Changes in Key Wall Street Data,\" in Barron's March 5 issue). \u001d  Thomson's initial response to the professors' findings was Nixonian. It refused to acknowledge any I/B/E/S problem and even threatened to sue the academics and their universities. But in March of this year, the professors presented even more evidence that the I/B/E/S data were a mess. Thomson has since asked the professors to help it attempt to fix the data. The merger could fix Thomson's damaged data and brand, since Thomson Financial would be subsumed under the Reuters name. \u001d  A combination would work much larger changes, of course. Together, the two companies' financial-product revenues exceeded $7 billion last year. If the merged companies were to wring the $500 million in annual savings contemplated in Tuesday's announcement, that would be worth four percentage points of profit on their combined 2006 sales level of $12 billion. \u001d  The terms of the deal aren't final, but the joint announcement last week said Thomson was offering 352.5 pence (about US$7) cash and 0.16 Thomson shares for each share of Reuters' stock. That valued Reuters at 697 pence per share -- a generous 15 times Reuters' per-share cash flow and 25 times the average estimate for its 2008 earnings. Helping to finance a deal would be Thomson's just-announced sale of its textbook and education businesses for $7.75 billion. \u001d  The London-listed shares of Reuters jumped at the news of Thomson's offer -- but only from about 500 to 613 pence, reflecting a 5% slide in Thomson shares since the preceding week, as well as investors' uncertainty about the deal. \u001d  Antitrust regulators in Britain and the U.S. would have to review the merger, of course. And a trust that's charged with protecting the integrity of the Reuters news service also has a deciding vote over any sale. But Tuesday's announcement said that Thomson has already agreed to abide by Reuters' arrangements for preserving news independence, and a person close to Reuters suggested that the Reuters Trust would likely support the merger. The Thomson family's holding company backs the deal, which would leave it with about 53% of a combined company. Citing the pending discussions, neither Thomson nor Reuters would talk to Barron's for this story. \u001d  Wall Street forecasts for the separate companies expected them to pull in a combined $4 billion in 2008 cash flow (before capital spending). Add half a billion dollars in savings and put a multiple of 11.5 times on that estimated cash flow, and you could get an enterprise value for Thomson-Reuters of about $47.5 billion. Adjust for $1.5 billion in new debt and almost 80 million in new shares of Thomson, and Thomson shares would be worth well more than 50 bucks apiece -- 20% over recent levels above $42. \u001d  A successful acquisition of Reuters would crown the 10-year restructuring campaign of Thomson chief exec Harrington, who plans to retire and leave Thomson-Reuters in the hands of Reuters' 47-year-old chief, Tom Glocer. For the past several years, Glocer has aggressively cut costs at Reuters, with the aim of lifting its operating-profit margin from 12% to 20% by 2010. Thomson already has those margins. And with bigger pieces of the legal and financial-data markets, a Thomson-Reuters combo might also be able to boost margins with its pricing power. That would give Thomson-Reuters shareholders -- and Bloomberg -- a run for their money. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"219c9273d90188067c9afc806e4f9b89","symR":["FOXH"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP LOMMEL Registers 2,667 Of FOXHOLLOW TECHNOLOGIES INC >FOXH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FOXH"],"IndustryCodes":["MDS","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: FOXHOLLOW TECHNOLOGIES INC \bSYMBOL: FOXH \b \b \bFILER: LOMMEL SUZON \bTITLE: Vice President \bBROKER: AIG FINANCIAL ADVISORS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 2,667          DATE REGISTERED: 5/8/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 5/7/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

Lazo \u001d  Railroad stocks gained speed last Tuesday on shareholder-friendly moves by giant CSX Corp. and on acquisition activity in the sector. \u001d  The largest rail system in the eastern U.S., the company (ticker: CSX), a Dow Jones transports component, rode to a 52-week high of 47.38 after announcing it will hike its quarterly common dividend 25% and repurchase another $1 billion worth of its stock. The enriched buyback brings the company's total current program to $3 billion (about 15% of its total market capitalization) through 2008. CSX also plans to invest $6.4 billion in operations over the next four years. \u001d  The new payout will be 15 cents a share versus 12 cents. Distribution will take place Sept. 14 for holders of record Aug. 31. The stock goes ex-dividend Aug. 29. With that payment, which makes for a 1.33% yield, the Jacksonville, Fla., company will have tripled its annual dividend in less than two years and restored it to the level it was before being slashed in July 2001 to a nickel a share. Figures are adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split in August 2006. \u001d  \"These actions emphasize our confidence in the earnings power of CSX businesses as demand for our rail and intermodal services is robust and expected to grow,\" declared Chief Executive Michael J. Ward. He added that CSX remains \"committed to driving shareholder value.\" \u001d  Standard & Poor's is less sanguine. It lowered its ratings on CSX debt, saying the \"increased, debt-financed repurchase program indicates a more aggressive financial policy and contrasts with a focus on debt reduction in prior years.\" Moody's Investors Service, which is reviewing CSX debt for possible downgrade, said the company's plan \"marks the most aggressive increase in debt for shareholder-enhancement programs among the major railroads, and comes at a time when softer economic conditions could further weaken demand for railroad transportation services.\" \u001d  Be that as it may, CSX anticipates record operating income and earnings per share this year, while delivering strong free cash flow,  and double-digit average increases annually through 2010. \u001d  Last week's rail rally, which extended across the border into Canada, was helped by Florida East Coast Industries' (FLA) disclosure that it will be taken private by Fortress Investment Group in a deal valued at $3.5 billion. \b \u001d  The visco-elastic foam in the high-end mattresses and pillows crafted by Tempur-Pedic International (TPX) was developed by NASA during the 1970s to help cushion astronauts during liftoff. On Monday, Tempur-Pedic launched a higher quarterly common dividend of eight cents a share. Distributions were begun in January at six cents. Investors of record May 31 will receive the new dividend June 14. The ex-date is May 29. Yield: 1.27%. \u001d  CEO H. Thomas Bryant said the payout boost \"reflects our confidence in the company's growth prospects, as well as our strong cash flow and financial position. We are executing on our strategy to extend our global market leadership and deliver sustained, profitable growth.\" \u001d  The shares currently trade about three points under their 52-week high of 28.90, set April 19. In the first quarter, Tempur-Pedic repurchased 1.5 million of its shares at an average price of 25.61, for a total cost of $39.2 million. It has some $60 million remaining under its current buyback authorization. \u001d  The Lexington, Ky.-based company said capacity limitations in the face of strong consumer demand \"somewhat moderated\" first-quarter results, but last month it opened a new plant in Albuquerque, N.M. January-March net climbed 10.7% from a year earlier to $29.8 million, or 35 cents a share, on a 16.4% sales gain to $266 million. At wholesale, the overall mattress market is believed to be $6 billion in the U.S. and $12 billion worldwide, with the premium segment growing the fastest. \u001d  Tempur-Pedic said earlier this month that a 2005 stockholders' lawsuit should be dismissed because there's not \"one single specific fact\" to support allegations that it made false statements to inflate its stock price or that insider sales had been \"unusual or suspicious in timing or amount.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"305c0840763680d685bb5c531c9b0516","symR":["IMMG"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder O'ROURKE THOMAS & CAROL Registers 120,000 Of IMPART MEDIA GROUP >IMMG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IMMG"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","MED"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: IMPART MEDIA GROUP INC \bSYMBOL: IMMG \b \b \bFILER: O'ROURKE THOMAS & CAROL \bTITLE: Shareholder \bBROKER: CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 120,000        DATE REGISTERED: 5/8/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 4/30/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

Following a disappointing earnings announcement in January, the stock tumbled 30%, from a near all-time high of 29 to under 19. Now, five months later, a partial rebound fueled by the recent announcement of an accelerated $420 million stock buyback has taken the stock back up to 23. \u001d  And as several problems still causing headaches and queasiness on Wall Street gradually are solved, still brighter times lie ahead. \u001d  A severe wine glut in Australia is showing signs of tailing off, and the company is integrating a big, recent spirits deal while also working out the kinks in both a makeover of its U.S. distribution and a new Mexican beer-importing deal. \u001d  All that will take some time. In fact, consensus among analysts is that both sales and earnings will drop at least 20% this fiscal year, ending February '08. But as the improvements kick in, earnings should turn up sharply. \u001d  Tim Ramey, an analyst for brokerage D.A Davidson, and himself owner of a vineyard in Oregon, sees profits climbing 20% in fiscal '09, to $1.75 a share. The shares, now trading at just 13.5 times that estimate, could well hit 29 in 12 to 18 months, he says. \u001d  On top of everything else, the New York-based Constellation (ticker: STZ) is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing popularity of high-end wines and spirits. \"The U.S. and other major world wine markets are now undergoing some profound shifts in drinking habit [like moving to more upmarket brands], and these shifts are playing to some of the company's big strengths,\" says Ramey. \u001d  Constellation, with a market value of $5.5 billion, is the kind of company that the good ladies who promoted the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution back in 1920 would have hated. It is the world's largest wine maker, owning a total of 50 wineries as far-flung as New York State, the West Coast, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and (in the form of partial equity stakes) Europe. \u001d  At the high end, the company's labels include such prestigious names as the Mondavi Reserves, Australia's Eileen Hardy and Canada's Inniskillin ice wines; the latter in some years sells for close to $100 a half bottle. It also owns 50% shares of Napa's famous Opus One. At the bottom of the price pyramid, Constellation makes and sells a range of what British drinkers impolitely call \"plonk,\" including ultra-low-priced Inglenook, Almaden and Taylor New York. \u001d  The wine part of the business, branded and mass marketed together, accounts for close to 75% of total sales. \u001d  The next biggest slice, at 20%, comes from beer, although the company is not a brewer but an importer. It brings into the U.S. not only the Tsingtao and St. Pauli Girl labels, but also the far-better-known and faster-selling Mexican-made Corona and Modelo brands. \u001d  The rest of total sales comes from spirits, generally lesser known brands like Ridgemont Reserve bourbon, Paul Masson brandy, Danfield's Canadian whiskey, 99 schnapps, Kajmir vanilla liqueur and Effen vodka. \u001d  Before that portfolio really shines, the company is sure to take some more financial lumps. Constellation will probably announce a 20% drop in sales and a near- 50% drop in earnings for the current three months when it reports in late June. Each of the subsequent three quarters will also have unfavorable comparisons -- although the percentage declines will steadily grow smaller. \b \u001d  The biggest problem for Constellation is the impact of the Australian wine glut on the company's critical U.K. market, which accounts for about 10% of total revenues. Increasing vineyard plantings in Australia over the past decade have driven that country's grape harvest to successive record levels in 2005 and 2006. Since Australia traditionally exports the bulk of its wines to Britain, this increasing flood prevented Constellation from lifting prices to offset normal cost increases. \u001d  Worse still, it allowed an increased number of supermarkets and other middlemen to start up their own private labels. The result: an oversaturated market that sent revenues and profits plunging. \u001d  Yet a turnaround is already under way. \"The huge Australian harvest came on very rapidly, producing the kind of wine glut that Barron's has been warning of for years,\" says Richard Sands, Constellation's CEO. \"But it looks like the worst is over.\" \u001d  Thanks to the drought, he adds, \"this year's harvest will probably be down 30% on last year. And since the drought has prevented many growers from watering the vines after picking -- something important to the following year's crop -- it's likely that, too, will be lower still. But it's hard to predict exactly how and when this will play out. There's never been a glut like this in the history of the wine business.\" (Barron's first warned of this overabundance in \"The Coming Glut,\" August 3, 1998.) \u001d  Added to the turmoil in Europe, Constellation voluntarily elected to disrupt its U.S. wine sales at the same time; electing, as many other liquor companies have recently done, to revamp its sales system to cut distributors' inventory levels. While the move has and will significantly reduce the company's total U.S wine sales in the first half of the calendar year, it has been generally applauded, since it cuts stocks to mirror demand, frees up capital for distributors and improves the company's supply-chain management. \u001d  When the destocking is complete this summer, suggests D.A. Davidson's Ramey, \"it will reduce the need for promotions to move excess product and give Constellation significantly more pricing power.\" \u001d  The beer business, for its part, was thrown into disarray when Constellation signed a new deal with Mexico's Grupo Modelo, the brewer of Corona. Previously, Constellation only had rights to import the Mexican beers to the West Coast. As of last January, however, the new joint venture with Modelo gave it rights to the entire U.S. There was inevitably some confusion, and an increase in inventory in the pipeline, both of which will dampen first-quarter returns and, to a lesser degree, the second-quarter numbers also. \u001d  \"We are now in a tremendous position to really build on and market these brands across the country,\" notes Sands. \"Though sales of the broad U.S. beer brands have been slowing or declining, sales of imported, upmarket brands have been growing. Corona is the No. 1 imported beer in the U.S., and we are in a perfect position to continue growth.\" \u001d  The last big problem is significantly smaller in impact but could last longer: the purchase earlier this year of Svedka vodka from its European owner for $384 million -- a high price, but far below the the $2 billion Bacardi paid to buy Grey Goose three years ago. Produced in Sweden and launched in 1998 primarily for the U.S. market, Svedka boasts a stunning track record, boosting sales by 60% in 2006 to more than one million cases and becoming one of the world's top 100 premium spirits brands. \u001d  The deal markedly increases Constellation's market share in vodka, still by far the fastest growing part of the spirits business. And it lifts Constellations sales of premium brands to about 30% of total spirits sales from 20%. \u001d  But while the deal makes strategic sense, it comes at a price. Consensus calculations suggest the purchase will be dilutive for at least the next three years, costing more in terms of interest than it will deliver in profits. The problem is that the company borrowed a good chunk of change for the deal, and it's debt is rated as \"junk,\" the result of past acquisitions and a long-term debt load that amounts to nearly 50% of capital. \u001d  Still, the Svedka purchase fits in neatly with Constellation's push to move upmarket across its entire portfolio of wines, spirits and beers, a push designed to mirror the big ongoing upmarket swing in U.S. drinking habits. \u001d  According to CEO Sands, sales in the overall spirits market are rising by just 4% to 5% a year, but this includes zero growth at the lower price points and 10% annual growth for premium brands. \"This is why the Svedka acquisition is so important and why we paid the price we did,\" he says. \"We can and will build growth around it, putting other brands that we create or buy to ride on its coattails.\" \b \u001d  Constellation is following a similar strategy in wine, aiming to boost organic growth of such upmarket labels as Ravenswood, Jackson-Triggs, RH Phillips and Kim Crawford, and (it's assumed) continuing to explore still further acquisitions. The change, slow as it may be, will work steadily to improve both margins and sales. \u001d  \"Most people don't realize it,\" notes Sands, \"but Constellation is the No. 1 premium-wine maker in the U.S. and in the world.\" In value wines and so-called fighting varietals, which are wines selling for under $8 a bottle, Constellation is ranked third in that market, which is a market where sales are either falling or at best static. \u001d  But in the higher categories, up to the $15 level, the company is the biggest seller in terms of units. \u001d  \"We think in terms of the market for $10 wines growing at about 10% a year and the market for $20 bottles at about 20%,\" says Sands. \"That's where the growth is and that's where our focus is.\" \u001d  That's good reason for shareholders to raise a glass. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3360543d78dc9b20f36fa64bf9b3c8a5","symR":["CBSS"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Dir GESSLER JR Registers 3,579 Of COMPASS BANCSHARES INC >CBSS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBSS"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: COMPASS BANCSHARES INC \bSYMBOL: CBSS \b \b \bFILER: GESSLER CARL J JR \bTITLE: Director \bBROKER: CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 3,579          DATE REGISTERED: 5/8/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 4/27/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

Annaly, a Manhattan-based real-estate investment trust, borrows funds at short-term rates and reinvests them in mortgage-backed securities sold by the likes of Fannie Mae (ticker: FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE). It earns the difference, or spread, between the income generated by its portfolio and its cost of capital, and pays out about 90% of its earnings in the form of dividends. \u001d  Alas, that spread is only 0.58 of a percentage point these days, following the Fed's three-year campaign to tighten credit, which has boosted the short-term federal-funds rate to 5.25% from 1%. With rates on long-dated Treasuries relatively unchanged, the yield curve has flattened or inverted for much of the past year. \u001d  Mortgage yields don't mimic the Treasury market precisely, but the difference is negligible in terms of the damage done: Annaly earned only 44 cents a share last year, down from a record $2.67 in 2002. Its dividend fell to 57 cents a share, compared with a payout of $2.67 in 2002, and its shares dropped to 15 from 21. Annaly recently traded at 15.86. \u001d  Some savvy investors now think the worst is over. \"The yield curve will start to steepen in the second half of the year and continue to do so in '08 as the economy begins to slow and the Fed cuts rates,\" says Arnie Schneider, chief investment officer of Schneider Capital Management, which has owned shares for about a year. \"If the federal- funds rate decreases by one percentage point, [the company] could probably earn close to $2.\" \u001d  The last time Annaly earned as much, in 2002 and '03, its stock traded up to 21 a share. \u001d  Fed policymakers left rates unchanged when they met last week, but spreads already have widened, as Annaly's first-quarter results attest. The company earned 26 cents a share before one-time gains, two cents above Wall Street expectations and 10 cents higher than a year ago. Analysts expect Annaly to earn $320 million, or $1.19 a share, on net interest income of $410 million this year, and $1.42 a share in 2008. Dividends should rise commensurately. \u001d  Like Schneider, Annaly Chairman and CEO Michael Farrell thinks the Fed's next move is down, as a deteriorating housing market threatens the broad economy. \"It could be fall before we see the Fed move to lower rates, but the bond market would move ahead of that,\" he says. \u001d  A reduction in the fed-funds rate normally drives down short-term Treasury yields faster than long yields. Hence, Annaly's borrowing costs would fall faster and more sharply than the income earned on its investments. \u001d  At the end of the first quarter Annaly had $33 billion of repurchase agreements, or short-term borrowings, secured by the majority of its $39 billion of mortgage-backed securities. Its borrowing costs averaged 5.1%, and its yield on investments 5.68% -- hence, the 0.58-of-a-point spread. Nearly 85% of the company's repo agreements mature within 30 days, while the rate on the investment portfolio resets after 19 months (or 9.5 months, after accounting for the company's interest-rate-swap portfolio). \u001d  Current earnings estimates assume the Fed will stay on hold or cut rates by half a percentage point in the next year. But the Fed rarely cuts in such restrained fashion; to spur the economy, former Fed Chief Alan Greenspan lowered rates by 6.75 percentage points from 1989 to 1992, notes Jeremy Diamond, a managing director of the REIT. \b \u001d  Annaly faces several risks, chief among them the possibility that the economy will strengthen and the Fed will raise rates. If that happens, the shares could fall by as much as three dollars, says Robert Napoli, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, who has a Market Perform rating on the stock. Even if Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke stands pat, the shares could give up a dollar or so, Napoli reasons. \u001d  Mortgage prepayments could also pose a problem. When interest rates fall sharply, as in 2003, borrowers typically prepay existing mortgages and take on new loans at lower rates. If history repeats, Annaly will receive fresh cash just as interest rates head lower, capping its potential profit. \u001d  Annaly's risks -- and opportunities -- are amplified by the use of leverage, which stood at 9.8 to 1 at the end of March. For every dollar of equity, the REIT borrows another $9.80, investing it all in mortgages. Higher rates could lead to significantly higher borrowing costs. \u001d  Farrell, 56, and Wellington Denahan-Norris, 43, Annaly's chief operating officer, have maneuvered the company expertly since founding it in 1997. \"History is littered with the body bags of people who try to do what we do for a living,\" Farrell observes. \u001d  Indeed, some investors cite the \"Farrell\" premium to explain why Annaly trades at a 33% premium to book value of $11.90, while peers trade at book. The combination of strong management and size give it two advantages: abundant access to credit, and better financing terms. The company currently pays about 0.05 of a percentage point under one-month LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate), while similar REITs pay as much as a tenth of a percentage point over, estimates Stephen Laws, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, which was involved in Annaly's secondary stock offering last year. Laws has a Buy rating. \u001d  Annaly's small asset-management division also adds ballast. While it contributed just $22 million of revenue, versus nearly $170 million of net interest income, its earnings generally are steadier than other REIT earnings and garner higher multiples. \u001d  Farrell is bearish on the economy.\"The country is going through a real-estate depression,\" he says. \"It just hasn't played out yet.\" Low-income consumers don't have access to credit, he notes. Boomers are squeezed by college payments and the cost of caring for parents.

The Virginia-based investment manager is too busy trying to hunt down another kind of quarry: small companies with big competitive edges and world-class management teams. \u001d  The quest for these elusive entities may make flushing out foxes from their lairs in the Virginia countryside look simple by comparison. \"The things that we look for are scarce,\" explains Akre. \"We have to take our time and consider carefully what we will do with our cash.\" \u001d  That cash, meanwhile, is mounting almost daily in the coffers of FBR Small Cap Fund (ticker: FBRVX), the mutual fund that Akre has run since its inception a decade ago. In 2000 Akre and his team at Akre Capital Management became an independent entity that sub-advises the fund for FBR Mutual Funds, a Friedman Billings Ramsey unit. FBR recently reopened the fund to new capital -- for the first time in three years -- some $600 million in new assets have been allocated to the small-cap fund, which now has a total of $1.7 billion. \u001d  And today nearly a third of the fund -- some $500 million -- remains uninvested. Says Akre: \"Finding new [investment ideas] is the lifeblood of this business, but we have to stick to our discipline. It's not a simple process.\" \u001d  He isn't kidding. To qualify for inclusion in Akre's portfolio -- only about 40 names make the cut at any one time -- a company must have the potential to post above-average returns on capital. Ideally, in Akre's eyes, that will come as a result of a regulatory edge, patent protection or other advantage that will keep competitors from nipping at their heels. He also insists on top-quality management teams. \"We want them to be excellent at running the business and to see their public shareholders as partners,\" Akre says. \u001d  Many of Akre's favorite stocks are founded and still run by families who retain large stakes in the businesses and thus think like shareholders. A case in point: Penn National Gaming (PENN), which he discovered more than a decade ago. \"When we found it, it had five off-track betting locations in Pennsylvania; today, it's the third-largest gaming-venue operator in the country,\" Akre says proudly. \u001d  What attracted him to that stock was the combination of the industry's growth potential and the CEO's ambition and commitment. \"He had his own money on the line, and had a great sense of what the risk and the potential were -- and we were able to buy at a very modest valuation,\" Akre adds. The company, which today owns an array of race tracks and casinos, trades at just 11 times Akre's estimate of free cash flow for 2008 and 13 times 2007 estimated free cash flow. \u001d  Although Akre has held Penn National in the FBR portfolio for most of the fund's lifetime, he sees no reason to unload it any- time soon. Indeed, the fund's turnover is a measly few percentage points a year, and Akre will hang on to a stock even after it has moved out of conventional small-cap territory into the world of mid-caps. \"When we designed the fund, having that flexibility was one thing I insisted on,\" he says. \"We didn't want to have to cut our flowers back in order to water our weeds.\" \u001d  Not that Akre has cultivated many weeds. His offbeat array of small-cap stocks, dominated by gaming, specialty finance and specialty retail companies, has generated an average annual return of 19.6% for the fund in the five-year period ended March 31 -- and as high as 45.8% in some recent years. \u001d  Sustaining that record could get trickier, especially with the responsibility of putting so much new cash to work, says Laura Lutton of fund-tracker Morningstar. \"It's tough to continue to do that well anyway, but you have to wonder if the fund's larger size is going to hamstring Chuck's ability to be nimble and position himself where he really wants to be,\" she says. \"I think this fund is FBR's star offering, and their best chance for asset growth, but I want to be sure, going forward, that the investment process isn't compromised by the growth in assets.\" \u001d  For Akre, that's not even up for debate. FBR trustees asked him on no fewer than six occasions to consider reopening the fund, since its performance remained stellar. He eventually consented late last year, after market volatility created some fresh buying opportunities, and the fund reopened in January. \"Just because we have a lot of cash doesn't mean we'll get it to work today,\" he says. \u001d  Certainly, Akre doesn't mind buying out-of-favor companies that meet his criteria and holding them until their problems have been resolved and the market recognizes their intrinsic value. \u001d  For instance, one of the fund's largest holdings -- nearly 3% of the portfolio -- is 99 Cents Only Stores (NDN), a beleaguered dollar-store retailer that didn't file its 10-K for the March 31, 2006, fiscal year with the Securities and Exchange Commission until this April. \"Everything that could go wrong with this company, went wrong,\" says Akre. Management bungled the company's expansion in Texas and ran afoul of new accounting regulations. Akre started buying NDN in late summer of '04 at $13 a share, and kept buying down to 10 a share through year-end '06, convinced the company would resume its historic earnings and growth pattern. These days, the stock hovers between 13 and 15. \u001d  One of Akre's contrarian bets these days is on housing-related businesses like Pool Corp. (POOL), a swimming-pool distributor. Its business, he notes, isn't tied to new-home starts -- some two-thirds of gross profits come from remodeling and maintenance of swimming pools. Indeed, Akre began adding to his holdings of building-products companies about eight months ago, betting that homeowners no longer able to trade up would opt to buy, say, new kitchen cabinets -- from companies like American Woodmark (AMWD), another holding. \u001d  And as recent history has shown, it may be foolish to bet against Akre the contrarian. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"44d926dd830d6c4f3c4e2e9f67f62764","symR":["EQT"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP PETRELLI Registers 26,365 Of EQUITABLE RESOURCES INC >EQT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EQT"],"IndustryCodes":["GAS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: EQUITABLE RESOURCES INC \bSYMBOL: EQT \b \b \bFILER: PETRELLI CHARLENE \bTITLE: Vice President \bBROKER: AG EDWARDS & SONS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 26,365         DATE REGISTERED: 5/9/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 5/3/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

But one of the more intriguing characters missing from that drama was Nortel Networks Chief Executive Mike Zafirovski, who was one of the key players in helping Motorola fix its storied mobile phone business earlier this decade. \u001d  Motorola (ticker: MOT) could probably use Zafirovski about now. A General Electric alumnus, he was hired by former Motorola CEO Chris Galvin and teamed with then-Chief Technology Officer Ralph Pini to lead a rebound in phones that eventually spawned the RAZR. But before the fruits of their labor were evident in 2003, the board forced Galvin out and passed over Zafirovski to recruit Zander from Silicon Valley. Both Pini and Zafirovski eventually left Motorola after Zander's arrival. \u001d  Since then, Zander has been left with a relatively bare bench when it comes to cellphone-engineering turnaround specialists. Of course, Motorola is still stocked with capable engineering talent, but designing an iconic (Moto's favorite adjective) high-margin platform on a fast-track, with Icahn breathing down Zander's neck at the same time, won't be easy. \u001d  Zafirovski, with his operations and manufacturing experience, might well have been up to the task. Instead, he finds himself leading a turnaround that is probably even more challenging than the one at Motorola. \u001d  Nortel (NT) was in a real mess when he arrived in late 2005, and he has worked diligently to straighten it out. The Canadian telecom giant doesn't make handsets but does compete with Motorola in the rapidly consolidating telecommunications infrastructure industry. \u001d  While Zander was answering to Icahn in Chicago last week, Zafirovski was basking in the relative success of his own shareholder meeting, held in Toronto several days before Motorola's. While hardly out of the woods, Nortel reported a narrower first-quarter loss than expected, slightly better revenues and improved gross margins. That didn't come as a total surprise; I wrote about the turnaround's prospects several months ago in a feature story (\"Nortel's Stronger Signal,\" Dec. 11, 2006). Shares were trading last week around 24, up about two bucks from when the story ran. \u001d  Nortel still faces obstacles. For one thing, it's in a prickly intellectual-property battle in U.S. District Court in Marshall, Texas, the court of choice for intellectual property plaintiffs. \u001d  Last month, Nortel lost the suit, filed by Australia's QPSX, and was told to pay $28 million in damages. The trouble is, legal experts say, that the price tag could swell to three times that before it is over, including court costs, lawyers' fees and pre-judgment interest. Since Nortel is expected to earn only about $320 million in profits this year, that's a decent chunk of change. Since the ruling, Nortel has moved to dismiss the verdict and will likely appeal. \u001d  Three of Nortel's competitors -- Juniper Networks, Alcatel-Lucent and Cisco Systems -- also were sued for patent infringement by QPSX but opted to settle before going to trial. Nortel's lawyers apparently weren't as wise, but Zafirovski is on the case: Last week, the company replaced its lead outside firm with a new team of patent lawyers. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: mark.veverka@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4c35b19595e442f6b4438ddc3b1391dc","symR":["AAPL","AET","BEN","BXC","CCU","CSC","EK","F","GS","HNT","LEH","MSFT","PCAR","PHM","STX","US00817Y1082","US0378331005","US38141G1040","US5249081002","US5949181045"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/14) Barron's 500 -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAPL","AET","BEN","BXC","CCU","CSC","EK","F","GS","HNT","LEH","MSFT","PCAR","PHM","STX","US00817Y1082","US0378331005","US38141G1040","US5249081002","US5949181045"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","AUT","BLD","BRD","CPR","ENT","HEA","HOM","HPR","MED","REQ","SCR","SOF","TRQ","TSX","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF","XSTX"],"Story":"\u001d  With 100 million iPods already in the market, unit growth could decline, says Bruce Bartlett, manager of the Lord Abbett Large-Cap Growth Fund (LALCX). The iPhone will be a big determinant of Apple's future, he says. The device, which is expected to go on sale late next month, combines an iPod, a cellphone and an Internet device. \u001d  Initial interest seems to be high, says Bartlett, whose fund owns Apple shares, \"but the degree of demand will be dictated by the price point and to what degree it is subsidized [by wireless providers].\" A price of $400-$500 might dampen demand, but at $250 to $350 the iPhone could be \"extremely successful,\" he says. \u001d  If Apple sells 12 million iPhones in the higher price range, the company could generate $6 billion in incremental revenue, says Gabe Birdsall, a manager of the AIM Constellation Fund (CSTGX); Apple is the fund's biggest position. Birdsall thinks the company could double its size in three to five years, but he cautions that an iPhone flop would weigh heavily on its shares. \u001d  With a relatively high P/E, Apple isn't without risk. Second-quarter results were strong, with profits up 88%, but investors didn't celebrate because much of that gain came from lower component costs. Apple executives declined to comment. \b \u001d  Terex \u001d  Our fourth-place finisher isn't a household name, but it is well known among the world's mining and construction companies. Westport, Conn.-based Terex, which makes large, off-road heavy-duty mining trucks and mobile cranes, among other big machines, has benefited handsomely from the global commodity boom, says Zili Zhang, directive of quantitative research for American Century Investments. \u001d  Terex's cash-flow growth stems, in no small part, from its numerous acquisitions in the late 1990s and early 2000s; it combined companies and cut overhead, says Ron Muhlenkamp, who runs the Muhlenkamp Fund (MUHLX) and owns Terex shares. \u001d  Adding capacity this way eliminated the need to build new plants when the global boom got under way a few years ago. \"Building new capacity eats up cash,\" Muhlenkamp says. \u001d  Ryan Amerman, an analyst at AIM Investments, concurs, noting improved efficiencies allowed operating margins to rise to 9.3% last year from 6.5% in 2005. Terex also managed to raise inventory turnover to about four times a year from 3.3 times, he says. The inventory-turn rate is a measure of how fast a company moves products out the door. \u001d  Terex's chairman and CEO, Ronald DeFeo, says the company has been able to wring cash from an \"aggressive\" approach to waste in the manufacturing process over the past few years. Terex also has been successful in passing along price increases from suppliers to clients. \u001d  Now that Terex has bulked up, the \"next phase\" is to leverage its size to increase purchasing power. \"We use as much steel as BMW, but from 1,000 suppliers,\" DeFeo says. \u001d  If the company can extract cost savings from suppliers, that should help Terex fulfill its vow to deliver \"12-12-10,\" or $12 billion in sales and 12% operating margins by the end of 2010. Last year, Terex reported revenue of $7.7 billion, up 24% from 2005, while earnings per share more than doubled, to $3.88. \u001d  Terex currently sells for 14.7 times 2007 consensus estimates of $5.54 per share, though its expected growth rate exceeds that P/E multiple. Yes, it is in a cyclical business, but as long as the digging and building continue around the world, Terex looks prepared to fulfill its promise. \b \u001d  Paccar \u001d  Anybody who has driven America's highways might recognize Paccar's products: 18-wheelers with names like Peterbilt and Kenworth that flash by hauling goods cross-country. \u001d  Paccar makes light, medium and heavy-duty trucks and engines and sells them around the world. Like Terex, Paccar's cash flow has been boosted by global growth. \u001d  In addition to strong sales growth -- revenue jumped 17% to $16.5 billion last year -- Paccar built up its cash flow by increasing inventory turns 400% and cutting expenses as a percentage of sales by 60% in the past decade, notes its chairman and CEO, Mark Pigott. More recently, it has accelerated the design process for new products so that new rigs come to market in two to three years instead of five years, he says. \u001d  The Bellevue, Wash., company's operations are less capital-intensive than those of its peers and most other heavy-industry companies, says Tony Fiore, a Standard & Poor's analyst. By outsourcing a significant percentage of components, like transmissions and engines (in the U.S.), Paccar can operate with relatively little working capital, freeing up cash for other things, he says. That has contributed to above-average returns and operating margins, he adds. \u001d  Paccar shares, up 68% in the past 12 months, now trade for about 19 times 2007 consensus estimates of $4.73 per share, down from $5.95 last year. Analysts expect North American demand to slow. \u001d  Yet Paccar managed to beat estimates handily in the first quarter, raising dividends in the process to 25 cents a share per quarter. The U.S. represents a not-insignificant 40% of Paccar's business, but the company has a long track record of outperforming and is likely to keep doing so, as long as the global economy stays strong. \u001d  --- \u001d                           Barron's 500 Methodology \u001d  Holt, a unit of Credit Suisse, uses four equally weighted measures to grade and rank the largest companies in the U.S. and Canada (as measured by  sales). For each company, Holt calculates stock-price performance relative to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (for the 52 weeks ended April 27); the median cash-flow return on investment (CFROI) for the past three years, stripped of the effects of inflation and accounting practices; CFROI in the latest fiscal year compared to the three-year historical median, and sales growth in the latest fiscal year, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. For financial companies, Holt calculates cash-flow return on equity. \u001d  The firm then grades each company in all four categories: the top quintile in each category gets an A, the bottom quintile an F. Using these grades, it calculates a total grade-point average, or GPA, for each company, with 4.0 the highest. In the case of tie GPAs, the \"winner\" is the company with the greatest change in CFROI or cash-flow return on equity in the past year. The Barron's 500 excludes companies that are restating financial data, operating under bankruptcy protection or have delisted shares. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"51e6774034cfde0b65a3a58984863129","symR":["SCON"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Dir SHALVOY Registers 7,146 Of SUPERCONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGIES >SCON","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SCON"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: SUPERCONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGIES \bSYMBOL: SCON \b \b \bFILER: SHALVOY CHARLES E \bTITLE: Director \bBROKER: CHARLES SCHWAB & CO INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 7,146          DATE REGISTERED: 5/9/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 5/2/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

The trip coincides with an energy summit in Poland that is to discuss ways to reduce Europe's energy reliance on Russia. \u001d  Putin met with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev in the Kazakh capital Astana Thursday and with Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov in the Turkmen capital Ashgabat Friday. The three presidents are to travel to the Caspian town of Turkmenbashi Saturday for joint talks. \u001d  After that, Putin is to return to Kazakhstan for three days to visit the Caspian port of Aktau. \u001d  \"Russia wants to secure gas shipments going forward, preferably at a predictable price,\" Timothy Brenton, an oil and gas analyst at Renaissance Capital, said Thursday in a note. \"Central Asian republics remain crucial in supporting Russia's gas balance, as domestic production is not growing sufficiently to meet domestic and export demand.\" \u001d  Brenton said natural gas supplies from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan \"is supporting Gazprom's business\" in the former Soviet republics. \u001d  Russia exports natural gas from Central Asia through a pipeline that has an annual capacity of 60 billion cubic meters. \u001d  Putin's talks with Nazarbayev, who has been increasingly independent in his energy policies, were marked by an agreement on export prices for Kazakh natural gas processed at Orenburg gas processing plant in Russia. The Russian and Kazakh government also signed a deal on establishing a joint uranium enrichment center. \u001d  Kazakhstan has been attempting to keep Russia as well as other foreign energy partners at an equal distance regarding its oil and gas contracts. \u001d  Putin and Nazarbayev agreed to an expansion of the pipeline operated by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium that Kazakhstan uses to ship crude oil from the Tengiz oil field in western Kazakhstan operated by Chevron Corp.-led (CVX) Tengizchevroil. \u001d  No specific deal for the expansion has been signed, but it may have been linked to Kazakhstan's involvement in Russia-backed Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline that would take Russian and Kazakh oil bypassing the Bosphorus. The Turkish strait is already overloaded by cargo ships and has been a source of environmental concerns for the Turkish authorities. \u001d  Putin's second meeting with President Berdymukhammedov within just a few weeks is a sign that Russia wants to establish strong ties with the new leader of the country. His predecessor, Saparmurat Niyazov, who died in December, was difficult to deal with, because of his extravagant character and annoyance with Russia's dominance in its export contracts. \u001d  Turkmenistan is the second-largest natural gas producer in the former Soviet Union after Russia, with reserves of 2.8 trillion cubic meters, though the figures haven't been independently verified. \u001d  \"It is remarkable that President Putin is taking a rather long trip to Central Asia where his focus will obviously be Turkmenistan,\" said Kaan Nazli, an analyst at Medley Global Advisors. \"Russia is keen to get more say in Turkmen gas production, which is set to decline incrementally in the coming years in the absence of more investment.\" \u001d  Another key issue on Putin's Central Asian agenda is the construction of a pre-Caspian gas pipeline that would carry Kazakh and Turkmen natural gas supplies to Russia. \u001d  Turkmenistan has been looking for ways to transport its gas to energy-hungry China. Some Kazakh officials have suggested that Kazakhstan's territory could be used for such a project. \u001d  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Naryshkin said that the meeting between the three leaders in Turkmenbashi will focus on the construction of the Caspian pipeline, Interfax news agency reported Friday. \u001d  The pre-Caspian pipeline projects competes with a U.S.-backed trans-Caspian pipeline that would bypass Russia but is hindered by the undefined legal status of the Caspian sea. \u001d  Brenton said that Putin's two goals for the Central Asian trip included gaining support for the pre-Caspian pipeline, which would ensure Russia's dominance over Europe's energy supply, and getting guarantees from the Turkmen leadership for energy export contracts signed by Niyazov. \u001d  \"Collectively, the goal of the trip is to secure for Russia a pole position in accessing energy-rich Central Asia, and consequently secure Russia's position as the major energy supplier to Europe,\" Brenton said. \b \u001d  -By Kadyr Toktogulov, Dow Jones Newswires, +7 701 726 4327; kadyr.toktogulov@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"549c7b43984634b2f6b52fdfd206ac51","symR":["SRCH"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder ABLE Registers 50,000 Of SEARCHLIGHT MINERALS CORP >SRCH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SRCH"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: SEARCHLIGHT MINERALS CORP \bSYMBOL: SRCH \b \b \bFILER: ABLE STEWART \bTITLE: Shareholder \bBROKER: CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 50,000         DATE REGISTERED: 5/8/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 6/1/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

The Tokyo Stock Exchange's REIT index, sporting a roughly 3% dividend yield, has tallied a dizzying 30% rise year to date to hit a lifetime high of 2602.69 on May 8, against the Topix's paltry 2% gain. \u001d  And mobile-phone operator NTT Docomo (ticker: DCM), which raised its fiscal 2006 dividend to 4,800 yen from 4,000 yen , to recent yield of 2.3%, has comfortably outstripped the Topix year-to-date, with a 12.7% gain. \u001d  Over all, Japanese companies generating high free cash flow to equity -- cash left for shareholders after all expenses, reinvestment and debt repayments, with which companies can potentially pay dividends -- have clocked good gains this year. The telecoms have the highest free-cash-flow yield, 12.2%, in an 11-sector breakdown of Japan's equity market by Lehman Brothers. \u001d  Despite Japan's new dividend culture, the Topix's forecast of dividend yield for the 12 months ending March 2008 is a modest 1.2%, well below the 1.8% sported by the Standard & Poor's 500 in the U.S. -- a market where investors buy stocks more for price appreciation than for dividends. Indeed, the current move for higher dividends is partly a reflection of how pitiful yields are for Japan's legion of aging domestic investors clamoring for retirement income. \u001d  The Topix's dividend yield is 72% of the 10-year Japanese government bond's recent yield of 1.665%, while the S&P's yield weighs in at just 39% of that of the 10-year Treasury's. Throw in any capital appreciation with the Topix's yield, and, for some domestic investors, the mix begins to look quite appetizing. \u001d  Overseas funds have had mixed success hassling firms to speed up dividend hikes and engage in share buybacks. Dai Nippon Printing (DNPCY) recently boosted its dividends at the behest of a major investor, and a hedge fund is battling Electric Power Development (9513.JAPAN) to do the same, while Fursa Alternative Strategies failed in March to get Noritz (5943.JAPAN), a maker of heating and air-conditioning units, to raise its dividend more than tenfold. \u001d  For investors looking to play the payout trend, strategist Kazuhiro Miyake of the Daiwa Institute of Research suggests companies with high returns on equity or high yields of free cash flow to equity -- and with either an already high dividend yield or low dividend payouts relative to their sector. Blue-chip names include the diversified JFE Holdings (5411.JAPAN), shipper Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (9107.JAPAN) and Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.JAPAN). \u001d  Chinese equities soared last week, even as the central bank warned of a bubble. The Shanghai stock index blew past 4,000 for the first time, and volume in Chinese stocks eclipsed trading volume in the rest of Asia. So far this year, the Shanghai Composite is up 50% to 4,021. Meanwhile, Japan inched higher and Hong Kong slumped. Late in the week, investors grew concerned that China would tighten credit further, and that U.S. growth would slow. \u001d  --- \u001d  JAMIE MIYAZAKI is a reporter with Dow Jones Newswires in Tokyo. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"58edfb6d03fee7116b3ae347fdbfce23","symR":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BAC","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","ITAU4.BR","ITU","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","BRITAUACNPR3","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109","US0605051046"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(5/12) ABN Brazil Arm Draws Interest Amid Takeover Talk","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BAC","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","ITAU4.BR","ITU","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","BRITAUACNPR3","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109","US0605051046"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XAEX","XB20","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XIBEX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Carrick Mollenkamp and Jason Singer \u001d  A number of banks have contacted Barclays PLC to express an interest in ABN Amro Holding NV's main Brazilian bank operations to gauge whether that unit would ever be on the market, according to people familiar with the situation. \u001d  Barclays, which is in the midst of a contest with a European bank consortium to buy ABN, for now, has no plans to part with Banco Real if the British bank succeeds in the increasingly bitter fight for ABN. Barclays views Banco Real as one of the real growth opportunities that would come from its proposed $86.45 billion purchase of ABN, these people said. \u001d  But the inbound phone calls to Barclays add yet another twist to the ABN story. The European consortium, led by Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, is reviewing its options after having its own proposed bid, valued at $97.71 billion, turned away by ABN a week ago. \u001d  ABN plans to schedule a court-ordered shareholder meeting to vote on the sale of its U.S. LaSalle bank to Bank of America Corp. But Bank of America is suing ABN in federal court in the U.S. to enforce its contract to buy LaSalle. Ahead of Bank of America's lawsuit, which was filed May 4 in U.S. federal court in the Southern District of New York, the consortium or RBS, through intermediaries, sent out feelers to Bank of America to see if there might be a way to accommodate it, though no specifics were discussed, according to people familiar with the situation. One possible avenue could have been to portion out LaSalle between RBS and Bank of America, but the feelers didn't lead to any action and the lawsuit was filed. \u001d  Spokespeople for RBS and Bank of America declined to comment. \u001d  Friday, consortium partner Fortis NV, a Dutch-Belgian concern, reported first-quarter results but offered little information on the consortium's next move. A Fortis official said that it, RBS and partner Banco Santander Central Hispano SA would update the market before the ABN shareholder meeting or before May 27. The consortium on April 25 made a proposed offer of 39 euros a share for ABN and has 30 days to provide an update under Dutch corporate law. \u001d  One of ABN's prime assets is Banco Real and the telephone calls to Barclays highlight the fact that any number of banks foreign to Brazil would prize the bank. In total, ABN's Latin America operations account for about 17% of its revenue. Globally, banks have increased their focus on the so-called BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- to take advantage of these markets' demand for banking services, especially as growth slows in home markets. David Hendler, an analyst at research firm Credit Sights Inc., said Banco Real would be sought after because few independent Brazilian banks are interested in selling. Barclays declined to comment on Banco Real. \u001d  One potential buyer would be Brazil's Banco Itau Holding Financeira SA, another of Brazil's large banks. A Banco Itau spokesman said the bank always evaluates market opportunities that create shareholder value. \u001d  Banco Itau is 7.4% owned by Bank of America. If a purchase of ABN's Brazilian business would help Barclays clinch its deal for ABN, that would also benefit Bank of America. Bank of America declined to comment. \u001d  --- \u001d  Valerie Bauerlein contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:00 ET (04:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6111e644a6c99b6d7d31b62f0faba7f8","symR":["CMCSA","CMCSK","CVC","TWC","VZ","US2003002001","US20030N1019","US92343V1044"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/14) Takeover Or \"Take Under?\"","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CMCSA","CMCSK","CVC","TWC","VZ","US2003002001","US20030N1019","US92343V1044"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","FTS","MED","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Jacqueline Doherty \u001d  The Dolan family, majority owners of Cablevision Systems, knows how to create drama. Its attempt to take the cable-television provider private -- this time for $36.26 a share -- once again has sparked an uproar among other investors who think the bid undervalues the company by as much as $10 a share. If it succeeds, critics argue, the family of Chairman Charles Dolan, 80, and his son, CEO James Dolan, 52, will capture more than $2 billion of value that would otherwise enrich Cablevision's public holders. \u001d  Our bet: The largest investors of Cablevision (ticker: CVC) will successfully block the transaction. Either the Dolans will raise their offer or the deal will unravel, leaving shares to rise in tandem with the company's improving cash flow in the next few years. \u001d  \"Cablevision deserves a much higher price,\" says John Linehan, manager of the T. Rowe Price Value Fund (TRVLX), which owns the stock. \"They're trying to steal this company from under our noses.\" \u001d  Mario Gabelli of Gamco Investors (GBL), another vocal critic, owns 20 million, or 7%, of Cablevision's shares. In a blog entry in January, Gabelli implied he'd consider a deal valued at $36 a share. But since then, Cablevision's stellar results and the rising value of its assets have made it more valuable, he says. Gabelli figures the private-market value of Cablevision is $51 a share, but declines to say what he would accept from the Dolans. \u001d  If the Dolans were to allow a public bidding process, Cablevision likely would attract interest from industry giants Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Comcast (CMCSA). Though the Dolans and other Cablevision representatives declined to comment, the family previously has said it is not interested in selling to a third party. Because almost all of its 57 million shares have super-voting rights, other shareholders can't force a sale. The Dolans' shares represent 20% of the economic interest in the company but 70% of the voting rights. \u001d  In their bid to acquire Bethpage, N.Y.-based Cablevision, the Dolans won't invest new money, but contribute their existing equity, valued at $2.1 billion, to a new company established to complete the acquisition. This new company and its affiliates will assume Cablevision's debt and raise about $8.5 billion of new debt to fund the purchase of Cablevision's remaining 235 million shares. \u001d  Granted, this strategy will increase the Dolans' risk; the new company will be highly leveraged, with about $2.1 billion of equity supporting $20 billion of debt. Its debt load will be about 10 times Cablevision's expected cash flow, measured by Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $2 billion this year. \u001d  Unless the Dolans inject more equity, they can't raise their bid much because of Cablevision's inability to take on still more debt. But analysts assume Ebitda will grow by about 10% a year, suggesting the possibility of a higher bid down the road. \u001d  Cablevision's Ebitda is expected to increase to $2.3 billion in 2008 from $2 billion this year, according to Thomson Financial. At that point, the company theoretically could support $23 billion of debt, applying the same multiple of 10 times Ebitda. That extra $3 billion equates to $10 a share. \u001d  \"We'd hang in until [the Dolans] force us out,\" says Christopher Marangi, an analyst with Gabelli. \b \u001d  What would Cablevision be worth if its sundry parts -- including the cable system, several cable networks, New York's Madison Square Garden and the New York Knicks and Rangers -- were sold off separately? The company recently announced the sale to Comcast of its 60% stake in the SportsChannel Pacific Associates and its 50% stake in SportsChannel New England -- all for a higher-than-expected $570 million. Marangi estimates Cablevision's parts are worth $48 a share now and could command as much as $58 next year as results improve. \u001d  Some analysts value the company on the basis of price to free cash flow, or operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, sees free cash flow rising to $5 a share by 2010. At 10 times that figure -- a fair multiple, he says -- the stock could be worth 50. \u001d  Cablevision's public holders might be pacified if they can participate in any profits the Dolans reap by selling company assets in a particular time period. Such a clause reportedly was discussed in earlier negotiations. Also, non-family holders might be willing to accept warrants or equity. \u001d  The Dolans could raise their offer by selling off a business or two, using the proceeds to increase the payout to other holders. Gabelli has said he might go to court to invoke dissenters' rights, which would allow the courts to assign a fair value to the company by which the Dolans would have to abide. \u001d  After rejecting earlier, lower bids from the family, a special committee of Cablevision's independent directors approved the latest offer. The committee required a majority of the minority shareholders to approve the deal, however. Altogether, owners of about 120 million of Cablevision's 292 million shares must vote in favor, though the Dolans can walk if holders of more than 10% of the public shares object. \u001d  The Dolans' supporters note the deal price represents an 11% premium to the stock's price before the current offer, and a 52% premium to price of the shares in October, before the family's first bid. Proponents also say Cablevision faces a growing threat from Verizon Communications (VZ), the telecom provider, which is stringing fiber throughout its territories to provide voice, data and video services to its customers. Verizon has rolled out service in more than 20% of Cablevision's markets and could become a more fearsome competitor. \u001d  Cablevision expects basic subscriber growth to climb 1% to 2% this year, versus 3.3% in '06. Client turnover grew in the first quarter, a sign Verizon is making headway, says Jason Bazinet, a Citi analyst who thinks the Dolans' offer will succeed. Others counter that Cablevision will win telephone and business customers from Verizon. \u001d  The Dolans' offer values the company at about $22 billion, or more than 10 times this year's expected Ebitda. Comcast and Time Warner Cable command only nine times Ebitda. But one industry insider notes most cable owners believe their stocks are undervalued and would like to believe their companies merit a multiple closer to 12. Time Warner Cable and Comcast, he adds, would likely pay up to 12 times Ebitda to purchase Cablevision's assets. \u001d  Historically, cable deals have been valued on the basis of subscribers. The Dolans would pay about $5,200 per \"sub,\" while Comcast and Time Warner Cable trade for roughly $4,000 per sub. But the latter companies are unlikely to be purchased, whereas Comcast recently bought a small Princeton, N.J., cable property for about $6,000 per sub. \u001d  Cable investors who opt to sell to the Dolans might want to redeploy their proceeds in other media stocks. Moffett has a 12-month target of $35 on Comcast and $48 on Time Warner Cable, which are about two years behind Cablevision in rolling out their triple-play of voice, data and video services. Other undervalued issues include Time Warner (TWX), Sprint Nextel (S), Viacom (VIA) and News Corp. (NWS). \u001d  If the latest deal fails, Cablevision's stock could fall by several dollars. But in a year or two, it could be 10% to 20% higher as the company's fundamentals improve. \u001d  As they say in the business, stay tuned. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6517ef463372d0c1215be3a9ff420f73","symR":["CBF"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder TARQUINIO Registers 1,667 Of CBRE REALTY FINANCE INC >CBF","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBF"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: CBRE REALTY FINANCE INC \bSYMBOL: CBF \b \b \bFILER: TARQUINIO A RICHARD \bTITLE: Shareholder \bBROKER: CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 1,667          DATE REGISTERED: 5/9/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 5/3/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

But first-quarter operating profits generated by companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index generally beat the expectations, helping to lift stock prices higher in recent weeks. \u001d  And things can get better. \u001d  Early estimates suggest that earnings growth generated by big U.S. companies will improve as the year continues, perhaps returning to double digits by the fourth quarter. And some Wall Street pundits say major market indexes can rise right along with them. \u001d  Yet much of the improvement to corporate bottom lines is coming from overseas operations, not from here at home, where economic growth slowed to a paltry 1.3% during the first quarter. \u001d  This should give export-driven, large-cap stocks such as Caterpillar (ticker: CAT) and 3M (MMM) an advantage over the stocks of small, U.S.-dependent companies. \u001d  \"We talk about a global economy, well here it is,\" says David Dropsey, an analyst with Thomson Financial. \"Big U.S. companies have positioned themselves to serve the world. If not, we would not have good earnings growth right now.\" \u001d  Last year, companies in the S&P 500 got 48% of their revenues from outside the U.S., up from 35% in 2002, according to Standard & Poor's. And sometime this year, that figure should hit 50%, says Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P. \u001d  A weak U.S. dollar has made U.S. products cheap in foreign markets. Plus, fast-growing economies in China, Brazil, Russia and India are spurring demand for heavy equipment, basic materials and consumer goods such as sneakers, fast food and televisions. \u001d  Yet in the U.S., a slumping housing market and weak automobile sales have taken a lot of air out of the U.S. economy. \u001d  In 2007, the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) should climb 2.1%, or half as fast as the broader global economy, according to Goldman Sachs. \u001d  Still, in 2007, profits generated by companies in the S&P 500 should climb 7% compared to 2006. International operations should generate half of those gains, says Barry James, president of James Investment Research. General Electric (GE), says in 2007 more than half of its revenue could come from outside the U.S. for the first time ever. \u001d  Little wonder that Goldman Sachs last week recommended a basket of 34 U.S. companies that generate 65% of their sales from outside the U.S. Up 13.2% year-to-date, the index, which includes Schering-Plough (SGP) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL), has dramatically beaten the Standard & Poor's 500's 6% gains so far this year. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6b94195c7296573bda959637cc03be90","symR":["CYNO"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Officer SIERRA Registers 20,370 Of CYNOSURE INC >CYNO","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CYNO"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: CYNOSURE INC \bSYMBOL: CYNO \b \b \bFILER: SIERRA RAFAEL A \bTITLE: Officer \bBROKER: DEUTSCHE BANK \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 20,370         DATE REGISTERED: 5/9/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 5/8/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

(AP)--Private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LLC may be the top contender to buy DaimlerChrysler AG's (DCX) struggling Chrysler Group, according to a newspaper report Saturday. \u001d  Cerberus has been holding extensive discussions with DaimlerChrysler on a possible deal, while two other contenders - Magna International Inc.

(005380.SE), South Korea's largest automaker, and its affiliate Kia (000270.SE). \u001d  Together they form the world's sixth-largest automotive group and aspire to become the fifth biggest by 2010. Kia has one factory in China and is building another. \u001d  Prosecutors said in a statement that five former Hyundai-Kia employees working at an auto-consulting firm in Seoul last year allegedly obtained core technology for the manufacture of a sport utility vehicle and a new car, code named \"HM,\" from two current Hyundai-Kia employees. \u001d  The five allegedly leaked the technology to a Chinese carmaker in return for $248,000, prosecutors said. They also allegedly tried to leak technology to another Chinese automaker, according to prosecutors. \u001d  All seven were charged with violating laws that protect business secrets and guard against unfair competition, the prosecutors said. Six of them were also charged with breach of trust. \u001d  If found guilty, the accused potentially face up to 10 years in prison. \u001d  Prosecutors said they launched the investigation in April after a tip-off from South Korea's National Intelligence Service. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 01:25 ET (05:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7f6818352321763648b15c675a703658","symR":["SVSE"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder JOHNSTON Registers 960,221 Of SILVER STAR ENERGY INC >SVSE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SVSE"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: SILVER STAR ENERGY INC \bSYMBOL: SVSE \b \b \bFILER: JOHNSTON NAOMI \bTITLE: Beneficial Owner \bBROKER: RESEARCH CAPITAL CORP \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 960,221        DATE REGISTERED: 5/9/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: N/A \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

She followed the sector in good times during her 22-year tenure as a research analyst and managing director at Salomon Brothers, and she has stuck with it during the bad times. Through it all, she has regularly topped Institutional Investor magazine's annual list of the best-of-the-best researchers on Wall Street. Since 2003 she has headed up Michelle Applebaum Research in Chicago, continuing to offer institutional and industry clients the same cogent advice and compelling analysis that has always made her a standout. And with the good times back, she has a lot to say. \b \u001d  Barron's: What's your outlook for steel stocks? \u001d  Applebaum: Over all, our outlook is conservatively upbeat. The weak pockets of the U.S. economy are automotive and housing and they are definitely taking their toll on steel. It's visible. The type of steel that goes into those products, flat-rolled steel, is seeing a decline in demand in those sectors. But a lot of flat-rolled steel also goes into nonresidential uses -- office buildings and hospitals and so on. There is a tremendous amount of capital goods demand right now and we are seeing peak levels of demand -- all-time record demand -- for a lot of different products. Also, there is a market-share shift that is getting lost in the translation. \b \u001d  Q: How's that? \u001d  A: In the U.S., foreign steel can range from 15% to 35% of the market. Now, foreign steel is down to between 15% and 18% of domestic consumption. The difference is made up by domestic companies. The pie might be getting smaller, but then the domestic piece of the pie gets bigger. We are seeing a slower market in the U.S., but the strength of the overseas market is pulling steel out of the U.S. That's creating opportunities for domestic producers to step up. Domestic shipments and domestic demand are looking much stronger going into the second quarter, which is usually the peak period for consumer-durable markets, than they were in the fourth quarter. \b \u001d  Q: Isn't that at odds with U.S. Steel's forecast? \u001d  A: United States Steel [ticker: X] has a couple of issues to contend with. They've had some cost increases. They also have a big tube business [used in drilling oil and gas wells], and that's been weaker than it had been. We've seen an inventory overhang on the tube business for about six months now. It doesn't seem to be abating just yet. Then its European operations have some cost pressures. U.S. Steel's earnings will likely stay flat in the second quarter after they reported a big surprise in the first. The market was looking for $1.85 and we were looking for $1.80; they came out with $2.30 a share. It was a relatively clean number. \b \u001d  Q: So their issues are specific to U.S. Steel and not the steel industry in general? \u001d  A: Yes. We would expect companies like Nucor [NUE] to be up but not by a huge amount. The mini-mills had cost pressures in the month of April because there was an overrun on scrap. That's backed off, so May will be a good month, and June will be a better month for both Nucor and Steel Dynamics [STLD]. Pricing for hot-rolled coil has improved from a low of $5.25 on average early in the first quarter to $5.75 a ton now. There is an awful lot of steel that is sold on contract, and contract prices unilaterally were up for the calendar year. In overview, we are looking for increasing domestic market share and pricing opportunities as steel imports decline and prices are higher offshore. We are seeing record prices for a whole bunch of steel products overseas. \b \u001d  Q: Such as? \u001d  A: Structural and bar steel, for example. They are used to support construction, and they are hitting all-time pricing highs. They are selling out in the U.S. as pressures from imports have all but disappeared. It's ironic, because the industry talks about the impact of imports, particularly from China, and what you don't hear about a lot is the volatility in import prices, and the impact this has on steel buyers and the economy. Import prices are far more volatile than domestic prices. High import prices have put pressure on domestic companies to raise prices. There has been more discipline on raising prices this cycle than we saw in prior years. Nucor is the price leader in long products [like bar, rod and structural items, rather than flat], which are more than half their sales, and they have raised prices but by a lot less than the market could have given them. They are working hard to try to keep construction costs for their customers stable, and so you give them some credit for that. \b \u001d  Q: Hasn't consolidation contributed to pricing strength? \u001d  A: Not in the way you would think. The hidden benefit from consolidation is the operating flexibility that it brings to the integrated mills. An issue in operating a steel mill is the blast furnace. Blast furnaces can be efficiently run in only two ways: on or off. In the 1980s, the domestic industry downsized from about 150 million tons of capacity to 120 millions tons. The smaller, less-efficient blast furnaces were all shuttered permanently, and it left most of the domestic industry with two or three blast furnaces per company. The companies either had to run flat out or run at very inefficient levels. What consolidation has done is: Instead of running on three blast furnaces, where they would have to cut a third of their capacity if they cut anything, they are running on as many as 12 blast furnaces. It offers degrees of freedom, where a company can run at a 92% operating rate or 3%. That's a benefit that is fairly invisible to the investing public. About three decades ago the industry actually had that operating flexibility, but for most of my lifetime it has not. \u001d  The other big change in the industry is Nucor. Nucor is now one of the largest domestic producers of steel. Nucor always had a policy of no layoffs and was historically the low-cost producer, which made it difficult for them to cut production. But they have evolved with the help of a production-oriented compensation scheme with their workers and have shown greater production discipline. Nucor was cutting production in the fourth quarter along with the big integrated mills. It's a real change in how the industry operates. \b \u001d  Q: Do you favor companies that are more vertically integrated and have access to raw materials? \u001d  A: I prefer companies that are more consistently profitable, period. If they are profitable because they do a good job on the raw materials by taking them out of the ground and turning them into steel, more power to them. But if they're more profitable and don't have any raw materials, I'm going to like those companies, too. A good example is Nucor. Nucor is as nonintegrated as a company could get, yet they have, because they are not integrated, a very tight rein on their costs. When Katrina hit and gas prices skyrocketed, very few of the integrated companies had hedges in place. The interesting point is that before the gas-price runup, Nucor's natural-gas cost per ton of steel shipped was only $5, while the integrateds' cost per ton was $35. Nucor was hedged for the next 18 months. The week before Katrina, the average cost of natural gas per ton of steel shipped was $35 for the integrated companies, seven times Nucor's cost, which was only $5. Nucor has had a better focus on controlling costs, and it is true for Steel Dynamics, as well. \b \u001d  Q: Among domestic companies, which do you favor? \u001d  A: Over all, we like the growth prospects for the industry. Everyone is throwing off huge cash flow. Debt's being paid down and pensions are being fully funded. But the opportunities for capital redeployment and the skill sets for the redeployment vary tremendously. Two stocks at the top of my list are Reliance Steel & Aluminum [RS] and Nucor. Both are growth companies masquerading in cyclical clothing. Both have grown their top lines about 20% since 2000. Both have grown their bottom lines significantly more than that. If you hold the debt constant for the next five years, you could easily see both companies funding growth in the 10% to 12% range totally from internal cash flow and earnings per share of a similar amount. Nucor has had a compound average growth rate in excess of 20% every year since 2000. They have just announced a huge acquisition of Harris Steel, which is not a steel company but a buyer and fabricator of steel. It is exciting because it is a different kind of acquisition for Nucor. The company in the past has been reluctant to expand into its customers' business. It's also paid a healthy multiple for Harris. It was over six times cash flow, which might not seem a rich multiple but is compared to the pennies on the dollar acquisitions that they've done historically. \b \u001d  Q: Is this the start of a trend? \u001d  A: I expect to see more growth in the downstream side of the business: metal bending and fabricating and metal buildings. Just take rebar fabrication. The three largest players in that business are roughly 35% of that market. It is a very fragmented market. So there are a lot of opportunities for other significant acquisitions, and that is just one market. Metal buildings would be another; pipe would be another. Distribution, potentially another. Nucor has a unique niche that should allow it to grow through acquisitions. \b \u001d  Q: And the case for Reliance? \u001d  A: Reliance is a steel distributor. They also provide logistics. Reliance grows through acquisitions, and they acquire well-run private companies. They went public in 1994 with just under a half-billion dollars in sales, and this year their sales are projected to reach $7 billion. They've made 40 acquisitions since 1994. They are more profitable than other distributors, and I need to make my spreadsheet columns wider for them because they have double-digit margins and nobody else does. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8573696204d0e0290a2a41c087258997","symR":["WCN"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Chmn MITTELSTAEDT Registers 3,106 Of WASTE CONNECTIONS INC >WCN","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WCN"],"IndustryCodes":["POL","SVC","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: WASTE CONNECTIONS INC \bSYMBOL: WCN \b \b \bFILER: MITTELSTAEDT RONALD J \bTITLE: Chairman of the Board \bBROKER: CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 3,106          DATE REGISTERED: 5/8/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 4/30/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

Western last month said June-quarter profit will be substantially below expectations despite rising revenue, a sure sign that margins are contracting as prices fall. \u001d  A glance at some market data shows, however, that not only are PCs selling better than expected, but the trends that are pressuring prices may also play to Western Digital's laggard approach over the long term. \u001d  The global PC market is \"healthy\" and will likely grow at a stable 11.1% this year over last, says IDC's director of PC research, Loren Loverde. \u001d  Global PC sales rose a better-than-expected 10.1% in the first quarter, faster than the 8.5% forecast, according to PC analyst Mikako Kitagawa with research firm Gartner. \u001d  A good chunk of that came from emerging markets such as Eastern Europe -- just the place one would expect to see cheap trailing-edge technology of the kind Western offers, which can bring down the overall bill of materials for a PC. \u001d  Furthermore, sales growth of notebook computers far outpaces desktops these days as laptops become the new mainstream machine. Laptops probably rose 30% in the first quarter, versus a mere 1% for desktops, says Kitagawa. \u001d  That's good for Western Digital, because it means the priority in computing is to achieve nearly equivalent storage capacity in a 2.5-inch notebook drive as in a 3.5-inch desktop drive, but at the same price \u001d  Such drives require not cutting-edge technology, says John Rydning, head of disk-drive research at IDC, but simply repurposing the same trailing-edge desktop technology. \u001d  Perhaps that's why Western Digital's shipment of notebook drives more than doubled in the March quarter, year over year, to 15% of its total shipments, far faster than the company's overall 30% rise in drive shipments. \u001d  For all its low-tech expertise, Western Digital has been profitable the last five years after running deep losses in the 1990s, and it has been adding cash to its balance sheet every quarter and now has roughly $4 per share in cash and no debt. \u001d  With those steady cash flows, the company could actually be a takeout target for leveraged-buyout shops, opines Citigroup's Mansky. \u001d  To be sure, another concern haunting drive stocks these days is the fear that flash-memory chips, made by Korean giant Samsung, among others, will replace disks. Flash chips are smaller and lighter, and they use less power than disks. \u001d  But flash chips are also 20 times as expensive for equal storage capacity, says Citigroup's Mansky. That means there's no way flash is going to be economical any time soon for all those laptops that have to match desktops in price, especially in emerging markets. \u001d  Another quarter-billion PCs will be sold this year, estimates Loverde, albeit at prices that continue to fall. Someone's got to build and sell drives to fit those prices. Western Digital's low-cost-laggard strategy is the right approach for such economics. \u001d  And as worries about flash chips abate and investors realize disk drives are not going away, the disk-drive maker's stock may cease to be a laggard. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: tiernan.ray@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8f1d89e2ca45bac6025fdf9981581c76","symR":["AHIZQ"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Crt Confirms Allied Joint Reorganization Plan","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T18:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AHIZQ"],"IndustryCodes":["TRK"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DECATUR, Ga., May 12 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Allied Holdings, Inc. announced today that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia yesterday issued a ruling confirming Allied's Joint Plan of Reorganization filed by Allied, affiliates of Yucaipa and by the Teamsters National Automobile Transportation Industry Negotiating Committee. Allied expects its Joint Plan to become effective prior to June 1, once all closing conditions of the plan have been met. As previously announced, at Allied's option, it may convert its current debtor-in-possession credit facility into exit financing, subject to certain conditions. \u001d  After Allied's confirmation hearing yesterday, the Honorable C. Ray Mullins issued his ruling affirming that the Company had met all of the necessary statutory requirements to confirm its Joint Plan of Reorganization and exit from Chapter 11. Judge Mullin's ruling also applies to all of Allied's wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S. that filed for Chapter 11 protection. Each of those subsidiaries is expected to emerge from Chapter 11 alongside Allied prior to June 1. \u001d  Current holders of Allied's common stock, which has recently traded on the Pink Sheets under the symbol \"AHIZQ.PK,\" will not receive any distributions under the Joint Plan of Reorganization. These equity interests will be canceled upon the effectiveness of the Joint Plan and the unsecured creditors of Allied will receive the new common stock to be issued in the reorganization. As set forth in the Joint Plan, these new shares of common stock will be subject to a number of transfer restrictions. Accordingly, the Company urges caution be exercised with respect to investments in its existing equity securities and any of its liabilities and other securities. \b \u001d  About Allied Holdings \b \u001d  Allied Holdings, Inc. is the parent company of several subsidiaries engaged in providing distribution and transportation services of new and used vehicles to the automotive industry.

Economics literature is inconclusive about whether they truly exist. (Do the hedge funds that charge the most become the hardest to get into, or vice versa?) But the market lately has been hinting that high-priced stocks are enjoying an appeal all their own. \u001d  Today, there are probably more stocks with prices above $100 per share than ever before. According to numbers furnished byStandard & Poor's, as of Thursday there were 34 stocks in the S&P 500 priced in the triple-digits. You have to go back to 1999 and before that, 1997, to find as many as 27 stocks priced above $100 at any year's end. \u001d  In a related pattern, the number of stock splits among large companies this year is running at less than half the long-term average. Only six S&P 500 companies have announced stock splits in 2007, well off the 1979-2006 annual average of 59. The last time so few splits occurred: 2003, when legions of stocks had been ground down to mere nubs by the bear market. \u001d  There are a few things driving these phenomena, including mechanical factors. Electronic trading and low-cost commissions have made trading higher-priced stocks less cumbersome and costly than in the past. And retail investors -- who love to see their stocks split, even though it's like changing a $10 bill for two fives -- are a less-active constituency in the markets today. All this aside, it seems higher-priced stocks are more in favor because they confer some corporate prestige, and because they have performed better. \u001d  At Barron's request, the researchers at Bespoke Investment Group put together a portfolio of all S&P 500 stocks that were priced at $100 a share -- or more -- a year ago, and then added to it any stock that attained $100 in subsequent months. The \"$100 club\" portfolio returned 20.6% in the year through Wednesday, versus 15.4% for the overall S&P 500. That's a substantial (if short-term) outperformance for stocks that had already gotten to the century mark before they were \"bought.\" \u001d  The current roster of three-digit stocks features several bellwethers of market health and investor risk appetite, most notably Google (ticker: GOOG), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Among the strongest stocks of the past few years, they may well have invested a bit of cache into the unsplit, high-priced stock. \u001d  The broader high-priced list indicates the way this bull market has transitioned into a momentum phase, where what has worked for the past couple of years continues to attract performance-chasing investment dollars. Energy, real-estate and capital markets stocks are well-represented, as are a couple of cult-of-personality stocks loved largely for their CEOs, like Apple (AAPL) and Sears Holdings (SHLD). \u001d  Most of the rest are part of what might be called the materials-infrastructure-industrial-transport complex, driven by the commodity boom and the emerging-market development frenzy. Take that as a warning, if you like, about the maturity of that particular market theme. \u001d  The leadership of high-priced shares also hints at the advancing maturity of the bull market generally. In 2003, in the initial mad thrust of this bull phase, there was much tut-tutting in the financial press that the hottest stocks were low-priced, \"low quality\" names, ones that had been beaten up in prior years. We've come full circle. \u001d  The similar incidence of $100 stocks today and in 1997 creates another point of resonance between the present environment and the one of a decade ago -- an analogy cited here more than once before. \u001d  The '97 market was, like today's, animated by a favorable supply/demand backdrop for stocks, the broad assumption that globalization offers vast opportunity and little risk, and hot money flushing into emerging markets. The '97 stock market wobbled early in the year, then levitated to repeated new highs into late summer. \u001d  Of course, it was accompanied by collapsing long-term interest rates and a strengthening dollar, both absent this year. And even still, a flutter in the Asian markets dropped the S&P by 11% in 20 days in October 1997 -- thus knocking a number of cloud-skirting stocks back to the double-digits. \u001d  The idea aired here in January that health-care stocks are finally set to perform well is panning out, with large-cap health stocks up 8% in '07, versus the market's 6%. \u001d  Morgan Stanley's Henry McVey is sticking with his bullish stance on health care, based on prospects for forecast-beating results in the second half. He favors Merck (MRK), Abbot Labs (ABT) and St. Jude Medical (STJ), among others. \u001d  One hazard is that the Street has become quite bullish on the sector. Given that, perhaps it's best to avoid the most-loved health stocks with fundamental challenges and punk stock-price action; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Amgen (AMGN) fit that description. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: michael.santoli@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"92b8ea1b39d72d0da1ab7fb7ce681a51","symR":["DOW","US2605431038"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Saudi Aramco and Dow Announce the Signing of the Memorandum of Understanding to Develop One of the Largest Grassroots Plastics and Chemicals Production Complexes in the World","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T10:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DOW","US2605431038"],"IndustryCodes":["CHC","CHM","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"The project will facilitate the development of downstream conversion industries in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \b \b \u001d  DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, May 12 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Saudi Aramco, a fully-integrated, global petroleum enterprise and the world's leading energy supplier, and The Dow Chemical Company, the world's leading science and technology company, providing innovative chemical, plastic and agricultural products and services to consumers around the globe, today announced the signing of a detailed Memorandum of Understanding regarding the construction, ownership and operation of a world-scale chemicals and plastics production complex in Saudi Arabia, named the Ras Tanura Integrated Project.  The parties will now enter the final negotiation phase for the formation of a joint venture company to build, own and operate the facility to be located near Ras Tanura in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province.  The Ras Tanura petrochemical joint venture will be operationally integrated with Saudi Aramco's Ras Tanura Refinery complex and its Ju'aymah gas processing plant, two of the largest facilities of their kind in the world. The latter two facilities will supply feedstock to the joint venture and continue to be owned and operated by Saudi Aramco. \b \u001d  The proposed JV partnership will bring together the world's largest oil company with the world's leading chemicals and plastics producer and marketer. The Ras Tanura integrated complex will produce an extensive and diversified slate of plastics and chemicals and introduce new value chains and performance products to the Kingdom.  When fully operational, the new complex will be one of the largest grassroots plastics and chemicals production facilities in the world and will be ideally positioned to serve major world markets. \b \u001d  \"This project will leverage our largest refining asset and enhance its profitability by capitalizing on the value addition opportunities and synergies existing between refining and petrochemicals,\" said Saudi Aramco President & CEO Abdallah S. Jum'ah. \"The wide range of chemical materials and plastics to be produced by the joint venture will help spawn other downstream chemical conversion industries, thus strengthening the role of the chemical sector as a key enabler of many other future investments in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\" Jum'ah added.  \"The downstream industries to be fed by the materials to be manufactured by the joint venture will assist in further expanding the national economic base while promoting economic diversification and capitalizing on the vast job creation potential of these industries.\" \b \u001d  \"We are extremely pleased to be selected by Saudi Aramco as their joint venture partner to help build the Ras Tanura petrochemical complex.  This joint venture will further strengthen Dow's presence in the Middle East and add to our already vast capabilities worldwide,\" said Dow Chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris.  \"Furthermore, the complex will have a long-term, secure and reliable feedstock position with integration to the adjacent refinery and gas processing plant, while positioning the new enterprise to grow its product sales.\" \b \u001d  The Ras Tanura petrochemical complex will produce a broad range of both basic and performance products, including ethylene, propylene, aromatic and chlorine derivatives.  Initially, the project scope includes world-scale production units for polyethylene, ethylene oxide and glycol, propylene oxide and glycol, chlor-alkali, vinyl chloride monomer, polyurethane components, epoxy resins, polycarbonate, amines and glycol ethers. \b \b    About Dow \b \u001d  Dow is a diversified chemical company that harnesses the power of innovation, science and technology to constantly improve what is essential to human progress.

CBS Radio, a unit of CBS Corp. (CBS),  dismissed broadcasting hall of famer Imus in April for his defamation of the Rutgers women's basketball team. \u001d  The cancellation of the show, nearly three weeks after the show hosts were suspended, was another indication of the increased scrutiny on radio hosts and the heightened management sensitivity to complaints in the wake of the Imus firing. \u001d  \"This is a victory not only for the Asian-American community, but for all communities who find themselves constant targets of racist and sexist programming,\" said Jeanette Wang, an executive with the Organization of Chinese Americans. \u001d  Mateo declined any further comment on the \"JV and Elvis\" show, which had aired on WFNY-FM immediately after the shock jock pairing of Opie and Anthony. \u001d  Gregg \"Opie\" Hughes and Anthony Cumia return to the station's airwaves Monday after issuing their own apology for a segment on their satellite radio program where they laughed as a homeless man fantasized about raping Condoleezza Rice and Laura Bush. \u001d  Vandergrift and Lay made their comments one day after Imus' April 4 meltdown on his nationally syndicated program. The pair broadcast a call to a Chinese restaurant; the caller, in an exaggerated accent, placed an order for \"shrimp flied lice,\" claimed he was a student of kung fu, and compared menu items to employees' body parts. \u001d  The initial airing of the call went unnoticed, but a re-airing of the segment after Imus's firing prompted an outcry from Asian-American groups. Vandergrift and Lay were initially suspended without pay, but Asian-Americans quickly demanded the same penalty applied to the much higher-profile Imus. \u001d  Mateo wouldn't comment on the status of the DJs' contracts or whether they were still on the CBS payroll. Imus plans a $120 million breach of contract suit against CBS Radio. \u001d  As word spread about the fate of JV and Elvis, more than 100 people turned out for a Union Square rally to offer support for those two, Imus and other radio personalities under fire. \u001d  \"It's not about whether you like what you heard or not,\" said Debbie Wolf, president of People Against Censorship. \"I find censorship to be far more offensive than anything that was said.\" \u001d  The Rev. Al Sharpton, who played a major role in Imus' ouster, said Saturday that he wanted to meet with Hughes and Cumia's bosses at XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. (XMSR) over the rape comments on their show. \u001d  \"My personal feeling is they should have already been fired,\" said Sharpton, who one night earlier had debated Imus producer Bernard McGuirk on the Fox News Channel. McGuirk was also fired from WFAN-AM. \u001d  McGuirk called Sharpton a \"race-baiter\" looking for attention when he led the campaign to fire Imus. Sharpton replied that Imus and McGuirk got what they deserved for making racist, sexist comments on the air. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 15:05 ET (19:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9add5c87ab67d21ed33b1b318f87c364","symR":["COSI","CUTR","ETM","GSOL","HPQ","NILE","PFE","US4282361033","US7170811035"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/14) Research Reports: How Analysts Size Up Companies","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["COSI","CUTR","ETM","GSOL","HPQ","NILE","PFE","US4282361033","US7170811035"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","CPR","DRG","ISV","MDV","MED","OTS","RES","RTS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   Edited By Anita Peltonen \u001d  The research reports excerpted here were issued recently by investment firms.

Revenues increased 34% year-over-year to $67.9 million. . . . Particularly strong were sales of high-end diamonds. Based, in part, on management's updated guidance, we've revised our2007 estimate . . . [to] 92 cents per share, versus prior 86-cent estimate. . . . Despite strength, stock appears fully valued . . . it trades at 51.5 times our revised '07 earnings estimate. Raising target to 45 from 34, or 49 times our '07E; reiterate Hold. \b \u001d  Cosi \u001d  -- COSI-NNM \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 4.80 on May 8 \u001d  by Wedbush Morgan \b \u001d  Maintain Buy and 7 target. We continue to believe Cosi [owner, operator and franchiser of 130 cafe units; firm's market-cap, $192 million] has potential to grow units and revenue in excess of 20%, compared to our estimate of 8% industry revenue growth. Our target continues to be based on a 20% discount to the 1.7 times enterprise value/'07 estimated revenue multiple of Cosi's quick-casual peers, reflecting Cosi's relative size and liquidity. \b \u001d  Cutera \u001d  -- CUTR-NNM \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 29.24 on May 8 \u001d  by Lazard Capital Markets \b \u001d  Cutera laser and light-based systems . . . [are used by] dermatologists, surgeons . . . and others practitioners. Cutera preannounced 13% revenue shortfall, but doubt remained about whether problems were affecting Cutera specifically or whole cosmetic-laser industry, [or if they were] nonrecurring. . . . We [don't] expect shortfall to carry through rest of '07. . . . Our new 29 target (prior: 39) is, net of $7 cash, 17.6 times our one-year forward (2Q08-1Q09) earnings-per-share forecast of $1.25, at 1.1 PEG [price-to-earnings-growth], below med-tech mean. \b \u001d  Entercom Communications \u001d  -- ETM-NYSE \b \u001d  Market Perform \u001d  -- Price 27.18 on May 8 \u001d  by Barrington Research \b \u001d  Radio broadcaster ETM [100+ stations in 23 U.S. markets] reported EPS of a 1-cent loss, close to our estimate of 0 cents . . . it included a one-time tax charge, which our estimate reflected. The EPS would have been 9 cents on adjusted basis. . . . M&A activity has been significant, potentially strengthening results in the future but complicating comparisons in current time frame and adding to expense levels . . . there will be an increase in Red Sox sports rights amortized over the months of baseball season.

We believe GSOL is well positioned for . . . positive trends including international-trade growth, adoption of online marketing . . . and [a] strategy to cross-sell services across multiple media platforms. However, a tough industry environment . . . and other emerging companies are key risks. . . . Our target implies 19 times our '08 EPS estimate plus cash. \b \u001d  Hewlett-Packard \u001d  -- HPQ-NYSE \b \u001d  Sell - Price 43.80 on May 8 \u001d  by Think Equity \b \u001d  HPQ preannounced slightly better-than-expected earnings and guidance for the quarter. . . . Personal PC systems were the driver. Note: HPQ only squeezed 1 cent more EPS from $1.4 billion more in revenues -- less than 40% of its current net margin.

Carey \u001d  To enable its listed companies to offer up more of their balance sheets to efficient trading and to enhance fixed-income market liquidity generally, the New York Stock Exchange is relaunching its bond platform this quarter. The upgraded electronic bourse should end at least some of the fragmentation in corporate bond trading, an enormous marketplace that's still mostly off-exchange -- which means retail investors typically buy from and sell to a brokerage's internal inventory. \u001d  Finding out whether you're getting the best available price for a stock trade is easy these days, thanks to the wide availability of real-time quotes. If you want to get the latest quote for, say, General Electric (ticker: GE), you just type the ticker into a quote box. Bond-price quotes, particularly for the many thinly traded names, are considerably more difficult to locate than stocks'. The market's complexity is partly to blame. There is one class of GE stock available in the U.S., but many, many more GE bond issues, all at varying interest rates and maturity dates. \u001d  During June, the NYSE will launch a bond-information site at http://www.nyse.com/bonds that will provide 20-minute delayed bond-price quotes as well as a look at the market for individual bonds. The site will contain listings of all available bonds and give users the ability to search the inventory, based on criteria such as maturity date, coupon, and industry sector. \u001d  What will this mean to individual investors? The NYSE's goal, according to John Holman, vice president and head of fixed income for the exchange, is to open up the bond market, increasing the visibility of pricing and adding liquidity. Holman says that the NYSE is making it simpler for liquidity providers, such as brokerage houses, to link into the platform. \u001d  \"Having centralized information always drives the cost of execution down, which is an advantage to the retail investor,\" adds Holman. \u001d  The new platform started with 1,000 bonds and is adding about 500 new issues every few days with the eventual goal of 5,000 to 6,000. Government bonds will eventually be available. \u001d  Currently, brokers that allow their customers to trade using Townsend Analytic's RealTick platform, including Terra Nova Trading and MasterTrader, can view data and place trades on the NYSE bond platform. Holman says several online brokers, including Fidelity, are currently working on giving their customers access. \"We hope the online discount brokers hook up to us,\" says Holman. \b \u001d  Why We Prefer Barron's \b \u001d  Consumer Reports magazine's newly released ranking of online brokerages is strikingly different than the one Barron's compiled back in March. CR's top-ranked firm, Firstrade, for instance, came in tenth in our comparable category and its runner-up, E*Trade, was sixth in Barron's. \u001d  Some readers have inquired about the differences. Actually, the results aren't so shocking in light of the criteria the two publications use. We're definitely biased, but we happen to like ours better. \u001d  The differences mostly stem from the target audiences. Barron's seeks to address a more sophisticated investor with a more comprehensive array of broker tests. Our online-brokerage client profile is a relatively wealthy individual with at least $100,000 in his or her account who is a moderately active trader and technologically savvy. Consumer Reports' Money Lab's target reader is a \"typical small\" investor who, the service says, \"makes two or three stock trades a month at most\" and \"adds steadily to . . . core mutual-fund holdings.\" \u001d  CR rates only Web-based systems (Barron's also assesses software-based brokers) on trading cost and scope, minimum trade fees, mutual-fund programs, the number of mutual funds available without a transaction fee, banking and asset-management services, the amount of free research and education tools, and customer support. \u001d  Barron's evaluates the trade experience, technology, usability, product selection (with partial credit for items available only via a live broker), research amenities, portfolio analysis and reporting (with an emphasis on tax reporting), the quality of help and means of access, and costs of the Website or software program. \u001d  For Barron's, high-quality trade execution, smart-order routing technology (which finds the best bid or offer), and the absence of internalized orders and reliance on payment for order flow were necessary to earn a high rating. CR's rankings don't consider any of these criteria. \u001d  Another key difference: Our emphasis is on hands-on testing. We get a trading account with each broker, and run the sites and software offerings through a comprehensive script. I'll leave it at that. \u001d  --- \u001d  e-mail: electronicinvestor@yahoo.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a1c24ee4a1e86dd0e85d9b621eb412ab","symR":["GSPBEX.RS","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CORRECT: Russia Imports, Not Exports, Gas From Central Asia","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T14:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GSPBEX.RS","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["CHC","CHM","OIL","PIP","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Russia imports natural gas from Central Asia through a pipeline that has an annual capacity of 60 billion cubic meters. \b \u001d  \"Putin Goes To Central Asia To Secure Russia's Energy Interests,\" published at 0900 GMT, misstated the imports as exports. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 10:25 ET (14:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a64c03ff372a986cec4db0cda08c46c9","symR":["GAS"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP DODGE Registers 30,700 Of NICOR INC >GAS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GAS"],"IndustryCodes":["GAS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: NICOR INC \bSYMBOL: GAS \b \b \bFILER: DODGE DANIEL R \bTITLE: Vice President \bBROKER: CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 30,700         DATE REGISTERED: 5/9/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 5/3/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

It's not just the margin of conservative candidate Nicolas Sarkozy's victory -- an estimated 53% to Socialist Segolene Royal's 47% -- that makes the result so noteworthy. It's the record turnout in both rounds of the election. There seems to be strong popular support for Sarkozy's determination to make the French accept more personal responsibility for the future and rely less on the state. \u001d  Thisis a big departure. The forces of globalization flooding the planet -- from international adoption of market-oriented economic policies, trade liberalization, immigration, and new technology to subdued inflation -- haven't been lived well by France's politicians. \u001d  Most -- including outgoing President Jacques Chirac, who was nominally of the right -- have sought refuge in a sort of market-Leninism. It's characterized by a grudging acceptance of the market and a bewildering confidence in the French state to micro-manage the economy from bureaucrats' offices in Paris, best seen in the 35-hour-work-week law. \u001d  So it will be a small revolution if Sarkozy can implement his program of lowering taxes, a simplifying France's labor code, conditioning unemployment benefits on active job hunting, granting greater autonomy for schools and universities, and applying another dose of pension reform. \u001d  By attacking structural economic weaknesses like these, a Sarkozy government might allow the economy to grow closer to its potential, creating more jobs, and, coupled with modest streamlining of the public sector, reduce government debt and balance the budget after two decades of deficits. \u001d  Nonetheless, cynical interpretations of the result are inevitable. \u001d  First, the power that France has already devolved to Brussels and the constraints of its stretched budget give Sarkozy little room for maneuver. \u001d  Secondly, Sarkozy's no radical. His confidence in market-based solutions didn't preclude backing a government bailout of Alstom and much campaign talk about asserting political control over the European Central Bank. \u001d  And parallels with certain other countries -- many observers would like to think of Sarkozy as France's Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan -- are inappropriate because France is different, and resistent to change. \u001d  But if not a Reagan or a Thatcher -- and France's troubles arguably are less worrying that those faced by the U.S. and the U.K. in the late 1970s -- Sarkozy may yet have the impact of Gerhard Schroeder in Germany or the early years of the Tony Blair government in Britain in triggering a French renaissance. \u001d  And as Sarkozy prepares to fight to get a parliamentary majority to back his presidency, the irony that Blair and Schroeder were leaders of left-wing parties surely can't be lost on France's antediluvian Socialist Party. \u001d  If a report on German radio is true, France's biggest state-controlled enterprise, EdF (ticker: EDF.FRANCE), hasn't wasted much time after the election of the country's new president to approach Berlin about a plan to tie up with German rival RWE (RWE.GERMANY). \u001d  Leaving aside the compelling industrial and political logic behind the creation of a Gazprom-rivaling, 159 billion euros European energy behemoth, but not forgetting the antitrust obstacles, this is a deal that won't get done unless Berlin and Paris see eye to eye on European energy policy. \u001d  So an EdF-RWE partnership might yet be some way off. \u001d  But the carefully worded denials from the two companies are unlikely to puncture speculation that something is afoot. The circumstantial evidence pointing toward a merger of this scale and at this juncture looks compelling. Politically vetted cross-border industrial mergers in Europe's energy sector is in vogue. \u001d  Look at Enel's (ENEL.ITALY) successful tilt at Endesa (ELE.SPAIN) with the overt backing of the governments in Rome and Madrid, which stymied E.On's (EDA.GERMANY) takeover bid for the Spanish utility. \u001d  French President Sarkozy was slated to meet German counterpart Angela Merkel over the weekend. It would hardly be a surprise if energy policy was high on their agenda. After all, it's the financial and technological challenge of meeting the EU's future energy needs while protecting the environment that ultimately is driving consolidation in the sector. That and the EU Commission's determination to promote competition to keep prices low. \u001d  As for Sarkozy, the prospect of taking on the two biggest taboos for the ferociously left-wing trade unions in France's energy sector -- full privatization of EdF and ending their workers' preferential pension benefits -- no doubt appeals. Sarkozy has said he's open to the idea of the state reducing its stake in EdF, which a share offer for RWE would entail. \u001d  Increasing the number of years that employees at state-controlled enterprises like EdF have to work to qualify for retirement benefits, bringing them in line with the rest of the country, is one of Sarkozy's top reform pledges. \u001d  Finally, it seems clear that with Sarkozy in the Elysee Palace, France is headed for a period of more muscular policy toward industry, which may go beyond the protection of so-called national champions that in recent years has been the focus of government attention. \u001d  Given its market capitalization and ability to generate free cash flow, mining and metals giant Rio Tinto (RIO.UK) shouldn't be the subject of takeover speculation. Yet the Anglo-Australian-listed copper and iron company had to deny speculation about a bid from BHP Billiton (BHP.AUSTRALIA) after its shares jumped over 10% last Wednesday. \u001d  True, a BHP-Rio Tinto deal makes sense industrially because it would diversify BHP's asset base and geographic presence. And BHP would be picking up Rio Tinto's stock on the cheap; it has been trading at a forward price-earnings multiple of less than 10, its lowest levels in 10 years. That's a 33% discount to Anglo American (AAL.UK) and 8% to BHP's Australian-listed shares. \u001d  The reason behind the discount isn't hard to find. Rio Tinto has proved conservative on making acquisitions, creating the impression it's missing out on growth opportunities. But the company has a relatively easy way to fix investors' poor perceptions of its prospects. \u001d  Management should take a closer look at various partnership projects and buy out minority shareholders. Rio Tinto owns 53% in Robe River Mines; Mitsui owns the rest. The present value of Rio's share in Bunet is estimated at $3.7 billion. It has majority ownership in coal assets with a combined net present value of nearly $3 billion. The combined value of all assets also owned by minority investors is well over $10 billion. \u001d  Buying them out would let Rio Tinto book all their operating income, some of which is growing faster than rest of the company's. It would improve the quality of Rio Tinto's earnings and offer the prospect of fatter dividends and bigger buybacks for investors. And management would show it does have an alternative to to sitting on its hands. \u001d  --- \u001d  MATTHEW CURTIN and ARINDAM NAG are contributors to The Skeptic, a Dow Jones Newswires column on which the European Trader is based \u001d  --- \b                   DOW JONES GLOBAL INDEXES \b \b Region/ \b Country \b  DJ Global          DJ Global          DJ Global     Point \b   Indexes,           Indexes,           Indexes,      Chg.    % Chg. \bLocal Curr.

Racanelli \u001d  The ascendance of capitalism across the globe has rewritten the rules in nearly every industry and spurred explosive growth in international trade. The biggest beneficiaries of these twin trends, from New York to London to Mumbai and Beijing, are allocators of capital and commodities, and the companies that supply them. Small wonder, then, that investment banks, asset managers and producers of oil, metals and steel scored best in the latest Barron's 500 survey, a unique ranking of U.S. and Canadian companies based on cash-flow returns on investment. This year top honors go to investment-banking powerhouse Goldman Sachs (ticker: GS), last year's runner-up, which nabbed a perfect grade of 4.0, nosing out No. 2-ranked Franklin Resources (BEN). The mutual-fund firm also earned a 4.0 but received a lower grade in one of the key measures by which the companies are ranked. The bronze went to Apple (AAPL), while Terex (TEX), a maker of cranes and giant trucks, took fourth place, and Paccar (PCAR), another truck maker, fifth. The Holt division of Credit Suisse crunches the numbers for Barron's, comparing companies on the basis of one- and three-year cash-flow returns, sales growth and stock-price performance. Our ranking illuminates which companies consistently generate strong and growing sales and cash flow -- the very things that lead, over time, to higher earnings and rising stock prices. The shares of all our top five winners are near 52-week highs. \u001d  The Barron's 500 rankings do not reflect the views of Credit Suisse analysts. \u001d  While this year's leaders owe their gains to a booming global economy, there are notable differences, too. Their price-earnings ratios, for one, range from a low of 11 for Goldman to a high of 30 for Apple, whose iPod franchise transformed the computer maker into a fast-growing company with a rich stock. \u001d  Last year's winner, Lehman Brothers (LEH), slid to 25th place this year, done in by a flat stock price. Noteworthy improvements, in contrast, were made by Aetna (AET), Microsoft (MSFT) and Health Net (HNT), all of which rose sharply in the latest ranking. \u001d  As for losers, an eclectic mix of construction, tech and auto companies came up short this year. BlueLinx Holdings (BXC), an Atlanta-based building-materials supplier, was hurt by the downturn in housing and placed last at No. 500.  The company recently reported a first-quarter loss of a penny a share on a 30.5% drop in revenue, to $957.1 million, but said its end-user markets, though weak, appear \"stable.\" In an e-mail, CEO Stephen Macadam said: \"We believe we are managing our business well in this environment, appropriately removing costs while continuing to invest in and execute our long-term growth strategy.\" \u001d  Other noteworthy laggards include Computer Sciences (CSC), Eastman Kodak (EK), Ford Motor (F) and Pulte Homes (PHM), which fell to 480 from last year's 62. Don't ignore the losers, however; many have become turnaround plays and buyout targets. Previous cellar-dwellers such as Maxtor and Clear Channel Communications (CCU) received takeover offers. \u001d  No ranking can tell a company's whole story; it's best used as a jumping-off point for future research. The Barron's 500 aims to identify companies that make the most of their invested capital and perform best for investors. Here's a closer look at the 2007 winners. \b \u001d  Goldman Sachs Group \u001d  There is an undeniable mystique to this globe-girdling financial firm, found perennially atop investment-bank league tables. Mystique goes only so far, however. The secret to Goldman's success is a more prosaic combination of hard work, business acumen and teamwork, all integral to a corporate culture that knows big rewards don't come without taking calculated risks. \u001d  \"People and culture is what drives everything,\" says Chief Financial Officer David Viniar. \"We have no inventory. No factories.\" \u001d  That culture has survived market crises and management transitions, including former Chairman Henry Paulson's departure in 2006 to become Secretary of the Treasury. He was succeeded as chairman and CEO by Lloyd Blankfein. \u001d  With its three divisions -- investment banking, trading and principal investments, and asset management -- \"Goldman Sachs is in the sweet spot in the growth of global capitalism,\" says Rick Wetmore, a portfolio manager at Turner Investment Partners, which owns Goldman stock. \"And it is at the heart of the proliferation of private equity moving into public markets.\" \u001d  Goldman placed heavy emphasis on China early on, building important relationships with corporate and government leaders that are paying off now, Wetmore adds. Last year, Goldman bought just under 5% of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398.CHINA), before the bank's initial public offering. ICBC has been racking up robust results -- 2006 profits rose 31% --and has been a nice contributor to Goldman's revenue, says Wetmore. \u001d  ICBC gives Goldman a big leg up in China, where it is the best positioned global investment bank. \"We've been in China a long time, with the first significant investment way back in 1994,\" says Viniar. \u001d  The New York firm's legendary trading prowess is another cash-flow generator, notes James Huguet, president of Great Companies, a money manager that holds Goldman shares for clients. Goldman typically doesn't pull back the veil to reveal how its traders make their money, which probably adds to its mystique. There is a certain amount of faith on the part of investors in the firm's ability to trade, \"but they have proven to be the best at it,\" Huguet says, citing Goldman's avoidance, most recently, of the subprime-mortgage mess. \u001d  \"We think we are the employer of choice,\" says Viniar, who also notes that \"Goldman has the willingness to stick with our investments.\" \u001d  China isn't the only example. Goldman made a long-term commitment to commodities trading in 1981, when it picked up J. Aron, a commodities broker and Blankfein's then-employer. \u001d  Though Goldman's stock has rallied more than 30% in the past year, to 226, it trades below the market multiple at 10.6 times fiscal 2007 consensus estimates of $21.43 a share. In the fiscal first quarter ended February, net revenue jumped 22% from the year-earlier period, while earnings per share rose 31%. Return on equity was 38%. \u001d  Goldman's discount owes in part to the company's market sensitivity, and the relative opacity of its trading division. But the P/E could expand to 13 if return on equity remains in the the high-20% to low-30% range, Wetmore says. \u001d  What could knock Goldman from its rarified perch? A sharp or prolonged downturn in the global economy could hurt the company's business. Similarly, a single nasty trading quarter could send investors fleeing its shares. Then again, a nasty selloff probably would serve to make Goldman more attractive. \b \u001d  Franklin Resources \u001d  Our runner-up by a nose has nothing to hide. Like Goldman, this giant asset manager is reaping the rewards of global growth and capitalizing on industry changes. \u001d  Merrill Lynch analyst Cynthia Mayer notes that the strength of equity and bond markets in the past four years has attracted funds to money managers like Franklin, raising assets under management and fund-manager fees. Moreover, the money-management business is characterized by relatively high operating margins of around 30%, she says. \u001d  San Mateo, Calif.-based Franklin has additional aces up its sleeve. Through its Templeton Funds subsidiary, it has significant exposure to overseas markets at a time when many investors are clamoring for foreign stocks. In April, assets under management in Franklin's global/international equity funds rose nearly 20% year to year, to about $262 billion, while total assets also increased by 20%, to $600 billion. \u001d  Franklin's income series funds have been attracting U.S. baby boomers who are nearing retirement and looking for income-generating products, notes Shannon Reid, manager of the Evergreen Strategic Growth Fund (ESGAX). In general, Franklin has a well-recognized franchise among financial planners and gets \"a lot of shelf space\" from distributors, Reid says. Evergreen owns Franklin shares. \u001d  According to Franklin CEO Greg Johnson, the company's investments around the world in the past three to five years, such as a sales and investment office in India catering to local customers, are starting to pay off. \"Today our funds are sold in 100 countries,\" he says. \u001d  Forty percent of Franklin's recent gross sales are international, compared with 25% five years ago, and 30% of assets under management come from overseas clients, versus 16% previously. \u001d  Franklin's shares have risen about 40%, to 135, in the past 12 months and trade for about 20 times 2007 consensus earnings estimates of $6.91 a share for the fiscal year ending September. Last year, the company earned $5.44, up 31%. Reid has \"trimmed a bit\" of his holding but remains an investor for the longer term. \b \u001d  Apple \u001d  The near-ubiquitous iPod MP3 portable music player has redefined Apple -- and the way we listen to music. Sales could reach 50 million units this year, up from just one million in 2003, and drive further gains in cash flow and earnings for Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple. \u001d  Another plus, to shareholders like Kevin Landis, manager of the Firsthand Technology Leaders Fund (TLFQX), is that Apple is asset-light. \u001d  \"It is a dominant consumer-electronics brand, without any manufacturing of its own,\" Landis says. \u001d  Not having cash invested in factories and machinery is \"a wise use of capital,\" Landis adds. Instead, Apple focuses on the intellectual property behind its products. \u001d  For all the attention on the iPod franchise, the company's incremental growth rests with other products, such as the soon-to-be released iPhone and the Macintosh personal computer, which continued an impressive comeback in the second fiscal quarter, ended March. MAC sales of 1.5 million were up 36% from the same quarter in fiscal 2006. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bb53601480e6bd99168422714f6ea96c","symR":["VPRT"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder WINDOW TO WALL STREET INC Registers 100,000 Of VISTAPRINT LTD >VPRT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VPRT"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC","XDJGI","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: VISTAPRINT LTD \bSYMBOL: VPRT \b \b \bFILER: WINDOW TO WALL STREET INC \bTITLE: Affiliated Person \bBROKER: GOLDMAN SACHS & CO \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 100,000        DATE REGISTERED: 5/8/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 5/2/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

But when you sit down and map the universe and say, OK, they've got $7 billion in sales, so how big is the distribution market and how much can they acquire? The total distribution market in the U.S. for all types of metals is $130 billion. The top dozen players are less than 50% of that. It is still a very fragmented market, with lots of opportunities for growth for a company like Reliance. There has also been talk the last two years about mills and service centers [which process steel and then resell it in a revised form] getting together and integrating. \b \u001d  Q: What do you think of that? \u001d  A: I think there would be a lot of pluses. If you could align the two in some way, the industry would be a lot more efficient, more customer-friendly with less volatile pricing. However, to get from here to there might be difficult, because if a mill suddenly bought a service center, the other service-center customers would run away. While the long-run answer is a good one, getting there is difficult. Layer on that the situation with Ryerson [RYI], a competitor to Reliance, where the private-equity firm Harbert Management is stirring things up because Ryerson has not lived up to its potential for an awfully long time. The trade press also says Arcelor Mittal Steel [MT] is looking at Ryerson so there is an end game. If those two were to join up, it might make others consider a relationship. If you go back 25 years, most of the mills owned their distribution. \b \u001d  Q: How is Reliance valued compared with its peers? \u001d  A: It is at seven times Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization], about average compared to the peer group. Both Nucor and Reliance are trading at a little over 10 times their '07 earnings estimates. Nucor is at two-thirds the market multiple with a demonstrated growth rate the last five years in the 20% range. It has no debt and pays out $1 billion a year to shareholders in dividends and buybacks, and yet the stock is at 10 1/2 times. We know that growth in steel-making assets is gone, there are none. The store is empty. What people don't understand is that the downstream growth at Nucor is sustainable at a reasonable price. \u001d  The market has to get a little smarter and understand what is unique about Nucor. And it is not only Nucor. Steel Dynamics has a lot of the same characteristics. It's cheaper on an enterprise value [market value plus net debt]-to-Ebitda basis but about the same on a multiple-of-earnings basis. It is also one of the lowest-cost producers. \b \u001d  Q: So you are focused on capital redeployment and growth? \u001d  A: Yes, steel companies that can grow: It's not a bizarre topic, it's a viable topic. There are growth stocks in this sector and they should get premium multiples for the growth. Maybe market multiples. But at 10 times, they are pretty far away from that. \b \u001d  Q: Other companies obviously recognize the value. \u001d  A: What is disturbing is the increasing amount of European interest. \b \u001d  Q: Why? \u001d  A: Because typically their return requirements are lower than ours, and it makes it a lot more difficult to compete if you are looking at the same assets. Having said that, there are still lots of strategic combinations that have not happened yet. \u001d  There are two primary global themes in M&A in the steel industry. One involves the BRICs, ex-China, or BRIs -- Brazil, Russia and India are very rich with raw materials and they traditionally have been focused on the upstream side of the business. But they now are looking for downstream processors of their raw materials. So some of these transactions, like Russia's Evraz [EVR.UK] buying Oregon Steel, India's Tata Steel [TATA.INDIA] buying Corus and CSN's [SID] unsuccessful attempt to buy Wheeling-Pittsburgh [WPSC], are about going downstream. \u001d  The other theme, which has been less prevalent but is going to get bigger, is about Europe and Japan looking for exposure to high-value-added markets. There is increasing pressure on the Japanese companies in particular to expand their participation in the U.S. I could see Japanese or European interest in a company like AK Steel [AKS]. What makes AK Steel unique is that they are the buyers of the semi-finished steel made in Russia, Brazil and India, and they have one of the best consumer-durable franchises in this country While it would be a great fit for U.S. Steel, AK Steel's valuation is relatively rich for them. AK Steel would be worth more to a Japanese or European company, which would pay more to get into the automotive market in the U.S. \b \u001d  Q: What about reports that Arcelor Mittal is interested? \u001d  A: The notion of a Mittal bid for AK Steel is not credible. Mittal already is the largest player in many of AK Steel's key markets, and there most probably would be anti-trust issues. Far more compelling, in our view, would be interest by ThyssenKrupp (TKA.GERMANY], CSN or any of the Japanese steelmakers that are increasingly looking to follow their automotive customers into the domestic market. \b \u001d  Q: Thanks, Michelle. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"cfcc8b4432d9704a78e48dd160eaccb0","symR":["CBSS"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder GESSLER Registers 3,003 Of COMPASS BANCSHARES INC >CBSS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBSS"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: COMPASS BANCSHARES INC \bSYMBOL: CBSS \b \b \bFILER: GESSLER SARAH WESTBROOK \bTITLE: Shareholder \bBROKER: CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 3,003          DATE REGISTERED: 5/8/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 4/27/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

Upadhaya. \u001d  \"No harm has come to them, but they are being examined by doctors,\" Upadhaya told The Associated Press by telephone. \u001d  Three Posco officials had traveled to the village of Gobindapur to meet with farmers about acquiring land when they were kidnapped. One of the three officials, a woman, was released soon after being taken hostage, but the two others were kept for 10 hours. \u001d  Abhay Sahu, the president of an activist group dedicated to fighting the Posco project, had said the hostages would not be released until the company pledged not to develop the site, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. But they were released after the villagers received assurances from Posco that they would not enter their village, PTI quoted Sahu as saying. \u001d  Posco officials could not immediately be reached for comment. \u001d  Posco's steel plant - which would be the largest single foreign investment in India - was approved by the Indian government last year as a special economic zone, making it eligible for tax breaks and exempt from some government duties. \u001d  Posco has said it will invest about $10.8 billion to build the plant and develop the area. \u001d  Many residents are strongly opposed to the project because they say it would require the displacement of about 20,000 people. \u001d  Police said the Posco officials had been warned by residents not to enter their villages without permission, but the three did not heed the warning. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d802d828b070d949a4b5b445a61320fe","symR":["ESRX"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder IGNACZAK Registers 9,558 Of EXPRESS SCRIPTS INC >ESRX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ESRX"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: EXPRESS SCRIPTS INC \bSYMBOL: ESRX \b \b \bFILER: IGNACZAK MARY ANN \bTITLE: Shareholder \bBROKER: AG EDWARDS & SONS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 9,558          DATE REGISTERED: 5/8/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 5/2/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

The company is carrying out an effective turnaround and the stock is attractively priced, trading at just 12 times estimated earnings for the year ahead. \u001d  An Alcan deal would give the combined company a 30% share of the world's aluminum market and pave the way for some big cost savings. \u001d  While the stock, did little between our 2005 story and early this year, it jumped 10% in February on rumors Aloca itself may become a target. And it climbed 8% this week after the Alcan bid, to 38, near a 52-week high. Frank's Buckingham sees the stock headed to as high as 73 over the next three to five years. \u001d  One Alcoa shareholder, hedge fund Jana Partners wants the company to withdraw the bid and put itself on the auction block. Jana has cited Alcoa's \"long history of failing to generate shareholder value through acquisitions.\" A sale, of course, could help the stock, too. \u001d  Barron's bullishness on Alcan already has paid off.

(6764.TO) said Saturday it will strengthen its product quality control and hinted its solar and battery operations will be a major focus this fiscal year. \u001d  Under a new management policy for the current fiscal period through March 2008, the Osaka-based electronics maker said it will establish a division to monitor customer satisfaction and product quality. Sanyo also said it will focus on \"environmental- and energy-related solutions.\" \u001d  The company said President Seiichiro Sano presented the new policy to company managers and executives throughout Japan on Saturday afternoon. It marked Sano's first major presentation to his company since taking over from predecessor Toshimasa Iue in April. \u001d  A company spokesman said Sano would present a new mid-term \"master plan\" for the company toward the end of this year. \u001d  Sanyo forecasts it had a group net loss of Y50 billion in the fiscal year ended March. It is struggling to recover its finances under the watchful eye of a group investors led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who last year invested $2.6 billion to bail out the company. \u001d  The company faces questions about its product quality, with recalls of its laptop and mobile phone batteries over the past six months. \u001d  In addition, analysts say it must focus more on its mainline battery and promising solar panel operations to regain profitability. The company currently makes a wide assortment of products, from washing machines to mobile phones. \u001d  Earlier this week, General Electric Co.'s (GE) Japanese unit said it had succeeded in its bid to take over Sanyo Electric Credit Co.

It will use the data in formulating plans to reduce energy consumption at these factories next fiscal year and beyond.  For example, it will replace compressors used in air conditioning systems, as well as boilers, with more energy-efficient ones. \u001d  The company will aim to obtain under the U.N.'s Clean Development Mechanism greenhouse gas emissions credits equivalent to the CO2 reduction volume achieved through its efforts in China. \u001d  In March, the U.N. approved energy-saving measures Matsushita proposed implementing at its 10 Malaysian factories as worthy of CDM recognition, and the company started implementing the steps in April, aiming to secure 8,100 tons worth of emissions credits annually over the next 10 years. \u001d  Denso Corp.

It hopes to obtain 200 tons worth of emissions rights annually by improving a system involving compressed air. \u001d  Japanese companies have so far gained emissions credits in China and other Asian countries by, for example, helping local partners produce electric power using such natural energy sources as wind and solar power, as well as biomass.  The Japanese government has approved 161 such projects so far, helping reduce an equivalent of 77.76 million tons in CO2 emissions annually in these countries. \u001d  But such projects appear to have reached a limit in these countries, prompting Japanese firms to seek new ways to obtain emissions credits there. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 12:39 ET (16:39 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"ef4b205d2d5da75759e3450199cc11c1","symR":["KMT"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP MORRISON Registers 5,300 Of KENNAMETAL INC >KMT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KMT"],"IndustryCodes":["IDD","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: KENNAMETAL INC \bSYMBOL: KMT \b \b \bFILER: MORRISON JAMES E \bTITLE: Vice President \bBROKER: CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 5,300          DATE REGISTERED: 5/8/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 4/27/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

Prime Minister Tony Blair told lawmakers that continuing the Serious Fraud Office investigation \"would do enormous damage to our relationship with Saudi Arabia,\" which, he said, was strategically important. \u001d  The SFO had been investigating allegations that BAE ran a GBP60 million \"slush fund\" offering sweeteners to Saudi officials, reportedly via Swiss bank accounts, in return for lucrative contracts as part of the Al-Yamamah arms deal in the 1980s. \u001d  Al-Yamamah, meaning \"the dove,\" was the name given to an agreement under which BAE supplied Tornado fighter jets and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia. The full extent of the deal, which Saudi Arabia paid for by supplying the U.K. government - BAE's largest shareholder - with oil, was never revealed. However, it was widely believed to be the U.K.'s largest-ever export agreement. \u001d  Blair's decision to call off the SFO probe earned a complaint from the U.S. government and a strong rebuke in January from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which questioned whether the move conformed to the group's commitment to combat corruption. Britain is a member of the Paris-based OECD. \u001d  An OECD working group on bribery - led by Swiss jurist Mark Pieth - said in March it would continue to examine closely Britain's anti-corruption efforts. \u001d  The following month Britain's Guardian newspaper reported that London was exerting pressure on the OECD to have Pieth removed from his post to prevent further criticism of the conduct of government ministers and BAE in the affair. \u001d  The SFO in June last year asked Switzerland for legal assistance in its probe of the Saudi deal. The request was put on hold after the British government called off the probe, but never formally withdrawn. \u001d  Balmer said separate requests from the SFO for legal assistance into possible BAE bribes to Tanzania, Romania, Chile and the Czech Republic were also still being considered. She said prosecutors had yet to decide whether to pass on bank documents relating to these cases to British authorities. \u001d  The Czech case has caused concern in Sweden because it relates to a deal - later canceled - to sell 14 Gripen fighter jets to the Czech Republic as part of a joint venture between BAE and Sweden's Saab. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 10:17 ET (14:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f82066fe07b36e2bfde59c72f47e64d9","symR":["BP","BP.LN","GRAMONC1.VL","PBR","PETR4.BR","RDSA","RDSA.LN","RDSB","RDSB.LN","REP","REP.MC","BRPETRACNPR6","ES0173516115","GB0007980591","GB00B03MLX29","GB00B03MM408","PEP736581005"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Bolivia's Morales Vows To Proceed With Energy Nationalization","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T20:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BP","BP.LN","GRAMONC1.VL","PBR","PETR4.BR","RDSA","RDSA.LN","RDSB","RDSB.LN","REP","REP.MC","BRPETRACNPR6","ES0173516115","GB0007980591","GB00B03MLX29","GB00B03MM408","PEP736581005"],"IndustryCodes":["CON","OIL","XAEX","XDJGI","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XIBEX","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP)--Bolivian President Evo Morales vowed to move forward with his campaign to nationalize Bolivia's oil and gas industry while presiding Saturday over ceremonies marking the transfer of two Brazilian-owned oil refineries to state hands. \u001d  Bolivia this week agreed to buy back formerly state-owned refineries from Brazilian state energy company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR), or Petrobras, for $112 million. \u001d  On Friday, the government announced it would negotiate the purchase of a majority share in the Bolivian operations of four more foreign companies, as dictated by Morales' nationalization decree last year. \u001d  \"We have not yet finished the job,\" Morales told a flag-waving crowd at the Guillermo Elder Bell refinery near the eastern city of Santa Cruz. \"There is still work to do.\" \u001d  Morales was expected to attend a similar ceremony later at the Gualberto Villaroel refinery near Cochabamba. \u001d  The four businesses to be targeted are: pipeline company Transredes, part owned by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA); the gas exploration company Chaco, owned by the British company BP (BP); gas exploration company Andina, subsidiary of the Spanish-Argentine company Repsol YPF (REP); and the Hydrocarbons Logistics Company of Bolivia, jointly owned by the German company Oiltanking GmbH and the Peruvian company Grana y Montero SA (GRAMONC1.VL). \u001d  Morales ordered the nationalization of Bolivia's oil and gas industry in a surprise decree on May 1, 2006. After six months of tense negotiations, the foreign companies were allowed to remain in the country but agreed to sell a controlling interest in their Bolivian operations to the state. \u001d  The foreign companies also agreed to pay higher taxes and royalties on their Bolivian earnings. South America's poorest country has since seen its petroleum revenues double to $1.3 billion in 2006 from $608 million in 2005, according to government figures. \u001d  But analysts worry that exerting too much state control could scare off the long-term foreign investment needed for the industry to grow. \u001d  On Saturday, Morales also reiterated his recent criticisms of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID, a World Bank-sponsored arbitration court many companies turn to when fighting local government claims against their international investments. \u001d  Morales announced Bolivia's withdrawal from the ICSID last month, and foreign companies will only be able to present claims against Bolivia for the next six months. \u001d  Morales has said he believes the ICSID is biased toward transnational corporations, and has called for a global campaign to \"eradicate\" the court. \u001d  \"Now is the time for us to mobilize and say 'no' those institutions that only allow the looting of the people, the looting of nations, and the looting of our natural resources,\" Morales said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 12, 2007 16:29 ET (20:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fae93fbc9e5970d3b08a7a7a07888cf6","symR":["GVA"],"date":"2007-05-12","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Officer ROBERTS Registers 6,947 Of GRANITE CONSTRUCTION INC >GVA","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-12T04:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GVA"],"IndustryCodes":["CON","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: GRANITE CONSTRUCTION INC \bSYMBOL: GVA \b \b \bFILER: ROBERTS JAMES HILDEBRAND \bTITLE: Officer and Beneficial Owner \bBROKER: CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 6,947          DATE REGISTERED: 5/8/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 4/30/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.
