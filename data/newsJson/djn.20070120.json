Lord, the economy is going to grow at 2.5%. The business has got to turn around. Other truckers sell for 11-13 times earnings. YRC gets a 14% return on equity. It pays no dividend, though it could look to do so within the next 12 months. That would make it a 10% grower with a 1.5% yield, or something like that. They have economies of scale that nobody else has. They have 60% of the long-haul, less-than-truckload market, and 1,000 terminals. You import goods from abroad, and you've got to distribute them around the country. \u001d  Gabelli: Play that again, John. Why do you think a 9% decline in November was just an aberration? \u001d  Neff: I can't explain it precisely, Mario. Somebody in Massachussetts declared inventories too high, so they didn't move more stuff into the market. I only know it explains the problem with earnings. If they move more freight next year at, say, 3% or 3.5%, YRC is going to participate. \u001d  Witmer: What was the trend in trucking tonnage year-to-date through November? I'm trying to normalize the number. Maybe they shipped too much early on in the year. \u001d  Hickey: It has been dropping. It was down 4% in October, and 8.8% in November. \u001d  Faber: Year-to-date for 2006, tonnage is down 2.8% relative to 2005. \u001d  Cohen: The data from the U.S. government show a couple of interesting trends. First, a lot of the movement in the inventory-to-sales ratio has been related to the transportation sector -- that is, transportation equipment being shipped or not being shipped. That tends to move the numbers around a lot, because these are big, expensive items like airplanes. Second, the new-orders-to-shipments ratio, a more arcane number in the same release, has been moving higher and higher, so the orders are out there. \b \u001d  Barron's: Is that ratio just for trucking? \u001d  Cohen: No. Transportation equipment helps explain some of the lumpiness in the I/S ratio, but the unfilled orders-to-shipments data apply to the overall economy. \u001d  Neff: One of the knocks on YRC has been that it's unionized. There used to be quite a spread in wage levels between union and nonunion truckers, but it has narrowed considerably. It's hard to find truck drivers, particularly cross-country drivers. You have to pay up for them. \u001d  My last stock is an old favorite, Citigroup [C]. The stock had an overdue move last year. I was having a bad year and it bailed me out. Citi had a big meeting recently and swore that non-interest expense would rise less than revenue this year. There are all kinds of economies of scale at this company. They don't have a big branch system in the U.S., but a big hunk of the credit-card business, which is somewhat the same. Within the last few years they bought the credit-card businesses of Sears, Home Depot and Federated Department Stores. You crank all that into the existing infrastructure and you make out on the bottom line. Some people say the company should split itself up or spin off components, but then it would lose these economies of scale, including in investment banking. Their investment-banking operations are all over the world. \u001d  Cohen: Does their credit-card business have any exposure to sub-prime loans? \u001d  Neff: Very little. They are pretty careful. The stock is 54.77. I've got them earning $4.75 a share for 2007. The stock is trading for 11 times earnings, twice the multiple of my other picks. But Citi is a solid 10%-12% grower. It has 3.6% yield. They meet in a couple of weeks, and I think they'll raise the dividend from 49 cents to 54 cents a share, which would lift the yield to 4%. [Friday Citigroup announced it will indeed hike its dividend to 54 cents.] \b \u001d  Barron's: What are you looking for on the stock? \u001d  Neff: Long-term it should trade at a market multiple, but I would settle for 13 times earnings in the next year. Thirteen times $4.75 would be around 62. That's not super upside, but the stock could be up 11%-12%. Last year Citi was up 14.8% \u001d  The company has a double-A credit rating. It paid cash for all its acquisitions in recent years yet hasn't destroyed that rating. Just in the last three months Citi bought 20% of the most significant bank in Turkey, and 20% of a troubled bank in China. Their market capitalization is $265 billion. \b \u001d  Barron's: Sounds good.

Manor Care (ticker: HCR) came through the right-sizing of the industry unscathed and now falls squarely in the latter camp. \u001d  In the past 10 years, the Toledo, Ohio, company has moved aggressively from offering just long-term care to also providing intensive shorter-term rehabilitation for people recovering from strokes, heart attacks and other conditions. Indeed, the average stay at a Manor Care facility, which go under such names as Heartland and ManorCare Health Services, has shrunk to 90 days, from the two years of 20 years ago. And the shorter stays are far more profitable, commanding double the daily bed rates of conventional nursing-home care. \u001d  The company, with a stock-market value of $3.7 billion, also has a fast-growing hospice and home health-care operations, outpatient rehab therapy and assisted living facilities for patients with Alzheimer's and dementia. In all, it operates more than 500 facilities across the country, most of which it owns. \u001d  Manor Care's stock, however, hasn't kept pace with all the improvements. Though the company is an acknowledged leader, its shares, at about 50, have been changing hands at 18.5 times estimated earnings for this year -- lower than the multiples of most rivals. While the stock popped last Tuesday on excitement about a premium-priced buyout plan of a similar company, Genesis HealthCare (GHCI), it's still 6% off its 52-week high, set in August. \u001d  Jim Lane, a portfolio manager at Tripoint Asset Management, a Boston-based hedge fund, figures earnings per share are growing at 15% a year, thanks to brisk sales gains, solid operating leverage and share repurchases. And with an ample free-cash-flow yield of 4.5%, the company could boost its dividend and continue buying back shares, he says. Manor Care repurchased 14% of its stock in the past year. \u001d  \"If I can buy a 15% EPS-growth company at a cash-flow yield that's in parity with the 10-year Treasury, it's pretty attractive,\" says Lane, whose fund has been buying shares at recent prices. \u001d  He sees the stock heading to $65 within 18 months, adding that the value of its extensive real-estate holdings should limit the downside. \u001d  There's no mystery to Manor Care's new emphasis on shorter-stay patients. While a traditional nursing-home patient might pay $200 a day, the norm for the more intensive rehab patients is closer to $400. \u001d  \"Our strategy is to increase cash flow per bed,\" Manor Care Chairman and CEO Paul Ormond told Barron's. While 39% of Manor Care's approximately $3.6 billion in revenue comes from intensive rehab or patients needing complex medical care, Ormond sees that higher-margin work accounting for more than half the company's business in less than five years. Hospice care, now about 15%, will dominate the other half of the company, while traditional skilled nursing, now near 50%, will fall to about one-quarter of the company's revenues, Ormond figures. \u001d  With demand growing for the newer services, Manor Care looks well-positioned to keep bolstering its bottom line. Occupancy levels, at 89%, are at a 10-year high, and the company is operating efficiently. Susan Robbins, a senior analyst at longtime Manor Care investor Baron Capital Group, calls the company \"a low-cost provider for post-acute rehabilitation care.\" The costs are especially low, compared with those of full-scale hospitals. That helps win patient referrals. \u001d  Though Manor Care doesn't need acquisitions to grow, Ormond won't rule them out. Its ownership of 97% of its real estate is \"at a minimum, dry powder for us\" should an opportunity present itself, he  says. \u001d  The Medicare reimbursement landscape, meanwhile, is expected to remain relatively stable, since Democrats, now the majority in Congress, have long been favorably disposed to the nursing-home industry. All of which should provide a nice backdrop for healthy growth. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:07 ET (05:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"09d05ad82170dee8c1dd6e13b27238b2","symR":["8253.TO","8515.TO","8570.TO","8572.TO","AIFLY","C","JP3105040004","JP3108600002","JP3131400008","JP3271400008","US1729671016"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(1/22) Asian Trader: Outlook Bright For Japan's Credit-Card Shares","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T05:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["8253.TO","8515.TO","8570.TO","8572.TO","AIFLY","C","JP3105040004","JP3108600002","JP3131400008","JP3271400008","US1729671016"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","CFN","X225","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Mayuko Ota \u001d  Credit-card issuers could be the big winners in a Japanese consumer-finance industry that has been ravaged by the recent imposition of interest-rate caps. \u001d  In Japan, consumer financing is divided broadly into two kinds of players, the consumer-loan companies and credit-card companies. The former, comparable to U.S. sub-prime lenders, offer credit to lower-middle-income families with average debt of over $10,000. In contrast, credit-card companies -- still an underdeveloped industry -- serve shoppers who make minimal use of the cards and tend to pay off card balances every month. \u001d  The system yielded high returns for consumer-loan companies. Even though some of their borrowers weren't the most creditworthy, the risks were offset by the high interest rates the lenders could charge -- up to 29%. But on Dec. 13, the government limited rates to a maximum of 18%-20%. \u001d  Consumer-finance stocks all took beatings after the rate-regulation debate began in March, with shares of loan company Acom (ticker: 8572.Tokyo) plummeting 42% and those of credit-card issuer Credit Saison (82.53.Tokyo) losing 37%. But the major card companies, with a lower-risk clientele, won't be affected nearly as badly as the consumer lenders. \"I still remain bullish on high-quality card companies, despite the radical change,\" says Shiro Yoshiyoka, a Mizuho Securities analyst. \"The consumer bases are significantly different, so credit companies should be OK.\" He and some other analysts strongly recommend Credit Saison and Aeon Credit (8570.Tokyo). \u001d  The new interest-rate limits are leading Citigroup (C) to close 84% of its Japanese consumer-loan operations. \"Citigroup's sweeping round of restructuring is a signal of things to come,\" warns Takehiro Tsuda of Nikko Citigroup, the most vocal industry doomsayer. \"It's highly possible two or more of the major lenders, possibly Acom [8572.Tokyo] and Aiful [8515.Tokyo], will go bankrupt.\" \u001d  The card outfits' better outlook is reflected in their stocks' valuations. At its recent price of 4,570 yen -- about $38 -- Credit Saison sells at about two times book value and at 17 times analysts' average earnings estimate for fiscal 2008. At its recent price of 2,330 yen, Aeon Credit's price-book ratio is 2.5; its P/E is 14.5. Consumer-finance shares, in contrast, trade barely above de facto book value. \u001d  \"One advantage of Credit Saison is that they can make profit even under tight pressure,\" says Ayako Sato at UBS Securities. The company has a 17% market share and lots of retail allies, including the Japan Postal Service and Seibu department store. That share could grow through M&A and aggressive marketing over the next few years. \u001d  Aeon Credit has also safely positioned itself with a strong base of low-risk customers, successfully piggy-backing on its parent company's retail outlets. About a quarter of its revenue and 18% of its profit comes from outside Japan. \u001d  Credit-card shopping accounts for roughly 10% of consumption in Japan, versus close to 25% in the U.S. In fiscal 2005, purchases on plastic leapt 14%, according to the Japan Consumer Credit Industry, and they're likely to keep rising. Sato notes that cards now can be used to pay highway tolls and utility and hospital bills. In the next few years, taxes probably also will be payable with plastic. \u001d  Credit Saison and Aeon Credit look well-placed to capitalize on these changes. \u001d  --- \u001d  Mayuko Ota reports for Dow Jones Newswires from Tokyo. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:05 ET (05:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0a7aff87e488f51da29b8b7919fd277a","symR":["LLY","US5324571083"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Ill, Vt Demand Eli Lilly Turn Over Zyprexa Marketing Data-NYT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T07:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LLY","US5324571083"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Stepping up government investigations into Eli Lilly & Co.'s (LLY) marketing of its best-selling drug Zyprexa, state prosecutors in Illinois and Vermont have demanded that the company turn over information about the way it promoted the medication, the New York Times reported in its Saturday editions. \u001d  On Thursday, lawyers from the consumer protection division of the Illinois attorney general's office demanded that Lilly hand over marketing materials, email messages, and other documents with information about promotion of Zyprexa, the Times reported.

The states are investigating whether Lilly tried to hide Zyprexa's risk of causing weight gain and other risks associated with diabetes and whether the company promoted Zyprexa for use in patients who do not have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, the report said. \u001d  Federal laws prohibit such so-called \"off label\" marketing, although doctors may prescribe any drug for any disease that they believe the drug will help, the report said. \u001d  The orders on Thursday and Friday are the first formal demands for Lilly documents from state attorneys and they indicate an escalation of the investigation, according to Hagan and Julie Brill, who is an assistant attorney general in Vermont, the Times reported. \u001d  \"We can ask for documents; we can ask for answers to questions; and we can ask for people to come in and testify under oath,\" Hagan said, the report said.

He didn't elaborate. \u001d  China's foreign exchange reserves are the world's largest, at $1.06 trillion and growing. \u001d  How to spend the money, which is usually invested in U.S. Treasury securities and other low-risk instruments, has been hotly debated among Chinese officials. Beijing is unlikely to dump its U.S. holdings, analysts have said, because that would shock the American economy - China's top export market - and the dollar, sending the value of China's reserves plummeting. \u001d  Wen also announced that the debt-laden Agriculture Bank of China will be restructured and greater financial support given to rural China. \u001d  While many of the measures were expected, the conference, held once every five years, comes as the communist government is trying to ease friction at home over a widening gap between rich and poor and dampen criticism abroad about its trade surplus. \u001d  Wen acknowledged that it was proving a challenge to manage domestic social strains, the trade surplus - which grew 74% last year to $177.47 billion - and inflows of investment. \u001d  \"We must increase the sense of urgency and responsibility in financial work,\" state television and the Xinhua News Agency quoted Wen as saying. \u001d  With so much money flooding in, Chinese leaders and economists are worried that the surge could touch off inflation or a binge of ill-conceived lending by banks and spending by companies. The trade surplus has also fueled criticism in the U.S. and the E.U. that China was depressing the value of its currency, the yuan, making its exports cheaper. \u001d  In recent weeks, China has accelerated the yuan's rise against the dollar, and Wen said that exchange rate adjustments will continue. \u001d  Less clear, however, was whether China intended to use its foreign exchange reserves to buy up assets abroad, helping to reduce trade tensions. In debate over how to spend the reserves, which in addition to U.S. Treasury bonds have been used to bail out state banks, some Chinese scholars have suggested buying up oil and gas fields or other strategic commodities. \u001d  Xinhua said that the trillion-dollar reserve \"could buy Microsoft, Citibank and Exxon Mobil Corp. as well as General Motors and Ford.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 11:08 ET (16:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0c6cdcd87ceab3fef7abb1bd50a093e2","symR":["TRB"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Tribune Company Updates Strategic Review Process","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T22:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TRB"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  CHICAGO, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Tribune Company (NYSE: TRB) said today that the independent special committee of its board of directors is continuing its strategic review following the submission of proposals from prospective investors. \b \u001d  \"The committee is actively engaged in the review process,\" said William A.

Martin \u001d  Ever since we alerted readers to an impending turnaround at Alcoa, the company's stock has plotted a roller-coaster course: plunging 19.7% to as low as 22.28 a couple of months after we wrote about it (\"Alcoa's Shiny Prospects,\" Aug. 8, 2005) before soaring to a high near 37 last May, with many dips and surges, before and after. \u001d  Shareholders should stay buckled up for another climb, says fund manager John Buckingham of Laguna Beach, Calif.-based Al Frank Asset Management. The shares enjoyed a renewed surge Friday, rising 3.3%, to 31.31, on news of a big stock buyback and a 13% dividend hike. \u001d  Buckingham says the world's largest aluminum maker (ticker: AA) is worth buying up to 32.41. Before Friday's afternoon's jump, it was trading at 10 times estimated earnings for the year ahead, \"which we believe is cheap given the likelihood of continued strong demand for aluminum products,\" he said. \u001d  The aluminum giant, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, gave the new year's earnings season a boost last week when it reported higher-than-expected record profits for 2006 of $2.90 a share and a 60% boost in net income for the final quarter. \u001d  \"Results were driven by higher metal prices and strong demand for aluminum in the aerospace, commercial-transportation and commercial-building markets,\" says Buckingham. \"This suggests that commodities like aluminum are in for more years of heavy consumption. Volume levels in those key business sectors remain high, which goes against those who believe commodity prices may be headed back to the low levels of the 1990s.\" \u001d  A consensus of estimates by analysts looks for the company, which also makes Reynold's Wrap and other consumer products, to earn $2.99 a share in 2007 and about the same in 2008. \u001d  The outlook is buoyed in part by prospects for continued relatively strong aluminum prices and heavy buying by China, where the company believes demand is growing on average by 14% a year. \u001d  Analyst David Martin of Deutsche Bank in New York recently increased his aluminum-price forecast for 2007 to an average of $1.14 a pound, from his prior forecast of $1.11; he lifted his 2008 expectation to $1.01 a pound, from 94 cents previously. The current spot price is $1.22 a pound. \u001d  Aluminum has been outperforming other metals of late, notably copper, Martin says, because it is less exposed to the slowing U.S. housing market and has not seen as large an inventory buildup as other metals, he says. Martin rates the stock a Hold. \u001d  \"Alcoa's priorities and focus have improved via its recent restructuring announcement, and we've become more positive,\" Martin writes in a recent report. He's keeping a Hold on the shares to see what the restructuring will include. \u001d  In other words, investors can expect more thrills as the year unfolds. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:08 ET (05:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"14a0eca52b279961a5ff82ed070df452","symR":["HANS"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(1/22) Barron's Online: Ready To Be Re-Energized","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T05:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HANS"],"IndustryCodes":["BVG","SFT","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Naureen S. Malik \u001d  Investors in Hansen Natural turned fickle toward the No. 2 energy-drink company in last year's second half. But new growth initiatives could put some fizz back into the shares in 2007. \u001d  Hansen enjoyed a monster run from 53 cents at the beginning of 2003 to a record $52.72 last July 6 (adjusted for stock splits). But its shares slumped after the company reported in-line second-quarter earnings (much to the disappointment of growth investors used to outsized advances) and an options probe. \u001d  At its recent price of $37.08, Hansen (ticker: HANS) was 30% below last year's high, though still triple the price (again, split-adjusted) that it was fetching when Barron's ran a skeptical piece on it a year and a half ago. (\"Buzzed to the Max,\" Aug. 1, 2005.) \u001d  Although the stock has bounced back somewhat, there is still upside potential of at least 20%, as Hansen starts to reap the benefits of a deal under which brewer Anheuser-Busch (BUD) will distribute its popular Monster Energy drink, providing marketing muscle and potentially deeper market penetration. Hansen also should benefit from new-product introductions, following a pause in its pipeline last year. In addition, the company is likely to emulate energy-drink leader Red Bull in its recent decision to boost prices. \u001d  Les Engebretson, the founder and CEO of Engebretson Capital Management in Newport Beach, Calif., started buying Hansen stock in early 2004 and says the popularity of the beverage maker's energy drinks isn't a fad. \"They have been able to take market share away from the others pretty consistently.\" \u001d  He expects earnings to grow another 35%-40% in 2007 from the $1.11 expected in 2006. This compares with 65 cents a share in 2005, 22 cents in 2004 and a mere seven cents in 2003. \u001d  Some speculate that the Anheuser relationship ultimately could lead the St. Louis brewing giant to bid for the company. Hansen's chief executive, Rodney Sacks, declined to comment for this article. \u001d  With an adjusted cost of roughly $5 a share, Engebretson's firm sold about half of its stake last July for roughly $2 million at around $53 a share. But it became a buyer again near the end of 2006, as Hansen stock dipped to around $30. \u001d  Engebretson says that Sacks and Hansen's president, Hilton Schlosberg, manage the company well. The two South Africans purchased Hansen in the 1990s when it was generating roughly $17 million in annual sales. Last year, it probably had $530 million in revenue. \"It was a sleepy business that they took over and turned into a remarkable growth story,\" comments Engebretson. \u001d  The beauty of Hansen's business model is that the company doesn't own any manufacturing facilities or make its own drinks. Instead, it relies on a network of producers and distributors with greater economies of scale to make, package and sell its products. \u001d  As a result, Hansen has strong cash flow, low capital requirements and costs, and can churn out a new product in as little as six weeks, says Engebretson, whose firm calls Hansen's brass monthly and visits its Corona, Calif., headquarters once or twice a year. \u001d  Although Hansen sells over a dozen varieties of fruit juices and carbonated natural sodas, about 90% of its sales are generated by energy drinks. Its top sellers bear the Monster label; others are sold under labels including Lost and Rumba Energy Juice. \u001d  In the 13 weeks ended Oct. 28., Monster's 16-ounce cans accounted for $23.4 million of the $100 million U.S. energy-drink market, narrowing the gap with leader Red Bull, which had $33.8 million in sales, according to AC Nielsen. \u001d  Energy drinks are the beverage world's fastest-growing segment, with sales expanding roughly 50% in 2006. A Hansen investor presentation in December estimated that convenience stores account for at least 50% of U.S. energy-drink sales. \u001d  Goldman Sachs analyst Andrew Sawyer expects the Anheuser-Busch deal to boost Hansen's penetration to 80% at U.S. food and convenience stores, from 55%-65%. That should help it grab some of Red Bull's market by the horns. \u001d  This deal could help Hansen sell Monster drinks at bars where Red Bull is popularly mixed with vodka, but only if Hansen can create a similar kind of brand image, says Sawyer. Right now, Hansen's core consumers are 18-to-25-year-old males, with more of a \"blue-collar skew\" than Red Bull's imbibers, he adds. To create a cooler image, Hansen has been sponsoring extreme and motor sports. \u001d  The Anheuser-Busch arrangement should give Hansen more clout with retailers. Hansen stock could see further upside should the company raise its prices, says Goldman Sachs' Sawyer. He expects Monster sales to climb 45% in 2007. \u001d  Any good news from Hansen would put pressure on the bears, who've shorted 19% of its 70.2 million publicly traded shares. If they had to cover a substantial portion of their bets, that could boost the stock. \u001d  The company, which has just 400 employees, is a potential takeover target, either for Anheuser-Busch or another company, since it has solid financials with low debt and rising cash flow. \u001d  On a valuation basis, the stock is trading at 25 times earnings estimates for the next four quarters; it's expected to boast annual earnings growth of at least 20% over that span. Long-term growth is estimated at 36%. \u001d  To be sure, Hansen could continue to face downward pressure through the first half of the year during its transition to the Anheuser-Busch distribution system. In some cases, old distributors had become complacent about pushing the product, notes Sawyer. \u001d  An options backdating probe and class-action suits could weigh on the stock, as well. The investigation has found that 12,000 shares were \"inadvertently\" awarded to a director in November 2004 after a grant expired, according to a press release earlier this month.

We are lowering our revenue estimate for 2007 from $31.8 million to $27.6 million (consensus: $30.8 million), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization from $10.4 million to $8.9 million (consensus: $10.3 million). . . . ARTD trades at enterprise value/Ebitda multiple of 7 based on our 2007 Ebitda estimate, a discount to peer-group median of 15 times, which we believe appropriate, given its lower growth rate. \b \u001d  CaremarkRx \u001d  -- CMX-NYSE \b \u001d  Outperform \u001d  -- Price 56.25 on Jan. 17 \u001d  by Cowen & Co. \b \u001d  The sweetened terms of the CVS (CVS) merger make the deal more competitive with Express Scripts' (ESRX) competing offer. We think Express can raise its offer by $2 to $3 a share in response. We think CMX shares can outperform the market by 25% over the next year. . . . The $2/share special dividend is a cost-effective method of adding a cash component to the offer. We estimate the share buyback adds 8 to 9 cents to '08 estimated EPS. . . . Pro forma analysis suggests 2008 EPS potential of $2.36. \b \u001d  Commerce Bancorp \u001d  -- CBH-NYSE \b \u001d  Underperform \u001d  -- Price 34.72 on Jan. 16 \u001d  by RBC Capital Markets \b \u001d  Q406 EPS increased 54%, year-over-year, but decreased 2.4% sequentially to 40 cents. EPS was two cents below our estimate, but in line with the consensus. . . . EPS missed our estimate due to lower-than-expected average earning-asset growth, lower than anticipated deposit-service-charge income and a lower net-interest margin. U.S. Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have started an investigation . . . that \"will include but not be limited to transactions with its officers, directors and related parties, including transactions involving bank premises.\" \b \u001d  Global Payments \u001d  -- GPN-NYSE \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 38.78 on Jan. 16 \u001d  by Janney Montgomery Scott \b \u001d  We [recently] hosted a client field trip to Global's main processing facility in Owings Mills, Md. . . . Regarding the stock, catalysts remain elusive due to margin pressure; however, attractive long-term trends in electronic payments could provide support at the $40-per-share level, in our opinion. It appears margins will trend higher as operating efficiencies and overall economies of scale [set in]. . . . We view recently disclosed competitive issues within money-transfer as secondary given this business represents only 4% of pretax earnings. In our opinion, money-transfer challenges were simply the straw that broke the camel's back in regards to tightening '07 revenue guidance to 16% to 17.7%, from 16% to 19%. Reaffirming Buy rating and lowering our 12-month fair value estimate to 48, due to a lack of any material short-term catalysts. \b \u001d  Gray Television \u001d  -- GTN-NYSE \b \u001d  Outperform \u001d  -- Price 7.79 on Jan. 12 \u001d  by Barrington Research \b \u001d  We are raising our rating on GTN to Outperform. We are tempted to feel that some important catalysts for Gray will not come fully into play until later in the year, when attention will turn toward the potentially very lucrative 2008 quadrennial election period, which will benefit from a presidential race absent an incumbent from either party. Gray captures about 60% of the political spending in its markets . . . [a] digital switch in 2009 should help its digital duopolies. Recent perking up in the stock leaves it short of other media stocks that have begun to generate longer momentum. We feel additional upside remains, with a 2008-based target of 10. \b \u001d  LeCroy \u001d  -- LCRY-NNM \b \u001d  Hold \u001d  -- Price 10.35 on Jan. 17 \u001d  by Needham & Co. \b \u001d  LeCroy is a leading manufacturer of digital oscilloscopes, which are used to visually analyze electronic signals, and serial-data analyzers, which leverage the company's core expertise in high-speed electronic signal acquisition and analysis. The company's products are used in computer, semiconductor, storage, communications and automotive design applications. Although the stock trades at an attractive valuation (16 times our new FY07 estimated EPS) on our reduced estimates after yesterday's sell-off, we are downgrading the stock since the Q2 results [are] yet another in a sequence of apparent execution errors. LeCroy's solution [it is hiring some direct and an army of new indirect salespeople in the U.S. and Asia, and has new products in the pipeline] should play out over the next 12 months. However, we urge caution in case the execution errors continue during that period. \b \u001d  Navteq \u001d  -- NVT-NYSE \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 32.48 on Jan. 17 \u001d  by American Technology Research \b \u001d  Initiating coverage with a Buy and 44 target. We think Navteq, a maker of digital maps for vehicular navigation, will report [Feb. 8] a strong Q4 . . . current consensus estimates do not reflect dilution from recent acquisitions. The stock is trading at 13 times '07 Ebitda, below our Ebitda growth rate of 16% (depressed by acquisition dilution). Our price target is based on 18 times '07 Ebitda (slight premium to growth) and represents around 38% upside potential. \b \u001d  OMI \u001d  -- OMM-NYSE \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 21.13 on Jan. 16 \u001d  by Lazard Capital Markets \b \u001d  Reiterating Buy but reducing target to 25 from 27. Our 25 price target equates to 10 times our 2007 EPS forecast and nine times our 2007 enterprise value/Ebitda forecast, in line with the peer-group averages. . . . Lowering 4Q06 estimates and 2007 outlook on softer-than-anticipated freight rates, but OMI still has promise . . . the tanker markets remain historically strong, but freight rates have not met expectations for 4Q06 and 1Q07. After a near record 3Q06 for the Suezmax [one million-barrel capacity] tanker sector, 4Q did not meet our expectations. Handymax and Handysize product tankers are also coming off a strong 3Q, but had a softer-than-expected 4Q. \u001d  High U.S. oil inventories and lower-than-expected Chinese demand have led to weaker-than-expected demand from top down for 4Q06, and soften our 2007 outlook. . . . Via its term charter business, OMI is somewhat insulated from future weakness. . . . OMI has an estimated 41% debt to cap and $600 million in liquidity. . . . Colder weather in the U.S. Northeast and declining refined and crude oil inventories could signal improved demand. \b \u001d  Qiao Xing Universal Telephone \u001d  -- XING-NNM \b \u001d  Strong Buy \u001d  -- Price 12.72 on Jan. 16 \u001d  by Dutton Associates \b \u001d  XING is one of China's largest manufacturers and distributors of telecommunications products, [sold under] the CECT and COSUN brands, with a product portfolio covering fixed wireless phones, VoIP telephones, advanced mobile phones, PDAs and consumer-electronic products such as MP3 players, cash registers and set-top box products. . . . Although net revenues for the first three quarters of FY2006 were lower than our expectations, we are happy to see significant improvement in gross, operating and net margins [mainly from] cost-control measures . . . and improving product mix toward higher-margin products. This positive trend should extend into FY2007. \u001d  In November, XING completed acquisition of the remaining 20% equity in Qiao Xing Mobile Communication, and thus raised its effective interest in CECT (its mobile-handsets operation) from 74.7% to 93.4%. Ministry of Information Industry statistics indicate that the number of mobile subscribers in China is accelerating. These positive factors, along with the improvement in margins, had prompted us to significantly raise our EPS forecasts for fiscal-year 2007 by 16.1% from $2.18 to $2.53. \b \u001d  SumTotal Systems \u001d  -- SUMT-NNM \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 6.36 on Jan. 16 \u001d  by Wedbush Morgan Securities \b \u001d  Mountain View, Calif.-based SumTotal Systems is the market leader in the enterprise learning-management-systems software sector. Preliminary Q4 results are higher than our above-consensus estimates. . . . \u001d  SUMT will release full Q4 results Feb. 6, after the market close. LMS market seems to be growing at a pace, 13% to 17%, that could be double that of the broader application-software market 6% to 7%. We are slightly increasing 2006 revenue estimate from $109.9 million to $110.4 million to reflect preliminary Q4 results. Increasing 2007 revenue estimate from $129 million to $131 million and EPS estimate from 41 cents to 46 cents, due to higher levels of business activity. Raising target to $9.50 (was $8.50), reflecting P/E about 21 times our new '07 EPS estimate of 46 cents. \b \u001d  WellsFargo \u001d  -- WFC-NYSE \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 36.23 on Jan. 16 \u001d  by Punk Ziegel \b \u001d  Wells Fargo reported 4Q earnings of 64 cents per share, 2 cents below our estimate and flat with 3Q results. The earnings forecasts for WFC are being adjusted as follows: a) the 2007 estimate is being reduced from $2.78 per share to $2.74 per share; b) the 2008 estimate is being increased to $3.07 per share from $3.06 per share; and c) an estimate of $3.37 per share is being instituted for 2009. The price target is being increased to 44 from 42, and the secular growth rate is being raised to 10.5% from 10%. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:05 ET (05:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1fd196bdc006a3982937819e8416416a","symR":["BAS.XE","BF","GSPBEX.RS","DE0005151005","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gazprom Exec Warns Europe Against Shunning Long-Term Pacts","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T16:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BAS.XE","BF","GSPBEX.RS","DE0005151005","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["CHC","CHM","OIL","PIP","XDAX","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP)--A top executive with Russian natural gas company Gazprom OAO (GSPBEX.RS) on Saturday warned Europe against energy market reforms that would disrupt long-term supply agreements or infringe companies' rights to control their own pipeline infrastructure. \u001d  Long-term contracts covering decades shouldn't give way to short-term trading by \"speculative firms of the Enron type,\" said deputy CEO Alexander Medvedev, referring to the high-flying U.S. energy trader that went bankrupt. \u001d  \"You all know how that turned out,\" he said. \u001d  The E.U. is working on a new energy policy aimed at improving the security of supply and increasing competition, including a proposal to split big energy companies from their distribution networks. Gazprom, the world's largest gas company, which supplies a quarter of Europe's needs, produces gas from its Arctic and Siberian gas fields and also owns a distribution pipe network in Germany through its Wingas partnership with BASF AG's (BF) Wintershall division. \u001d  \"We are prepared to conduct business to the letter of the law,\" Medvedev said. \"But I think it would be a mistake not to take into account the opinion of gas producers.\" \u001d  He noted that 60% of Wingas' contracts with Gazprom were of one-year duration. \"That means Wingas has to show its competitiveness on the market every year,\" he said. \u001d  Much of Gazprom's business, however, is long-term contracts with buyers obligated years in advance to pay whether they use the gas or not, the so-called \"take or pay\" practice. Medvedev defended the practice as a guarantor of steady supplies. \u001d  He also said any liberalization shouldn't deprive companies of control of their pipelines. One form of liberalization sometimes discussed would be to give competitors access to utility companies' pipelines, as has been done with phone lines. \u001d  \"Access to infrastructure is a condition of reliable gas supply,\" said Medvedev, who spoke to reports in Gelsenkirchen before a soccer match between FC Schalke and Zenit St. Petersburg.

Strauss \u001d  Chalk one up for the S&P 500, which in 2006 outperformed 69% of large-cap funds. \u001d  The indexing versus actively managed fund debate won't be settled anytime soon, if ever. But the latest results, compiled by Standard & Poor's, do highlight how difficult it is for active managers to beat their benchmarks, especially over longer periods. \u001d  Last year, the S&P SmallCap 600 surpassed nearly 64% of small-cap funds. On the plus side for active managers, 53.3% of mid-cap funds outpaced the S&P MidCap 400. \u001d  Extend the performance period for those three categories to three and five years, however, and the indexes hold a big lead. \u001d  From 2000 through 2006, the S&P 500 beat the performance of nearly 57% of large-cap funds, on average. \"That shows that over long periods of time, the S&P 500 outperforms the majority of active mutual funds,\" says Rosanne Pane, mutual-fund strategist at Standard & Poor's. \u001d  Countering all  this data is the argument that there are some gifted portfolio managers who are good at picking securities and generating superior returns. \u001d  \"It's a challenge to outperform the indexes,\" says Brian McMahon, president and chief investment officer of Thornburg Investment Management, whose four actively managed stock funds beat their benchmarks last year. (A fifth equity fund was launched last year.) \"Obviously, we think we can do it because we think we can add value with active management.\" \u001d  The keys to outperformance, he says, are \"doing the research and having the judgment and follow-up to apply it.\" \u001d  It's also tougher to outperform as the market narrows, assert investment strategists Richard Bernstein and Kari Pinkernell of Merrill Lynch. In a recent research note, they point out that 48% of the stocks in the S&P 500 beat the index last year -- well below the 57% average this decade. \u001d  \"We think 2007 is going to be the year where large-caps prevail because of the decelerating profit cycle,\" says Pinkernell. \"Leadership has narrowed in favor of the biggest and the best companies.\" Such a scenario would favor the S&P 500, which is weighted by market capitalization, over actively managed funds on average. \u001d  In a note last summer, Bernstein and Pinkernell argued that narrow markets favor indexing, because it gets tougher to find stocks that will go up in value. \u001d  During this decade, more than 50% of large-caps funds beat the benchmark in two separate years, 2000 and 2005. In 2005, energy was a dominant sector, providing a big lift to many active funds. But last year, says Pane of Standard & Poor's, there was a rotation away from energy. \u001d  \"What we've seen over long periods of time is that when there are major changes in market rotations, the indexes tend to do better,\" says Pane. \"The index is always in those sectors and tends to outperform active managers. It's difficult to make those sector moves.\" \b \u001d  Closed-end funds have seen their discounts to net asset value decrease. Last month, the median discount fell to 3.63%, continuing a trend that occurred throughout 2006, according to Lipper. This trend was especially true for equity funds. \u001d  Unlike open-end funds, closed-end funds have a specified number of shares and trade on an exchange. The price of the fund shares typically trade at a discount or a premium to the fund's underlying assets -- basically, the securities in its portfolio. \u001d  Another manifestation of this trend is the Herzfeld Closed-End Average, which is trading at par to its NAV. We plotted that performance against the S&P 500 back over nearly a decade to see if there were any discernible trends between the widening and closing of the average discount and the broad stock market's direction. \u001d  We didn't find anything that was particularly convincing or compelling. \u001d  \"It's a stretch to make the case that there's some kind of a strong correlation or that widening and contraction of discounts can be used as any kind of leading indicator,\" says Thomas J. Herzfeld, chairman and president of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, a Miami investment firm specializing in closed-end funds. \u001d  In the late 1990s, as equities had a big run, the Herzfeld index traded at a big discount to its NAV. Conversely, its discount narrowed and even became a premium between 2000 and 2003 when stocks struggled. But more recently, the discount has narrowed as stocks have done well. \u001d  Tom Roseen, a senior research analyst at Lipper, points out that a big factor driving down the discounts is that investors are looking for yield. \b \u001d  Vanguard plans to add four bond exchange-traded funds. The funds, including Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, are expected to have annual expense ratios of a mere 0.11%. Vanguard has filed a registration statement, but the introduction date depends on when the Securities and Exchange Commission approves them. \u001d  All four of the exchange-traded funds will be share classes of existing bond funds. These would be the first fixed-income exchange-traded funds offered by Vanguard.

Whoever wins France's elections in May, Breton, recruited from France Telecom as a stopgap finance minister, will be replaced. \u001d  That may tempt Desmarest to ask Total's board to let him stay as CEO until things calm down. He's to remain chairman anyway. \u001d  If the rush to damn Total and De Margerie is unseemly, it is understandable amid the corruption investigations swirling around the French oil giant. The legal heat Total faces is an all-but-inevitable consequence of the French oil company's strategy. \u001d  Total's belief is it should go where the oil and gas are. If it doesn't, somebody else will, to the detriment of its shareholders, staff and customers. \u001d  Then there's Total's determination to carve out its share of the world's oil and gas reserves, in competition with the U.S. majors, whose geographic room for maneuver has been crimped by Washington's foreign policy. \u001d  That has taken Total to countries with unsavory governments of one sort or another --  most notoriously Burma, Iran and Iraq. \u001d  Total likes to think of all this as its competitive advantage. But that will be hard to argue if Total executives are found guilty of the corruption they're suspected of in three legal probes in France, related to deals in Iraq, Iran and Cameroon. \u001d  But the cases against De Margerie and others aren't proven. And the problem isn't an exclusively French one, despite the memories of the corruption scandals at Elf, bought by Total nearly a decade ago, when it was a state-owned company. \u001d  Look at the investigations into war-profiteering by U.S. companies in Iraq, where Halliburton (HAL) has been in the spotlight, and the SEC probe into graft in building a gas plant in Nigeria during the dictatorship of Sani Abacha. The companies under investigation there include Halliburton, Marubeni, and Shell. \u001d  What is peculiarly French is the country's justice system, in which it's possible to remain a suspect, questioned by the authorities but not be charged, as an investigation continues, possibly for years. \u001d  Jean-Claude Trichet suffered that fate when he was governor of the Bank of France during the probe into Credit Lyonnais. The CEO of Societe Generale, Daniel Bouton, is in a similar position, regarding a money-laundering probe. \b \u001d  The London Stock Exchange has many investors rubbing their hands with glee in announcing another share buyback program. \u001d  But the LSE (LSE.London) is making such a habit of impromptu returns of cash to shareholders that the moves, funded by increased debt, are looking like a poison pill-one that may compromise the LSE's longer-term growth. \u001d  The additional debt the LSE is taking on, primarily to fend off the bid from Nasdaq (NDAQ), risks making the exchange an unattractive partner for any bidder. It also bars the LSE from making a transforming acquisition of its own without jeopardizing its investment-grade credit rating. \u001d  The extra 250 million British pounds in debt that the LSE is taking on, bringing its gross debt to GBP 615 million,  more than doubles its leverage, as measured by net debt to cash flow, to 3.2 times. That could hurt the LSE's future revenue and margins, even if the exchange continues to highlight past growth -- nine-month operating profits doubled to GBP 129 million. The extra debt will likely more than double its interest expense, to GBP 34 million. \u001d  The LSE's decision to cut trading tariffs from 90 pence per trade to 20 pence suggests that it's positioning itself for tougher competition. Cracks are also starting to appear in the success of AIM, the LSE's fast-growing junior market. \u001d  This all casts doubt over whether incremental earnings growth would be enough to support the LSE's current valuation. The exchange points out that Nasdaq's current offer values it at a little over 24 times earnings, below the 29.8 times of Nasdaq's first offer last March.. \u001d  But that's still rich enough for the two exchanges to embark on a constructive dialogue, given the LSE's mixed trading outlook and the absence of any other suitors willing to offer that sort of  multiple for the London market. \u001d  --- \u001d  MATTHEW CURTIN and ARINDAM NAG are contributors to The Skeptic, a Dow Jones Newswires column on which this European Trader is based. \u001d  --- \b                       DOW JONES GLOBAL INDEXES \b \bRegion/ \bCountry \b   DJ Global          DJ Global          DJ Global     Point \b    Indexes,           Indexes,           Indexes,      Chg.    % Chg. \b Local Curr.

But the Democrats identified a small number of economic issues they want to address this year. One is raising the minimum wage. Another will allow the federal government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over the price of drugs provided to Medicare recipients. This is now prohibited. Overall, they're trying to keep Medicare pharmaceutical costs from rising too rapidly. Part of that involves trying to negotiate with drug manufacturers. The other part involves a broader use of generics in the formulary used throughout Medicare. Barr will benefit from demographics and these political developments. Thanks for pointing that out, Scott. \u001d  My next name is in the energy sector -- Baker Hughes [BHI]. This may not be a great year for energy, but the longer-term patterns are constructive. For much of the past few years, commodity prices dominated share prices. With the commodity now rather dormant, a lot of momentum investors are leaving the sector. Baker Hughes is an \"intermission\" selection. Our analysts like it because it has less exposure to things like natural-gas prices, which have been hurt by the warm weather. The stock is selling at a discount to some of its peers, like Schlumberger [SLB], in part because of some execution problems at Baker Oil Tools. Our analyst believes the problem will be rectified. The P/E based on this year's earnings is about 13. That is not an unreasonable price to pay for a good, long-term investment. \u001d  Gabelli: GE finally decided to get into the oil-services business with the $2 billion purchase of Vetco Gray. They tend to buy not just one company in an area. \u001d  Cohen: At past Roundtables I have often talked about technology stocks I like. Tech is a significant portion of the S&P 500. My last stock, Symantec [SYMC], is in the software space. Our tech analysts are more cautious right now than they were a few months ago. Valuations are not as appealing, and we are also very much aware of seasonality, particularly as it relates to hardware. So we're looking at software. The advantage Symantec has is that it has some new products out, including some Norton AntiVirus products. It is in a good category. The stock sells for about 18 times 2007 earnings. Clearly, P/Es are not what they used to be in this category. The stock performed roughly in line with the overall market in 2006, but longer-term earnings growth is on the order of 16%-17%, which is substantially better than the S&P 500. Technology as a category is driven by many factors. Capital spending is not falling off a cliff. Capex [capital expenditures] by U.S. companies in the security category will be 6%-7%. In addition, Symantec sells a consumer product. The stock has been under pressure, given some operational problems late last year. At this entry point, some good returns are available. \u001d  Hickey: The big risk for Symantec is that Microsoft [MSFT] is moving into the market. It is a gorilla, and if it is successful, Symantec has trouble. If it's not, Symantec is a good company. \u001d  [Tuesday Symantec reported disappointing preliminary third-quarter results, and cut its fiscal '07 forecast. The stock fell about 14% on the week. In an update, Abby said Goldman removed the stock from its Conviction Buy list, though it remains on the firm's Buy list. Goldman's analyst cut her '07 and fiscal '08 forecasts but feels the bad news is reflected in the share price.] \b \u001d  Barron's: Thank you, Abby. Your turn, Felix. \u001d  Zulauf: I'm working on the assumption that the economic and financial-markets cycle will run another few years, into the turn of the decade, before a recession hits. Eventually a mania will develop in the market, but for now all the equity markets are extended and due for a correction. Two things: The VIX [volatility index], which is now trading at 12, will shoot up to 20 or even higher. I want to be long volatility this year, via the CBOE Volatility Index. \u001d  Second, everything I'd like to buy is not at a buying point now, because the markets are so extended. Don't rush in and buy here. Wait for a correction. My next recommendation is the European telecom industry. An exchange-traded fund such as the DJ Stoxx 600 Telecom [SXKPEX.Germany] is an easy way play it. The story is simple: The industry overexpanded in the late 1990s. Companies overstretched their balances sheets and made all the mistakes one could make. Afterward, stock prices dived from absurd valuation levels. The restructuring process then set in and has been under way ever since. Balance sheets are in good shape again. The investor focus has moved away from this sector, and valuations are attractive. \b \u001d  Barron's: Give us some numbers, please. \u001d  Zulauf: At the peak the sector traded for 70 times earnings. Now it trades for about 12 times earnings. In terms of price to cash flow it traded for 250% of the market's valuation, and now trades for about 60%. Dividends were half a percent at the peak, and are now around 4%. They're well covered, at only 20% of cash flow. The telecoms underperformed the European stock market from 2000 until September 2006. They have outperformed since and will continue to do so. While they could pull back in a general market correction, they're much less risky than many other European investments. \b \u001d  Barron's: Why have they rallied? \u001d  Zulauf: Some risk-averse investors looked at valuations and saw that industry fundamentals had changed. Telecoms are generating decent free cash flow of about 30 billion euros. The Blackstone Group took a position in Deutsche Telekom [DT]. They are already making money if they sell now. They saw the value. \u001d  The industry is not the high-growth business it once was, though there is some sort of growth kicker from the increasing use of broadband and broadband penetration. Return on equity industrywide is about 20%. Analysts in general are neutral or very cautious. I like that, and the fact that European telecom shares sell at a discount of about 15% to 20% relative to U.S. and Asian telecoms. Enterprise value [market value plus net debt] is about eight times operating free cash flow. \b \u001d  Barron's: Where do the ETFs trade? \u001d  Zulauf: They trade in Germany. My next recommendation is in Asia -- the Singapore stock market -- though I would definitely wait for a correction. Singapore is a city-state in Southeast Asia. It is only 3.5 times times the size of Washington, D.C., with 4.5 million people, 75% of them Chinese and the rest Malay and Indian. It was founded in 1819 as a British trading colony. It joined the Malaysian Federation in 1963 but separated two years later and became independent. It is probably the best-run country in the world, with an efficient government and a high level of education among its labor force. Singapore has a strong position in international trade because it is on major trade routes. Its port is one of the busiest in the world. \u001d  GDP [gross domestic product] per capita is equal to Western Europe. It has a free-market economy that is also free of corruption. Singapore depends heavily on exports, particularly electronics and manufacturing, but the government is trying to grow the economic base. In recent years medical research has been growing nicely, and Singapore now has established a highly competitive financial center. I think it will become the offshore financial center of Asia. As a result, it will benefit greatly from the rise of Asia. \b \u001d  Barron's: How would you invest in Singapore? \u001d  Zulauf: Through the iShares MSCI Singapore ETF [EWS]. The index composition is about one-third banks, 17% properties, 10% telecom, 10% multi-industry, 8% transports and 6% retail. The market trades for 1.9 times book value, or a discount of 20% to the world index. It is 10.6 times enterprise value to cash flow and 16 times earnings. The dividend yield is 2.8%, and return on equity is about 13% or 14%. Economic growth in recent years has been between 6% and 8%. In 2006 it was probably 7%. Next year, with the world slowing, it will be 6%. Consumer inflation is 1%. The market could have a correction similar to the one in May-June 2006, when it fell about 20%. I could see another 15%-20% correction in coming months, and would wait to buy into it. Singapore will be higher one year from now, and a lot higher two and three years from now. \u001d  Gross: I assume you get some exposure to the Singapore dollar here. \u001d  Zulauf: It's an attractive currency, probably one of the best around. Currently it is weak because it is misused like the yen and Swiss franc as a refinancing currency because interest rates are very low. That has a somewhat depressing effect on the currency. Longer term it will catch up and the fundamental strengths will come through. \u001d  Cohen: You're playing it both ways in terms of liking it but calling it too expensive. What is the catalyst for a market correction, and for another rally? \u001d  Zulauf: There is no specific catalyst other than trends in world markets. Singapore was always regarded as well managed, but people weren't sure it would be accepted as a stand-alone government and country. Over the years, in particular the past 10, it has demonstrated it is capable of moving into new, value-added industries. Eventually, Singapore will be a classic way to play the rise of Asia and the mania I see coming. A lot of financial companies and multinationals are choosing to locate there. \u001d  Cohen: It is also less polluted than Hong Kong, which is one reason for the recent migration of businesses. \u001d  Zulauf: It's a bit humid, and Marc would probably say the night life is not attractive enough. But that is improving, and casinos will come, too. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:05 ET (05:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4a4e08c7121fcf66127311a1a7367b29","symR":["3112.FR","AKH","AZA.MI","FR0000031122","IT0003918577"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Alitalia Says Not Able To Update Strategy For 2007-09","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T12:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["3112.FR","AKH","AZA.MI","FR0000031122","IT0003918577"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XENX","XMIB","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MILAN (Dow Jones)--Italy's struggling airline Alitalia (AZA.MI) said late Friday it has ditched plans to present an industrial strategy for 2007-09, but would draw up a budget for the current year by the end of January. \u001d  Alitalia's board had been due to meet on Friday to discuss the industrial plan, but the meeting was canceled after Jean-Cyril Spinetta, CEO of Air France-KLM (3112.FR), resigned Thursday, leaving the board with fewer than the mandatory three members. \u001d  The Italian government has put the ailing airline up for sale, asking for expressions of interest by Jan. 29, and Spinetta's departure triggered market speculation that Air France-KLM might finally be persuaded to bid. \u001d  Air France-KLM said Spinetta's resignation - over two weeks after Rome announced its plans - was due to a conflict of business interests caused by the government's announcement. \u001d  Italy's center-left government, which holds 49.9% of Alitalia, said at the end of 2006 it wanted to sell at least 30.1%, a stake that would legally oblige the buyer to launch a full offer for the carrier. \u001d  Alitalia hasn't posted an annual profit since 2002. \u001d  It said on Friday it couldn't confirm or deny reports that it had lost about EUR400 million last year. \b \u001d   -By Giada Zampano, Dow Jones Newswires; 39-3487678016; giada.zampano@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 07:39 ET (12:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"51df9d6a4147a98153fcca444163762b","symR":["BPI.MI","BPVN.MI","IT0000064300","IT0003262513"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Popolare Italiana Hldrs Vote To Reinstate Gronchi As CEO","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T15:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BPI.MI","BPVN.MI","IT0000064300","IT0003262513"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","XDJGI","XMIB"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MILAN (Dow Jones)--Shareholders in Banca Popolare Italiana (BPI.MI) Saturday voted to reinstate Chief Executive Divo Gronchi, who had been suspended from official duties last month after being convicted for his role in the collapse of real estate group Bagaglino. \u001d  In a statement, Popolare Italiana said 1,885 shareholders voted to reinstate Gronchi, on a total of 2,847 who turned up at the meeting in Lodi near Milan. \u001d  Gronchi is one of the main architects of the planned merger with fellow Italian cooperative bank Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara (BPVN.MI), which will create Italy's third-largest bank by number of branches. \u001d  Gronchi, who is pushing through a turnaround at the Lodi-based bank, was suspended in December along with other top Italian bankers following his conviction for a role in the bankruptcy of real estate and hotel company Italcase-Bagaglino. \u001d  Popolare Italiana shareholders are expected to vote on the merger with Popolare Verona in mid-March. \u001d  The new bank will focus its business on both savings and loans, to both its own shareholders as well as non-shareholders, based on the principles of popular credit, with particular attention to the territory where its subsidiary banks operate and where the group has its branch network, the two banks said in December. \b \u001d  -By Giada Zampano, Dow Jones Newswires; 39-3487678016; giada.zampano@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 10:34 ET (15:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"51e9248b3d82ff32fedfd795a78487bc","symR":["AAPL","US0378331005"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(1/22) Plugged In: Tech Earnings' Blow-Ups And Blow-Outs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T05:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAPL","US0378331005"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Mark Veverka \u001d  A gusty breeze has been blowing across Techland, propelled by a stream of December quarter-earnings whiffs. \u001d  SAP (ticker: SAP), Motorola (MOT), and Symantec (SYMC, see page 18) are just a few of the underperformers leading this parade of strikeouts. Of course, Apple (AAPL) has been an exception. \u001d  One big reason is that information-tech orders in the United States are down 10%-20% from their level a year ago, says Dresdner Kleinwort economist Tatha Ghose. New orders for equipment fell sharply during the latter part of 2006, with growth rates \"turning steeply negative.\" What's more, this may not be just an American phenomenon. Similar trends are occurring in Japan and the rest of Asia, which isn't always the case. \"This is a more synchronized downturn,\" Ghose notes. \u001d  What's happening? \u001d  Steep drops in orders typically occur when customers are aggressively cutting inventory to adjust for lower demand. These downturns usually don't last long, says Ghose, who predicts that orders should bounce back sharply during the first half. Once customers finally burn off their excess demand, orders often snap back with a short, abrupt spike, which he expects to hit before July. \u001d  But don't get your hopes too high. The rebound will be short-lived because the factors causing lower demand will continue to deteriorate, he posits. In fact, the one-time uptick in orders \"should quickly fizzle out in a powerful whiplash,\" Ghose says. The original demand slowdown, which caused the inventory glut, is likely to worsen. That's why Ghose says he's telling a \"downbeat story,\" longer-term. \u001d  Optimists point to the stellar performance of the second half of last year -- after a lousy first six months -- as reason not to panic. But Ghose maintains that fundamentals -- such as capital-spending growth -- were still weakening in last year's second-half boomlet, setting tech up for some painful quarters, starting in the fall. Here's hoping he's wrong. \b \u001d  Now, for something completely different. Apple's earnings are the flip side to our January of disappointment. The electronics maker had record profits in its fiscal first quarter, whipping consensus estimates by 46%. How many Nanos did you give as presents over the holidays? \u001d  Apple sold more than 21 million of the handheld music players, up about 50% from the total a year earlier. Still, the stock didn't benefit, as the company's projections for the rest of the year were typically sanguine. Its shares closed at 88.50, off 7% after the earnings report. \u001d  But the profits fun doesn't stop here, says Goldman Sachs analyst David Bailey. \"Apple's over-the-top December quarter results punctuate what has been a really strong year for the company, as well as starts the clock on what should be the next big growth phase,\" he comments. \u001d  The analyst actually lowered his estimates slightly for the first half as the company introduces new products, such as Intel-powered Macs with new operating systems. But he raised his estimates for this calendar year and 2008, based on high expectations for meaningful contributions from the recently unveiled iPhone smartphone. Bailey raised his price target to 110 from 102. \u001d  While there are some concerns that the iPhones might be too pricey at about $400 and $500, there already are suggestions that Apple plans to reduce prices systematically, as it has on items such as the iPod. \u001d  iSuppli, a supply-chain research outfit, predicts that every iPhone sold initially will produce about a 50% gross margins for Apple and its carrier, AT&T. That leaves room\"for aggressive price declines going forward,\" says Jagdish Rebello, a director and principal analyst at iSuppli. \u001d  Apple will need it. iSuppli says there are 14 music-enabled mobile phones like iPhone already available from Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and LG.

It's half absurd to suggest that a 25-basis-point overnight rate, or even 0.50%, is excessive, though in the past five years it was hardly excessive to be close to zero percent. It took that simply to get the economy above the line. Japan is in a demographic trap that will be difficult to get out of. Resuming or moving to a path that the rest of the world considers normal in terms of short-term rates is excessive. \u001d  Zulauf: They have drained too many reserves. Soon the Bank of Japan will come out with a revision of loan growth. The old number showed a nice pickup in loan growth in the past 12 months, but I hear the new number will show it was flat for the whole period and the economy was not doing as well as perceived. \u001d  Gross: I agree with that. The problem in Japan is the consumer, who is older relative to almost all parts of the rest of the world, barring Italy and maybe Germany. It's going to be very difficult to get consumption up in Japan. It is an export-dominated economy, and they have seen their best growth for the next few years. \u001d  My third pick is a plain, old-fashioned Pimco closed-end fund, Pimco Strategic Global Government Fund [RCS]. As Barron's readers know, I have been a supporter of closed-end funds. When purchased at net asset value or at discounts to NAV, they can be attractive. They can be bought easily, much like a stock on the New York Stock Exchange, which in fact is where they are listed. I've done lots of personal investing in municipal closed-end funds, buying them at 10% and 15% discounts. Typically, over time, those discounts close up, and that's one way of getting potential appreciation. The other is that you're buying $1.15 of assets for a buck. I like to do that. \b \u001d  Barron's: Aren't there some negatives? \u001d  Gross: One negative is that most closed-end funds are levered; they tend to have 50% leverage, borrowing at overnight lending rates or preferred-money-market rates. That allows them to provide higher yields. When you have a flat-to-negative yield curve, the leverage tends to work against you, as it does in most asset classes. \u001d  Pimco Strategic Global Government is a plain-vanilla, triple-A-type government fund. It doesn't invest in emerging markets. You won't find Brazilian or Argentine bonds in it. You'll find U.S. bonds and some of the Japanese bonds I just talked about. There's very little credit risk; most of the risk is related to interest-rate movements and leverage. This is a dollar-based fund. It yields 7.5%, even with triple-A government bonds. Is the dividend at risk? My lawyers would always counsel me to say that dividends are at risk. They are simply voluntary disbursements on the part of corporations. This dividend was cut because of the increasing cost of leverage about five months ago, though I expect it to be stable for the rest of 2007. \b \u001d  Barron's: How does the fund trade relative to NAV? \u001d  Gross: It trades at a 2% premium to net asset value, though I'd prefer to buy it at a discount. I'd like to underline for readers the importance of timing with regard to all investments, but particularly closed-ends, because they are thinly capitalized and thinly traded. You're talking 30,000 or 40,000 shares a day here. You don't want to place an order for thinly traded stocks or funds without recognition of potential price movements. You want to make sure your order reflects value. Don't go rushing in thinking you are capturing a 7.50% yield and give your broker a market order. Make sure it's price-specific, and that you're not taken to the cleaners by the bid-asked spread or by a rush of orders in the days after publication. That's critical for many of these recommendations. \u001d  Faber: In the U.S., the 30-year bond is yielding around 4.75%, and in Europe government bonds yield less than 4%. How does this fund achieve a 7.50% dividend? Does it invest in emerging-market debt? \u001d  Gross: Not at all. It invests in a lot of U.S. mortgages, which start out yielding 5.50% to 6%. Then there's the 50% leverage. \u001d  Faber: A few years ago you were negative about stocks. Yet, your first recommendation, the iShares MSCI EAFE, was a stock fund. Are you still bearish on stocks? \u001d  Gross: No. That doesn't mean they're not at risk, but at current multiples, both here and in Europe, as a risk asset class they rank relatively high. We have levered risk assets in many areas to levels that are inappropriate and almost ridiculous. To toss stocks into the basket is a mistake, however. That doesn't mean they won't go down in the short term, but they are decently valued compared to all other risk assets. \u001d  My last recommendation, BlackRock Floating Rate Income Strategies Fund [FRA], is another closed-end. It was issued by BlackRock -- I like to spread the wealth around -- and continues to be managed by the firm. It doesn't have interest-rate risk. This one has credit risk. There are about 10 or 15 of this class of floating-rate income closed-end funds; Pimco offers two. They are bank-loan oriented. The BlackRock offering makes bank loans, most of which are Ba-rated, plus or minus. They can be loans to rather major corporations. \b \u001d  Barron's: What is the duration on most of them? \u001d  Gross: Most of the loans have a term of about five years, with call provisions less than that. Thus, the life of the loan, depending upon the attractiveness of the spread, can be five years or less. But by the nature of the instrument, they adjust on a quarterly basis to changes in the fed-funds rate, and in LIBOR [London interbank offered rate]. That's why these funds have appreciated in price significantly in the past year or two. As the Fed has raised interest rates to 5.25%, these funds have benefited directly. Their dividends have gone higher and higher. If I'm wrong in terms of my Fed forecast and the Fed goes to 6% as opposed to 4.25%, BlackRock Floating Income would be able to add 75 basis points of yield simply on the basis of short-term money-market instruments. There is protection interest-rate-wise here. \u001d  The risk is on the credit side. Despite the bank-loan nature of the instruments, these are B-rated or Ba-rated securities for the most part of levered or semi-levered corporations. Reynolds American [RAI] is an example of a bank loan that can be purchased in the open market and by these funds. General Motors [GM] has a number of recently issued floating-rate loans that funds such as this have bought. Ford [F] has some. We are talking about Ba and B-rated securities that have some credit risk, but also interest-rate protection, which is a diversifier. \b \u001d  Barron's: Are they subordinate to other borrowers? \u001d  Gross: No, they are senior to other borrowers. A bank loan is almost always senior to other straight, and in some cases subordinated debt issued by a corporation. If a company fails, historically holders of bank debt recover on the order of 75 to 80 cents on the dollar, whereas a typical debt instrument would recover 40 cents. You have principal protection here from bank loans as opposed to normal debt instruments, so I like their long-term credit protection. I also like this fund because of its yield. It has an 8.10% yield that will hold at this level or maybe go a little higher over time. The fund has been conservative in terms of its dividend. The yield on most floating-rate closed-end funds approaches 9%. \u001d  In addition, the fund sells at a 6% discount to net asset value. You are buying a portfolio of loans initiated by banks and then sold, in this case to BlackRock, at a 6% discount. You're paying 106 or 106.5 cents for a buck. I prefer to buy this at a 10% discount, but 6% isn't bad for a floating-rate closed-end fund. \u001d  Gabelli: That's a great idea. Is it taxable? \u001d  Gross: This one is taxable, so it is better owned in an individual retirement account. Those are my picks. \b \u001d  Barron's: Thank you. Archie? \u001d  MacAllaster: I'm glad you asked me to speak before John, because my favorite stock is on his list. It's Lyondell Chemical [LYO], and it trades for 25.03. The earnings estimate for 2006 is $3.25 a share. The stock has ranged from 27.60 to 18.86; now it's closer to the high. Book value is $15 a share. My '07 estimate is $4-plus. They can earn quite a bit more than that, but I'm holding it at $4 and a lot of analysts who follow the stock are estimating a lot less. There must be a dozen or 14 who follow it. \u001d  Neff: That's a good number. It's the third-biggest chemical company in the U.S. \u001d  MacAllaster: I was about to say that. Lyondell owns 100% of a large oil refinery in Houston; it bought the Venezuelans' 41% stake. The company indicated recently that the refinery was earning about $2.20-$2.25 a share. The chemical operation will have more than $21 billion of annual revenue this year, and the company has added sales at very little cost to shareholders. Some might even say you're getting the chemical company for free, but that's probably a slight exaggeration. The dividend is 90 cents a share, and the yield is 3.5%. This is a global company; about 40% of its chemical operations are overseas. \u001d  I like to compare Lyondell to the No. 2 chemical company, DuPont [DD], which sells for 48. I'm not saying DuPont is a buy or a sell. Lyondell's sales in '07 will be about $29 billion. DuPont's are estimated to be $29.5 billion. Lyondell probably earned $3.25-$3.30 in '06, against $2.80 for DuPont. In '07, as I told you, my estimate is $4 a share for Lyondell, versus $3.25 for DuPont. Just remember, DuPont sells for 48, Lyondell for 25.50. \u001d  Gabelli: I am not going to defend DuPont, but a huge amount of its earnings comes from bioengineered seeds. It is the second- or third-largest seed company, so it gets a much higher valuation. \u001d  MacAllaster: The way I look at it, Lyondell is dirt cheap. \u001d  Witmer: Does it have much debt? \u001d  Neff: Monster debt, huge. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:04 ET (05:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6220f567234cfcbaae591d0f455cad95","symR":["NLX"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Analex Announces Merger Agreement With QinetiQ","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T15:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NLX"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  FAIRFAX, Va., Jan. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Analex Corporation (Amex: NLX), a leading provider of mission-critical professional services to U.S. federal government clients, today announced that it has signed a merger agreement with QinetiQ North America Operations LLC, a leading technology development and technical services company and a subsidiary of the British firm, QinetiQ Group plc.

It can tell you whether the issuing company is profitable, if those profits are growing or contracting and, in conjunction with the stock price, just how expensive the shares are. An analogous figure for a washing machine might give you an idea of its quality, reliability and its cost, relative to its peers. \u001d  Not surprisingly, a lot of financial Websites offer EPS news, projections and analysis, and, given that we've just embarked on a new earnings season (for the fourth quarter of 2006), I thought it would be a good time to explore what's available. \u001d  First, keep in mind that earnings announcement dates aren't carved in stone. Companies sometimes are reticent to commit to lengthy advance notice about when they'll report; worse, some posted dates can be inaccurate. Still, there are watchdog sites that attempt to keep pace with the most likely dates. \b \u001d  Analysts who follow public companies make their earnings estimates available to various services that compile them into averaged, or \"consensus,\" estimates. One of the best places to get a quick peek at these estimates is Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com). Type in a symbol for a quote, then click Analyst Estimates. You'll see stats on current earnings and revenue forecasts; history, trends and revisions. You'll also find profit-growth estimates, compared to market benchmarks'. \u001d  Yahoo! Finance -- like most major general investing sites -- provides a daily calendar of earnings announcements and access to conference calls and earnings releases. It also chronicles surprises: profits that beat or fall short of the consensus. \u001d  Zacks Investment Research (www.zacks.com), which pioneered consensus estimates and EPS surprises, also provides coverage. Go to www.zacks.com/research/earnings for its free information. You'll find a calendar of coming announcements, summaries of earnings news, declarations of profits and revisions of estimates. \u001d  But Zacks isn't just for earnings estimates anymore. It provides an impressive array of data, analysis and tools for general market research. Zacks Premium, which costs $24.95/month or $199/year, includes content like proprietary stock rankings, custom screening and investment strategies. For investors who want research tools plus stock-picking help, Zacks is one of the best bargains in this class. \u001d  Another paid Zacks' service is the Surprise Trader, which uses a proprietary indicator to predict which stocks will rise in the weeks following an earnings announcement. It's pricey, $1,495 per year, but the Surprise Trader does carry a money-back guarantee. \u001d  You can also browse earnings calendars on the free side of Briefing.com, one of the best sites for keeping track of fast-breaking numbers and related analysis. More active traders should consider its Platinum service ($29.95/month or $300/year). Under the Calendars tab, you'll find numerous entries related to earnings. There's a calendar with estimates from both Reuters and Zacks. Confirmed dates are check-marked; others are tentative. \u001d  Monthly calendars by sector are also displayed, as are current earnings surprises. Still another series of pages displays 30 days of \"earnings guidance\" --  companies' own judgments about their future performance. Colored arrows indicate whether a company's earnings are running above, below or in line with consensus forecasts. Revenue estimates are also provided. \u001d  Probably the simplest, fastest place we found for basic calendar info is Earnings.com, powered by Thomson Street Events (www.streetevents.com). This is also a good (and free) source of information on splits and dividends, initial public offerings, conferences and Webcasts. \u001d  Not all earnings estimates are compiled by analysts. \"Whisper numbers\" reflect the earnings world's rumor mill, figures bandied about by trading desks, chat rooms and blogs, and on various Websites. The best of the latter group is Earnings Whispers.com, an old-timer in Web years (and it looks like the site's interface hasn't been updated since we first looked at it many years ago). Free services include a calendar of verified and tentative announcements, news and discussion. \b \u001d  Those who operate behind Earnings Whispers.com's basic subscriber wall ($14.95/month) get daily updates on the compiled whisper numbers, on the site and in an e-mail. Each company covered is represented in a good one-page profile that includes a wrap-up of the current quarter with the related outlook and trends. An alert flashes if there's a new \"whispering,\" which is an EPS prediction from a source whom the service identifies by name. A premium service ($99.95/ month) offers more depth and breadth that can lead to trading opportunities based on more credible whispers. Both the basic and premium versions, however, can aid traders. \u001d  WhisperNumber.com assembles its earnings whisper numbers based on the views of individual investors. Interesting to see, but I'm not sure I'd bet the bank on these numbers. \u001d  There are other sites that will lighten your wallet a bit but could also provide helpful bits and pieces of your earnings research. The Fly on the Wall (www.theflyonthewall.com) sends market-breaking news and earnings predictions from the pros out to subscribers all day long; $25/month. Wall Street Horizon (www.wallstreethorizon.com) claims to have the most comprehensive and accurate earnings dates and conference-call schedule. (I was impressed.) The site's analysts speak with reporting companies regularly. It runs $695/year for institutional investors; half that for individuals. That's about the price of a solid, dependable washing machine  -- well worth the cost if it helps you locate a high-quality stock. \u001d  --- \u001d  e-mail: electronicinvestor@yahoo.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:07 ET (05:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"68855f6a105615b6ad9a2d7bcbdfd02f","symR":["ACGL","BHI","BRL","C","COF","DD","EFA","EWS","EXV2.XE","FD","FRA","GE","GLW","HIG","LYO","MEDI","NBR","PBR","PETR4.BR","PXD","RCL","RCS","SYMC","YAR.OS","YARIY","YRCW","BRPETRACNPR6","DE0006289358","NO0010208051","US1729671016","US2635341090","US3696041033","US4165151048","US9855771054"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(1/22) 2007 Barron's Roundtable -- Part -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T05:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACGL","BHI","BRL","C","COF","DD","EFA","EWS","EXV2.XE","FD","FRA","GE","GLW","HIG","LYO","MEDI","NBR","PBR","PETR4.BR","PXD","RCL","RCS","SYMC","YAR.OS","YARIY","YRCW","BRPETRACNPR6","DE0006289358","NO0010208051","US1729671016","US2635341090","US3696041033","US4165151048","US9855771054"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","BTC","CEF","CFN","CHC","CHM","CHS","CMT","DRG","DRL","EQS","EXT","IDD","INF","INP","INS","OIE","OIL","OIS","RCS","RTB","RTS","SOF","TRK","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XOBX","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\u001d  MacAllaster: Had they sold their portion of the Houston refinery, they would have reduced their debt considerably. But on the other side of the equation, the refinery's cash flow is enormous. They did a smart thing. The debt will come down rapidly. They've already reduced it by $2 billion or $3 billion. My target on the stock is 40. \u001d  My second stock is Hartford Financial Services. I'm doing relative values this year. In 2005, they earned $7.60 a share, and mind you, that was the year with all the hurricanes. They have a very balanced financial business in annuities, life insurance, general insurance, and fire and casualty. The earnings estimate for 2006 is $9 a share. For '07 it's $9.70. The P/E based on '07 results is about 9.5. The dividend yield is 2.15%. Return on equity is about 15%, and book value is about $58 a share. The company sells for about 1.6 times book. The growth rate is about 10%. Hartford has raised its dividend in each of the past nine years, and its P/E in the past few years has been about 12. Hartford also has a large stock-buyback program of $5 billion, roughly 2% of outstanding stock. \b \u001d  Barron's: Where is the stock? \u001d  MacAllaster: The stock sells for 91.67, and my target price is 115-120. Hartford is a large company, with more than $300 billion of total assets. Prudential Financial [PRU] is a little less than $400 billion and MetLife [MET] is a little over $500 billion. They both sell for 15-16 times '07 earnings. Hartford sells for less than 10 times. They yield about 1.1%, Hartford more than 2%. On a relative basis, Hartford is a good buy. \u001d  Next, I've got a new insurance company, in business since 2001. It's Arch Capital [ACGL]. \u001d  Gabelli: I love the name, Arch. \u001d  MacAllaster: I wish that Arch were me. The stock sells for 66.77. Earnings per share in '05 were $3.84. In '06 they should have earned about $8.50, and in '07 they will probably do about $8.50 again, because premiums are going to come down. They'll be lucky to earn the same $8.50. This is a Bermuda company. Though it's relatively new, it has experienced insurance executives and a solid book of business. It has always shown an operating profit, even in 2005, with all the hurricanes. The combined ratio -- expenses and losses -- was 95.8% in 2005. Arch does general insurance and reinsurance. It has 74 million shares outstanding and $13 billion of total assets. Book value is about $45, so it sells for 1.5 times book. The balance sheet is clean, and very important, it doesn't have a lot of old problems, spelled \"asbestos.\" It's a cheap stock with a long way to go. My target is 90. \u001d  Black: We own a few Bermuda reinsurers. Whether it's RenaissanceRe [RNR] or IPC [IPCR] or Arch, they had a benign year. They aren't going to get much multiple expansion because there's such volatility in weather year to year. \u001d  MacAllaster: When you're paying 90 bucks for $8.50 of earnings, that's not a high multiple. \u001d  Black: I'm not convinced they're going to sell at 10 and 11 times earnings. Many are selling at 6.5 and 7 times earnings now. \u001d  MacAllaster: All I'm saying is that this is a high-quality company. It has experienced people, and they started it fresh. I think they will increase assets massively year after year, and on a long-term basis you're going to make money in it. \u001d  Gabelli: How much of the business is old-fashioned property and casualty, and how much is reinsurance? \u001d  MacAllaster: It's about 40%-plus general insurance and 55% reinsurance. Now, on to Capital One Financial [COF]. We all see their ads on television. The stock trades on the Big Board [New York Stock Exchange] for 77.16. In 2005 they earned $6.80 a share. The estimate for 2006 is $7.75, and for '07 it's $8.25. [The company reported 2006 earnings of $7.62 a share Thursday.] The stock sells for under 10 times '07 estimated earnings. Capital One is the last remaining large credit-card company that hasn't been taken over by some other financial institution. \u001d  Black: They've been buying. They bought North Fork Bancorp, among others. \u001d  MacAllaster: They also bought Hibernia. They will end up with more than $150 billion of banking assets, which puts them in the top 15 in terms of asset size among U.S. banks. The company has a reasonable banking business, with 700-800 branches. It has gone international in its credit-card business. It's deserving of a higher multiple -- say, the 12 times earnings a lot of banks sell for. People are starting to look at it more as a bank. The American Banker named Capital One's CEO, Richard Fairbank, banker of the year. Earnings growth could be 7%-9%, and my target price is 90. \u001d  Black: We owned North Fork and opted to sell it because 32% of Capital One's portfolio is Alt-A [alternative documentation] and sub-prime loans. This is an accident waiting to happen. Some home buyers with option ARMs [adjustable-rate mortgages] have negative equity now. \u001d  MacAllaster: The company manages it well. I think you made a mistake. The 52-week range on Capital One is 69.30 to 90.04. \u001d  Switching to technology, it's time to buy Corning [GLW] again. Everyone here will probably tell me I'm wrong on this one, but I've bought and sold it for a lot of years, and made money on it. I'm recommending it in a range. There are speculators in Corning big-time, both up and down. The stock sold as high as 29.61 this year and as low as 17.50, and it's now 19.04, very close to the lows of the year. A lot of the selling seemed to come about because prices have been cut 40%, 50%, 60% on the new televisions for which they make glass panels. They probably have 45% of the business. By lowering prices, however, TV manufacturers are going to sell many more units. \u001d  Witmer: Archie, if you walk around on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, old Sony TVs, like WEGAs, are out on the street. \u001d  MacAllaster: Everybody wants a new one. \u001d  Hickey: The problem is, there's such a glut now. That's why prices have fallen so much. For example, LCD [liquid crystal display] TV prices fell by 50% more than Circuit City had budgeted, and plasma-TV prices have plummeted more than three times expectations. It's so bad that the second-largest flat-panel maker, LG Philips, is cutting its capital spending this year by 67% compared with last year. AUO Optronics [AUO], Chi Mei Optoelectronics [3009.Taiwan], and other panel makers are cutting production right now. As they cut, Corning's glass orders go down. \u001d  MacAllaster: You're probably short. \u001d  Hickey: I'm not short Corning. \u001d  MacAllaster: Then I'd better add quickly that they have other businesses. The company makes about 22% on capital. It has about $1 billion-$1.4 billion in debt and about $2 billion of liquid assets. Corning is in diesel controls, which should do well with the surge of interest in the environment. The company has had a great history of innovation. It will earn $1.05-$1.10 for 2006, and $1.25-$1.30 this year. It is cheap compared to most technology companies. \b \u001d  Barron's: You're confident about '07 earnings? \u001d  MacAllaster: They ought to be able to make that, maybe do even better. Television prices may be lower, but manufacturers have to put glass on all of them. \u001d  Hickey: Pacific Media came out with a forecast on flat-panel TV sales about a month ago. They see a 42% increase in last year's revenue, but their revenue-growth forecast is zero for this year. That feeds back to all the suppliers. They're going to force Corning's glass sales down. I heard a great line last month in a conference call: There's no nourishment in a bowlful of volume. That was from one of the big retailers, talking about flat-panel TVs. \u001d  MacAllaster: So sales will come down some. But TVs still need glass. \u001d  Gabelli: Also, Corning is finally laying optical fiber again. \u001d  MacAllaster: I've got one more name: Pioneer Natural Resources [PXD]. It trades on the Big Board. Book value is $16 a share. It costs them about $8 to find a barrel of oil. Most other producers have a $10 to $12 cost. The stock's high was 54.40 last year, and the low was 36.43. It trades around 38 now. Pioneer pays a small dividend of 26 cents a share, but it's a cash-flow story. The company sold forward a lot of its production and got lower prices for it, but used the money to buy back shares. They reduced the capitalization from 145 million shares to 125 million, and are on their way to 100 million. \u001d  A lot of the forward sales are coming off now. They should earn about $2 to $2.05 a share for 2006, and $3.50 to $3.60 for this year. They increased reserves 10% last year, and think they can do this for another three to four years. Pioneer is the third-largest independent oil and gas producer in the U.S. They have sold off some foreign assets and put the money in the U.S. Exploration results have been excellent. Capital spending was about $270 million over the past two years. That's about 12 bucks a share per year. \u001d  Black: Actually, until recently they had bad luck drilling reserves. One of the hedge funds [Highfields Capital Management] took a big stake and shook up management.

The company's online home page last week featured some of the bags that resembled many Coach creations. \u001d  Can this sort of merchandising work? Hurley thinks mid-tier companies like Banana Republic will have a hard time commanding prices anywhere near those that premium brands enjoy. \u001d  Indeed, the net losers in the new world of Plutonomy are mass-market brands. Their core customers aren't enjoying much of an increase in income, while their home equity has slipped and they're being squeezed by inflation, albeit it mild, in necessities. \u001d  For every Target (TGT) that has had some success in wooing the style-conscious with clever store and product design, there is a Wal-Mart (WMT) that stumbles trying. Middle-of-the-road department stores such as J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS) have had good runs, sprucing up product lines for those of moderate incomes, but the headwinds will turn brisk if the income concentration story plays on. \u001d  Yet this winner-take-most setup doesn't mean that the stock market will only reward companies that ply the most posh ZIP codes. There are several stock plays on the cash-strapped consumer. \u001d  Richard Bernstein, strategist at Merrill Lynch, said last month that dollar stores were an under-appreciated group that would be a big beneficiary of lower energy prices in 2007. So far, these lower fuel costs have arrived in a dramatic way. If, indeed, real wage growth turns positive in a tight labor market in the latter stages of a profit cycle -- as many now predict -- then the dollar stores could get even more of a lift. Stocks of companies like Family Dollar (FDO) and Big Lots (BIG) have been perky in recent months. \u001d  Obvious losers as many lower-income consumers become over-extended are subprime lenders, several of which have already filed for bankruptcy protection while others have seen their shares walloped. \u001d  In a dimmer corner of the financial industry sit pawn shops and payday lenders, which are thriving. Stephanie Pomboy of MacroMavens has been cited more than once in Barron's targeting these lenders of last resort as a play on the housing bust. \u001d  EZCorp (EZPW) and First Cash Financial (FCFS) are winners here. Be warned, however, that regulatory and legislative rumblings are emerging that would crack down on the practices of payday lenders, which many view as predators on the poor. \b \u001d  Kapur's Plutonomy theory also helps make sense of what appear superficially to be some disconnects in the economic data. \u001d  For instance, it has become popular among some Wall Street economists to marvel at the abiding growth in overall consumer spending, even as gasoline prices spiked in 2005, as housing turnover collapsed last year, and as consumer-confidence surveys have periodically dipped to dour levels. The simple fact is that the swollen incomes and investment accounts of the top several percent of households can drive an awful lot of spending. \u001d  The $16.5 billion that Goldman Sachs (GS) paid its employees last year makes up for an awful lot of wage stagnation elsewhere. Multiply that by all the other beneficiaries of the asset-economy boom -- merger lawyers, hedge-fund impresarios and art dealers -- and it helps explain why broad consumption figures defy the democratically sampled surveys of consumer confidence. It's a phenomenon that many find uncomfortable, but it's a fact. \u001d  Barron's economics editor Gene Epstein points out that many economists focus on the government's disposable personal income figures to divine the public's spending power. \u001d  But this number is strongly influenced, quarter to quarter, by \"factors affecting the wealthy, such as fluctuations in investment income and the change in the tax take due to more people moving into high brackets during an expansion. And since consumer spending by the wealthy is generally impervious to income, that explains why DPI is a far less useful number than wages and salaries in explaining consumer spending,\" he maintains. \u001d  Similar technical factors involving capital gains among the wealthy also serve to depress the national savings rate, often rendering it negative. While most households, it's true, fail to save much, if anything, the country is producing a sizable nest egg. \u001d  Kapur invokes the fast-expanding ratio of wealthy citizens' net worth to income. This has allowed them to spend more quickly than income rises. To some degree this is rational, and bodes well for the continuance of high-end consumption. \b \u001d  This is not to suggest that the economy can thrive indefinitely with an ever-widening income gulf, especially if the earnings of those at the median point or below stagnate or backslide for any stretch of time. \u001d  And, as anyone who watches cable news or reads the papers can affirm, the conspicuous divide between the often overindulgent rich and the struggling average worker has become a potent -- and potentially explosive -- political and social issue. \u001d  Several members of Congress were elected last year on sharply populist positions. Former Sen. John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat, is readying his 2008 presidential bid on his tested theme of \"Two Americas.\" And some media personalities are forging lucrative careers decrying outsourcing and scapegoating immigrants. \u001d  The outrage among the public and in Washington about executive-pay deals of the sort that handed Robert Nardelli $210 million for departing as Home Depot (HD) CEO will spur congressional hearings and possibly legislation before long. \u001d  While the notion of the estate tax remains unpopular in polls, even though just a tiny fraction of Americans will ever be subject to it, chances of repeal have dimmed. \u001d  History has shown that Americans, more than most of their counterparts around the world, favor equality of opportunity but shun measures to actively redistribute income. They choose to preserve the possibility of outsized rewards, so long as they believe a decent proportion of society has a legitimate shot at winning them. \u001d  Still, when the pie is being cut as unevenly as it is now, support grows for bolstering labor's slice of economic rewards. This may lead to more egalitarian measures and perhaps have a shaming effect on, say, corporate board members determining how much to pay a new chief executive. \u001d  Overseas, authoritarian or socialist governments might well be moved to target the hyper-rich of their countries or foreign interests who have hit the globalization jackpot. Who knows what a Hugo Chavez is contemplating? \u001d  There's little evidence to suggest that any likely measures will derail the long-lived emergence of an ever-richer tier of achievers, entertainers, asset-mediators and inheritors. But it's clear that the world of Plutonomy is creating dangers as well as opportunities as it evolves. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:06 ET (05:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6db3b47851c4dce1c330797e0271fc14","symR":["CBS","CBSA","GOOG"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(1/20) Google's Next Ad Gambit May Be Inside Videogames","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T05:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBS","CBSA","GOOG"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","BRD","ENT","ISV","MED","TMF","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Nick Wingfield and Kevin J. Delaney \u001d  Google Inc.'s efforts to broker advertisements beyond the Web could soon expand into ads that appear in videogames. \u001d  The Mountain View, Calif., company is in talks to acquire Adscape Media Inc., a closely held San Francisco company whose technology allows for the delivery of advertising over the Internet and placement within videogames, according to people familiar with the matter. They added that a deal could be reached as early as next week. \u001d  While the possible terms of a deal aren't known, Microsoft Corp. last year acquired Massive Inc., a company that delivers in-game ads, for close to $200 million. \u001d  An acquisition of Adscape, if completed, would allow Google to offer the hundreds of thousands of advertisers who currently buy online ads through its system to also buy ads that appear within videogames. The market for delivering ads into games -- such as a virtual billboard on a racetrack or a poster in a boxing arena -- is still in its infancy, but major games publishers such as Electronic Arts Inc. believe it could be a lucrative business and many are pursuing it aggressively. Sending ads over the Internet is just now becoming more feasible through new game consoles such as Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360, which are designed to be connected to the Internet. \u001d  One person familiar with the matter says Google for months has been discussing with game publishers the prospect of delivering ads over the Internet into the action of their games. \u001d  If completed, a deal with Adscape would form part of an ambitious Google effort to broker advertising across many types of media globally. The Internet company, whose 2006 revenue is expected to top $10 billion on the strength of its online-ad sales, currently is testing systems for selling ads in newspapers and on radio, and has said it plans to extend into television ads. People familiar with the matter say it is discussing a possible agreement with CBS Corp. that would include brokering TV and radio advertisements. Both CBS and Google have declined to comment on any talks. \u001d  A Google spokesman declined to comment on any talks with Adscape, saying \"We are always considering new ways to extend Google's advertising program to benefit our users, advertisers and publishers. In-game advertising offers one such possible extension among many others.\" \u001d  Adscape Chairman Bernard Stolar said he \"has spoken to every major player\" about a possible acquisition of Adscape, but there currently is no such deal. \u001d  People familiar with the matter say Google had looked at Massive prior to Microsoft's acquisition of the company. A purchase of Adscape would add a new front to expanding competition between Google and Microsoft, which today stretches from Web search to word processing. Google could look to form an alliance with Microsoft's archrival in the games console business, Sony. \u001d  In-game advertising has attracted an array of contenders, including IGA Worldwide Inc. and Double Fusion Inc. Adscape's chairman Mr. Stolar is a well-connected veteran of the games business, having previously served as an executive at Sega, Sony's U.S. games division and Atari, and could help Google form crucial partnerships with publishers. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:00 ET (05:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"700742affd1948caacc8281d4299a1b9","symR":["OPWV"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Musiwave Secures Exclusive on New Shakira Ringtone","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T09:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OPWV"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"Established Recording Industry Relationships Provide Added Value to Musiwave's Operator Customers \b \b \u001d  REDWOOD CITY, Calif. and MIDEM, CANNES, France, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Musiwave, an Openwave company (Openwave Systems Inc.

NetJets couldn't meet the enormous demand for its private-jet flights over the Thanksgiving holiday. Imports of French cognac into China surged 24% in 2006. And, last May, an unidentified Russian bought Dora Maar with Cat for $95 million, the second-highest price ever for a Picasso. \u001d  Never in history have the haves had so much. Burgeoning wealth and incomes from globalizing industries, swelling asset markets, media ubiquity and fast-developing emerging economies are accruing disproportionately to the entrepreneur class and the already rich. This is giving the world's affluent a greater capacity to splurge, build, invest and gamble than ever before. \u001d  Those of lesser means in the developed economies are suffering or stagnating financially by comparison, though in absolute terms standards of living are holding up or advancing modestly. Thus do we see the expanding \"wealth gap\" that populist politicians bemoan, capitalists celebrate and editorialists puzzle over. While there are some aspects of the income-and-wealth divergence that can be explained by cyclical forces, the long-term pattern in which the rich get rapidly richer seems durable. And there remain exploitable investment opportunities tied to this trend. \u001d  The numerical evidence is plentiful, thanks to data collectors who want to reverse the trend or take advantage of it. For years, both the number of wealthy households and their aggregate resources have been growing much faster then world gross domestic product. The latest Merrill Lynch-CapGemini World Wealth Report estimates that the number of people globally with financial assets exceeding $1 million climbed 6.5% in 2005, and their combined financial wealth rose 8.5%, to $33.3 trillion, for an average of $3.8 million each. It's getting to the point where \"millionaire\" will no longer serve as useful shorthand for defining who's rich. \b \u001d  The financial net worth of this segment grew 20% in North America, 23% in Latin America, 50% in the Middle East, 15% in Asia and 9% in Europe. \u001d  In the U.S., according to the liberal think tank Economic Policy Institute, the richest 1% of Americans had net wealth 190 times that of the median household, up from a ratio of 168 in 1998 and 131 in 1983. The top 1% owned 37% of all domestic stocks held by individuals in 2004, and the top 10% owned 79% of all stock. The real income of the richest 5% of U.S. residents climbed an aggregate 31% from 1985 through 2004, versus 14% for the middle 20% and 12% for the bottom 20%. \u001d  Though academics continue to seek definitive causes for this widening of the wealth divide (see \"Wealth Inequality: Data and Models,\" www.nber.org/papers/ w12550) several forces clearly seem to contribute to it. \u001d  The income premium on higher education has grown in recent years, as the economy became more service-based and rewarded those with better communication, organizational and creative skills. And educated folks have gotten better at passing on educational and economic advantages to their children, while those lacking education have fewer reliable, good-paying manufacturing jobs available to them. This contributes to a winner-take-most economy, with slight inflation-adjusted declines in the median household income in recent years. \u001d  The opening of world economies to competitive forces and capitalist incentives has allowed innovative people to access deep global financial markets. Lower tax rates on capital in the U.S. and elsewhere obviously have played a role, as well. \u001d  With technology allowing cheap global communication, information and entertainment products can easily reach a vastly larger audience than ever before. Economists have long theorized that technology would help create a class of super-rich celebrities. \u001d  Tom Cruise is worth what he is because his movies can address markets numbering billions. Satellite TV has meant that English soccer star David Beckham could go from a team in Manchester to one in Madrid to, this month, one in Los Angeles, where he was given a $250 million, five-year contract and will be watched by sports fans in Europe, Africa, Latin America and Fresno. \b \u001d  From a cyclical angle, the percentage of U.S. GDP now attributable to corporate profits is near a multi-decade high. These profits are driven by global demand and fast productivity gains. They drive strong dividend and capital-gains income toward the affluent, while restraining wage growth. UBS points out that prior profit cycles also have seen the median wage stagnate until the middle of an economic expansion, after which it gains some ground. \u001d  Finally, this wealth buildup has created plenty of well-paying jobs in the asset-churning professions. The American service economy is commonly thought of as relying on fast-food soda jerks and hair stylists. But among America's key exports is that investment banker in the Upper Class section of a Virgin Atlantic flight to London, preparing to cut a billion-dollar deal. \u001d  Ajay Kapur, global strategist at Citigroup, has been bundling these economic trends into a theme that he calls Plutonomy -- a global economy disproportionately propelled by the rich. To Kapur, the pattern of rapid and lopsided wealth buildup around the world is a durable one. \u001d  \"The spread of free financial markets, patent protection and the rule of law,\" he says, means that more smart, ambitious people than ever are able to turn a good idea into capital, and capital into liquid wealth. \u001d  Indeed, Kapur disagrees with the popular idea that the current high share of corporate profits in the developed economies -- which tends to be funneled into the pockets of the rich and of business owners -- will ebb toward historical norms. \u001d  \"To me, the profit share of GDP will get even higher, back to the (record) levels of the '50s,\" he says. Then, the arms buildup for the world wars spurred a long period of innovation and wealth accumulation, and the broken economies of Japan and Germany were rebuilt. Today, Kapur suggests, we are still reaping the benefits of Cold War spending, while financing the rapid expansion of China and India. \u001d  The spending power of the rich has grown so formidable and shows so few signs of reversing, investors probably still have an opportunity to harness this dynamic in their portfolios. \u001d  Citigroup, among other firms, has assembled a basket of stocks that should benefit from the Plutonomy thesis. Luxury-goods stocks have outperformed the market for more than a decade, so the market has to some degree sussed out the macro forces. Yet in many ways the backdrop remains favorable for the sector. \u001d  The Citi basket includes 24 names, including Coach (COH); Sotheby's (BID); Polo Ralph Lauren (RL); Tiffany (TIF); Four Seasons Hotels (FS) and, from Europe and Asia, Bulgari (BUL.Italy); Burberry (BRBY.UK); Mandarin Oriental (MAND. Singapore); Julius Baer (BAER.Switzerland); LVMH (MC.France); Porsche (POR3.Germany) and Shangri-La Asia (69.Hong Kong). \u001d  As noted, stocks of this ilk already have outpaced the broad market over recent years. And, on average, they carry higher valuations than the broad indexes. Still they haven't left the rest of the market in their wake. In the past year or so, this portfolio has merely kept pace with the global markets, Kapur notes. \b \u001d  He thinks that these stocks tend to hit their stride for outperformance in periods when equities are doing better than housing in the asset-class race. That, certainly, began to occur last year and could well continue for some time. He adds that, in the past, the relative valuation of the luxury group hasn't prevented it from delivering superior returns. \u001d  UBS strategist Tom Doerflinger last year put together a similar list, though this one geared toward companies with a strong franchise in selling to the affluent in the States. It includes such stalwarts as American Express (AXP); Best Buy (BBY); Constellation Brands (STZ); Merrill Lynch (MER); Nordstrom (JWN); Simon Property Group (SPG); Starbucks (SBUX) and Whole Foods Market (WFMI). \u001d  A distinguishing strength of luxury companies is their brands' enduring power, which transcends time, country and culture. Doerflinger notes that Louis Vuitton and Tiffany trace their history to the 19th century. \u001d  Because of their exclusivity -- real or imputed -- and the lack of price sensitivity of their core customers, these brands have enviable pricing power. Says James Hurley, who follows the luxury sector for Telsey Advisory Group in New York: \"I expect we'll continue to hear about sustained momentum\" in these businesses. \"We have price increases coming our way soon\" from European luxe specialists, inspired by strong demand and the greenback's decline last year versus the euro. That will provide a pricing umbrella for domestic competitors such as Coach and Tiffany, who will \"go along for the ride.\" \u001d  The best of these brands manage both to maintain their prestige at the high end and to broaden their base with entry-level items. Tiffany's $100 \"Return to Tiffany\" dog-tag charm necklaces and Coach's colorful $88 iPod covers do the trick. \u001d  In the market for consumables, newly well-off people in emerging economies grasp for Western brands that attest to success and disposable income. Starbucks has proven quite exportable, and European liquor companies are duking it out in the burgeoning Chinese cognac market. \b \u001d  The brand power of the luxury nameplates presents a tremendous challenge to more mainstream purveyors trying to gain a foothold in the wallets of the well-off. \u001d  \"For mid-market brands trying to trade up, it's easier said than done,\" Hurley observes. \"Just go to the department stores and see what's marked down.\" As an example, he points to the singer Gwen Stefani's handbags, listed at $300 to $600, as \"markdowns waiting to happen.\" \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:06 ET (05:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"775dcf36b4b75bb8085395fe90541123","symR":["532174.BY","IBN","INE090A01013"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE:India ICICI Bk 3Q Net Up 42% On Strong Loan Demand","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T10:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["532174.BY","IBN","INE090A01013"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \b   (Updates with company, analyst comments, background) \b \u001d  MUMBAI (Dow Jones)--ICICI Bank Ltd. (532174.BY), India's second-largest bank by assets, Saturday said its fiscal third-quarter net profit rose 42% on-year on the back of strong demand for loans, and added that it doesn't expect rising interest rates to slow credit growth. \u001d  Net profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2006, rose to INR9.10 billion ($205.5 million), from INR6.40 billion a year earlier, beating expectations. The averaged estimates from a Dow Jones Newswires poll of six analysts forecast a net profit of INR8.16 billion. \u001d  \"This has again been a strong quarter for the bank. I expected about a 28%-29% growth in PAT, but 42% is totally unexpected,\" said Sarika Lohra, an analyst at Mumbai-based brokerage Angel Broking. \u001d  ICICI Bank Joint Managing Director Kalpana Morparia attributed the growth to the 32% on-year increase in net interest income and a growth in fee income. \u001d  The New York-listed bank's quarterly net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest paid,  increased to INR17.09 billion, from INR12.96 billion a year earlier, driven by total asset growth of over 39%% and a net interest margin, or NIM, of 2.6%. The NIM expanded from 2.5% in the second quarter. \u001d  For the quarter, total advances grew 41% to INR1,727.63 billion from INR1226.13 billion a year earlier, led by demand for retail loans, both domestic as well as international, said Morparia. \u001d  \"We have not seen any slowdown in disbursements which would give us a cause to say that it won't increase,\" said Morparia. \"Overall, for the system credit growth that people are talking about of 30%, we certainly believe the system will be very close to that.\" \u001d  Lohra however said that customers have a \"limited repayment capacity and any further rate hikes will definitely hurt credit demand.\" \u001d  \"Last year, ICICI reported an overall credit growth of about 50%. This year, it has already slowed down to about 43%. I expect the growth to slow to about 35%-40% for the full year (ending March 31),\" she added. \u001d  She, however, expects the bank, which has a customer base of 22 million, to grow its net interest income on the back rising low cost deposits. \u001d  Deposits grew 47% on-year and of that, 75% came from the low-cost from retail banking space, said Lohra. \u001d  Morparia expects the bank to maintain NIM at current levels. \u001d  For ICICI Bank, retail assets constituted 68% of total advances and 65% of customer assets, the bank said in a statement. The bank has a 32% share of the retail loan market in India. \u001d  Banks such as ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank Ltd. (500180.BY) have benefited from India's booming economy, which grew 9.2% in the second quarter of the current fiscal year and is expected to grow at 8% for the full year. India's fiscal year runs from April to March. \u001d  Demand for credit has kept pace with the growing overall conomy, with around 30% growth on average each of the past three years - underscoring the need for funds from the housing and industrial sectors, as well as a rise in consumer-credit demand from an increasingly affluent middle class. \u001d  HDFC Bank, which has a strong presence in the retail lending market, earlier in the month posted a 32% growth in its net profit for the fiscal third quarter, spurred by a rise in interest income, and had said it expects growth to be stable despite rising interest rates. \u001d  Morparia expects the Reserve Bank of India to hike its key short term rates at its meeting Jan 31. \u001d  \"Given the way inflation numbers are coming in, I wouldn't rule out a rate hike,\" she said. \u001d  She expects a combination of higher interest rates and rising real estates prices to slow demand for home loans. \u001d  \"Disbursements have been relatively muted for the last nine months as compared to the previous nine months. Earlier, we were talking about a growth of 30%-35%, now we are talking about 25% to 30%,\" she said. \u001d  The bank's quarterly fee income increased 53% to INR13.45 billion from INR8.81 billion a year earlier. \u001d  \"The retail business, which includes the credit related fees, and the third party distribution, contributed about 57% of the fee income. The corporate banks contributed 27%, and about 13% was contributed by our international branches,\" said Morparia. \u001d  The bank plans to open 110 new branches by early February, Morparia said. \"And once the merger with Sangli Bank comes through, we'll add 200 more branches.\" \b \u001d  -By Romit Guha; Dow Jones Newswires; 91-9900181471; romit.guha@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 05:23 ET (10:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7a394aeb8f69866684b06073be3533f7","symR":["AAPL","BGGR.YY","BRT.YY","EMI.LN","UMG.XX","WMG","GB0000444736","US0378331005"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Indie Record Labels Pool Catalog In Challenge To Majors","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T12:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAPL","BGGR.YY","BRT.YY","EMI.LN","UMG.XX","WMG","GB0000444736","US0378331005"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","CPR","MED","MOV","PUB","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  CANNES, France (AP)--Independent record labels behind artists like The White Stripes, Deep Purple and Arctic Monkeys announced a global deal Saturday to pool access to their catalogs, seeking to grab a bigger share of online music sales from the major record companies. \u001d  Indies and their trade groups from more than a dozen countries signed up to Merlin, a nonprofit licensing agency that will cut deals on their behalf with download sites under the terms of the agreement unveiled at Midem, a music industry gathering in the French Riviera town of Cannes. \u001d  Smaller record companies with just a handful of successful artists fear being left behind in fast-growing digital music markets, where the majors - Universal Music Group, Sony Corp. (SNE)-Bertelsmann AG joing venture Sony BMG, EMI Group PLC (EMI.LN) and Warner Music Group Corp. (WMG) - enjoy a clear advantage in negotiations with online retailers such as Napster and Apple Computer Inc.'s (AAPL) iTunes. \u001d  \"Merlin may be the most important move we as independents will ever undertake to secure our mutual prosperity in this rapidly changing business landscape,\" said Brett Gurewitz, owner of U.S.-based Epitaph Records, whose artists include Tom Waits. \u001d  Indie labels account for about 80% of new music releases in major markets but only 30% of total revenues, according to industry data for 2005, partly because the majors spend more on marketing and have - until recently - maintained tight control over distribution channels. \u001d  That is already changing with the inexorable rise of online sales, analysts say, as more artists achieve success and celebrity through independent record companies, bypassing the top four. \u001d  \"While you don't get the benefit of their marketing capabilities, the reality is that the majority of good new music being adopted by younger people is mostly spread through social networking and personal recommendations,\" said Tim Bajarin, president of California-based consulting firm Creative Strategies. \u001d  \"The indies are where we see some of the fastest growth in the next generation of music adoption,\" he said. \u001d  Billed as a \"one-stop licensing shop,\" Merlin will allow download sites and other digital platforms to access its members' music in one deal, rather than the thousands of separate contracts they would otherwise have to negotiate. \u001d  Martin Mills, chairman of The Beggars Group - which produces Basement Jaxx, The White Stripes and the Pixies - said the new Netherlands-based agency would create a \"virtual fifth major\" from its combined catalog. \"Merlin will license collectively the individually unlicensable,\" he said. \u001d  The scheme is backed by indie labels and associations from countries including Australia, Brazil, the U.K., Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and the U.S. \u001d  According to Ted Schadler, an analyst with U.S.-based Forrester Research, the licensing deal could alter the balance of power within the music industry. Providing it's backed up with efficient management of payments and distribution, it would make it viable for even the smallest labels to sell music through mainstream sites by removing the cost of negotiating and managing an individual contract with each one. \u001d  \"What this does is level the playing field between indies and majors,\" Schadler said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 07:44 ET (12:44 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7c394899ceb9fdd37b4f3bf246936b10","symR":["ACGL","BHI","BRL","C","COF","DD","EFA","EWS","EXV2.XE","FD","FRA","GE","GLW","HIG","LYO","MEDI","NBR","PBR","PETR4.BR","PXD","RCL","RCS","SYMC","YAR.OS","YARIY","YRCW","BRPETRACNPR6","DE0006289358","NO0010208051","US1729671016","US2635341090","US3696041033","US4165151048","US9855771054"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(1/22) 2007 Barron's Roundtable -- Part -6-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T05:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACGL","BHI","BRL","C","COF","DD","EFA","EWS","EXV2.XE","FD","FRA","GE","GLW","HIG","LYO","MEDI","NBR","PBR","PETR4.BR","PXD","RCL","RCS","SYMC","YAR.OS","YARIY","YRCW","BRPETRACNPR6","DE0006289358","NO0010208051","US1729671016","US2635341090","US3696041033","US4165151048","US9855771054"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","BTC","CEF","CFN","CHC","CHM","CHS","CMT","DRG","DRL","EQS","EXT","IDD","INF","INP","INS","OIE","OIL","OIS","RCS","RTB","RTS","SOF","TRK","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XOBX","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\u001d  My next recommendation is Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras [PBR], the Brazilian oil company. The case for higher oil prices during the rest of this decade remains valid, based on continued industrialization and rising living standards in emerging economies, which will lead to higher demand. On the supply side, the depletion rate in existing fields is roughly 4% per year, and oil companies face increasing difficulties replacing production with new reserves. The structural tightness has developed over 20 years, and it won't go away soon. Now we see only a temporary softness due to a slowing economy, better weather and such. Oil prices this year may come down to the $50-a-barrel level, or lower, but they won't stay down. Exploration, production and servicing will continue to boom, and profit margins will stay high. I still expect the price of oil to be at $100 or higher by the end of this decade. \b \u001d  Barron's: Why Petrobras? \u001d  Zulauf: It is the seventh largest integrated oil company in the world. It operates primarily in Brazil and other parts of Latin America, but is diversifying into North America and Europe. Petrobras was established in 1953 as a Brazilian state enterprise with a monopoly in Brazil. In recent years a gradual deregulation and privatization program took effect in Brazil, and price controls were eliminated fully in 2002. In 2000 the government sold 153 million of the company's 634 million common shares in the form of ADRs [American depositary receipts]. \u001d  Petrobras plans to grow production by 7% to 8% in the next five years. It is active off the coast of Brazil, where it expects to increase production. On the one hand it is an integrated oil company operating successfully. On the other, you get exposure to an emerging economy and market. Interest rates are still high in Brazil but coming down. There is a long way to go before they are normalized. At the last peak, in 2000, earnings hit $4.92 a share. In 2002 they bottomed at $2.13. In 2005 Petrobras earned $9 per share, and the consensus for '06 is $11.50. Consensus estimates are virtually the same for 2007, as analysts are cautious. The stock trades for 8.5 times earnings, and is one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest, major oil stocks. The dividend yield is 3.8%. I would buy into a serious market shakeout. The shares could decline from today's 95 to 80 or so in the next few months. \b \u001d  Barron's: Isn't there political risk in Brazil? \u001d  Zulauf: There is always that risk in Latin America, but it is relatively low here. Brazil opened up its economy just a few years ago. The high on the stock was 107 in May, and the low was 69 in June. I see a similar correction coming, though the stock could double by the end of the decade. \u001d  My last pick is a Norwegian fertilizer company, Yara International [YAR.Norway.] The world population keeps growing, and a big part of it is getting wealthier, which is changing the way people feed themselves. A few years ago, I pointed to extremely depressed inventory levels in the grains. The inventory-consumption ratio in wheat is at a new 25-year low. Fertilizer companies sold 10% less fertilizer for last year's planting season, due to the fact that farmers' income was squeezed by rising energy prices and low grain prices. But a drought in Australia cut the harvest in half, and wheat prices rose sharply. Since midyear, grain prices have risen by more than 40%, energy prices are lower and farmers' income is improving. I expect fertilizer sales to go up for the new planting season. \b \u001d  Barron's: Tell us more about Yara. \u001d  Zulauf: In the past I recommended Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan [POT] and Kali und Salz, or K+S [SDF..Germany], which are still prime choices. So is Yara, which was spun out of Norsk Hydro [NHY] in 2004, at 41 Norwegian kroner. Yara produces and markets mineral fertilizer, which accounts for about 90% of sales. Gas and chemicals account for the rest. Its products include standard nitrogen fertilizers, and complex nitrogen, phosphate and potassium fertilizers. In contrast to Potash, whose fertilizer is mined, Yara's is based on natural gas, so there's a little more risk in the stock. \u001d  Yara operates worldwide, though its principal markets are Europe, North America and Brazil. The company employs 7,000 people. It has about $8 billion of sales. Yara should be a major beneficiary of rising grain prices, and will be able to sell more fertilizer. The stock trades in Norway for NOK137.50. \u001d  Black: It also trades over the counter in the U.S., under the ticker YARIY. \u001d  Zulauf: In Norway, the stock trades for NOK137. The company earned NOK8.95 in 2004 and NOK10.20 in '05. NOK10.70 is the consensus estimate for '06, and NOK11.70 is the estimate for 2007, though actual results could be a lot higher. The stock sells for 11 to 12 times earnings and yields 1.7%. The dividend is NOK2.35. This stock also has to correct first, maybe by 10%, to get to where I'd would want to buy it. \b \u001d  Barron's: Thank you, Felix. John, are you ready? \u001d  Neff: Picking up on Lyondell, I'm estimating $4.75 a share in '07 earnings, so the stock sells at an astronomical price-earnings multiple of 5.2. As you know, instead of selling its share of the refinery it owned in conjunction with the Republic of Venezuela, Lyondell bought Venezuela's 41% stake and turned a balance sheet that was starting to improve into one that is very leveraged now. The refinery in the Houston Ship Channel amounts to about half their earnings, or $2.35 a share, pro forma. They're a substantial chemical company. They saw a bit of deterioration in the fourth quarter in their principal chemical, the so-called ethylene chain, but it's starting to come back. I've got them earning 90 cents to a dollar a share in the quarter. \u001d  In the first quarter of this year their refinery is going down for two weeks. This is a turnaround they have to do every 18-24 months to keep it in good shape. [Last week Lyondell announced a major refinery overhaul of the sort it performs every 5-6 years. As a result, John now expects the company to earn $4.50 in 2007.]for the full year.] \b \u001d  Barron's: And the rest of the year? \u001d  Neff: In the last three quarters of '07 they should be going full blast. The chemcial business was spun out of Atlantic Richfield about 20 years ago. It uses as feedstock a high-sulfur oil, which sells at a considerable discount to sweet crude. By the third and fourth quarter, gross margins will run at about $14-$15 a barrel. Sweet-crude margins are around $4 a barrel so you can see why this is a good entity. It's the eighth-largest refinery in the country. They paid $2.1 billion for Venezuela's interest, but got a better crude price from Venezuela. \u001d  MacAllaster: For five years. They have a five-year contract. \u001d  Neff: Lyondell yields 3.6%, and pays a 90-cent dividend. It will pay back $1.5 billion of debt in the next few years. The company will be investment-grade maybe two or three years out, so they can do something with the dividend or buy back stock. \b \u001d  Barron's: What is your target? \u001d  Neff: It's 40, which would be up 60% from the current price. As far as 2008 earnings go, they won't have a turnaround at the refinery -- you do that every two years -- so they'll make more in the quarter. If they pay down that debt, interest costs will fall by about 30 cents a share. Add them up and you've got 60 cents in hand, no matter what happens on the other fronts. They're locked in the candy store, and will earn $5.30 to $5.50 in '08. \u001d  One caveat is refinery accidents, but that's one reason for the turnaround -- to make sure everything is working. \b \u001d  Barron's: What is your next stock? \u001d  Neff: Nabors Industries [NBR], the largest land driller in the world. It operates in North America, including Canada, but also offshore. It is not nearly as concentrated as some others. Natural-gas prices have gonethe wrong way recently, so the stock has fallen from 41 to 28.55. I've got them earning $4.60 a share this year, which makes for another astronomical P/E. \b \u001d  Barron's: On what price gas? \u001d  Neff: Maybe prices go a little higher than today's $6 per mcf or so. The futures contract for '08 is $8 per mcf. This is a coward's way to bet on natural gas, which, after all, is a clean fuel. Nabors is in a good position to punch more holes in the ground. You can buy all this at 6.2 times earnings. \u001d  Zuluaf: Right now, there is too much natural gas. \u001d  Neff: No, there is too little use of natural gas. I predict that before this winter is over, it will get cold. [Touche, John. Temperatures dropped below freezing in the Northeast last week.] \u001d  MacAllaster: You only have to go back a few years, and natural gas was $2.50 per mcf. It flipped to $10. It went back to $4. It's very volatile, so $6 isn't a bad price. \u001d  Black: I own Nabors, as well. The CEO, Gene Isenberg, is getting on in years. There is an issue of successorship. The company also is selling for about six times enterprise value to Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.] It could be vulnerable to a private-equity deal. \u001d  Samberg: These things'll all be gone. \u001d  Neff: My third recommendation is YRC Worldwide [YRCW], the old Yellow Freight. With Roadway Express and U.S. Freight they put together a tasty morsel, but it hasn't done well in the market. I've got them earning an aggressive $5.75 in 2007. It's 6.8 times earnings. Notice that all my stocks have a very low multiple. All of them could be candidates for buyouts. \b \u001d  Barron's: That's the biggest attraction, right? \u001d  Samberg: That's the common thread. \u001d  Neff: Obviously, Lyondell has a lot of debt. The other two, Nabors and YRC, are not that bad, though there is a question in YRC's case about pension obligations.

Symantec has yet to prove the wisdom of its controversial 2005 acquisition of Veritas Software, a maker of enterprise back-up software. \u001d  Symantec, known for its anti-virus software, last week lowered its profit projections for its fiscal third quarter, ended in December, to 10-11 cents a share, down from a previous forecast of 14-15 cents. \u001d  The Cupertino, Calif., company, with a market value of $16.4 billion, also slashed fiscal 2007 profit estimates to no higher than 39 cents a share from a range of up to 56 cents a share. The stock plunged about 13% on the pre-announcement to 17.79, then dropped to 17.54 by Friday. \u001d  Result: The shares are about 5% below where they were trading when we ran a favorable story on the company last fall (\"The Best Defense,\" Sept. 11, 2006). At the time, we postulated that Symantec Chief Executive John Thompson had worked out the kinks in his highly scrutinized Veritas merger, and that the consumer-oriented company was poised to benefit from its bold move into enterprise back-up software. \u001d  That was premature, judging by the magnitude of the quarterly miss. Symantec blamed much of the problem on its data-center management business (the old Veritas operations). And underperformance from the core Norton anti-virus and security software operations may have hurt more than the company let on, says Morgan Stanley software analyst Peter Kuper. \u001d  For now the stock is probably not much better than dead money. Kuper, long a bear on the Veritas deal, figures the stock could edge back up to 19 after last week's slamming -- but the optimism ends there. \u001d  Pricing on Norton products is under heavy pressure from Microsoft's (MSFT) entry into the consumer security area, as well as from a rebate program from rival McAfee (MFE). Research outfit NPD Group reported last week that both Symantec and McAfee have been losing market share to Microsoft and smaller competitors. \u001d  \"The best days [for Norton] are behind us,\" Kuper contends. \"You are going to see that the future is not particularly rosy.\" \u001d  Tougher sledding in the once-booming consumer security-software business wasn't totally unexpected, which is why Veritas-deal fans initially applauded the buyout. New revenues from enterprise clients were meant to provide a more balanced sales mix and greater growth. \u001d  But after losing top managers from Veritas, who clashed with Symantec's more button-downed culture, Symantec has yet to prove itself with enterprise customers. Though its Veritas unit is still the leader in data protection and recovery software, with about a 39% share of the market, researcher IDC says the company lost ground to IBM and EMC during the third quarter of last year, the most recently reported. \u001d  Some analysts say enterprise customers are resisting the premium prices that Symantec demands for renewable maintenance fees, as dissatisfaction with its customer service begins to fester. CEO Thompson hopes to improve margins by trimming operating costs, which critics argue is affecting the quality of the maintenance service. \u001d  The company, which declined to comment pending its complete third-quarter earnings announcement, has cited weaker-than-expected industry spending. But WR Hambrecht analyst Robert Stimson suggests the problems are unique to Symantec. \u001d  With the enterprise recovery business stumbling and the Norton consumer franchise getting squeezed from Microsoft, Symantec will now need to deliver several quarters of performance and growth from the Veritas group if it is to win back its whipsawed fans. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:08 ET (05:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"99339dff949887c15c3b96409e689e0c","symR":["7203.TO","TM","JP3633400001"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Toyota Narrows Choice For US Plant To Two - Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T14:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["7203.TO","TM","JP3633400001"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XGTI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LITTLE ROCK (AP)--Toyota Motor Corp.

One source said Toyota could choose a location in the next month. \u001d  Previous news reports have said the company was considering the Marion and Tennessee sites as well as a location in Crockett County, Tenn., and another site in North Carolina. \u001d  Daniel Sieger, spokesman for Toyota in Erlanger, Ky., would only say that Toyota was studying expansion in North America and was researching sites. \u001d  Four years ago, the 1,750-acre site near Marion was one of two finalists for Toyota's Tundra pickup plant.

I wrote about the improving prospects for the San Jose, Calif.-based networking giant (ticker: CSCO) back in October when the shares were below 24 (\"Getting the World Wired,\" Oct. 9), so I've got an interest in following up. The stock was actually around 21 when I started chasing Cisco's busy executives for interviews, but youshouldn't have to hear my \"inside journalism\" excuses. \u001d  Tuesday, the stock was downgraded by the analysts at Banc of America Securities and Prudential Equity Group. Wednesday, it was Merrill Lynch. I wondered if those disenamoured analysts had uncovered things amiss in Cisco's business. I wasn't the only one with that question. \"Everybody has been calling me to ask if there's any hidden message in the downgrade,\" said Merrill analyst Tal Liani. \"There's not.\" \u001d  Liani believes that Cisco's fundamental business remains well-managed and thriving. The company has video-transmission solutions just as customers like AT&T are rolling out Internet-based television networks. Cisco deployed sales brigades to the world's oil-rich nations and persuaded them to invest in their countries' network infrastructure. When Cisco announces its January quarter results on Feb 6, Liani won't be surprised if it beats his forecast for $8.26 billion in revenues, and earnings of $1.6 billion, or 26 cents a share, including options expense. Those earnings would be 15% higher than the January 2006 quarter's. \u001d  With Cisco's operating profit margin at a handsome 29%, Liani wonders if there's much remaining leverage to the company's margins. In recent weeks, every fund manager who calls him about the stock browbeats him for ways that Cisco might ratchet up its margins some more. \u001d  I asked the analyst if he wasn't jumping off the Cisco wave too early. After all, YouTube hasn't yet started stocking high-definition videos. Video traffic could grow to levels that force widespread upgrades of Internet gear. \u001d  Liani said that he sees Cisco as sort of a growth cyclical company. Right now, it's riding waves with its CRS-1 router for the core of telecom networks and other hot networking products. But waves come in sets, with dull passages in between, and possibly hidden icebergs. He thinks the time to jump is in the middle of the cycle, not the end. His firm is one of Cisco's bankers. \u001d  Over at Cisco, I asked if any icebergs had been sighted in the past week. \"Cisco is focused on executing against the long-term growth initiatives that we've outlined to our investors for some time now,\" said spokesperson Heather Dickinson, in a written statement. \"Our success to date, as well as our expectations for the future, is based on our belief that the network is the platform for all communications and IT.\" \u001d  That doesn't sound like a pre-announced disappointment to me. I'd guess that Cisco still has a few good quarters ahead of it. Whether you want to race for the exit is your own decision. \b \u001d  The printing-services broker InnerWorkings priced its follow-on stock offering Thursday at $13.50. The firm sold 3 million shares for the business and 5 million shares for insiders -- including the company founders whose histories of underdelivering software have been underreported by InnerWorkings and its bankers at Morgan Stanley. \u001d  Last week, I told readers how founder Eric Lefkofsky had the cheek to name his previous venture Starbelly, in apparent tribute to a bamboozling huckster in a Dr. Seuss story, before that venture imploded and took its parent company into bankruptcy. \u001d  Numerous ex-employees of InnerWorkings (ticker: INWK) had told me how the company, which claims to develop groundbreaking software to help procure printing services, has misrepresented its \"PPM4\" software's utility. For instance, InnerWorkings says its software database provides its account managers with instant cost estimates on print jobs, based on historical data. But ex-employees said the estimates were usually not relevant and were scrapped -- claims the company has declined to discuss. Since my first story, I've heard from still others around the printing industry who confirm what I reported. \u001d  InnerWorkings spent last weekend meeting with its bankers and lawyers, before issuing a press release Monday that complained of \"numerous factual errors\" in my column. But the release contained little in the way of rebuttal evidence. One of its more concrete complaints was with my saying that a \"big part\" of the company's profits came from a related-party transaction in the months before the August 2006 initial offering. In this transaction, a Singapore printing business that's tied to InnerWorkings' chairman licensed the company's software for $1 million. About a half-million dollars' worth of the shares sold last week were the Singapore printer's, so it's already been rewarded for its propitious license deal. \u001d  According to InnerWorkings' IPO prospectus, it got $600,000 in payments under the deal during that June 2006 quarter, the last-reported period before the IPO. Typical profit margins on a software or technology license would be more than 80%, which after another 40% cut for the tax man would leave $300,000 net profit from that deal in the quarter, I figure. By my back-of-the-envelope math, that would have been about 17.5% of the quarter's reported net profit of $1.72 million. \u001d  In contrast, the company's press release said that the Singapore deal contributed only 7% of its operating profits in the nine months ended September.  Friday, I asked InnerWorkings spokesman Mark Desky to tell me the deal's contribution to the quarter ended June 2006. After noting that the company was still in the \"quiet period\" of its secondary offering, he said that the Singapore deal brought in less than 9% of June operating profits. That 9% is only half of what I figure. . . but I'm just a writer sitting here in New York; their books, their auditors and now $100 million of some investors' savings are over there in Chicago. \u001d  You may have noticed that these quibbles concern rather small amounts of earnings. Let's not lose sight of the forest for the trees: InnerWorkings has produced feeble profits for all its hooey about disrupting the printing industry with software technology. After my story's disclosures led investors to cut InnerWorkings' stock-market capitalization from about $700 million to $600 million, the company is still valued at 100 times trailing earnings. No ink-stained columnist can deter insiders (and their bankers) from printing money at that kind of a price. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:09 ET (05:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a9acd34dd5bd6fb1a20e74d697fc9827","symR":["ACGL","BHI","BRL","C","COF","DD","EFA","EWS","EXV2.XE","FD","FRA","GE","GLW","HIG","LYO","MEDI","NBR","PBR","PETR4.BR","PXD","RCL","RCS","SYMC","YAR.OS","YARIY","YRCW","BRPETRACNPR6","DE0006289358","NO0010208051","US1729671016","US2635341090","US3696041033","US4165151048","US9855771054"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(1/22) 2007 Barron's Roundtable -- Part -4-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T05:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACGL","BHI","BRL","C","COF","DD","EFA","EWS","EXV2.XE","FD","FRA","GE","GLW","HIG","LYO","MEDI","NBR","PBR","PETR4.BR","PXD","RCL","RCS","SYMC","YAR.OS","YARIY","YRCW","BRPETRACNPR6","DE0006289358","NO0010208051","US1729671016","US2635341090","US3696041033","US4165151048","US9855771054"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","BTC","CEF","CFN","CHC","CHM","CHS","CMT","DRG","DRL","EQS","EXT","IDD","INF","INP","INS","OIE","OIL","OIS","RCS","RTB","RTS","SOF","TRK","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XOBX","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\u001d  Cohen: My pleasure. My first pick is General Electric [GE], which I mentioned last year. Some of the positive trends we had expected to develop did begin to develop, but not until the autumn, so there is a ways to go. As we all know, this is an extraordinarily diversified company. It is placed in the S&P Industrials category by Standard & Poor's, but it has a lot more going for it, including very significant growth in the medical-technology area, where it is the leader not just in technology but increasingly in sales and service. In addition, because it is a mega-cap stock, it is underowned by lots of portfolio managers. Some proprietary work Goldman Sachs has done on what mutual funds and hedge funds own shows us GE is notably underweighted versus the S&P. That means portfolio managers, to this point, have decided the company is going to underperform. We don't think so. \u001d  A number of things set GE apart, including the mix of its business, its international exposure and its very strong balance sheet. It generates lots of cash flow. The company could increase its dividend, and has great capacity to do so. The yield is 2.7%. Unlike some other stocks with yields at about those levels, GE has very good earnings visibility. At a time when the economic cycle is getting a little old, this is a company with annual earnings growth of 9%. We have confidence around that number. Return on equity is about 16%. The current price-earnings multiple based on 2007 results is about 17 times earnings. \b \u001d  Barron's: Because of its diversity, isn't GE awfully exposed to the economy? \u001d  Cohen: It is exposed in some ways, but a lot of the products it makes probably are not as cyclically sensitive. Those that are tend to be in the aircraft area, and we feel pretty good about order patterns there. Much of their revenue growth has been coming from medical technology, which is much less exposed. \u001d  My second recommendation relates to the consumer. While this is not going to be an extremely robust year for the consumer, we've talked ourselves into believing the consumer is going into a black hole. That is not likely. As a consequence, some consumer-related stocks are now selling at reasonable prices. It is also important to recognize that as the economic cycle ages, consumption patterns change. Early in a cycle, items like housing and autos typically take a fairly large percentage of the total consumer dollar. As the cycle gets older, we see a rotation into discretionary services and spending. My choice here is Royal Caribbean [RCL], the cruise line. It fits neatly into a few themes I've mentioned today. While some consumers aren't feeling terrific, especially with debt problems, the typical Royal Caribbean customer tends to be more upper-middle income and upper income. This is not a budget cruise line. In this higher-income demographic, compensation and household incomes are rising. In addition, Royal Caribbean is benefiting from some company-specific changes. \b \u001d  Barron's: Such as? \u001d  Cohen: They have some new ships coming online that will represent 12% or 13% of their capacity, ships for which they'll be able to get premium pricing. The stock did not do particularly well in the first half of 2006, in part due to fuel-related expenses. But costs have eased dramatically and in 2007 are likely to be more benign. Also, there was some competitive pressure coming from other companies that expanded their Caribbean capacity too rapidly. Royal Caribbean is now in the process of shifting some of its ships to Europe. \u001d  Today we've talked a lot about the dollar coming under pressure. That is less of an issue with cruises, which have become extremely popular with Americans. You get on the boat. It's easy. You don't have to worry about other transportation and hotels. An American can visit Europe on a Royal Caribbean cruise and pay for it in U.S. dollars. In '07 there could be a substantial increase in the company's revenue, on the order of 13% or 14%. Earnings, which were flattish in '06, could go up about 8%. At 13 times earnings, the stock sells at a discount to its competitors. \u001d  Neff: What about viruses and the like that seem to afflict cruise-ship passengers? \u001d  Cohen: That creates an opportunity for the maker of those Purell hand wipes! [Pfizer] \b \u001d  Barron's: Now, there's a buy. \u001d  Cohen: Another pick in the consumer area is Federated Department Stores [FD]. The company had some problems last year consolidating its acquisition of May Department Stores. It had to shut down some stores, which was part of the plan, but the shares pulled back as a consequence. However, Federated is likely to do much better this year. First, the benefit of the restructuring will begin to show up in the data. And there seems to be a significant difference in the way various retailers are performing. Those that serve lower-income customers are having bigger problems. Federated serves higher-income customers, and is seeing reasonably good comparable-store sales gains. The company most likely will have same-store sales gains on the order of 3% in the year that ends this month, which is not too shabby. Federated also is benefiting from industry consolidation, to which it contributes, as well as shutting down stores. It now has a 30% market share in its category. \u001d  Neff: Aren't there some economies of scale? \u001d  Cohen: There are economies of scale in terms of buying and negotiating with suppliers and advertising. That was one of the reasons to consolidate some of the stores under the Macy's name. \u001d  Black: I own the stock and I like [CEO] Terry Lundgren, but there are a couple of drawbacks. In places like Boston, where Filene's was an institution, and Chicago, where they had Marshall Field's, and Texas, where they had Foley's, a lot of people have been turned off by the Macy's name and the fact that the local brand is gone. I'm not sure how this is going to play out. Federated has strategic issues here. \u001d  Cohen: Of course, in Chicago they agreed to continue to provide Franco's, the Marshall Field's candy. Finally, we are seeing margin expansion at Federated. Margins have gone from about 6% to 10%. In fiscal 2007 there was a nasty first quarter, a consequence of all the restructuring going on. Therefore, the shares currently trade for about 18 times fiscal '07 earnings and 13 times the next fiscal year. It is reasonably priced and has good prospects for earnings and margins. \u001d  Speaking of health issues on boats, my next two names are in health care. One is MedImmune [MEDI], a specialty pharmaceuticals company. It markets FluMist, which is distributed not only in the U.S., but increasingly overseas. It has been a significant player in the HPV [human papilloma virus] vaccine, which represents one of the truly dramatic changes in public health care. The vaccine has been seen to affect the virus, and therefore eliminate a form of cancer, which is quite extraordinary. The P/E is high, but earnings are about to grow dramatically. Long-term earnings growth is about 18%. Earnings for the year that just ended were about 20 cents a share, and our analyst estimates they'll be about 80 cents this year. \b \u001d  Barron's: Where is the stock? \u001d  Cohen: The stock as of Friday [Jan. 5] was 34.32. Again, it's a pretty high P/E, but with the product cycle and likely earnings growth, it's a good place to be. We also like Barr Pharmaceuticals [BRL], one of the largest generic-drug manufacturers. This was not a great category in 2006. People were concerned about the outcome of the midterm elections and a host of other factors. But it seems the secular trends in health care are quite constructive, particularly for the generics. No. 1, cost containment is going to be an important element of everything from here. It is not just a Medicare issue, but an issue for the health plans provided by employers for their current employees and retirees. No. 2, generic drug companies also benefit from demographics: the aging of the population and the fact that people demand good-quality health care, including pharmaceuticals. \u001d  The consolidation in the generics business is to the advantage of a company like Barr, which is one of the larger companies and financially robust. The P/E based on 2007 earnings is about 15. The stock on Friday was trading at 52.31. Most generics are not exciting in terms of product development, but they are well situated to benefit from other, secular trends. \u001d  Schafer: Abby, the CEO of Barr is one of the brightest in the business. But the business model has changed over the years. We have done a lot of investing in the generic space, but the problem now is that proprietary drug companies are getting into the business, whereas in the past the first to file had six months' exclusivity. Now you have the branded company with an authorized generic in the business, as well. Don't you think that deserves a lower multiple? \u001d  Cohen: Absolutely. That's one of the reasons generics in general have been under pressure. This stock was down about 20% last year. A recasting of multiples has occurred in generics, and that's why we like to stay with the larger names. They will have fewer problems keeping up with the big pharmaceutical companies that will try to compete with them. \u001d  Schafer: Are Barr's '07 numbers higher than '06? \u001d  Cohen: Yes. We estimate Barr will do $3.51 a share this year, versus $3.13 in '06. The consensus for '06 was $3.09, and for this year is $3.39, so we're above consensus. \u001d  Black: You ought to point out they might benefit from the Democrat House and Senate. There will be a trend toward generics. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:04 ET (05:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b87aa1257f256a9c070f483b56ee04be","symR":["CCO","CCU"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(1/22) Unclear LBO Path For Clear Channel","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T05:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CCO","CCU"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","BRD","MED","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Andrew Bary \u001d  Wall Street has watched as private-equity firms generated enormous profits from leveraged buyouts of companies like Hertz, Warner Music and Burger King. \u001d  The LBO wave appears to be generating a backlash. The independent directors of Cablevision (ticker: CVC) last week rejected the controlling Dolan family's bid to take it private, calling it inadequate. \u001d  Another giant LBO deal is also in trouble. Some big institutional holders of Clear Channel Communicationsare unhappy with the proposed $26 billion leveraged buyout of the radio and billboard giant. They plan to vote against it, believing the $37.60-a-share offer undervalues the company by at least several dollars a share. \u001d  This opposition could scuttle the buyout, which is being led by Thomas Lee Partners and Bain Capital Partners, two of the biggest names in private equity. The deal, announced on Nov. 15, also has the backing of the Mays family, which runs Clear Channel (CCU) and owns about 7% of its stock. No date has been set for the shareholder vote; the transaction is slated to close by year end. \u001d  Barron's has learned that at least two big institutional holders, including Fidelity Investments, have told management that they will cast negative votes. Fidelity, Clear Channel's largest holder, had an 11% stake at the end of September. Fidelity declined to comment. \u001d  Wednesday afternoon, Barron's broke the news of the rising investor resistance to the deal on Barron's Online, our Website. \u001d  The opposition by Fidelity and other institutional holders could kill the deal. Clear Channel, the country's largest radio operator, needs the assent of two-thirds of its shareholders to swing it. Holders who don't cast a ballot effectively are voting no. It's estimated that 10% to 15% of shareholders may not vote. \u001d  Based on Sept. 30 data, the biggest institutional holders after Fidelity are Morgan Stanley at 8% and Capital Research at 5%. Other sizable holders include NWQ Investments and Highfields Capital Management, a Boston investment firm. Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, wouldn't comment for this article. \u001d  If the deal dies, Clear Channel shares could rally because the company's radio business is effectively being valued at an appreciable discount to peers when factoring in the lofty value of Clear Channel's 90% stake in its publicly traded billboard operations, Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings. Clear Channel stock rose 20 cents Thursday to 36.45 after Barron's Online and The Wall Street Journal reported rising investor resistance to the deal. The stock closed Friday at 36.51. \u001d  \"The LBO price is wholly inadequate,\" says Jeff Jacobowitz, an analyst at Robotti & Co., a New York investment firm that holds the stock. Jacobowitz, who runs a partnership that owns the stock, says \"there's no reason that what management wants to do as a private company can't be done as a public company. That would give the upside to the public shareholders.\" Among its initiatives, Clear Channel plans to sell a group of small-market radio stations and its TV business. \u001d  Bulls argue that Clear Channel shares are attractive because the stock is apt to rise if the buyout bid fails and there's a chance the buyout firms will sweeten their offer. Jacobowitz says Clear Channel is worth at least $42 a share. He cites a research report by Bear Stearns analyst Victor Miller that lays out a scenario in which Clear Channel would remain public and buy back most of its stock, in part by letting shareholders swap their stock for Clear Channel's stake in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings. (CCO). \u001d  Billboards are one of the hottest areas of media, and Clear Channel Outdoor shares have risen to 29 from 21 in the fall. Clear Channel's stake in Clear Channel Outdoor is worth over $9 billion, or half the equity value of Clear Channel Communications. Clear Channel has $8 billion of debt, $2 billion of it associated with Clear Channel Outdoor. \u001d  Under Miller's buyback scenario, Clear Channel could generate $5 a share in annual free cash flow in about two years, which Jacobowitz says would produce a stock price of $50 or more. \u001d  Miller offered his thoughts in a Jan. 12 note titled \"Clear Channel: Take-Under? Radio at 8.2x.\" Miller wrote that Clear Channel's radio business is being valued at just 8.2 times projected 2007 cash flow, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, when factoring in the value of the company's stake in Clear Channel Outdoor. In contrast, public radio operators Emmis Communications (EMMS), Cumulus Media (CMLS) and Cox Radio (CXR) are valued at 10 to 11 times projected 2007 cash flow. Clear Channel could trade at $42 a share if its radio business were valued at 10 times projected '07 cash flow. \u001d  The institutional holders opposing the deal fear that the buyout firms and the Mays family will make a quick killing on the Clear Channel LBO. The buyout outfits plan to put up about $4 billion in equity and borrow $22 billion to complete the transaction. If Clear Channel's radio business is worth 10 times 2007 cash flow, the value of the buyout firms' equity could be $6 billion or more when the deal closes, giving them an immediate paper profit of $2 billion, a 50% return on their investment. \u001d  Clear Channel's three-week auction may have given potential buyers insufficient time to craft their bids. The company announced on Oct. 25 that it was pursuing strategic alternatives after it had been approached by a buyout group, including the Blackstone Group. On Nov. 16, the company announced that the Thomas Lee/Bain group had won an auction with a bid of $37.60, about $5 above the share price on Oct. 24. In contrast, the auction of Univision, the Spanish-language broadcaster, lasted several months in 2006. \u001d  The Mays family plans to sell its 35 million shares in the buyout. The bulk of that stock is held by Lowry Mays, the 71-year-old chairman who is the father of Mark Mays, the current chief executive, and Randall Mays, the current president. \u001d  Yet Mark and Randall Mays are to retain their jobs when the buyout group takes control and get sizable option packages and a shot at big profits. The two will each get options equal to 2.5% of the equity of the surviving company and be able to roll part of their Clear Channel stock into equity of the private company, according to the preliminary proxy for the deal. \u001d  And Clear Channel's investment banker, Goldman Sachs (GS), stands to make a fee of $40 million for advising the company. The bulk of that fee is payable only on consummation of the deal. \u001d  Clear Channel shares have languished in recent years as ad dollars shifted out of radio to the Internet and as the company cut commercial time to reduce clutter. \u001d  However, the radio market seems to be turning up, and the billboard business is hotter than ever, partly because of the potential for digital signs. Billboard operators like Lamar Advertising (LAMR) have some of the highest valuations in the media world -- 15 to 16 times projected 2007 cash flow. \u001d  \"We are one of the best-performing companies in the media industry,\" CEO Mark Mays said in the press release announcing Clear Channel's third-quarter earnings. Radio operating income rose 8% to $185 million in the period on a 5% rise in revenues. \u001d  Institutional holders are now sending a message to Wall Street that investors are tired of seeing LBO outfits make a killing at their expense. For Clear Channel, the buyout firms may have to offer at least $42 a share to get this deal done. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:07 ET (05:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b9d305d5310e09975554fae07231580f","symR":["UA"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(1/22) When A Hot Stock Breaks A Sweat","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T05:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UA"],"IndustryCodes":["CLO","TEX","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Christopher C. Williams \u001d  Forget Michael Jordan. Kevin Plank, chairman of Under Armour, wants to be like Phil Knight, the legendary founder of Nike. \u001d  Like Knight -- an ex-athlete who built a $15 billion global empire by turning high-priced kicks into must-have items for weekend warriors and elite athletes alike -- Plank, a college footballer, is carving out a niche in the $14 billion active-sports-apparel market by selling pricey shirts and shorts through in-your-face advertising, keen knowledge of the sports market and smart brand management. \u001d  Sales for Plank's Baltimore-based Under Armour (ticker: UA) are believed to have hit $421 million in 2006, up from just $5 million in 2000, as teens and college athletes snapped up Under Armour's core product -- tight-fitting synthetic shirts that wick away sweat from the body. \u001d  The start-up's swift success has fans touting Under Armour as the next Nike. The 34-year-old Plank generally downplays such talk, but he boldly predicts that his company will grow to $1 billion and eventually will become \"the world's No. 1 performance brand.\" Investors seem to believe it, bidding up Under Armour more than 100% since its November 2005 debut, to a recent 51. (The stock, which came public on Nasdaq, moved to the NYSE in December.) \u001d  But based on almost every valuation metric, investors are paying too much for Plank's big-league aspirations. \u001d  Under Armour's stock is selling for more than 80 times its earnings of the past 12 months, and 53 times the 96 cents a share analysts are projecting for this year. That price-earnings ratio is a towering 2.76 times the rate of earnings growth. In contrast, Nike, with a market value 14 times Under Armour's and the most respected brand in sports, is selling for 17 times this year's earnings and at just 1.16 times earnings growth. \u001d  Moisture management simply shouldn't be so pricey. There's a good case that the stock ought to be no higher than the low 40s, about 12% below current levels. And if the still-young company stumbles in managing its growth, the shares conceivably could fall much further. The fact is, growing to $1 billion is still anything but a slam dunk. \u001d  Already, big competitors are moving in. While Under Armour controls about 75% of the $500 million market for tight sweat-busting gear, Nike (NIKE) and Adidas-Salomon (ADS.Germany), which don't much like getting sand kicked in their faces, have introduced their own lines and are moving to boost their market shares. \u001d  Under Armour, for its part, has been diversifying into athletic footwear, including football cleats. But that's a famously crowded arena, one likely to crimp the company's margins. \u001d  Concludes Brady Lemos, an analyst at Morningstar: \"We believe the market's rich valuation of Under Armour is based on lofty revenue and profit-growth projections that will be difficult to sustain as the business matures.\" \u001d  Yes, Under Armour continues to grow faster than the more mature Nike. On Feb. 1, Under Armour is likely to report that earnings per share for '06 more than doubled to 80 cents, according to analysts, while sales jumped 50%. The company also is likely to meet or beat earnings expectations of 25 cents a share for the fourth quarter. And for the next five years, earnings and sales could climb at a spiffy 25% to 30% annual rate. \u001d  Fans reckon that Under Armour, with a market value of $2.4 billion, is just beginning to tap its growth opportunities, particularly with women and overseas markets. \"Don't be hung up on the price,\" advises Under Armour shareholder Tom Forte of Geneva Investment Management of Chicago, who bought the shares last January in the low 30s. \"Think about what the company can be. You have to believe in the company -- and I do.\" \u001d  Leaps of faith like that could help keep the stock up for a while. And heavy short-selling -- some 25% of the publicly available shares have been shorted -- could accelerate any further rises in the share price, with shorts forced to buy back shares to cover their positions. \u001d  Indeed, legions of skeptics have been burned betting against apparently pricey, hypergrowth stocks, a fact Barron's noted a year ago in casting a skeptical eye on Under Armour's lofty valuation (The Trader, Jan. 23, 2006). Under Armour has advanced 33% since then. \u001d  But the nosebleed valuation leaves Plank & Co. little room for error. The stock slipped after the company beat third-quarter earnings expectations by several pennies, suggesting that pleasing investors' appetite might be growing increasingly difficult. \"At 51, you need meaningful upside to earnings guidance to warrant that type of price,\" says analyst Eric Tracy of BB&T Capital Markets. \u001d  Like many of the 11 sell-side analysts who follow Under Armour, Tracy lauds the company's business model and bright growth prospects. But he has a Hold rating on the stock, joining seven other analysts who are wary of the valuation. Tracy notes, for example, that Under Armour trades at a significant premium to the average price-earnings ratio of a select group of active-wear companies, including VF (VFC) and Oakley (OO). \u001d  Hedge-fund manager Peter Siris of Guerrilla Capital in New York is similarly conflicted. \"There are too many momentum players for me to be short and too high a valuation for me to be long,\" he tells Barron's. \u001d  The sell-side analysts who follow Under Armour post an average price target of 44, valuing the shares at a more reasonable 46 times '07 earnings. But even that target also still assumes robust 25%-plus annual earnings growth. \u001d  That happens to be the precise value that Goldman Sachs, an underwriter for Under Armour's initial public offering, has placed on the stock. Goldman analyst Margaret Mager initiated coverage of Under Armour with essentially a Neutral rating last February, and repeated it in October, with the stock at 46.35. In a report at the time, Mager reminded investors that the apparel business grows in a pattern of steps, with periods of accelerated growth followed by consolidation of gains. \"Trends remain strong,\" said the analyst, \"but are already reflected in the share price, leaving downside risks if growth should slow.\" \u001d  Executives at Under Armour declined to comment for this article, citing a need to be quiet until earnings are released. \u001d  But it's clear that slowing down is anathema to Plank, a Baltimore native who worked his way from a walk-on with the University of Maryland football squad to a team captain. He felt weighed down by the sweaty cotton T-shirts he wore while playing sports, and felt certain other athletes felt the same. In 1995, he raised $20,000, hired a tailor to make T-shirts from spandex material and peddled them to schools along the East Coast, much as Knight started Nike by selling sneakers from the trunk of his car. \u001d  Made of a mixture of polyester or nylon and elastane, Under Armour's long-sleeved shirt, for example, hugs the body like a second skin and, unlike cotton, pulls moisture away from the torso and outside the shirt. This system, Under Armour says, regulates body temperature in all weather, making you more comfortable and able to perform better. The crew-neck long-sleeve comes at a hefty $48, compared with, say, $10 for a typical cotton shirt. \u001d  Today, Under Armour sells some 300 exercise-apparel styles and accessories infused with its moisture-management technology, including loose apparel, sports bras and backpacks, through more than 9,000 outlets. The company also targets golf and hunting. \u001d  Under Armour says it expects its international business to more than triple this year, though it will still be less than 5% of sales. The company is ramping up sales to women and children, and last summer it introduced football cleats -- grabbing, according to Plank, 22% of that business. The company is now said to be eyeing basketball kicks, where Nike and Adidas rule. \u001d  So far, Plank has expanded the brand without a major hitch -- but it's still early in the game, and it's uncertain whether management can skillfully expand the business to take advantage of growth opportunities. \u001d  Analysts expect gross margins to inch up to about 50% this year, from 48.3% in '05, but the improvement could be curtailed as Under Armour expands into tough markets like footwear. Margins could come under pressure unless Under Armour boosts sales volume, changes its sales mix or takes lower-cost sourcing initiatives, says BB&T's Tracy. \u001d  Expanding overseas has its pitfalls. Mager of Goldman notes three of them: The Under Armour brand isn't well-known outside the U.S.; its historical association with American football might not translate well; and it doesn't benefit from the first-mover advantage that it has enjoyed in the U.S. \u001d  That advantage, too, could erode as more companies push into the business. The main rivals are Berkshire Hathaway's Russell unit, with lower-priced products; Adidas, with its ClimateCool brand; and, mainly, Nike, whose Nike Pro business is growing in the high double-digits, analysts say. \u001d  Under Armour doesn't have a patent on the fabric or its sweat-busting process, so it has to rely mainly on its brand name to ward off rivals. While Under Armour's interlocking U and A logo might rule the anti-sweat market now, the swoosh is the undisputed king of sporting goods. And analysts say Nike is devoting more than $30 million of marketing muscle to its product line -- dwarfing Under Armour's total ad budget. \u001d  There's long been speculation that Nike and Adidas each would like to buy Under Armour. Those companies wouldn't comment. Plank has said he's turned down acquisition overtures in the past, and analysts figure that the supercompetitive executive, who holds 80% voting control through ownership of the super-voting Class B shares, wants to play out the game as an independent. \u001d  Any acquirer, meanwhile, is sure to think long and hard before paying 50-plus times earnings. Savvy investors might want to do the same. \u001d  --- \u001d  Superman's Basketball Game \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:09 ET (05:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bd9a9a92de01b12f5db6a6b811cc00b1","symR":["HD","US4370761029"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(1/20) Home Depot Directors To Visit Activist Investor","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T05:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HD","US4370761029"],"IndustryCodes":["HIM","RTS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Ann Zimmerman and Joann S. Lublin \u001d  Several Home Depot Inc. board members are expected by midweek to visit with activist investor Ralph V. Whitworth, who has threatened to launch a proxy fight for a board seat if the company doesn't reassess its business strategy. \u001d  Mr. Whitworth, a principal of San Diego-based investment fund Relational Investors LLC, was a leading critic of former Chief Executive Robert Nardelli's performance. And the activist investor maintains that some big changes are needed to boost the company's stagnant stock price now that Mr. Nardelli is gone. \u001d  Even though Home Depot is extending the olive branch to Mr. Whitworth, future spats are likely. Mr. Whitworth, 51 years old, has said he wants Home Depot to spin off its lower-margin supply business and focus on its stores, while newly appointed CEO Frank Blake remains committed to continuing Mr. Nardelli's diversification strategy that Mr. Blake himself helped craft and implement. \u001d  Home Depot has spent $7 billion acquiring wholesale-supply businesses in the last several years. \"They should sell them and get what they can for them, because they make no sense,\" Mr. Whitworth told The Wall Street Journal in December, after his efforts to raise a fuss at Home Depot became public. Mr. Whitworth, whose fund owns a 1.3% stake in the retailer, had alerted Home Depot that the fund planned to introduce a resolution at Home Depot's May shareholder meeting asking the board to establish a committee of independent board members to review the company's strategic direction, management performance and to explore possible alternatives, including a sale of the company. \u001d  Citing a recent visit to a San Diego Home Depot, where he couldn't find a salesperson to help him, Mr. Whitworth said in December that the company's flagging customer service was one reason competitor Lowe's Corp. was \"taking them to the cleaners\" and that the company shouldn't be pursuing acquisitions until it adequately invests in its stores. \u001d  Home Depot has been courting Mr. Whitworth ever since Mr. Nardelli abruptly resigned Jan. 2, after declining to curb his pay package significantly. The board members are meeting with Mr. Whitworth to signal that the board is anxious to hear Mr. Whitworth's ideas for improving the company, according to someone close to the board. \u001d  Whether the visit will succeed in quieting down Mr. Whitworth, who has a long track record of shaking up underperforming companies, is unclear. \"Nardelli was a peace offering by the board, but they are not going to have peace\" with Mr. Whitworth, predicts Randy Lampert, one of the two heads of the recently formed shareholder-activist group at investment bank Morgan Joseph & Co. The group advises firms that have been targeted by activist shareholders. Home Depot isn't a client. \u001d  What's more, Mr. Whitworth has already made up his mind to seek at least one seat on the Home Depot board regardless of what he hears from board members, according to a person familiar with the situation. \u001d  The Whitworth visit is the latest chapter in a charm offensive that began after the 57-year-old Mr. Blake suddenly was placed in command of the second-biggest retailer in the U.S. Mr. Blake has already talked to Wall Street analysts and impressed them with his down-to-earth manner, a big change from the imperious Mr. Nardelli. \u001d  Mr. Blake also stressed to analysts his interest in improving the store experience, hiring executives with the retail experience he lacks and restoring the company's entrepreneurial and fun culture. \u001d  While Mr. Blake is promising a new day at Home Depot, the board in numerous ways has strongly telegraphed that it is still committed to its previous strategic path. For starters, it selected as CEO Mr. Blake, who has no previous retail experience and was the chief architect of the wholesale-building-supply division. Mr. Blake recently told investors he is adamant about pursuing growth in that segment. \u001d  Meanwhile, on the same day it announced Mr. Nardelli's resignation, Home Depot said it was waiving mandatory retirement for a year for three directors who otherwise would have to step down because they are past 72 years old. The company said in a statement that it wanted the directors to provide continuity during this time of change, but others see it as a move to block Mr. Whitworth's attempt to run for any seats. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:30 ET (05:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c28c4e2f36f91995f33d7aa1845a2d27","symR":["2809.TO","7751.TO","9062.TO","9064.TO","CAJ","QPCPY","JP3242800005","JP3244800003","JP3729400006","JP3940000007"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Japan Listed Firms Steadily Adopt 401(k) Pension Plans","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T15:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["2809.TO","7751.TO","9062.TO","9064.TO","CAJ","QPCPY","JP3242800005","JP3244800003","JP3729400006","JP3940000007"],"IndustryCodes":["AIF","FOD","OFF","OFP","TRK","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--An increasing number of listed companies in Japan are introducing defined-contribution pension plans for their employees, with Canon Inc. (7751.TO) and Q.P. Corp. (2809.TO) launching Japanese versions of 401(k) schemes earlier this month and Yamato Holdings Co. (9064.TO) planning to do so soon, The Nikkei reported in its Sunday edition. \u001d  The outstanding balance of assets managed under such plans reached an estimated Y3 trillion at the end of last year, with 2.15 million workers participating in them as of the end of November. \u001d  About 30,000 Canon employees, including those of group firms, have joined the company's 401(k)-type plan.  Japan's top manufacturer of personal computer printers intends to divert to the scheme 20%-30% of the contributions channeled into its conventional defined-benefit pension program. \u001d  Meanwhile, Q.P., the country's largest mayonnaise producer, offers the plan as well as a system to pay retirement allowances in advance.  The new program is expected to attract 1,800 participants. \u001d  Yamato's plan, which is due to be launched in late January, will cover about 77,000 employees at the leading home parcel delivery company and group firms.  The company will not dissolve the existing defined-benefit program, but instead allow workers to choose the one they want to participate in. \u001d  Rival Nippon Express Co. (9062.TO) is also considering adopting a 401(k)-type pension system. \u001d  Japanese companies began adopting defined-contribution pension plans in autumn 2001, with 2,161 companies and corporate groups making them available to their employees by the end of December last year. \u001d  The balance of assets under management by dedicated investment trusts, one of the investment vehicles for 401(k) pension plans, exceeded Y1 trillion for the first time at the end of last year according to a survey by Quick Corp. and QBR Corp. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 10:30 ET (15:30 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c5ebf6dfb8c90bb210a7f08e5b11d05e","symR":["MS"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"TCG Exec: No Plans To Offer Public Stake In Morgan Stanley JV","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T14:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MS"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","SCR","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  RIYADH (Zawya Dow Jones)--Saudi Arabia's The Capital Group asserts that it has no plans to offer a stake in its newly announced joint venture with Morgan Stanley in the Saudi market in its initial public offering to local investors, Fahad Al Mubarak, TCG Chairman and Managing Director, told Dow Jones Saturday. \u001d  \"We haven't determined the size or the shareholders' ownership in the new company.

Racanelli \u001d  Stocks put in a mixed showing in a holiday-shortened week as the Nasdaq fell but the other major indexes finished mostly unchanged. Shares received another boost from lower energy prices and favorable economic news, but earnings from some big tech names failed to impress, weighing the sector down. \u001d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed at 12,565.53, and the Standard & Poor's 500, which finished at 1430.50, were nearly flat versus their levels the previousFriday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 2%, to 2451.31. \u001d  For data junkies, there were ample macroeconomic reports to parse, like inflation and industrial production, among others. The upshot is a U.S. that is expanding at a nicely measured pace, but with prices needing to be watched. The University of Michigan said Friday that its January consumer-sentiment reading had jumped to 98, the highest level in three years, from 91.7 last month and above forecasts of 92. \"The economic data continue to affirm that the economy is remarkably resilient,\" says Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. \u001d  Meanwhile, the earnings-reporting season began in earnest. Tech stocks were smacked on profits and outlooks from the likes of Apple (ticker: AAPL), IBM (IBM) and Intel (INTC) that were unimpressive or partly disappointing. \u001d  With 70 of the S&P 500's members reporting as of last Thursday, the ratio of firms beating fourth-quarter analysts' earnings estimates to those missing them was a respectable 2.2 to 1, says Dirk van Dijk, director of research at Zacks Investment Research. \"That's not nearly as good as has been the case at this point in previous earnings seasons, but it's early yet,\" he adds. Tech watchers, however, should note that consensus-estimate revisions for 2007 are \"noticeably weak,\" he notes, with tech analysts making three reductions for each upward revision. \u001d  Next week promises a large slug of earnings reports. \b \u001d  Crude rose Friday to finish at $52 a barrel. But that was still down $1 on the week, on sharply rising U.S. inventories. Although the stock market still expects an interest-rate cut this year, the plunge in energy prices, if sustained, could effectively act as a partial rate cut, perhaps putting off a Fed that shows no signs of easing yet. \u001d  At oil's peak last summer, global energy users would have paid the equivalent of $2 trillion, annualized, to producers, says Yardeni. At current prices, again annualized, their oil bills would be down by at least $500 billion. That's roughly equivalent to 4% of U.S. annual GDP, or more than 100% of Switzerland's. \u001d  The week's food for thought: It took just 15 days for the Dems in power to raise taxes. The House passed an energy bill, HR6, which creates the first net tax increase since 1993, according to Daniel Clifton, executive director of the American Shareholders Association, a nonprofit lobbyist for investor interests. \b \u001d  Tesoro Petroleum (TSO) is sitting on a treasure of cash, probably more than it needs to run the business efficiently. At the end of 2006, the San Antonio-based refiner, with a market-capitalization of $4.8 billion and $1 billion in debt, will likely end up with about $800 million in cash. That stash could reach $1 billion this year. \u001d  But what's a refiner to do, when, because of past missteps, investors will potentially react negatively to a big acquisition or to a major internal investment? \u001d  Friedman Billings Ramsey analyst Jacques Rousseau argues that the best use of the cash is a big buyback of its own shares, say $1 billion worth, to take out some 20% of the 67 million outstanding shares at the current 70.67 per share. He figures Tesoro could use a mix of about $600 million in cash plus additional debt to accomplish the share repurchase. \u001d  Tesoro hasn't reduced the share count much in recent years, he says, so such a buyback would make a \"material\" impact on earnings per share, increasing estimated profits about 18% this year by lowering shares outstanding. A similar move by refiner Ultramar Diamond Shamrock in 2001 led to a 26% rise in the stock price over the next 12 weeks, he points out. With oil and refined-product prices falling, refiners will likely see share volatility in 2007, and there will be chances to buy back the stock at prices lower than it is now. \u001d  Tesoro declined to comment on the report, but says it uses excess cash to create shareholder value by raising dividends, repurchasing shares and making capital investments. \b \u001d  Returns from value stocks, which have low price-earnings ratios and growth rates, have crushed growth stocks over the past decade. But in the six months since the market's lows last summer, growth stocks show inchoate signs of waking from a long torpor. \u001d  Although the current differential is small -- the Russell 1000 growth index is up 17% since mid-July, compared with 15% for the Russell 1000 value index -- it is intriguing, and potentially conducive to momentum-investment strategies. Rather than employing fundamental analysis, momentum investors look for stocks that show strong relative price outperformance, with the idea that stocks that go up tend to continue going up near-term. \u001d  \"We are in a unique environment in which certain stocks that perform better than the averages continue to outperform peers,\" says David Kovacs, a portfolio manager at Turner Investment Partners. With growth trying to make a comeback, \"this is one of those times when momentum strategies work.\" \u001d  In particular, there appears to be a move in asset-allocation strategies to growth from value, as well as a subtle shift to larger companies, he notes. Most large institutional investors can't make that shift overnight. Hence, once big mutual funds begin to do so, the effects on stock prices tend to persist, Kovacs adds. \u001d  The first phase of the accumulation process started back in July, coming out of the lows, he says, and has accelerated this month, after the market pause from mid-December to early January. \u001d  Kovacs has screened for companies with strong fundamental business trends and above-average short-term relative stock strength in the Jan. 5 to 17 period, in the belief that they will continue to outdo the market for the next two to four months as big fund managers pile in. (A portion of the screen is presented on the previous page.) \u001d  If institutions keep shifting to growth, then the next two to four months are likely to show excess returns for these stocks, he predicts. \b \u001d  Investors looking for an even shorter investment time frame might take a look at after-hours trading and what light it can shed on which way a stock will go the next day. \u001d  After-hours trading, which came of age during the stock-market bubble of 2000, remains the stepchild of traditional day-session trading. Many pros still view the various evening markets -- accessed through Instinet, among others -- as relatively illiquid and manned by nonprofessionals and naive stock jockeys, hence not indicative of the trading the next day. \u001d  That view may miss the mark. \u001d  Stocks develop distinct and consistent trading patterns in after-hours dealings, and it is a deeper market than many believe, contends Keith Lanigan, managing editor of a subscription Website aimed at such traders, www.midnighttrader.com, which began in 2000. \"It's like a window on next day's trading,\" he says. \u001d  There are stocks in which this phenomenon is particularly clear, adds Lanigan, who's been studying a wide range of shares looking for patterns. Some shares that have risen in the evening session after the official 4 p.m. close increase even further in the next day's traditional session. And some stocks that fall in the evening continue that decline the following day. \u001d  One stock showing predictability is Apple, he says. For example, in after-hours trading last Wednesday, following Apple's fiscal first-quarter earnings report earlier that day, Apple fell about 1.1%, to 94, by the time the evening session thinned out. In Thursday's regular session, Apple dropped 6%, to 89. Also Wednesday, Lam Research (LRCX), which fell 7% to 50 in the evening session after it released fiscal second-quarter results, declined 15% Thursday to 46.22. In both cases, shorting the shares in evening trading would have paid off the following day. \u001d  Lanigan says other candidates that report earnings this coming week and have shown after-hours tradeable patterns in the past are: Texas Instruments (TXN), on Monday; Avaya (AV), Citrix (CTXS), Yahoo! (YHOO) and QLogic (QLGC), Tuesday; Novellus Systems (NVLS) and Netflix (NFLX), Wednesday; and Synaptics (SYNA), Thursday. \u001d  What's behind this? Probably, the next day's trading sees analysts' ratings changes, as well as big players piling on or exiting, amplifying the move of the previous evening session. For those wanting to test Lanigan's predictions, free sights like Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com) give after-hours quotes as well as regular-session quotes. \u001d  --- \b                      VITAL SIGNS \b \b                            Friday's        Week's     Week's \b                               Close        Change     % Chg. \b \bDJ Industrials              12565.53         +9.45      +0.08 \bDJ Transportation            4859.30        +99.03      +2.08 \bDJ Utilities                  448.12         +2.96      +0.66 \bDJ 65 Stocks                 4202.83        +34.02      +0.82 \bDJ US Total Mkt               346.74         -0.30      -0.09 \bNYSE Comp.                   9179.53        +39.59      +0.43 \bAmex Comp.                   2067.95         +9.92      +0.48 \bS&P 500                      1430.50         -0.23      -0.02 \bS&P MidCap                    816.49         -3.94      -0.48 \bS&P SmallCap                  399.62         -2.99      -0.74 \bNasdaq                       2451.31        -51.51      -2.06 \bValue Line (arith.)          2237.81         -9.39      -0.42 \bRussell 2000                  785.16         -9.10      -1.15 \bDJ Wilshire 5000            14405.79        -20.21      -0.14 \b \b                                         Last Week   Week Ago \bNYSE \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:07 ET (05:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ced43f51ad15b68d97badeb0d1e50e80","symR":["12057.FR","AOX.YY","AZN","AZN.LN","BMY","SNY","FR0000120578","GB0009895292","US1101221083"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"=WSJ: Acting Bristol-Myers CEO Looks Beyond Nightmare Year","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T19:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12057.FR","AOX.YY","AZN","AZN.LN","BMY","SNY","FR0000120578","GB0009895292","US1101221083"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \b   By Sarah Rubenstein \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--James Cornelius, the interim chief executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY), will try to bring an end this week to a year-long nightmare involving the company's best-selling drug - a series of missteps that led to his predecessor's ouster. \u001d  Monday, Bristol-Myers heads to court in hopes of re-establishing its exclusive U.S. rights to the blood-thinner Plavix. Thursday, the company will report earnings that will be severely depressed partly because of a brief period last year in which it lost those rights. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  Many observers believe that Bristol-Myers, with a crop of new drugs at a time when the industry's pipeline is running dry, makes an attractive takeover candidate and that bids will emerge once the Plavix uncertainty has passed. Mr. Cornelius, who took the job in September, maintains that Bristol-Myers can remain independent. \u001d  But, in an interview, Mr. Cornelius acknowledged that his optimism about the company's future is predicated on keeping the Plavix patent. A loss in the trial over the drug - a nearly $4 billion seller for Bristol-Myers in 2005 - would mean \"a complete rethink of what we're trying to do,\" he said. He spoke at the company's offices in Lawrenceville, N.J. \u001d  Bristol-Myers said in December it expects to announce 2006 profits of 72 cents to 77 cents a share, compared with $1.52 a share in 2005. Sales of the company's second-biggest seller, cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol, faced generic competition for the first time in the United States and some European markets last year, weighing on the company's profits. \u001d  Then there was the unexpected blow last August, when Apotex Inc., following failed negotiations with Bristol-Myers to delay generic Plavix until 2011, briefly flooded a generic version of the drug on the market. \u001d  The prevailing view is that Bristol-Myers and Sanofi-Aventis SA (12057.FR) of France, which originally discovered Plavix and co-markets the drug with Bristol-Myers, are likely to win the patent trial, in U.S. District Court in New York. \u001d  That view is based in part on the conclusion of Judge Sidney Stein, who, in granting a preliminary injunction halting Apotex's sales of the generic last year, wrote that Bristol-Myers and Sanofi were likely to succeed. Plavix's patent is set to expire in 2011. \u001d  In the third quarter, the generic ate into sales of the branded drug by $525 million to $600 million. Once supplies of the generic are depleted, Bristol-Myers says it expects its own sales of Plavix to return to normal. \u001d  That done, Bristol-Myers - having put a number of challenges largely behind it - should transition into a growth period, analysts say. After Pravachol, the company won't face another patent expiration on a major drug until at least 2011. \u001d  Late last year, the company reached a preliminary agreement with the Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney in Massachusetts to settle investigations into its drug- pricing, sales and marketing practices. In the middle of this year comes the expiration of a deferred-prosecution agreement with the U.S. attorney in New Jersey following an accounting scandal, under which Bristol-Myers pledged to conduct itself lawfully for two years to avoid criminal indictments. And Bristol-Myers still faces ongoing investigations related to its handling of Plavix. \u001d  Meanwhile, the company has launched new drugs and improved its pipeline. \u001d  \"Earnings have been poor for a number of years, but now they're depressed and they're poised to accelerate,\" said  Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical analyst at Deutsche Bank. Bristol-Myers is an investment-banking client of Deutsche Bank. \u001d  It's not clear when Bristol-Myers will replace Mr. Cornelius with a permanent successor. While reiterating that he's not a candidate for the job, Mr. Cornelius said he would stay in the interim post as long as he's needed. \u001d  He pointed out that the company's board has said it's weighing internal and external candidates equally, but he added that the board would prefer somebody with CEO experience. \u001d  Mr. Cornelius says he backs the strategy mapped out by his predecessor, Peter Dolan, which is to focus heavily on diseases treated by specialist physicians, such as cancer and HIV, while maintaining a smaller sales force for primary-care medications. \u001d  Mr. Cornelius is also eyeing costs. The company has said it would cut $500 million in expenses in 2007 and $100 million in 2008. Mr. Cornelius said there is room for \"probably another $1 billion\" in savings. \u001d  Then Bristol-Myers will have to deliver on some of the drugs now in its pipeline. After years of lackluster performance by its research-and-development organization, Bristol-Myers launched eight new products in the U.S. from 2003 to 2006, half of them discovered in-house. \u001d  The company hopes eventually to shift its number of in-house discoveries to about two-thirds of its drugs, said Andrew Bonfield, the chief financial officer. It also says it's looking to enter more partnerships with other drug companies - potentially including large rivals - as a way to reduce the costs and risks of drug development. \u001d  This month, Bristol-Myers and drug giant AstraZeneca PLC (AZN.LN), announced a partnership to develop and market two experimental drugs for Type 2 diabetes discovered by Bristol-Myers. \u001d  -By Sarah Rubenstein of The Wall Street Journal; 212-416-4406, sarah.rubenstein@wsj.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 14:44 ET (19:44 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d337104fdf35f9686f3df18cd446d2df","symR":["ACGL","BHI","BRL","C","COF","DD","EFA","EWS","EXV2.XE","FD","FRA","GE","GLW","HIG","LYO","MEDI","NBR","PBR","PETR4.BR","PXD","RCL","RCS","SYMC","YAR.OS","YARIY","YRCW","BRPETRACNPR6","DE0006289358","NO0010208051","US1729671016","US2635341090","US3696041033","US4165151048","US9855771054"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(1/22) 2007 Barron's Roundtable -- Part 2: Mixing It Up","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T05:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACGL","BHI","BRL","C","COF","DD","EFA","EWS","EXV2.XE","FD","FRA","GE","GLW","HIG","LYO","MEDI","NBR","PBR","PETR4.BR","PXD","RCL","RCS","SYMC","YAR.OS","YARIY","YRCW","BRPETRACNPR6","DE0006289358","NO0010208051","US1729671016","US2635341090","US3696041033","US4165151048","US9855771054"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","BTC","CEF","CFN","CHC","CHM","CHS","CMT","DRG","DRL","EQS","EXT","IDD","INF","INP","INS","OIE","OIL","OIS","RCS","RTB","RTS","SOF","TRK","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XOBX","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Lauren R. Rublin \u001d  At the annual Barron's Roundtable, we spend the morning surveying the forest. After lunch, we examine the trees. How do you turn big-picture views about the economy, interest rates and equity markets into winning stocks, bonds and funds? Therein lies the essence of successful investing. \u001d  Fortunately, few folks on the planet have been more successful at translating macro themes into money than the 12 market mavens who graced our Jan. 8 event, including the five -- Bill Gross, Archie MacAllaster, Abby Cohen, Felix Zulauf and John Neff -- whose investment picks form the basis of this week's Roundtable installment. \u001d  In last week's Barron's, Bill Gross cast Pimco, his giant West Coast bond-investment firm, as a mere bit player in the fixed-income markets, sandwiched between the world's central banks on the one hand and giant asset allocators like the OPEC nations on the other. Even so, Bill remains our go-to guy for bonds, as he demonstrates again in the current issue by picking a pair of fixed-income funds from Pimco and its cross-country rival, BlackRock. His expertise extends to currencies, as well, including the laboring dollar. That's why he's also recommending the iShares MSCI EAFE fund -- for rest-of-the-world exposure. \u001d  For Archie MacAllaster, the animating theme is valuation, or the opportunity to buy fast-growing and financially healthy companies for much less than they're worth. The chairman of New York's MacAllaster, Pitfield MacKay, Archie made his name in financial services, and to that arena he returns with kind words for Hartford Financial, Capital One and Arch Capital. \"Wish I were that Arch,\" he quips. \u001d  The great bull market has come and gone, but Abby Cohen, Goldman Sachs' unflappable U.S. investment strategist, remains, explaining the post-bubble world as expertly as she discoursed on its manic predecessor. Abby's not a stockpicker but a stock peruser, scanning Goldman's Buy list for companies that amplify her ideas. The U.S. consumer has yet to fall down on the job, which should benefit cruise-line operator Royal Caribbean and Federated Department Stores. The government's efforts to contain health-care costs should bolster generic-drug makers such as Barr Pharmaceuticals. You get the picture. You'll also get the good word on General Electric, currently one of her favorites. \u001d  Never mind that Felix Zulauf, head of Switzerland's Zulauf Asset Management, is a wise student of markets and manias. He's also tops in currencies, commodities and whole countries, as his table-pounding pitch for Singapore suggests. Felix also likes back-from-the-dead European telecoms and Brazilian oil giant Petrobras, though most of his recommendations come with an asterisk: Please, please don't buy them until prices correct. Felix, you see, thinks world markets will sell off sharply in coming months, setting the stage for the bull's next big run. \u001d  John Neff, like Archie a consummate value investor, rounds out this week's stock- picking session. Both, as it turns out, are recommending Lyondell Chemical, which affords an opportunity to study how two savvy investors approach the same company. John retired some years back from the helm of the Vanguard Windsor Fund, but his eye is on the ball more than ever these days -- and on land-driller Nabors and his old friend Citigroup. \u001d  Please read on for the picks and preferences of all five pros, as well as the well-timed queries and amusing asides of their colleagues 'round the table. \b \u001d  Barron's: Give us a few ideas, Bill \u001d  Gross: My selections are predicated to a considerable extent upon the premise that the Federal Reserve will be lowering interest rates by midyear, and that interest rates on the longer end of the Treasury yield curve will be a function of asset allocations by relatively price-insensitive foreign central banks and reserve accumulators. Risk markets in general are somewhat at risk because of the potential for oil-producers' reserves to decline and for those monies to be withheld from the markets, to which they clearly were allocated in 2006. I am not necessarily suggesting that there will be a precipitous decline in financial assets, but that spreads are at risk of widening in the credit markets, and prices perhaps could be stagnant on the equity side. \u001d  Also -- and this view is endorsed by many people around this table -- the dollar ultimately is, if not a doomed currency, a weak currency relative to the rest of the world. The U.S. requires a depreciating currency to pay its bills to the rest of the world. We will get a weak dollar despite [Treasury Secretary Hank] Paulson's and prior Treasury secretaries' admonitions that they favor a strong-dollar policy. Treasury secretaries and domestic policy will have to favor weak-dollar movements in the future. So a weak dollar and risk markets somewhat at risk in 2007 form the basis for my selections today, many of which are bond-oriented. \b \u001d  Barron's: OK, let's have 'em. \u001d  Gross: My first pick, iShares MSCI EAFE, a Barclays exchange-traded fund [ticker: EFA], relates to my weak-dollar-policy thesis but at the same time allows investors to participate in the equity markets. It's one I recommended last year, and it did very well. It encompasses all markets other than the U.S., and is denominated in non-dollar currencies. This is an index fund of a thousand stocks. Fees are relatively low, which is important. All investors should continue to focus on how much they pay for asset management. This one has an overall expense ratio of 35 basis points [a basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point], so that's pretty cheap. Many investors, even yours truly, may wonder how to buy foreign currencies in a relatively inexpensive way. This is one way to do it, plus you capture long-term equity exposure. The fund has a 20% Japan orientation and a 20% U.K. exposure. The balance is in euroland, Asia and other positions. \u001d  Gabelli: Isn't this a diluted way to participate in these markets? The Japanese sell to the U.S., and their earnings get depressed if the dollar gets weaker. \u001d  Gross: I suspect the dollar will depreciate at a 5%-plus annual rate. To the extent that you get a 5% kicker in terms of dollar weakness, that more than makes up for the dilution. This is a great diversifier. U.S. investors are too focused domestically. They think everything revolves around the U.S. economy. In fact, global corporations, many of which are U.S.-based, have lots of foreign earnings. By buying them, U.S. investors participate globally. But they also need to go outside the U.S., and this ETF does that, giving them non-dollar exposure. One of the ways people will be able to retire going forward is to extract earnings and wealth from the rest of the world, which is growing faster than the U.S., certainly in currency-denominated terms. This is a cheap way to participate. \u001d  Next, I'm going to recommend a bond market -- the Japanese bond market -- which might raise some questions. On the surface, it provides a yield of only 1.50%. Investors everywhere, even me before I snap myself to with smelling salts, wonder how you can turn a 1.5% yield into something that supposedly is attractive to investors. The way to do that is to buy a JGB [Japanese government bond] future [JBH7] via the commodities exchange. That's the March contract for this JGB 10-year bond, which yields about 1.5%. As a buyer, you basically take that 1.50% and apply it to the money-market rate of the country you are in. With money-market rates in Japan at 25 basis points, this yields only 1.5% to 1.75%. But if you're in euroland, you attach the 1.5% yield to 3.5% or 3.75% local money-market rates, and suddenly you have a 5.2% bond guaranteed by the Japanese government. \b \u001d  Barron's: And in the U.S.? \u001d  Gross: With the federal-funds rate at 5.25%, you tack on the 1.5% JGB yield and you've got 6.75%. That is almost as competitive, and in some cases more competitive than junk bonds. It's hard to explain how you could buy a bond at 1.50% and turn it into a 6.75% yield, but that's simply the way it works. [Buying a Japanese bond-futures contract and investing in a U.S.-dollar money market at 5.25% is similar to buying a Japanese bond and hedging the currency exposure. First, hedge the currency by borrowing yen at 0.25% to buy dollars at 5.25%, for an effective yield of 5%. The bond-futures contract you buy with those funds effectively yields about 1.25% to 1.5%, or the difference between the underlying bond's 1.5%-to-1.75% yield and the 0.25% yield on short-term Japanese bonds.] \u001d  By buying JGB futures you are increasing your spread, though at the risk of the Japanese economy strengthening and the Bank of Japan raising interest rates either gradually or substantially over time. If you buy a junk bond in the U.S. you are risking default. If you buy a JGB future you are risking future yield in terms of an overnight raid by the Bank of Japan. \u001d  Gabelli: You don't think they will raise rates in the next few weeks? \u001d  Gross: I do. I think they'll go to 50 basis points, but there they'll stop, because with oil prices falling, the Japanese economy nominally will be sinking below the line again. [The BOJ voted Thursday to leave rates unchanged at 0.25%.] If they stop at 0.50%, you'll not only get the yield from this contract, but some appreciation, as well. \b \u001d  Barron's: Japan's fiscal situation is worse than ours. \u001d  Gross: They have a lot of debt from the standpoint of their federal deficit, which they are trying to correct. In terms of their dollar reserves, however, they are one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Though they have internal deficits of substantial magnitude, they have been saving lots of money. So the economy is not as bad as it would appear. \u001d  Zulauf: Bill, are you assuming Japanese policymakers are making a mistake in being too tight, and that the economy will sink again? \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 20, 2007 00:04 ET (05:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d90646d2b909328caf2e79029215e914","symR":["JDH.YY"],"date":"2007-01-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"UK PRESS:Jurys Doyle Weighs Possible Sale Of Hotel Brand","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-20T11:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JDH.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["LOD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Dublin-based Jurys Doyle Hotel Group PLC  has hired advisers to look at a possible sale of its Jurys Inn brand worth up to EUR1 billion, the Times of London reported Saturday, without quoting sources.
