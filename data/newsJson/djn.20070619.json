Several other airlines subsequently were put on the block. \u001d  The new \"Open Skies\" treaty between the European Union and the U.S. frees previously restricted trans-Atlantic routes to competition and may fuel deals. Under the pact, if buyers from one EU country acquire an airline in another one, the purchased carrier won't risk losing its routes between the U.S. and EU. Additionally, European carriers can fly to the U.S. out of any European city, not just out of their home markets. \u001d  Combinations among European carriers would give them marketing heft and operating efficiencies, making them better positioned to compete in global markets. That could put European airlines even more in competition with U.S. carriers that have expanded their international networks in recent years to escape competition from no-frills rivals in the U.S. domestic market. \u001d  Soon after Iberia said it was open to a potential acquisition, it received a proposal from private-equity firm TPG. British Airways, which already owns 10% of Iberia, later joined with TPG. \u001d  Other airlines looking at Iberia include Lufthansa. The German carrier has discussed a potential bid with the London private-equity firm Apax Partners Worldwide, according to people close to the matter. \u001d  British Airways could face further pressure from Lufthansa closer to home. Last week, Scandinavian Airlines System AB said it planned to sell its 20% holding in British Midland Airways, known as bmi, which serves short-haul routes in Europe. Lufthansa already owns just shy of 30% of bmi and is considered the most likely buyer of the stake. SAS also said it aims to sell its 95% stake in its Spanish unit, Spanair. \u001d  British Airways dominates the takeoff and landing slots at London's Heathrow Airport, the world's busiest international airport. It controls 3,930 round-trip slots, or 41% of the airport's total, which are owned by 85 different airlines. At No. 2 is bmi, followed by Lufthansa, according to Airports Coordination Ltd., the company that runs the slot allocation. Boosting its stake in bmi would give Lufthansa a much larger presence at Heathrow. \u001d  \"Presumably, there will be some coordination with Lufthansa,\" SAS spokesman Hans Ollongren says. \"But it's very early in the process now.\" He adds that a deal for SAS's bmi stake is expected by early 2008. \u001d  A bmi spokesman says the sale is subject to the shareholders' agreement, under which the other shareholders have a say to whom SAS sells its stake. \u001d  Lufthansa could gain another clutch of Heathrow slots by buying a large stake in Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. Singapore Airlines is looking for a buyer for its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, according to people familiar with the matter. Virgin ranks just after Lufthansa in Heathrow slots, with 322 weekly round trips. \u001d  Lufthansa, Virgin and bmi together would account for 19% of the Heathrow slots, according to Airports Coordination figures. A Lufthansa spokeswoman declines to comment. \u001d  Virgin and bmi already market themselves as a package to some companies that buy airline seats, pairing Virgin's long-haul network with bmi's short-range routes. \"We've always believed that consumers would benefit from a Virgin-bmi tie-up, because of the logic of linking a long-haul carrier up with a short-haul one,\" says Virgin Atlantic spokesman Paul Charles. \"It's for bmi and Lufthansa to determine the future structure of bmi and its operations.\" He adds that \"Singapore Airlines is a long-term shareholder.\" \u001d  The competition resulting from any such deals would put further pressure on an already-squeezed British Airways, whose shares have fallen about 16% in the past three months and are trading near their 52-week low. Lufthansa shares are flat over the same three-month period. Iberia's stock has been trading in a narrow range slightly above the 3.60 euros ($4.83) a share TPG indicated it might bid. \u001d  Another option in any European shake-up could be a more-ambitious merger between Lufthansa and British Airways, creating the largest airline in Europe by any measure. The combination would provide the carriers with significant cost savings, people close to the matter say. British Airways says it doesn't comment on rumors. Lufthansa declines to comment about such a combination. \u001d  One of the few international airline mergers, the acquisition of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines by Air France in 2004, has shown rivals what can be achieved with greater scale in the highly fragmented industry. After integrating its two networks and hubs, Air France-KLM has grabbed a growing portion of European air traffic, particularly among high-paying business fliers on long trips involving transfers. \u001d  Lufthansa followed in 2005 with the smaller acquisition of Swiss International Air Lines.

Okuda and Toyoda also expressed concern about rising wages at Toyota's U.S. plants, all but one of them nonunion. To date, Toyota has matched United Auto Workers wages for tens of thousands of Toyota factory jobs. In Georgetown, Ky., for example, its pays an average wage of $26 an hour. Although that's a bit less than UAW workers get at GM or Ford factories, bonuses that Toyota pays twice a year to hourly workers more than make up the difference. (U.S. auto makers have long complained that generous health-care and pension benefits they provide union workers and retirees have saddled them with a $30-an-hour labor-cost disadvantage.) \u001d  Discounting health-care and pension benefits, Toyota workers are among the highest-paid manufacturing workers in the U.S. Toyota executives had reason to be concerned about labor costs: A weaker yen has made U.S. costs relatively higher, and efforts by the Big Three to cut labor costs threaten to erode Toyota's competitive edge. Toyota executives project U.S. manufacturing labor costs will rise by $900 million by 2011 because of a growing labor force and expected increases in wages and benefits, according to a recent Toyota study. \u001d  Toyota's North American executives had already been looking for ways to reduce manufacturing and operational costs at its next U.S. plant. But the concerns raised by Messrs. Okuda and Toyoda made it more urgent to find a \"low-cost business model\" for the U.S., according to one Toyota executive. \u001d  Executives decided that North American plants, starting with Tupelo, will adopt certain innovations currently being introduced in Japan. For example, Toyota has developed a shorter assembly line that can churn out a dozen different cars nearly simultaneously, on the same line -- one every 50 seconds, one of the fastest production speeds in the world. Toyota also aims to outfit each U.S. plant to produce a variety of models, giving the company more flexibility to adjust to shifts in demand. \u001d  In addition, it plans to reduce U.S. labor costs by revamping its pay policies, aligning hourly wages for new hires more closely with prevailing manufacturing pay in the regions where each plant is located. Executives say they have no plans to cut hourly wages of its current U.S. factory workers. New hires, however, will be paid no more than about 50% over the prevailing manufacturing wage in the area. \u001d  That policy means that in Tupelo, where the average manufacturing job pays about $14 an hour, Toyota workers would likely make no more than about $20 an hour. In addition, Toyota intends to use more temporary workers, who typically get paid about half of what regular workers make and have few or no fringe benefits. \u001d  \"We tried to create a model where we continuously operate profitably, even as the Big Three car makers from Detroit send their manufacturing jobs south of the border to Mexico,\" says one executive involved in devising the model. \u001d  By January, Tupelo had emerged as the front-runner for the new plant location. But at a meeting in mid-January, Messrs. Okuda and Toyoda posed more questions. Among other things, they asked why Toyota planned to spend $1.3 billion to build a new vehicle-assembly plant when the yen's persistent weakness made Japan a much cheaper place to produce cars, according to senior executives and board members. The two former top executives wanted to know \"whether we had a precise plan to make Tupelo profitable quickly,\" according to one senior executive who was present in the meeting. \"And we didn't have the answer.\" \u001d  After a detailed financial review, Toyota decided to scale back the Tupelo project. Instead of building 200,000 Highlanders a year, the new plant will produce 150,000. It will open in 2010 instead of 2009, and will employ about 2,000. \u001d  Inside Toyota, management-board members say, the scaled-back Mississippi project sent a message: no more new vehicle-assembly plants until production capacity is used up at existing ones. If North American demand for Toyotas continues to climb, the company can increase manufacturing capacity by adding second assembly lines at existing plants rather than by building new ones. \u001d  Now in jeopardy, these executives say, is a plan Toyota had been exploring to produce subcompact cars like the Toyota Yaris in Mexico rather than to import them from Japan. \u001d  Mitsuo Kinoshita, a Toyota executive vice president, says the company could produce the Yaris at existing plants in Ontario or in Brazil. \"It's a complete blank sheet of paper right now,\" he says. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 23:03 ET (03:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2d7da85fde5d16f1682ac42aa731a78b","symR":["BTH"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder GOERGEN ROBERT B LIVING TRUST Registers 100,000 Of BLYTH INC >BTH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T02:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BTH"],"IndustryCodes":["HPN","HPR","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: BLYTH INC \bSYMBOL: BTH \b \b \bFILER: GOERGEN ROBERT B LIVING TRUST \bTITLE: Affiliated Person \bBROKER: JP MORGAN SECURITIES INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 100,000        DATE REGISTERED: 6/14/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 6/12/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will receive $625,000 of the total fine. \u001d  The case was \"hotly contested,\" Wiley Rein said. \"Decisions made in that context are inevitably subject to varying interpretations.\" A spokesman for Zurich American declined to comment. Coughlin Duffy didn't return a call. \u001d  In 2001, before the terrorist attacks, Zurich American issued a policy to World Trade Center Properties LLC, which leased the Twin Towers from the Port Authority. Following the attacks, suits were filed against the Port Authority and World Trade Center Properties for personal injury and property damage. That litigation touched off the suit over Zurich's insurance obligations. Zurich initially denied that the Port Authority was covered by the insurance. But Zurich employees testified that they intended the Port Authority to be covered. Zurich, the judge found, tried to delete the electronic version of a 62-page insurance document, which the judge said established the Port Authority's right to coverage. Zurich eventually agreed that the policy covered the Port Authority. \u001d  -- Jennifer S.

With about $938 million in first-quarter sales, Plavix is Bristol-Myers's best-selling drug. \u001d  Separately, Bristol Myers said the Food and Drug Administration has granted priority review status to one of the company's breast-cancer treatments. \u001d  And \"fanning the flames\" was a return of speculation that Bristol-Myers might be a takeover target, said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group. \u001d  Reports of interest from larger drug developers, including Sanofi-Aventis, have been widely cited for some of the run-up in Bristol-Myers shares in recent months, and some analysts said such a deal is more likely with the legal overhang removed. \u001d  \"The news opens the door to a takeout, which has been widely discussed in the press,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Jami Rubin wrote to clients. Though Rubin said he thinks Bristol-Myers could fetch a price in the mid-$30 range, he added that the fact that it has product deals with other large drug companies might complicate any buyout. \u001d  A Bristol-Myers spokesman said the company doesn't comment on rumors and speculation. \u001d  Though also heavier than usual, the volume of call options traded on Sanofi-Aventis was dwarfed by trading in Bristol-Myers. Almost 244,000 call options and nearly 80,000 put options on Bristol-Myers changed hands. About 7,300 call options and about 4,300 put options on Sanofi-Aventis traded. \u001d  With shares of Bristol-Myers up $1.27, or 4.2%, to $31.58, traders targeted contracts that give them the right to pay $32.50 and $35 for the shares in coming months. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 22:45 ET (02:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3e33ac1903cb6192f4ff686809874c23","symR":["OATS","WFMI"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(6/20) UPDATE: CEO's Words May Cook Whole Foods","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T02:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OATS","WFMI"],"IndustryCodes":["FDR","RTS","XDJGI","XFFX","XNQ1","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By David Kesmodel \u001d  Federal antitrust officials aim to use the words of Whole Foods Market Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive John Mackey as a tool against the company as they move to block the natural-food chain's purchase of rival Wild Oats Markets Inc. \u001d  In its June 6 lawsuit -- a more detailed version of which became available yesterday -- the Federal Trade Commission quoted Mr. Mackey as telling fellow directors in internal documents that buying Wild Oats would enable the company to \"avoid nasty price wars\" that could \"harm [Whole Foods'] gross margins and profitability\" in Portland, Ore.; Nashville, Tenn.; Boulder, Colo.; and other cities. \u001d  The agency, in the complaint filed in a federal court in Washington, D.C., said Mr. Mackey also told the board that the $565 million deal would eliminate the possibility that a major conventional supermarket chain such as Kroger Co. would create a competing national natural-foods retailer. Wild Oats \"is the only existing company that has the brand and number of stores to be a meaningful springboard for another player,\" he said, according to the suit. \u001d  The agency yesterday released Mr. Mackey's statements, which had been redacted from the original complaint. \u001d  The government is highlighting Mr. Mackey's comments, which it obtained from the company while reviewing the merger, to bolster its contention that the deal would reduce competition and raise prices for consumers. Among the newly disclosed material is the commission's contention that Whole Foods intends after acquiring Wild Oats to close \"numerous\" Wild Oats stores, sell others and operate the remainder as Whole Foods outlets. \u001d  Last night, Mr. Mackey vehemently challenged the FTC's assertions in a voluminous entry on his blog on the company's Web site. He accused the government of \"bullying tactics\" and said it was taking internal conversations -- many of them by email -- out of context in order to bolster its argument. \u001d  \"They aren't going to place\" internal correspondence \"in their proper context,\" he wrote, adding that many statements by executives were merely part of brainstorming sessions or \"macho posturing\" common to any competitive organization. \u001d  Mr. Mackey blasted the agency for failing to \"bother to actually gather any pricing information from Whole Foods or Wild Oats\" as part of its critique of the merger. Mr. Mackey also wrote: \"If eliminating a competitor is inherently 'bad' or 'wrong' then the FTC should probably never allow any mergers to ever occur.\" \u001d  In an interview, Jim Sud, executive vice president of growth and development for Whole Foods, said the company is at \"a severe disadvantage\" in trying to fight the FTC's stance. \"They have the power to subpoena whatever documents they want,\" he said. \"It's been very one-sided.\" \u001d  Whole Foods, which has submitted more than 20 million internal documents to the agency, hasn't made any decisions about how many Wild Oats stores it might close if the deal goes through, Mr. Sud added. The company lacks financial information about the Wild Oats stores on which to base such decisions. \u001d  A Wild Oats spokeswoman declined to comment. \u001d  Other companies had worried that the commission's complaint might signal more-aggressive antitrust enforcement in Washington. But that concern could ease with the knowledge that the commission's case appears to be based largely on the companies' own words. \u001d  The core of the argument against the deal is that Whole Foods and Wild Oats are essentially the two leading competitors in a distinct market for premium organic foods. According to this argument, conventional food retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger don't really count, even as they increasingly offer similar products in pursuit of higher profit margins. \u001d  For instance, the lawsuit quotes Mr. Mackey as saying that organic foods are \"only one part of its highly successful business model,\" citing as others \"superior quality, superior service . . . and superior store experience.\" The lawsuit quotes Mr. Mackey as saying, \"Wal-Mart doesn't sell high-quality perishables\" and that is \"why Wal-Mart isn't going to hurt Whole Foods.\" \u001d  Karen Burk, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the company has \"to be doing something right if 127 million customers shop our stores every week.\" \u001d  Whole Foods, of Austin, Texas, agreed in February to buy Wild Oats, of Boulder, Colo., for $18.50 a share. Whole Foods argues the FTC is defining the natural-foods sector too narrowly, stressing that Kroger and other chains have been expanding their selection of such foods and even redesigning stores to look more like Whole Foods' locations. Whole Foods says in a document on its Web site that it faces \"substantial\" competition from conventional stores and smaller natural-foods outlets. \u001d  When the government sued, it filed its complaint and supporting materials under court seal because they contained proprietary business information. The Wall Street Journal, owned by Dow Jones & Co., sent a letter to Judge Paul L. Friedman asking him to unseal many documents, saying the issues are of public interest. \u001d  June 13, the FTC sought to have the full text of its complaint released, and Monday, Whole Foods and Wild Oats said they wouldn't object. \u001d  In 4 p.m. composite trading yesterday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of Whole Foods were down 56 cents, or 1.4%, to $38.95. Shares of Wild Oats declined 17 cents, or 1%, to $17.03 on the Nasdaq. \u001d  --- \u001d  Dana Cimilluca contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 22:54 ET (02:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3ffaeab51ce23ee771240fee5554c40b","symR":["GOOG","MSFT","US5949181045"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(6/20) Microsoft Agrees To Vista Change","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T03:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GOOG","MSFT","US5949181045"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","SOF","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Robert A. Guth and John R. Wilke \u001d  Responding to complaints by Google Inc. to state and federal antitrust enforcers, Microsoft Corp. agreed to change its Windows Vista software in advance of a court hearing next week that will review its compliance with a 2002 antitrust settlement. \u001d  In a regular status report on the Microsoft settlement, the Justice Department and state attorneys general said yesterday that Microsoft has agreed to make changes later this year that will make it easier for competitors such as Google to run their desktop search programs with the company's new Vista operating software. \u001d  The agreement follows a complaint Google made to the Justice Department and state officials earlier this year alleging that Vista, the latest version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, makes it hard for consumers to use rival desktop-search applications provided by Google and others. Microsoft executives earlier this month denied that claim but said the company was willing to alter Vista if requested. \u001d  The resulting compromise follows a dispute between the Justice Department and some states over how to respond to Google's complaint, and even last night some attorneys general remained concerned that it hadn't gone far enough. In a filing in U.S. District Court in Washington last night, the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general said that the agreement, \"which aims to promote user choice, will resolve any issues the [Google] complaint may raise.\" Federal Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly will review the report in a hearing Tuesday. \u001d  \"This is a positive step that will allow greater access by competitors,\" said the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal. But he said Google should be permitted to have a voice in the court review to ensure the compromise accomplishes what it is supposed to do. \u001d  Under the compromise, Microsoft agreed to allow more ways for PC users to access competitors' desktop search programs, according to the report. The company will create a way for users to set their PC to default to a search program of their choosing. So, for instance, users could set the \"Search\" button under the Start menu of a Vista PC to always use Google's desktop search program. Microsoft also agreed to provide PC makers and software makers information on how to write desktop search programs to run more smoothly on Vista PCs. \u001d  \"We're pleased we were able to reach an agreement with all the States and the Justice Department that addresses their concerns so that everyone can move forward,\" Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said in a statement. \u001d  Microsoft's changes will be included in a previously scheduled update to Vista due later this year. Called Service Pack 1, the update is software that can be downloaded over the Internet.  It will include any number of additions to Vista, including software to fix bugs and other problems. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 23:40 ET (03:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"40fb413b999de4300f28ee22e826040b","symR":["AIG","US0268741073"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder STARR INTERNATIONAL CO INC Registers 500,000 Of AMER INTL >AIG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T02:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AIG","US0268741073"],"IndustryCodes":["INF","INS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP \bSYMBOL: AIG \b \b \bFILER: STARR INTERNATIONAL CO INC \bTITLE: Beneficial Owner \bBROKER: CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 500,000        DATE REGISTERED: 6/14/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 6/12/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

The price of Gulf Coast jet fuel was up 12% from the previous quarter, according to UBS Investment Research. A factor behind the rally in energy prices in the past several years has been surging growth in China. \u001d  FedEx is moving to capitalize on that growth. In May, it launched guaranteed overnight express-delivery services within China. It expects to shift its Asian hub from the Philippines to China in 2008. It may set up a base for its pilots in Hong Kong. \u001d  While China has been red hot, the U.S. has been cooling off. Waning deliveries to the U.S. from Asia hurt FedEx's third-quarter results. The weaker dollar cuts into demand for overseas goods, which get more pricey the further the greenback falls. That could provide another stumbling block for FedEx in its latest quarter. \u001d  Expansion into China is likely to pinch FedEx's profits in the short term. The company expects its tax rate to rise to 39% in the fourth quarter from 33.2% in the previous quarter due to the impact of its recent acquisition of DTW Group, an express carrier in China. \u001d  FedEx's China move \"will slow down earnings growth in this fiscal year, but it's also what will get them back on their long-term track record,\" said A.G. Edwards analyst Donald Broughton. \b \u001d  Corporate-Debt Market \u001d  Continues Its 'Lite' Run \b \u001d  History isn't much of a guide in the debt markets these days. \u001d  In the mortgage-bond market, investors are grappling with mounting losses on bonds backed by subprime loans, brought on by years of loose lending standards to risky borrowers. Yet in the corporate-debt market, investors continue to make loans to heavily indebted companies on lenient terms. \u001d  Consider the proliferation of loans that are being taken out by borrowers without standard performance measures known as covenants. In a report released this week, Fitch Ratings said through the first five months, the percent of loans coming to the market with cash-flow requirements for borrowers dropped to 44.3% from 68.1% in 2006 and below the 1996-2006 average of 78.1% \u001d  It means investors will have fewer warning signs when a company's fortunes deteriorate, and they could be left with bigger losses when default rates pick up. Defaults are low, which has led to a huge appetite for corporate debt. \u001d  First Data is expected to market its entire $14 billion loan as \"covenant lite\" as part of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts's $26 billion leveraged buyout of the company. \u001d  These loans tend to be bundled together and sold in pieces to investors. It has made the loan market more permissive than when it was controlled largely by banks, which made the loans and were accountable for getting their money back. \u001d  Yet leniency has a price. Just ask subprime-mortgage investors. \u001d  -- Cynthia Koons \u001d  --- \u001d  Send comments to scott.patterson@wsj.com or cynthia.koons@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 23:01 ET (03:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"61d106dc179936d9d950d9407bb9a2f7","symR":["ABG"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Dir DURHAM Registers 5,000 Of ASBURY AUTOMOTIVE GROUP INC >ABG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T02:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABG"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: ASBURY AUTOMOTIVE GROUP INC \bSYMBOL: ABG \b \b \bFILER: DURHAM MICHAEL J \bTITLE: Director \bBROKER: CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 5,000          DATE REGISTERED: 6/14/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 6/7/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

Ltd. in South Korea, Maxis Communications Bhd. in Malaysia, PT Telekomunikasi Selular (Telkomsel) in Indonesia and Taiwan Mobile Co. \u001d  In its effort to expand outside the U.S., Yahoo said it would test localized versions of the service in Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Spain, the United Kingdom, Thailand and Vietnam. \u001d  Mobile devices have emerged as a new battleground for Internet companies like Yahoo and rival Google Inc. that are rushing to get their services onto cellphones. Both Yahoo and Google have built mobile applications in an effort to win places on those devices, just as they have on personal computers, and build advertising businesses there. \u001d  Yahoo's Mr. Ott predicted that \"2007 is going to be the tipping point for mobile, because finally \"the phones are good enough, the networks are good enough and now, with the new Yahoo Go, the products are good enough.\" \u001d  Yahoo's downloadable Go for Mobile application, which has been in test mode in the U.S. since January and has been requested by more than three million people, makes a number of Yahoo's Web-based services for computer users available from their mobile devices. \u001d  Go will be released with several key improvements, the company said. Yahoo Mail users will be able to open common attachments, including Word, Excel and PDF files, in addition to the basic text and image files that they previously could view. They also will be able to access and file emails in folders. \u001d  The new Local and Maps service will offer satellite maps and real-time information on traffic conditions. There will be shortcuts for finding the location of ATMs, restaurants and other places people often search for while on the road.

(6752.TO) said Wednesday its plasma display panel capacity will double when a new plant begins operation in May 2009, keeping the company's production in line with its sales targets. \u001d  The Osaka-based maker of Panasonic-brand products aims to capture a quarter of the global market for large flat-screen TVs in the year through March 2010. \u001d  Plasma technology was once thought to be the most suitable technology for large flat-screen products, but liquid crystal display TVs are encroaching on that market and driving prices down. \u001d  Matsushita has responded by aggressively ramping up production to capture market share, even as other domestic plasma makers scale back or drop out altogether. \u001d  The company has decided to manufacture 300,000 plasma display panels, or PDPs, a month in terms of 42-inch screens at its No. 3 Amagasaki plant in western Japan, where construction will start in November, a Matsushita Electric spokesman said. \u001d  Panels are the main component in flat-screen TVs. \u001d  Combined with a planned PDP output increase at an existing plant, Matsushita will be able to turn out 1.26 million panels a month by May 2009, up from the current 640,000 panels, the spokesman said. \u001d  This is roughly in line with the company's goal of capturing a 25% market share in the year through March 2010, which it has said will require it to sell about 15 million sets. \u001d  The No. 3 Amagasaki plant will eventually be able to turn out 1 million PDPs a month but Matsushita will decide on further production increases after May 2009, depending on demand, he said. \b \u001d  -By Jay Alabaster and Kazuhiro Shimamura, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; kazuhiro.shimamura@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 23:39 ET (03:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a8d087f207038bae1f23181fbefaea1f","symR":["VSA.XX","WMT","US9311421039"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(6/20) Wal-Mart Plans To Sell Debit Card From Visa","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T03:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VSA.XX","WMT","US9311421039"],"IndustryCodes":["CFN","RTB","RTS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Gary McWilliams \u001d  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is expected to announce today a broader push into financial services, selling a Visa debit card under its own name at about 4,000 U.S. Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores. \u001d  Customers will be able to use the Wal-Mart MoneyCard to shop online, buy gasoline, get cash from an ATM, and use it where Visa cards are accepted. \u001d  The world's largest retailer by revenue has been angling to provide financial services for its customers, many of whom do not have bank accounts. In March, it withdrew an application for an industrial-loan bank charter after the proposal met stiff opposition from commercial banks, savings and loans, and some members of Congress. It already sells money orders, international cash transfers and bill-payment services. \u001d  A spokesman for Wal-Mart, Bentonville, Ark., declined to comment on the announcement. John B. Menzer, vice-chairman and chief administrative officer, yesterday hinted at the rollout in an investors' conference in Chicago. \"You will see more financial services coming very shortly.\" Mr. Menzer said. \"You may not need a bank to do some of these.\" \u001d  According to a Wal-Mart Web site, the MoneyCard can be loaded with a paycheck or government check at its stores. It will sell for about $9 and come with fees for loading cash onto the card and monthly maintenance. \u001d  Retailers including CVS Inc., RadioShack Corp., RiteAid and Walgreen sell similar Visa debit cards. Wal-Mart will use a subsidiary of General Electric Corp. for the card's services. It has a long history with GE's consumer-finance group, launching a Wal-Mart Discover Card issued by GE two years ago. Last year, GE and Wal-Mart released a co-branded credit card in China. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 23:36 ET (03:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a9393baa7c9208842dc2e581debdb4aa","symR":["WNS"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder FIRST MAGNUS CONSULTING LLC Registers 20,000 Of WNS HOLDINGS LTD >WNS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T02:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WNS"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: WNS HOLDINGS LTD \bSYMBOL: WNS \b \b \bFILER: FIRST MAGNUS CONSULTING LLC \bTITLE: Shareholder \bBROKER: JP MORGAN SECURITIES INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 20,000         DATE REGISTERED: 6/14/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 6/11/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

Guth and John R. Wilke \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Responding to complaints by Google Inc. (GOOG) to state and federal antitrust enforcers, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) agreed to change its Windows Vista software in advance of a court hearing next week that will review its compliance with a 2002 antitrust settlement. \u001d  In a regular status report on the Microsoft settlement, the Justice Department and state attorneys-general said Tuesday that Microsoft has agreed to a compromise that will make it easier for competitors such as Google to run their desktop search programs with the company's new Vista operating software. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  The agreement follows a complaint Google made to the Justice Department and state earlier this year alleging that Vista, the latest version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, makes it hard for consumers to use rival desktop-search applications provided by Google and others. Microsoft executives earlier this month denied that claim but said the company was willing to alter Vista if requested. \u001d  The resulting compromise follows a dispute between the Justice Department and some states over how to respond to Google's concern, and even last night some attorneys general remained concerned that it hadn't gone far enough. In a filing in U.S. District Court in Washington last night, the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general said that the agreement, \"which aims to promote user choice, will resolve any issues the [Google] complaint may raise.\" Federal Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly will review the report in a hearing next Tuesday. \u001d  \"This is a positive step that will allow greater access by competitors,\" said the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal. But he said that Google should be permitted to have a voice in the court review to ensure the compromise accomplishes what it is supposed to do. \u001d  Under the compromise, Microsoft agreed to allow more ways for PC users to access competitors' desktop search programs, according to the report. The company will create a way for users to set their PC to default to a search program of their choosing. So, for instance, users could set the \"Search\" button under the Start menu of a Vista PC to always use Google's desktop search program. Microsoft also agreed to provide PC makers and software makers information on how to write desktop search programs to run more smoothly on Vista PCs. \u001d  \"We're pleased we were able to reach an agreement with all the States and the Justice Department that addresses their concerns so that everyone can move forward,\" Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said in a statement. \u001d  Microsoft's changes will be included in a previously scheduled update to Vista due later this year. Called Service Pack 1, the update is software which can be downloaded over the Internet that will include any number of additions to Vista, including software to fix bugs and other problems. \u001d  The altercation and its resolution demonstrate how Microsoft's past continues to haunt it even as Windows' influence is lessened with the advent of Web services such as Google search. During its rise in the 1990s, Microsoft waged an intense anti-trust battle with the federal government over its use of Windows to cripple browser maker Netscape Communications Corp. The 2002 settlement included a \"consent decree,\" under which Microsoft must adhere to certain guidelines to ensure that its operating system doesn't hinder the ability of others to compete with it. In Google's complaint it alleged that Microsoft's Vista violated the decree. \u001d  Desktop search is software that allows users to scan the contents of their hard drives, emails and other personal information. The software is part of a broader strategy by Google and others to create ties with PC users and draw them to other services online, which could become more important as consumers store files in various online and offline locations. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 22:38 ET (02:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b41acd12240aed781f01287ad558d961","symR":["SPDV","SPDV"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder BENSON JAMES W & SUSAN C Registers 5,000 Of SPACEDEV INC >SPDV","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T02:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SPDV"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: SPACEDEV INC \bSYMBOL: SPDV \b \b \bFILER: BENSON JAMES W & SUSAN C \bTITLE: Affiliated Person \bBROKER: CHARLES SCHWAB & CO INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 5,000          DATE REGISTERED: 6/12/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 6/5/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

Berman \u001d  Home Depot Inc. announced a big increase of up to $22.5 billion to its stock-repurchase plan, representing more than a quarter of its market capitalization, funded in part by a deal to sell its construction-supply business for $10.3 billion to a trio of investors. \u001d  The nation's top home-improvement retailer by sales also plans to borrow heavily to finance the massive share buyback in an effort to ignite its flagging stock price. As a result of the borrowing, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service Inc. both placed Home Depot's credit ratings under review for possible downgrades. \u001d  The company increased the buyback program to a total of up to $40 billion. The company has already bought back $16.5 billion under its earlier authorizations. \u001d  The buyback, announced late in the day, sent Home Depot's share price climbing to $40.34, up $2.07, or 5.4%, in after-hours trading. As of 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Home Depot was at $38.27, up 31 cents. \u001d  The proposed buyback is equivalent to more than a quarter of Home Depot's $74.9 billion market cap. Since the first of the year, Home Depot's stock has slid almost 8% as it struggled to jump-start sales, amid a sharp slowdown in the housing sector. \u001d  Home Depot wasn't the only company using buybacks as a tool yesterday. Expedia Inc. said it will spend $3.5 billion to repurchase 42% of its shares. \u001d  Bain Capital LLC, Carlyle Group and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Inc. agreed to buy Home Depot's wholesale construction-supply business, with each taking a one-third stake. Critics had complained the unit siphoned attention and capital from the retailer's core home-improvement stores. \u001d  Home Depot wanted to sell the division so that it could put more money and effort into rejuvenating customer service, staff morale and sales at its chain of more than 2,100 retail stores. \u001d  Under former Chief Executive Bob Nardelli, Home Depot built the wholesale construction-supply business through nearly 40 acquisitions totaling more than $7 billion over the past few years. HD Supply sells infrastructure and maintenance products to builders, municipal systems and other businesses, generating about 13% of Home Depot's sales in fiscal 2006 but delivering 80% of its sales growth. \u001d  Mr. Nardelli bought these businesses at the height of the home-building boom. As analyst Colin McGranahan of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. pointed out, the winning bid, which is about 10 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a discount to what Home Depot was paying a couple of years ago when it acquired some of these businesses. For example, it bought sewer-products supplier National Waterworks Holdings Inc. from Thomas H. Lee Partners in 2005 for $1.35 billion, or 11.4 times Ebitda. \u001d  \"Still, I think the rationale for selling it is valid,\" Mr. McGranahan said. \"The company has a lot to do to integrate the division into the company. And it has a lot to do in its retail division. I guess the sin of being distracted from what needs to be done in retail is greater than the sin of buying high and selling low.\" \u001d  Asked why the company decided to sell now, Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said: \"We looked at all alternatives and this was the best way to create value for shareholders. The purchase price is a lot more than we have invested in businesses, which is about $8.5 billion. This is cementing our focus on retail. We are excited.\" \u001d  Steve Zide, managing director of Bain Capital, said that Joe D'Angelo, who ran HD Supply, will stay on. He added that Mr. D'Angelo could drive better execution, growth and profitability now that it won't be part of Home Depot, which is first and foremost a retailer. \u001d  \"We will help to drive integration, operating improvement, whether its through sourcing opportunities or investing in logistics,\" added Dave Novak, partner at Clayton Dubilier. \u001d  The price is about what analysts had expected in late spring as the housing market remained depressed. But earlier in the year, when CEO Frank Blake, who succeeded Mr. Nardelli, first announced the company was considering strategic alternatives for the business, estimates were as high as $13 billion. \u001d  Initially, Mr. Nardelli saw the supply business as a defensive counter to dips in the cyclical housing market, but in fact the supply division sold to home builders as well. Shareholders began to see it as a distraction, gobbling up funds needed to improve staffing, renovations and computer systems at its stores. In recent years, Home Depot's sales at stores open at least a year trailed those at its smaller, but faster-growing competitor Lowe's Cos., although that gap has narrowed in recent months. \u001d  --- \u001d  Mary Ellen Lloyd contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 22:46 ET (02:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bb30353d486f36ef1ddca99192e733ec","symR":["YHOO","US9843321061"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(6/20) Can 'Chief Yahoo' Rise To Challenges As Chief?","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T03:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["YHOO","US9843321061"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Kevin J. Delaney and Joann S. Lublin \u001d  Jerry Yang is back at the helm of the company he co-founded in 1995. But can he manage the Yahoo Inc. of 2007? \u001d  The surprise announcement Monday that Mr. Yang had succeeded Terry Semel as the Internet giant's chief executive has many investors and analysts wondering whether he has the skills to lead a company that now brings in more than $6 billion in revenue and has nearly 12,000 employees -- and whether he is ready to make the big changes that may be required for Yahoo's recovery. \u001d  Mr. Yang, 38 years old, is one of a string of high-profile founders to take on the CEO job years after creating their companies. The group also includes Apple Inc.'s Steve Jobs and Dell Inc.'s Michael Dell. But those men had previously served as permanent CEOs. \u001d  Mr. Yang helped to start the service that became Yahoo while an engineering graduate student at Stanford University, and he even held the CEO post for a few weeks. But he, his co-founder and their chief investor wanted a seasoned executive to run the company, so he handed it off and assumed the unconventional title of Chief Yahoo. \u001d  Several people close to the company say Mr. Yang's level of involvement at Yahoo has fluctuated over the years. But some of them argue that he has always been at the core of the group defining Yahoo's strategy and that he jumped in to troubleshoot key operational issues and amassed a strong track record of attracting and retaining talent. Such skills will be in high demand as Yahoo grapples with high-profile staff departures, challenges in its core online advertising business and pressing questions about its ability to capitalize on Internet hot spots such as video and social networking. \u001d  Some people close to the matter say that Yahoo's directors intend to search for a new CEO eventually and that Susan Decker, a key executive who was named president as part of this week's shuffling, will be a top candidate for the post. But Mr. Yang, whose fortune is estimated at more than $2 billion, denied Monday that he was serving in an interim role and -- amid speculation that Yahoo could merge with the Internet activities of another company -- said Yahoo will have a vibrant future as an independent company. \u001d  Last summer, Yahoo board members decided that Mr. Yang would succeed Mr. Semel on a temporary basis if the CEO died suddenly, according to one acquaintance close to Mr. Yang. Another person familiar with the matter says that several directors agreed late last week that Mr. Semel needed to move on, especially given that the weakness in Yahoo's traditional display-ad business meant the company could come in toward the low end of its revenue projections for the rest of the year. \u001d  Mr. Semel has denied that the board pushed him to resign and says that discussions leading up to his formal resignation announcement to the board Sunday had been under way for a while. He now serves as nonexecutive chairman. \u001d  In any case, the CEO job may be Mr. Yang's to keep. If he proves a great chief executive, \"he will be CEO for a long time,\" the longtime acquaintance says. \u001d  A Yahoo spokeswoman said Mr. Yang wasn't available to comment for this article. But she added that Mr. Yang has \"been in an executive leadership role at Yahoo since day one. It's not like a leadership role is new for him.\" \u001d  Mr. Yang emigrated to San Jose, Calif., from Taiwan when he was 10 with his mother, a widowed English and drama professor, and his younger brother. In 1994, he and David Filo, a fellow Stanford engineering graduate student, created a directory of Web sites they liked. The service soon exploded in popularity, going public in 1996 and making its co-founders icons of the modern Internet age. \u001d  Mr. Yang's role as Chief Yahoo wasn't always well understood. But as a director and member of the executive committee, he helped to shape strategy and assumed responsibility for key projects, according to people close to Yahoo. \u001d  In the late 1990s, when Yahoo was lagging in e-commerce, Mr. Yang immersed himself in developing products and business deals to boost that area. In 2001, when Yahoo's top management and directors moved to develop their own Web search expertise and reduce their dependence on technology from rival Google Inc., they had Mr. Yang get that effort off the ground. Mr. Yang was also instrumental in recruiting Mr. Semel in 2001 and has spent years helping to build Yahoo's international business. \u001d  While Mr. Yang wasn't a permanent CEO, \"he's been half in that chair almost from the day I met him -- and now he just gets the full seat,\" says Jeff Mallett, who was at Yahoo from 1995 to 2002, including as president and chief operating officer, and is now chairman of online music start-up Snocap Inc. \u001d  Mr. Yang developed a reputation for taking contrarian positions on issues, helping him earn the nickname Grumpy. Managers also came to Mr. Yang for support for unconventional initiatives and benefited from a discretionary Yahoo budget he controlled known as \"The Jerry Fund.\" Yahoo's technology incubation group in San Francisco, known as the Brick House, and a similar group focused on Web design innovation grew in part because of such support, a person close to the company says. \u001d  Over the years, Mr. Yang won the loyalty of many employees. He and Mr. Filo, now Yahoo's interim chief technology officer, have donned big sumo costumes to wrestle before employees on a central lawn at Yahoo headquarters. He's also an avid golfer known to pace during meetings with a putter in his hands. In February 2005, Mr. Yang scored a hole in one on the fifth hole of the famed Pebble Beach course. \u001d  Still, some staffers have wondered at times whether Mr. Yang's attention was more on his golf game than the company. In recent years, Google has pulled ahead in search and online advertising as Yahoo has struggled with its own delayed ad-system upgrade, amid fretting by some senior executives that Yahoo had lost focus. \u001d  \"The internal perception of Jerry is that he's laid back and not that involved in the day-to-day operation of the business,\" says a person close to the company. \"He still seems a little bit of a gentleman founder.\" Mr. Yang's \"tremendous passion and work ethic has continued throughout his 12 years here,\" counters the Yahoo spokeswoman. Another person close to the company questions how prepared Mr. Yang will be to make the tough decisions required to right Yahoo since he has helped shape its current strategy. \u001d  In a Web post on Yahoo's site titled \"My new job,\" Mr. Yang said he and Ms. Decker share a vision of a Yahoo \"that executes with speed, clarity and discipline.\" Other elements of the vision he cited included differentiating products, investing in innovation and better generating revenue from Yahoo's big base of users. \u001d  Some management experts and people close to the company say that an effective partnership between Mr. Yang and Ms. Decker, 44, will be crucial to his success. Ms. Decker, the company's former chief financial officer and the head of a key operating group, has a strong reputation among investors and company executives and has been considered an heir apparent to Mr. Semel. Outside of Yahoo, she sits on the boards of Intel Corp., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. \u001d  Mr. Yang \"really needs to make this relationship with [Ms.] Decker operate successfully,\" says Gary E. Hayes, a managing partner at Hayes Brunswick & Partners, an organizational and management development consultancy in New York. \u001d  But management experts say fixing Yahoo could prove a lot tougher for Mr. Yang than launching the enterprise. To regain the company's competitive edge, he must hit the ground running -- without relying too much on Mr. Semel. \u001d  \"Jerry won't be able to do much unless he can bring back that entrepreneurial spirit,\" says John Sullivan, a management professor at San Francisco State University's business school.

Penney Co., Target Corp. and Kohl's Corp. have discovered that fashionable underwear for women is a hot trend. To cash in on it, they are launching lingerie lines or giving old ones a makeover or redecorating dressing rooms and offering professional fitting services. Other companies, including Chico's FAS Inc., American Eagle Outfitters Inc. and Charming Shoppes Inc.'s Lane Bryant, have created stand-alone lingerie stores. \u001d  The retailers are hoping to steal some thunder from the Limited Brands Inc.'s Victoria's Secret chain, which has dominated fashion lingerie in the U.S. for many years. \u001d  \"Lingerie is second to handbags as the fastest-growing apparel category, so everyone in retail is trying to capitalize on that growth,\" says Marshal Cohen, chief research analyst with NPD Group, a market-research firm based in Port Washington, N.Y. \u001d  U.S. retail sales of intimate apparel last year rose 10% to reach $10.5 billion, more than double the growth rate in 2005, according to NPD. Driving that growth are new technologies and fabrics that allow for such innovations as laser-cut seamless bras and the growing fashion appeal of lingerie, particularly among young women. \u001d  Many younger women today have no compunction about \"wearing inner-wear as outerwear,\" NPD's Mr. Cohen notes, for instance allowing colorful bra straps to show without embarrassment. That creates a market for lingerie to change with the seasons instead of just being bought as \"replenishment,\" he says. \u001d  The intimate-apparel category is appealing to retailers because it has higher profit margins than regular apparel, drives store traffic and boosts customer loyalty. \"If you solve a woman's bra needs, you have a customer for life,\" says Adrianne Shapira, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. \u001d  Victoria's Secret largely created the market for fashionable lingerie in the U.S., emulating the lingerie market in Europe. In 1982, the Columbus, Ohio, Limited bought a handful of Victoria's Secret stores and a catalog, at a time when most women in the U.S. owned a few sets of underwear, in beige, black and white. Chief Executive Les Wexner envisioned women buying underwear more like they purchased clothing, buying more frequently and choosing among a range of colors and styles. He improved the quality of Victoria's Secret and toned down racy styles so that they would appeal to mainstream shoppers. \u001d  For much of the last 20 years, Victoria's Secret had the market for fashionable lingerie to itself. Brands sold in department stores, such as Maidenform, Vanity Fair and Bali, have typically appealed to different shoppers, loyal consumers with more conservative tastes, says Monica Tang, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon Associates. \"The younger, more fickle customer has been lured away by Victoria's Secret, whose pieces have a fashion component,\" she says. \u001d  But in the fiscal first quarter ended May 5, Limited reported its overall net income fell 47%, hurt by profit-eroding markdowns, and said it expects continued weak sales in its Victoria's Secret division. Net sales at the lingerie unit rose 14.8%, while same-store sales -- a closely watched measure of revenue from stores open at least a year -- increased 2%. \u001d  The problems at Victoria's Secret stem in part from recent product launches that didn't make as much of a splash as last year's Secret Embrace, a bra fashioned from a single piece of material that has no seams, stitches or labels. Its teen line Pink is battling American Eagle's aerie launched last August. American Eagle has tested three stand-alone stores and the results were so good, a spokesman says, that it plans 40 new stores this year. Aerie will roll out 10 different lingerie collections throughout the year. \u001d  Limited spokesman Tom Katzenmeyer says the recent sales weakness is \"largely self-inflicted.\" During the spring season, customers wanted a greater proportion of colorful styles than they had in past years, and Victoria's Secret didn't have the right inventory, he says. In addition, weak mall traffic has hurt the brand, he says. \u001d  All the new competition certainly isn't helping. In February, J.C. Penney launched its Ambrielle lingerie collection with a series of smoldering ads during the Academy Awards. The company predicts it could become one of the store's private-label \"power brands.\" Sharen Turney, chief executive of the Victoria's Secret brand, said in a recent conference call with analysts that Victoria's Secret was \"quite aware\" of the competition. She said Penney used the consultant Interbrand, a company Limited uses for its beauty business, in an effort to emulate Victoria's Secret. \u001d  Penney acknowledges it hired the consultant but \"we only used them for conceptualizing the brand,\" says Laurie Van Brunt, Penney's vice president and director of brand management. \"Our positioning is totally different from [Victoria's Secret],\" she says. \"You can't look at anything that they do and say that's not sexy. But Ambrielle is more about sensual indulgence,\" which Penney defines as a feminine look that's not overtly revealing. \u001d  Penney and Bloomingdale's are among stores that have upgraded their fitting rooms with an intimate boudoir feel, in some cases outfitted with call buttons to summon a saleswoman. In the past year, Bloomingdale's, owned by Macy's Inc., has begun putting a focus on more exclusive, trendy lingerie brands such as Myla, La Perla and Leigh Bantivoglio. \u001d  Macy's stores, too, are getting in on the game -- 18 months ago, they launched Jenni, a private brand of colorful panties and bras aimed at the \"younger customer with a high fashion IQ,\" said Muriel Gonzalez, senior vice president of the merchandising group that oversees intimate apparel. It is also gradually introducing \"panty bars\" -- long tables to display underwear -- in its intimate-apparel sections nationwide. \u001d  Kohl's recently announced it is launching three new lingerie lines this year: Moments, its first private-label line, plus collections by Daisy Fuentes and Vera Wang. The Daisy Fuentes line will feature colorful separates designed to appeal to 25- to 40-year-olds; Moments, a more basic look, will be aimed at women 25 to 54; and the Vera Wang collection is intended for fashion-forward customers. \u001d  Target has also made changes, redesigning and expanding its private-label Gilligan & O'Malley line, offering seamless bras and sorbet-colored matching lace bra and panty sets displayed as ensembles. However, lingerie was among its weakest sellers last year, according to the company's monthly sales reports. Target has since tweaked the lines, bringing down prices from a high of $21.99 to a range of $7.99 to $16.99, focusing more on cotton and comfort and grouping products by category again. \u001d  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. began upgrading its private label Secret Treasures and plus-size Just My Size lingerie a few years ago, plus carrying a fuller range of styles like thongs, in addition to basic brands like Hanes and others. \u001d  But adding snazzier designs and creating private-label lines is not without its risks, notes Kelly Tackett, senior consultant at TNS Retail Forward, a Columbus-based retail consulting firm. Selling bras, in particular, is a difficult business, because there so many sizes and retailers must carry a large inventory. \"If you don't do it right, you're stuck with a lot of excessive merchandise that you have to mark down,\" she says. \u001d  Other retailers have tried to dislodge Victoria's Secret from its perch. In 1998, Gap Inc. launched GapBody, which sells women's underwear and sleepwear and portrays a more wholesome image than Victoria's Secret. Gap has said recently that it's pleased with the performance of its lingerie business. However, Gap doesn't give many financial details about GapBody and the Gap brand's total sales last year in its U.S. and Canadian stores, as well as online, were $5.13 billion, demonstrating that the GapBody division's sales don't come close to Victoria's Secret's 2006 sales of $5.14 billion, a 15.5% increase over the previous year. \u001d  Victoria's Secret is fighting back. It is expanding many of its store locations by 50%, and it is testing new categories in its stores such as swimwear, accessories and workout clothing. It also is testing stand-alone stores for its Pink brand, which is expected to reach $900 million in revenue this year and targets teenagers and college students. The company plans to expand the Pink assortment this fall, add new beauty products and launch its Intimissimi line in more Victoria's Secret stores. The company also plans to expand Victoria's Secret to other countries by relying on the global expertise of the Canadian brand La Senza, which it acquired in January. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 23:10 ET (03:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ccf390abf9347d739b8f6f8f1a8c9d8a","symR":["VRSO"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder TILLEM Registers 50,769 Of VERSO TECHNOLOGIES INC >VRSO","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T02:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VRSO"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: VERSO TECHNOLOGIES INC \bSYMBOL: VRSO \b \b \bFILER: TILLEM JEROME \bTITLE: Shareholder \bBROKER: UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 50,769         DATE REGISTERED: 6/14/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: N/A \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

Now the architect of that push and a senior member of the company's founding family are both urging a new strategy for the U.S. -- hit the brakes. \u001d  Top Toyota executives are concerned that the car maker may have built too many U.S. factories, in part to build political support by providing new jobs in lots of places. And although Toyota's U.S. sales continue to grow, these executives worry about an uncertain outlook. \u001d  At the same time, a cheap yen is making it advantageous for Toyota to increase manufacturing capacity and export cars from Japan. \"It's much, much more profitable to produce cars in Japan and ship them all to the U.S. right now, if it wasn't for the political problems that might cause,\" says a senior executive and management-board member. Toyota has increased shipments to the U.S. of Japanese-made vehicles from 762,000 in 2004 to 1.27 million last year. \u001d  Toyota's planned slowdown in U.S. factory building, and a parallel effort to rein in rising labor costs, suggests a rare misstep for the Japanese giant. Over the past decade, it gobbled up market share by anticipating the appetites of U.S. car buyers better than its Detroit competitors, rattling the beleaguered American industry and supplanting General Motors Corp. as the world's No. 1 auto maker. Now, Toyota's far-flung U.S. plants have created logistical tangles that have raised the cost of doing business. The reaction inside Toyota's executive offices -- ignited by the oracular input of two elder corporate statesmen -- shows the company scrambling to keep its lead in a tough U.S. car market. \u001d  For Toyota, building factories in the U.S. has served as a way to win goodwill in the face of public rancor over the role played by foreign auto makers in the decline of the American auto industry. In Japan, most of Toyota's factories are clustered in a single place, Toyota City. In the U.S., over the past decade, Toyota has spread factories from Fremont, Calif., to Georgetown, Ky. For states whose efforts to attract one have thus far fallen short -- including Michigan -- Toyota's strategic shift means that new factories aren't likely any time soon. \u001d  In the automobile industry, having too much manufacturing capacity is bad business. Last year, Toyota began producing its redesigned Tundra pickup truck at a new factory in San Antonio, its second plant dedicated to that model. Then rising fuel prices took a bite out of large pickup sales, leaving Toyota with a problem it has rarely experienced during 30 years of U.S. growth: excess capacity. \u001d  Toyota can now make more than 100,000 more Tundras each year than it expects to sell. The sluggish demand and competition from Detroit have forced Toyota to offer unusually large discounts on Tundras, including zero interest financing for five years -- a tactic borrowed from GM. \u001d  \"It's time for us to strengthen the fundamentals in all areas\" in the U.S., says Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe. He cites problems including rising manufacturing costs, excess capacity at some plants and quality problems. \u001d  In 2005, Toyota recalled 2.38 million vehicles in the U.S., slightly more than it sold that year. To improve engineering and design, Mr. Watanabe has said, Toyota will delay introducing some models by as much as six months and will eliminate others. \u001d  Despite the problems, the U.S. is likely to remain one of Toyota's most profitable markets. A recent shift by U.S. consumers back to more fuel-efficient cars has helped increase Toyota's U.S. sales even as Detroit's auto makers struggle. Toyota has increased U.S. market share over the past decade with a string of popular vehicles ranging from the Camry, the nation's best-selling sedan, to the Prius, a fuel-efficient gasoline-electric hybrid. The company became known for its dedication to quality, its efficient manufacturing, and for keeping costs lower than Detroit's Big Three. \u001d  But the plant-construction slowdown -- coupled with Mr. Watanabe's decision to reduce the pace of product launches -- means Toyota's revenue and profit growth could slow. It could also jeopardize Toyota's effort to increase its operating margin to 10% or above and to sustain it there. \u001d  Toyota's rethinking of plant construction began with a flurry of questions about its plans for an assembly plant on the outskirts of Tupelo, a northeastern Mississippi town near the birthplace of Elvis Presley. The Tupelo plant, scheduled to start production in 2010, will be Toyota's eighth North American vehicle-assembly plant and the fourth new one it has authorized in the past five years. \u001d  Criticism came from two of the company's most respected statesmen: Former Toyota Chairman Hiroshi Okuda and Honorary Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda, a key member of the company's founding family. Mr. Toyoda was the company's president from 1981 to 1992; Mr. Okuda, from 1995 to 1999. Both are members of Toyota's board of directors. Although they have no executive roles, both still attend meetings of top executives and exert strong influence over management strategy, particularly Mr. Okuda. As Toyota's chief executive during the mid-1990s, Mr. Okuda was the chief architect of the auto maker's aggressive expansion outside of Japan. \u001d  In a series of high-level meetings last fall, Mr. Okuda, with Mr. Toyoda's support, began questioning management's rush to further expand its North American manufacturing capacity, according to several senior executives and board members. \u001d  At that point, the company had already been assessing new sites for months, stirring government officials in at least a dozen states. Its goal was to expand manufacturing capacity for its popular Highlander wagon, essentially a sport-utility vehicle built on the chassis of a midsize sedan. \u001d  Toyota executives such as Dennis Cuneo, then a senior executive of Toyota North America, began showing up in Southern towns like Tupelo, whose furniture industry had been hit hard by globalization. By September 2006, Toyota had a shortlist of sites including Tupelo; Marion, Ark.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; and towns in Georgia, Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina. \u001d  In Tupelo, teams of Toyota employees began collecting information about land ownership, labor availability, and local cultural attitudes toward the Japanese, among other things, says Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour. State and local officials were on standby to answer questions from Toyota. \"If an ox fell into a ditch, we got the ox out of the ditch within 24 hours,\" the governor says. \u001d  At one point, Toyota said that no homes could stand within about 5,000 feet of the plant's paint shop, so that residents wouldn't be endangered by chemicals in the event of an accident. The Tupelo site had more than 10 homes within that radius, most of them mobile homes. Within 36 hours, Gov. Barbour says, the state had an option to purchase every home and plans to relocate occupants. \u001d  But early last fall, at a meeting of Toyota's top executives on the 14th floor of Toyota's global headquarters building in Toyota City, Mr. Okuda began asking questions. With Mr. Toyoda's support, he questioned whether top executives were becoming \"a bit complacent\" with manufacturing-capacity expansion, recalls one senior executive, and whether they viewed the rapid plant building in the U.S. as a given, according to several senior executives who attended. \u001d  There were signs that sales weren't keeping pace with the increases in U.S. production capacity. In addition, it was becoming more expensive to build cars in the U.S. because the costs of materials and labor were rising, according to the executives. Messrs. Okuda and Toyoda \"were concerned we were becoming too happy-go-lucky, and that we were rushing to build plants, with investments becoming too lavish,\" according to the senior executive. \u001d  Mr. Okuda, who the company said was unavailable to be interviewed, wanted to know whether each project was really \"given a thorough review\" with a long time horizon in mind, according to the senior executive. Mr. Okuda asked if it was wise to keep adding plants rather than tackling pressing issues such as quality problems. \u001d  Toyota's decisions to add plants in the U.S. have always involved more than maximizing manufacturing efficiencies. The company has long been concerned about a resurgence of trade tensions. That could lead to protectionist measures such as import quotas, which limited U.S. sales of Japanese vehicles between 1981 and 1994. \u001d  Toyota has pledged to produce in North America at least two-thirds of the vehicles it sells in the region. It regards building more vehicles in the U.S. as a form of political insurance. By sprinkling manufacturing jobs across many states, Toyota built a network of state and federal politicians friendly toward the company. Toyota operates vehicle, engine and parts factories in eight states -- California, Kentucky, Texas, Alabama, West Virginia, Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee. \u001d  Although Toyota enjoys a significant cost advantage over Detroit's unionized factories, spreading out its operations raised the cost of doing business. Messrs. Okuda and Toyoda raised several specific concerns. \u001d  Toyota's most efficient plants around the world operate more than one assembly line each. Between 2002 and earlier this year, Toyota announced four new vehicle-assembly sites -- Tijuana, Mexico; San Antonio; Woodstock, Ontario; and Tupelo. Not one of the four has plans for a second assembly line. Only Tijuana and San Antonio are currently up and running. \u001d  In Japan, some of Toyota's plants are capable of building more than a half-dozen different vehicles. In North America, several of them build just one or two models. That lack of flexibility makes it more difficult for the company to adjust to sudden swings in demand. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 23:03 ET (03:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d17250799e19d9d74d68bfb8f6602b8b","symR":["BBY","CC","DJDAY","TWTR","US0865161014"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(6/20)Heard On The St:Best Buy May Be Running Out Of Juice","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T03:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BBY","CC","DJDAY","TWTR","US0865161014"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Kris Hudson \u001d  Investors appear ready to pull the plug on Best Buy Co. \u001d  The electronics retailer's stock was sent tumbling $2.83 a share, or 5.9%, to $45.18 yesterday in 4 p.m. composite New York Stock Exchange trading following its quarterly earnings miss and reduced earnings forecast for the year. \u001d  While bulls think the stock can hold its ground for the next quarter or two amid an industry shakeout, bears counter that Best Buy's strategy of rapidly gaining share in a cutthroat electronics-retailing industry might not be worth the cost. \u001d  Best Buy's problem is the same one facing many large retailers these days, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. In the go-go 1990s, retailers boosted both revenue and profit by building new stores as quickly as possible. Now, as margins decline and national retailers increasingly have fewer new U.S. markets left to conquer, Wall Street is calling on them to rein in growth and return more money to shareholders through stock buybacks and fatter dividends. So far, Best Buy, widely regarded as the best consumer-electronics retailer, has resisted that pressure. \u001d  Investors have cause to be spooked by the electronics-retailing industry. Circuit City Stores Inc. has shuffled its management ranks and laid off workers. Tweeter Home Entertainment Group Inc. filed for bankruptcy-law protection this month. CompUSA Inc. closed more than half of its stores this year. \u001d  \"Our concerns have been around the competitive dynamics of the consumer-electronics industry,\" said Loomis Sayles & Co. analyst Eric Meyers, whose firm held 1.7 million Best Buy shares at the end of March after selling nearly 800,000 in the first quarter. \"The greatest growth of the TV cycle is behind us. The attempt to differentiate yourself with services, which is partially what Best Buy is doing, is challenging. We have reservations about the ultimate earnings power of the company going forward.\" \u001d  Hobbled by declining profit margins, Best Buy yesterday posted net income of $192 million, or 39 cents a share, for its fiscal first quarter ended June 2. The result fell well below the 50 cents a share forecast by Wall Street analysts. What's more, Best Buy reined in its annual profit projection to $2.95 to $3.15 a share from an earlier range of $3.10 to $3.25. Best Buy, of Richfield, Minn., maintained its revenue forecast for the year of roughly $39 billion. \u001d  Best Buy's stock has fallen about 15% in the past 12 months, and its price/earnings ratio sits at 14.8 times per-share earnings. \u001d  In contrast, the stock of rival Circuit City has plummeted 43% in the past 12 months. Yet Circuit City has a lofty 31.5 P/E ratio, partly because its projected earnings are smaller and more difficult to predict. The Richmond, Va., retailer withdrew its earnings guidance for the year in April, so its multiple is based on analysts' consensus forecast that it will earn 51 cents a share this year. Circuit City, which is scheduled to report its first-quarter results today, already has signaled a loss from continuing operations of $80 million to $90 million. \u001d  Best Buy executives pinned most of the blame for the first-quarter earnings shortfall on surging sales of low-margin merchandise such as laptop computers and videogame consoles, as well as a steep decline in the prices of flat-panel televisions from year-ago levels. Indeed, Best Buy's gross margin shrank by 1.5 percentage points to 23.9% of sales last quarter. It has been trending down for two years. \u001d  Brad Anderson, Best Buy's vice chairman and chief executive, urged investors not to jump to conclusions. \"If you look over the course of the past 10 years, we've had pretty consistent earnings results,\" he said. \"We think . . . it's a pretty good industry. But it is not a stable industry.\" \u001d  Amid the margin squeeze, particularly in its Chinese operations, Best Buy didn't waver from its plans for aggressive growth. The retailer opened 34 stores last quarter and reiterated its plans to open a total of 135 globally this year while spending as much as $850 million in capital. It didn't cut back operating expenses, keeping them at the same 20.5% of sales as a year ago. While Best Buy ramped up its share buybacks to $412 million last quarter, it fell short of the aggressive multibillion-dollar outlay some investors hope to see this year. Finally, executives reiterated that Best Buy will continue to seek acquisitions. \u001d  \"We are confident in our strategy and plan to stay the course of investing for the future,\" Chief Financial Officer Darren Jackson told analysts on a conference call yesterday. \u001d  Gary Balter, an analyst with Credit Suisse Securities, speculated that Best Buy could have softened the blow last quarter by easing off the accelerator, but it instead chose to forge ahead in search of a future payoff. \u001d  \"They've chosen not to restrict near-term investments, which would hurt them in the battle for market share, just to please Wall Street,\" says Mr. Balter, who has the equivalent of a \"buy\" rating on Best Buy's stock and a 12-month price target of $59. \"You're going to have a group of investors that appreciate that, and you'll have investors that are more short-term in nature.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 23:00 ET (03:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d426f8bd21b8ec76854447429a7b46b1","symR":["CVX","US1667641005"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Chevron May Boost Thai Invest If Concessions Extended -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T02:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CVX","US1667641005"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BANGKOK (Dow Jones)--U.S.-based Chevron Corp.

(MSFT) has agreed to make its Windows Vista operating system more compatible with alternative desktop search programs in response to a complaint by Google Inc. (GOOG). \u001d  In April, Google alleged that Vista hindered other desktop search applications in violation of a landmark 2002 antitrust settlement, under which Microsoft ensured that its operating system wouldn't disadvantage the functioning of applications produced by competitors. Tuesday's agreement comes in advance of a regularly scheduled court hearing next week to review Microsoft's compliance with the 2002 settlement. \u001d  \"Through a constructive and ongoing dialogue, the Department of Justice, the state attorneys-general, and the District of Columbia continue to ensure that Microsoft complies with all of its obligations under the final judgments,\" Thomas O. Barnett, assistant attorney-general in charge of the DOJ's anti-trust division, said in a statement late Tuesday. \u001d  Microsoft said that a scheduled update to Vista due later this year now will include changes allowing computer manufacturers and consumers to select a default desktop search program similar to the way they select defaults for third-party web browsers and media players. Also, Microsoft will provide information to developers of third-party desktop search programs about how they can optimize their programs to minimize any performance problems. \u001d  \"We're pleased we were able to reach an agreement with all the States and the Justice Department that addresses their concerns so that everyone can move forward,\" Microsoft said in a prepared statement late Tuesday. \u001d  For smaller technology players, the changes should reduce the barriers between them and consumers, according to Dennis A. Miller, general partner with Spark Capital, a venture fund in Boston. \u001d  \"This is a small victory for innovation. So much search begins on the desktop. If consumers can avoid having to click through the Microsoft plumbing to get where they want to get to, the more likely that will free up other players to capture some market share,\" said Miller. \u001d  The startup Me.dium Inc., which has created an application enabling users to see what others are doing online, is one company in Spark Capital's portfolio that might benefit from the agreement, he said. \u001d  Tuesday's filing by the DOJ is part of its quarterly update to the courts on Microsoft's compliance with the 2002 anti-trust agreement. The matter will come before a court in Washington, D.C. next week, where a judge will determine if the agreement reached between the DOJ and Microsoft is acceptable. \u001d  Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who agreed with Google's complaint, said that the court should hear from Google as to whether its concerns are addressed by the changes. \u001d  -By Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6637; corey.boles@dowjones.com \u001d  -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 415-765-6118; mark.golden@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 23:29 ET (03:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d89a2938f368682d035ab0487e4a2be7","symR":["CBEY"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP ROBINSON Registers 1,615 Of CBEYOND INC >CBEY","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T02:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBEY"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: CBEYOND INC \bSYMBOL: CBEY \b \b \bFILER: ROBINSON BROOKS A \bTITLE: Vice President \bBROKER: DEUTSCHE BANK ALEX BROWN \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 1,615          DATE REGISTERED: 6/14/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: 6/13/2007 \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

I can't begin to say whether they will lead to something acceptable or not,\" Levin said. \u001d  Supporters of the Senate bill said more efficient vehicles could help reduce the nation's dependence upon imported oil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \u001d  The current bill would require the fleetwide average to meet 35 miles per gallon for passenger cars, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans by 2020, an increase of about 10 mpg from current levels. Under the plan, automakers would need to boost fuel economy by 4% per year from 2020 to 2030. \u001d  The industry has coalesced around an alternative offered by a group of lawmakers led by Levin and Stabenow. It would require carmakers to meet a fleetwide average of at least 36 mpg for cars by 2022 and 30 mpg for pickups, SUVs and vans by 2025. \u001d  The approach, backed by Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., would boost flexible-fuel vehicles running on ethanol blends. \u001d  Automakers said the current Senate plan would cost them billions of dollars and require them to shed jobs at a time when domestic companies are already hurting. \u001d  But backers of the plan, which received broad support in committee, said the industry has lost credibility in Congress because it has used similar tactics to oppose fuel economy increases in the past. \u001d  Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the Senate's No. 2 Democratic leader, said the industry's approach was \"strangely reminiscent of the same arguments they used in 1975\" when the rules were first approved. \u001d  \"I wish that my friends in Detroit would spend a little more time with their engineering department and a little less time with their legal department when it comes to these issues,\" Durbin said. \u001d  The vote was expected to be close, and several senators said they were undecided on the competing plans. \u001d  Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., said he had opposed increasing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, but \"like a lot of my colleagues, I realize this has to be done.\" \u001d  \"I'm glad that we're going to raise CAFE standards - now the only issue is how much and how soon,\" Coleman said. \u001d  Sen. David Vitter, R-La., said he had met with auto officials and found some of their arguments persuasive - but he remained undecided. \u001d  \"I think we need to do something that doesn't penalize companies that have already made major improvements,\" Vitter said. \u001d  Dozens of auto dealers from around the country met with their home state senators about the plan while Detroit's companies sent top executives to make personal appeals. Automakers were targeting undecided senators and those who represent mostly rural states with a large percentage of pickup truck owners. \u001d  The industry opposes combining the standards for passenger cars and light trucks, saying it would strain their ability to offer a variety of large vehicles. \u001d  \"You can't provide towing capability and off-road capability and people-hauling capability off a tiny vehicle built off a car chassis,\" General Motors Corp.'s (GM) Mark LaNeve said before a meeting with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u001d  Mark Fields, Ford Motor Co.'s (F) president of the Americas, and Tom Lasorda, DaimlerChrysler AG's (DCX) Chrysler Group president, also met with lawmakers. \u001d  Vehicle fuel efficiency has remained stagnant for the past two decades, and Congress has not upgraded the standards since the mid-1970s. The fleet of passenger cars is required to get an average of 27.5 mpg, while SUVs, pickup trucks and vans must get an average of 22.2 mpg. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 23:08 ET (03:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d95e990ad5f6a41ec11a9ed9f8173df2","symR":["GYI"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(6/20) Getty Is Primed To Acquire Pump","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T03:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GYI"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Ethan Smith \u001d  Seattle rock trio the Presidents of the United States of America haven't had a hit since their novelty song \"Peaches\" reached the top 40 in 1996 with the infectiously silly refrain \"millions of peaches, peaches for me.\" \u001d  These days, singer and band leader Chris Ballew is still earning money from songs he writes and records -- hundreds of them -- thanks to a relationship with Pump Audio Inc., a six-year-old start-up whose business model is nearly as novel as Ballew's old hit single. \u001d  Pump maintains a catalog of over 100,000 songs, all of them by musicians who aren't signed to traditional publishing or recording deals, and licenses them for flat fees for use in films, TV shows, Web presentations and various kinds of ads. Pump says it generated 80,000 placements of music in television alone last year, and boasts of clients from MTV to NBC to the BBC to Nike to Mercedes-Benz. \u001d  That got the attention of suitors: Today, Getty Images Inc. plans to announce that it is acquiring Pump Audio for $42 million. For Getty, the world's largest creator and purveyor of still and moving images, buying Pump represents the latest step to expand beyond its core business. \u001d  A key to Pump's business is the way it lets clients search its database. The service offers a menu of simple search criteria, such as whether the song has lyrics or not, the kind of instruments used, as well as its genre, tempo and mood. \u001d  \"It opens up the production community to people who play the ukulele,\" says Pump Chief Executive Steve Ellis. \"Which the major labels don't offer.\" \u001d  For instance, a search for an uptempo, instrumental-only, alternative-country song with a \"Quirky/Wacky/Silly\" mood turns up a zany 78-second ditty called \"Tip e Toe III.\" (The service's Web site doesn't currently identify the performer.) \u001d  Rates range from $25 for use in a podcast to hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a theatrically distributed film or network television show. \u001d  Pump splits the licensing fees evenly with its artists. Mr. Ballew's arrangement with Pump earns him anywhere from $8,000 to $40,000 every six months, representing about 25% of his income. It's a far cry from the world of pop radio and sold-out tours. The songs Mr. Ballew writes for Pump are often much shorter than traditional pop songs, and have goofy names like \"You Broke My Monkey\" and \"Pink Passenger.\" \u001d  \"A lot of my early uses were in pornography,\" Mr. Ballew says with a chuckle. \u001d  Notwithstanding the racier uses to which Mr. Ballew's music has been put, Pump's biggest client is Viacom Inc.'s MTV Networks, with other reality-TV and documentary producers such as the Food Network and the Discovery Channel also heavy users. \u001d  \"The average TV episode is using 20, 30 or even 40 pieces of music in a half-hour,\" Pump's Mr. Ellis says. Music that has been released by major labels generally requires at least two sets of permissions, each of which must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Pump argues that its product allows users to move much more quickly and cheaply than they can going after bigger-name acts. \u001d  The deal announced today could significantly expand the reach -- and therefore the earning potential -- of Mr. Ballew and the thousands of other musicians Pump represents. Where Pump has about 30 full-time employees at its Tivoli, N.Y., headquarters, Getty has 650 sales representatives throughout the world and maintains close relationships with big ad agencies. Getty believes that the larger distribution network will help improve Pump's \"modest\" revenues. A person familiar with the company says its 2006 revenue was less than $10 million. \u001d  Getty Chief Executive Jonathan Klein says he considers the music-licensing business ripe for the kind of streamlining his company accomplished when it started in 1995. \"When we entered the photo industry, it was very similar to the music industry,\" he says. \"It was tedious to get hold of a photo; it took a long time; choice was limited.\" \u001d  Getty offered clients access to fully cleared images for a flat fee, much as Pump has with music. Getty has another incentive to expand into audio. Demand and prices for high-quality images costing more than $500 each, which accounted for about 40% of its revenue last year, have been dropping. Getty recently spent $200 million on the parent of WireImage, the online photo agency that specializes in material like red-carpet photos of celebrities. Mr. Klein says \"the high-end imagery business is not going away,\" although he acknowledges that Getty has recently \"reached lower down in the market in terms of price points.\" \u001d  Mr. Klein says is still deciding whether to call his new acquisition Pump Audio by Getty Images or Getty Audio. \u001d  Pump doesn't retain exclusive rights to the music in its catalog; artists are free to pursue traditional record deals, and in theory they would be free to release their music commercially through such a deal.

In March, it said it would raise more than EUR1 billion from European institutions, pitching itself against global investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and UBS as well as Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd. \u001d  CBA's Colonial First State Global Asset Management division, which was part of a consortium that last year bought U.K. water company AWG plc, said Wednesday the London-based team will be headed by Marcus Ayre, former vice president of investment banking at Merrill Lynch in the U.K. \u001d  \"The location of the new team is a direct response to increased deal flow expected in Europe and, increasingly, the U.S.,\" Damian Rigney, Colonial's global head of transactions and capital projects, said in a statement. \u001d  Colonial said the deal making teams will work with its investment management teams to secure new investments for Colonial's funds. \u001d  The London and New York teams will comprise a mixture of local hires and members of the Australian team. \u001d  Ed Lloyd, a senior executive from Colonial in Sydney, started work in the London office on June 12. Lloyd played a key role for Colonial when it took part in the 3i Group PLC-led consortium Osprey's GBP2.25 billion bid for AWG. \u001d  Ross Du Vernet, who will also transfer to the London team, was involved in Colonial's A$481 million bid for GasNet Australia that was last year trumped by Australian Pipeline Trust. \u001d  Also included in the London team is Colonial's Grant Rayner, who has spent the past 18 months in London, focusing on establishing the European Diversified Infrastructure Fund, which is currently being marketed. \u001d  The New York team will be headed up by Duane Cadman, who was involved in the AWG acquisition as well as Colonial's role in a Goldman Sachs-led consortium that last year considered a bid for U.K. airports operator BAA PLC. While Goldman lost out to Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA in the battle for BAA, Colonial had proposed taking an equity interest of more than A$1 billion. \u001d  Prior to joining Colonial, Cadman held investment banking roles with Gresham Partners in Sydney and prior to that, at JP Morgan. \b \u001d  -By Rebecca Thurlow, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2959; rebecca.thurlow@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Paul Dekkers \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 22:26 ET (02:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"df8d015fc4fdb7630261ae082f2e48e0","symR":["SVSE"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder JOHNSTON Registers 539,121 Of SILVER STAR ENERGY INC >SVSE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T02:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SVSE"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: SILVER STAR ENERGY INC \bSYMBOL: SVSE \b \b \bFILER: JOHNSTON NAOMI \bTITLE: Beneficial Owner \bBROKER: RESEARCH CAPITAL SECURITIES \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 539,121        DATE REGISTERED: 6/14/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: N/A \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.

In recent months, it also sued two of their subsequent employers, Morgan Stanley and a unit of Wachovia Corp. \u001d  In court documents and interviews, the ex-employees say they are being harassed and have done nothing wrong. One ex-staffer, Thomas Casper, is suing for libel in California state court after Fisher sent letters to its clients questioning whether Mr. Casper is \"trustworthy.\" \u001d  The Fisher spat has taken some twists. At the company banquet last year, founder Kenneth Fisher stood on a stage flanked by images of Saddam Hussein to discuss the legal actions against one of the ex-employees, William Carlson. Mr. Fisher described how he would pursue any former employees who went after Fisher's clients, according to several former staffers in attendance. \u001d  A Fisher spokesman said in an email that the company has \"done nothing to keep these individuals from pursuing their profession....They just can't use Fisher's proprietary information, including its client list.\" \u001d  Regarding the Hussein images, the firm provided a quote that it said came from Mr. Carlson's brother, Jay Carlson, who works for Fisher: \"I do not recall any connection between the photographic image your question says was displayed to everyone and any mention of my brother in any way. I continue to be happily employed at Fisher Investments.\" Jay Carlson didn't respond to a phone call seeking comment. \u001d  Disputes between firms and their salespeople over client poaching used to be more common. In recent years, more than a dozen brokerage firms have agreed to recruitment guidelines permitting a representative leaving a firm to take basic client information such as name, address, email and phone number. \u001d  Fisher Investments, which oversees $35 billion for individuals and institutions, is an investment adviser, not a broker. But its direct-mail and mass-market sales techniques put it in competition with brokerage houses for clients and employees. \u001d  Fisher Investments has a 10-year track record of outpacing its benchmark of the MSCI World Index, which Fisher materials cite as a standard performance benchmark. However, more-recent returns have lagged behind. For the five years ended Dec. 31, 2006, a composite of Fisher's accounts returned 6.5% a year, compared with 10% for the MSCI World Index, according to performance data from Fisher reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \u001d  The Fisher spokesman said the returns are \"not meaningful\" and the firm's performance should be compared to that of all mutual funds and separate accounts, which the company says it outperforms. Fisher didn't respond to a request for supporting data. \u001d  Fisher's recent lawsuits in California state court against Morgan Stanley and Wachovia Securities, a unit of Wachovia Corp., allege that the two firms helped Fisher's former employees use confidential client information to solicit business. \u001d  \"The allegations are without merit, and we intend to contest them,\" a Morgan Stanley spokesman said. Wachovia declined to comment. \u001d  Fisher also wanted brokerage house UBS Securities to commit to not hiring former employees or else the firm would pull its trading-related business, according to people familiar with the matter. Fisher Investments declined to comment about the UBS AG unit. \u001d  In late 2004, Fisher Investments sought damages and a restraining order against William Carlson, an Illinois-based former salesman who worked for the firm for more than six years. Fisher alleged that Mr. Carlson violated his employment contract by soliciting Fisher clients and that he stole trade secrets, specifically, contact information for existing and prospective clients. \u001d  In court documents, Mr. Carlson acknowledged contacting Fisher clients but said there was nothing improper about doing so. \u001d  In November 2004, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois wrote an opinion denying the restraining order against Mr. Carlson, saying that portions of Fisher's employment contract appeared to be unenforceable and that Fisher was unlikely to be able to show that its list of clients constituted a trade secret. \u001d  That dispute was settled out of court. The Fisher spokesman said Mr. Carlson made a payment to the company \"for violating his contractual obligation to keep Fisher client information confidential.\" The firm argues that the judge's opinion doesn't set a precedent for other disputes. \u001d  In an interview, Mr. Carlson's attorney declined to comment on the settlement, saying it was subject to a confidentiality agreement. He also questioned whether it was appropriate for Fisher Investments to comment on the settlement's terms in light of the confidentiality agreement. In court documents filed before the settlement, Mr. Carlson had denied that his actions violated his contract. \u001d  Last year, Fisher filed suit against Mr. Casper and his current employer, Wachovia, for allegedly soliciting Fisher clients in violation of his employment contract. Mr. Casper left Fisher after more than five years for a job at Citigroup Inc.'s Smith Barney. \u001d  In October 2006, Fisher threatened to pull unspecified business from Smith Barney if Mr. Casper tried to solicit any Fisher customers, according to Mr. Casper's countersuit. Mr. Casper says Fisher's actions caused Smith Barney to suggest that he find work elsewhere. \u001d  A spokesman for Smith Barney declined to comment. \u001d  In early April of this year, Mr. Fisher sent letters to an unknown number of individuals in the Fisher database who may have come into contact with Mr. Casper -- including current and former Fisher clients, as well as people who have never been Fisher clients, Mr. Casper's attorney says. The one-page letters say Mr. Casper had broken his employment contract. \u001d  Mr. Fisher \"is trying to tar Tom Casper,\" says Mr. Casper's attorney, Robert Peterson. \u001d  Virtually identical letters were sent regarding at least five former employees in total, according to people who have seen the letters. The letters were signed by Mr. Fisher, according to copies of the letters reviewed by the Journal. \u001d  The letter regarding Mr. Casper read, in part: \"The basic issue is: Would you trust your family's financial future in any regard to someone who could be proven to not live up to his word?\" It also said, \"If a person will not live up to his written word to us, do you think he will live up to his word, written or verbal, to you?\" \u001d  Mr. Casper's libel suit contends that the allegations are false and that Mr. Fisher sent the letters with the intent that they would \"damage Casper's reputation.\" \u001d  Fisher Investments didn't respond to a question about the letters or about the allegations in Mr. Casper's countersuit. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 19, 2007 23:07 ET (03:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fe5c2df8c7b8f05a90f03712a53e088a","symR":["MMG"],"date":"2007-06-20","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder FLORE Registers 12,500 Of METALLINE MINING CO INC >MMG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-20T02:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MMG"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 144 \b \bISSUER: METALLINE MINING CO INC \bSYMBOL: MMG \b \b \bFILER: FLORE ROCCO FELICE \bTITLE: Shareholder \bBROKER: GUNN ALLEN FINANCIAL INC \bRESTRICTED SHARES TO SELL: 12,500         DATE REGISTERED: 6/14/2007 \bAPPROXIMATE DATE OF SALE: N/A \b \b  The Form 144 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to \b  reflect the intention of any holder of restricted stock to sell those \b  shares.
