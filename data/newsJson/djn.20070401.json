 A few smaller producers do actively promote E85, such as VeraSun, which seeks to establish a branded E85. But even the smaller producers sell the bulk of their output for blending as a gasoline additive. \u001d  Because ethanol is more corrosive than gasoline, there's some concern it could leak out of a standard dispensing system and spark a fire. No E85 dispensing system -- nozzles, hoses, pumps -- has been certified by Underwriters Laboratories, the organization that tests the safety of products. \u001d  In October, UL suspended certification of parts that had been certified for use in E85 systems. Though there hadn't been any reports of problems, UL said it decided it needed to do its own safety research. Results aren't expected until late this year. \u001d  Among those trying to overcome obstacles to E85 are the domestic auto makers. They have built flex-fuel vehicles for years because doing so gives them \"credits\" in their efforts to meet federal fuel-economy standards. Without the credits, Ford and GM wouldn't have met mileage goals for light trucks in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and would have owed fines. The mileage goals pose a bigger challenge to Detroit because of its heavy reliance on large, thirsty vehicles. Foreign makers generally haven't resorted to building flex-fuel cars to meet the mileage goals. \u001d  For Detroit, the credits applied even if the flex-fuel cars they built never actually burned ethanol. For a long time, the auto makers said little about ethanol, and many owners of flex-fuel cars didn't know they had them. But when gasoline prices surged in 2005 and 2006, GM and Ford saw their flex-fuel cars as a way to counter their image as gas-guzzler makers. \u001d  Both began promotional campaigns, such as one in which GM gave buyers in Chicago and Minneapolis $1,000 gift cards good for E85. GM began to work with state officials to find grants to pay for installing pumping equipment. It has helped add E85 to 235 stations. Ford helped pay for installing 50 pumps so someone could drive from Chicago to Kansas City while filling up only with E85. \u001d  Among ethanol backers' recruits are two grocery chains. Kroger installed E85 at about 40 stations in Ohio and Texas. Privately held Meijer Inc. did the same in Michigan and Indiana. \u001d  Wal-Mart could provide a significant boost. It said last year it was considering selling E85 at its 388 company-owned stations but hasn't made a decision. \u001d  The U.S. tax code acts as a stimulus. Service-station owners can get a credit of up to $30,000 for their outlays to convert equipment to sell E85. \u001d  Some states have done their bit to spur the market. New York enacted a bill last year that barred oil companies from requiring stations to buy all of their fuel from the companies. \u001d  In the Albany area, station owner Christian King has begun selling E85 at one of his three Mobil outlets and plans to do so at a second. He says Mobil's restrictions still mean he can't put the price of E85 on the main sign or let drivers charge it on their Mobil credit cards. \u001d  Adding E85 \"is a personal thing,\" Mr. King says. \"I'm trying to do anything I can to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. And if this thing kicks off, I'm in a position to benefit.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 23:05 ET (03:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0383de32b8c5a77cea198aaaa7264752","symR":["NVC"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen CA Select Quality (NVC)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:53:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NVC"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen CA Select Quality (NVC): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NVC or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:53 ET (08:53 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"03bbbd403738406d28a464f179e79e9e","symR":["PCM"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Pimco Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust, Inc.

Record companies have so far insisted that digital retailers employ the software to prevent rampant copying. But because the DRM used by Apple is proprietary and does not work with services or devices made by competitors, it has had the unintended consequence of locking owners of its popular iPod music players into buying the most popular mainstream music from the iTunes store, and not its competitors. \u001d  Record companies have blamed this lock-in for limiting digital-music sales, which account for around 15% of all recorded music sales in the U.S. \u001d  EMI's move comes after months of private discussions and public advocacy by Internet and technology industry executives, including Mr. Jobs, aimed at encouraging the music industry to change its approach to licensing music for sale online. In February, Mr. Jobs took the unusual step of posting an 1,800-word essay on Apple's Web site urging major recording companies to consider dropping their insistence that music be sold over the Internet with DRM software. \u001d  Mr. Jobs contended that DRM software has been ineffective at solving digital piracy of music. That's in large part, he argued, because the vast majority of music is sold today on CDs, which generally don't contain copy-protection, making them easily sharable over the Internet through file-sharing technologies. Although he wasn't the first to suggest such a course change for the music industry, Mr. Jobs' essay spurred a vigorous debate through the technology and entertainment industries. Also fueling the discussion recently has been another steep drop in CD sales, which has forced the music industry to try and accelerate its digital future. \u001d  Privately, most labels rejected the idea out of hand, but EMI, the world's third-largest music company by sales, was already quietly exploring the idea of dropping DRM. EMI has struggled to overcome poor results and a laggard digital strategy, potentially contributing to its willingness to take a bold stance on DRM. \u001d  But EMI temporarily shelved its plans to drop DRM after various iTunes competitors declined to guarantee significant \"risk insurance\" payments designed to offset potential losses from the risky move. It is unclear whether Apple has guaranteed any such fee. \u001d  EMI's decision, if it's followed by other major recording companies, could also lessen growing political pressure on Apple by consumer rights organizations in several European countries, including Norway, that want to see Apple make its digital music products, iTunes and the iPod, work with songs and hardware from other companies. \u001d  EMI competitors have been divided on the DRM debate. Warner Music Group Corp. has been consistently opposed to the idea of removing DRM from its offerings, arguing that the technology will be increasingly important once CD sales are eclipsed by digital sales. Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group and Sony BMG Music Entertainment, a joint venture of Sony Corp. and Bertelsmann AG, on the other hand, have conducted experiments of its own. Neither company has moved as aggressively as EMI, though. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 20:20 ET (00:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"06cc9e533ed331400843d00bb29d68ce","symR":["CART.LN","GB00B05K7697"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Carter & Carter Group PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CART.LN","GB00B05K7697"],"IndustryCodes":["EAG","SVC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Carter & Carter Group PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B05K7697 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:30 ET (07:30 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"073e6f75cddcd2b3b911afb886cf8e34","symR":["ITW.LN","GB00B11FCP94"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Interactive World Plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ITW.LN","GB00B11FCP94"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF"],"Story":"\u001d  Interactive World Plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B11FCP94 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:19 ET (08:19 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"07b4292341327d3042df311f248d8ee4","symR":["PA8.XE","DE000A0B65S3"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for PAION AG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PA8.XE","DE000A0B65S3"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC"],"Story":"\u001d  PAION AG: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE000A0B65S3 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:51 ET (08:51 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"07b7de5b3a674e1b191f9d6bd58831e2","symR":["8001.TO","JP3143600009"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Itochu To Spend Y100B To Explore Natural Gas In US -Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T22:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["8001.TO","JP3143600009"],"IndustryCodes":["DIB","SVC","X225","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Itochu Corp. (8001.TO) plans to invest a total of about Y100 billion to develop natural gas in the U.S. over the three years through 2010, the Nikkei reported in its Sunday edition. \u001d  On Friday, the general trading house formally obtained concessions in 15 gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico. \u001d  Itochu's entry into the U.S. gas development business comes at a time when America is accelerating efforts to encourage the use of natural gas as an alternative energy source since it seeks to reduce its reliance on oil due to concern over national security and environmental protection. \u001d  In 2007, Itochu intends to spend roughly Y25 billion on gas development. \u001d  The company won concessions ranging from 10-49% in the 15 gas fields from Range Resources Ltd. by acquiring two subsidiaries of the midsize U.S. gas developer. \u001d  Itochu has already started gas production in all the fields, obtaining the natural gas equivalent of 2,300 barrels a day of crude oil. \u001d  The Japanese company seeks to sell the gas to local power utilities, chemical makers and other firms equipped with their own power generation facilities through a network of pipelines laid across the country that will be connected to its gas production facilities. \u001d  In a related move, Itochu in January bought concessions in a number of gas districts near the Gulf of Mexico from Santos Group, an Australian oil major. \u001d  In these districts, located southeast of Houston, it intends to first confirm the volume of reserves by drilling three gas wells by the end of this year and embark on production as early as 2008. \u001d  Itochu has an ambitious goal of boosting its gas output in the U.S. to 10,000 barrels a day within three years by acquiring more concessions in the Gulf of Mexico and eventually generating more than Y20 billion in annual sales from U.S. gas development operations. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 18:12 ET (22:12

\u001d  (Adds quotes from Prime Minister Abdullah and background) \b \u001d  KUALA LUMPUR (Dow Jones)--Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Monday said talks with Volkswagen AG (VW) and General Motors Corp. (GM) on the possibility of a strategic involvement in local carmaker Proton Holdings Bhd. (5304.KU) are continuing. \u001d  Last week, VW said that while a Malaysian government-imposed deadline for the conclusion of talks has passed, negotiations are ongoing. \u001d  Malaysia's government owns around 43% of Proton via its investment arm, Khazanah Nasional Bhd., and has stressed the need for foreign expertise, preferably via a stake investment, in revitalizing unprofitable Proton. Since the beginning of this decade, Proton has seen its domestic market share almost halve to 32% from nearly 60%. \u001d  \"I am waiting for the Proton chief...He has indicated he wants to see me (about the Volkswagen discussions),\" Abdullah told reporters Monday after opening a diplomatic conference. \u001d  \"At the level of the officials, (the talks are) nearing completion,\" he added. \"We want to conclude the talks as soon as possible,\" Abdullah said. \u001d  Malaysia has Southeast Asia's biggest new car market, with about half a million units sold each year, and Proton has set its sights on becoming a significant exporter of cars. \u001d  For the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2006, Proton reported a net loss of MYR281.5 million, compared with a net profit of MYR86.5 million a year earlier. \b \u001d  -By E-Ling Liaw, Dow Jones Newswires; 603-2692-5254; e-ling.liaw@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by David Bottomley \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 22:41 ET

Areddy \u001d  In his 35th-floor office overlooking the Shanghai Bund, Citigroup Inc.'s long-serving China chief, Richard Stanley, a veteran of some of Asia's biggest financial turning points, keeps a plaque next to his phone that reminds: \"never, never, never quit.\" \u001d  Mr. Stanley, who has headed Citigroup's China business for much of the past eight years, joined the New York financial institution in 1981 as an intern. After the bank sent him to Columbia University for his master's degree in business administration, it put him on a plane for Singapore in 1990. There in early 1995 he helped work through the spectacular implosion of speculative futures trading that brought about the collapse of Barings, Britain's oldest investment bank. The next year, Mr. Stanley became head of corporate banking for Citigroup in Bangkok, just in time for the Asian financial crisis that roiled many economies. \u001d  When Mr. Stanley first moved to Shanghai in 1999 to head the bank's China operations, Citigroup had just 150 people in the country. But Beijing was getting serious about opening up the banking sector, and in early 2002 Mr. Stanley became the first foreign banker to take a U.S. dollar deposit from a Chinese citizen. Following a brief posting back to Singapore in 2004, Mr. Stanley returned to the top China job. \u001d  Now the 46-year-old chief executive officer leads Citigroup China at its most critical juncture yet. In contrast to the way Citigroup is downsizing in the U.S. as part of a global restructuring, the bank is expanding in China, including adding 25% to its 3,000 staff this year, in hope of tapping into the total two trillion yuan ($259 billion) of savings held by individual Chinese. Citigroup has just crossed 100 days as the managing shareholder of 500-branch Guangdong Development Bank and is looking at other ventures, including a bigger stake in Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. \u001d  Mr. Stanley, who was born on Long Island, in New York state, is married to a woman from Singapore, and the couple has two boys and a girl. He spoke with James T. Areddy at his Citigroup office in Shanghai. \b \u001d  WSJ: What was your first job? \u001d  Mr. Stanley: At 13 years old I got my first paper route which, was an advertising circular delivered weekly in my area called the Penny Saver. A few months later, I was about 14, I thought I would take a route delivering the New York Daily News. You had to go one day a week and knock on people's doors and collect the money. It gives you a lesson of how to interact with people, how to handle people, clients actually. \b \u001d  WSJ: Who gave you the best business advice and what was it? \u001d  Mr. Stanley: My father was a civil engineer and he told me many many times as I was growing up that I should not look at engineering as a career. I don't know why he said that but that had the impact in part of getting me into the financial-services industry, which has evolved over the years into something much different from when I started and much more fascinating. The second thing is a quote from Winston Churchill that says, \"never, never, never quit.\" I have this thing sitting right by my phone. He actually said, \"never, never, never give up.\" But for some reason the thing says \"quit.\" That sort of thinking was very much with me during many issues of my China years, including some of the tougher negotiations I've been involved with in recent times. \b \u001d  WSJ: What advice would you give to someone starting off in your business today? \u001d  Mr. Stanley: I would take Warren Buffett's long-term investing approach, as opposed to the day-trader approach vis-a-vis a career. I have done a lot of different things, been to a lot of different places, seen a lot of interesting developments. I don't know if I would have had this experience if I had jumped around. \u001d  China right now is a very hot market. And a lot of people are tempted by the short-term opportunity of moving to another firm and getting an increase and new title. \b \u001d  WSJ: What are you reading? \u001d  Mr. Stanley: I read a lot of biographies. The current one is about Henry Ford. It's called \"The People's Tycoon\" [by Steven Watts]. He really tapped into what we now know as the consumer culture. There are a lot of parallels to what is happening now in China. \u001d  I just picked up another book, about the life of Walt Disney. Lately I'm thinking about \"The World Is Flat,\" the Thomas L. Friedman book. I think over the long-term future there will be a balancing between activities being done in places like this and the United States and Europe. The world is flat but it's not all one way. \b \u001d  WSJ: Is there any gadget or piece of technology you can't do without? \u001d  Mr. Stanley: The BlackBerry is to me the best and the worst device ever developed. I've recently cut a deal with my wife that the BlackBerry will not exist in the bedroom. \b \u001d  WSJ: In banking, how is China different from the West? \u001d  Mr. Stanley: There is a lot more specialization. We have a bit more of a broader involvement in different areas. That can be a function of the degree of sophistication of the industry, say in the U.S. versus China. One of the things I like about working out here is that I touch on many different things during the day that I wouldn't necessarily touch on if I was working in the United States. \b \u001d  WSJ: Is there any instance when you felt you let your company or colleagues down? If so, what did it teach you? \u001d  Mr. Stanley: On some occasions in my career as a manager I've allowed people to stay in the same job for perhaps longer than I should have. If you feel they are in the wrong job or their time has come to move on, you just have to give them the news, as opposed to delaying or letting the situation linger on, which doesn't help anybody. \b \u001d  WSJ: What is the toughest decision you've had to make as a manager? \u001d  Mr. Stanley: By far, it was the decision to go overseas. It was Asia, exotic, not in my comfort zone in the U.S. If I knew in 1990 what I know now, I would do it again in a heartbeat. But at the time it was a tough decision to make. \b \u001d  WSJ: What was the most satisfying decision you've made as a manager? \u001d  Mr. Stanley: What I'm doing today is putting a lot of people, mainly [Chinese employees], into much bigger jobs than they currently have. That is just a lot of fun. \b \u001d  WSJ: What is Guangdong Development Bank for Citigroup? \u001d  Mr. Stanley: We have a multipronged strategy in China, which includes obviously the development of our organic business. GDB is a critical part of the Citigroup China strategy. It allows us to be more engaged on a number of different fronts in the development of the banking market here. There are obviously a lot of uncertainties about how things will develop. Over time I think it positions us well for the opportunities that this market will present and as it becomes more sophisticated. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 17:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0e61de12038aa45647f7a4407c200e09","symR":["BDT"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Strategic Dividend Achievers Trust (BDT)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BDT"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  BlackRock Strategic Dividend Achievers Trust (BDT): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BDT or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:23 ET (07:23 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"0e74084824cc480580c66d9f212ceafc","symR":["RRC"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Range Resources Corp.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RRC"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Range Resources Corp.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=RRC or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:20 ET (09:20 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"0e83c37399df55984f23388ccaaa8a59","symR":["CHG"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for CH Energy Group, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CHG"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  CH Energy Group, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=CHG or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:36 ET (07:36 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"0ebc36048a16c49e9918e603e087641c","symR":["0005.HK","HBC","HSBA.LN","GB0005405286"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Moody's Assigns Hsbc Bk (China) -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T23:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0005.HK","HBC","HSBA.LN","GB0005405286"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XHSG","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"must be weighed solely as one factor in any investment decision made by or on behalf of any user of the information contained herein, and each such user must accordingly make its own study and evaluation of each security and of each issuer and guarantor of, and each provider of credit support for, each security that it may consider purchasing, holding or selling.

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \b   By Eric Bellman in Mumbai and Tom Wright in Jakarta, Indonesia \u001d  Tata Power Co.'s $1.3 billion purchase of a 30% stake in coal companies owned by Indonesian mining concern PT Bumi Resources shows how Indian companies are continuing their global search for the commodities and businesses they need to power the country's growth. \u001d  On Saturday, Tata Power said it signed an agreement to acquire a coal-trading company and 30% stake each in PT Kaltim Prima Coal and PT Arutmin Indonesia -- all three concerns controlled by Jakarta-listed Bumi Resources. \u001d  Tata Power is India's largest nongovernment power company and part of the same Tata Group that agreed in January to buy European steelmaker Corus Group PLC for around $12 billion. Tata Power said the Indonesian deal will give it access to the coal and technology it needs for big expansion plans. \u001d  \"This move not only secures our fuel requirements in light of the aggressive growth plans charted out by the company, but also opens up opportunities for Tata Power to own and operate a range of world class, competitive and profitable electricity and energy businesses,\" Prasad. R. Menon, managing director of Tata Power, said in statement. \u001d  The coal from Indonesia will be used to feed Tata's new power plants on India's west coast. The planned plants, scheduled to be completed in five years, will have a total capacity of 7,000 megawatts and will require almost 21 million metric tons of imported coal a year. The deal with Bumi Resources entitles Tata Power to buy about half of the amount needed from the Indonesian companies. \u001d  With the economy in India expanding at more than 8% a year for the past three years, its companies can at last afford the multibillion-dollar deals needed to get access to the overseas coal, steel, oil and technology and sales networks they need. The Tata Power deal would be one of the five largest international acquisitions to date by an Indian company. \u001d  Last year, Indian companies announced a record $21 billion in overseas acquisitions, according to Dealogic Holdings PLC. They are expected to make even more foreign acquisitions this year. \u001d  The latest deal also represents growing interest in Indonesian coal resources. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of thermal coals, used for generating power. (Australia is the largest exporter of higher-quality metallurgical coal used for making steel.) \u001d  With prices for the mineral rising 30% in the first three months of 2007, many Indonesian business groups have moved into coal mining recently. Meanwhile, foreign mining companies have been stymied by Indonesia's failure to pass a new law governing investments in the minerals sector. BHP Billiton Ltd., for instance, wants to invest in two major coal mines on Borneo island, but has put the plans on hold because of regulatory uncertainty. \u001d  The booming economy in India has turned that nation's companies into important customers for Indonesian coal. Sandiaga Uno, who runs an investment fund with a stake in PT Adaro coal mine, says Indian companies \"are important customers\" and account for 10% of that mine's output, compared with nothing three years ago. \u001d  Bumi Resources, which is controlled by the family of Aburizal Bakrie, a wealthy businessman and senior government minister, entered the coal-mining business in 2001 when it bought a controlling stake in Arutmin from BHP Billiton for $148 million. In 2003, it pulled off a coup by beating rivals to take 100% in Kaltim Prima for $500 million. \u001d  Kaltim Prima, a world-class open-pit coal mine, was previously owned by Rio Tinto Ltd. and BP PLC. Like BHP, Rio Tinto and BP had to sell their stakes to an Indonesian company under the terms of their original operating contracts with the Indonesian government. \u001d  Last year, Bumi Resources tried to sell 100% of Arutmin and Kaltim Prima to Indonesian investors for $3.2 billion. But that deal fell through amid disagreements over valuations. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 17:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

\u001d  MILAN (Dow Jones)--Italy's Telecommunication Minister Paolo Gentiloni Sunday said he is \"deeply worried\" about the news that tires-to-telecom group Pirelli & C. Spa (PC.MI) has entered exclusive talks with U.S. telecommunication operator AT&T (T) and Mexican mobile phone operator America Movil (AMX) to sell 60% of its stake in Italian unlisted holding company Olimpia SpA. \u001d  This would pave the way for the two foreign telecommunication operators to become major shareholders of Italy's largest telecom group Telecom Italia SpA (TI). Pirelli indirectly controls an 18% interest in Telecom Italia through its 80% stake in Olimpia. \u001d  In a statement issued late Sunday, Gentiloni said he and the government had been informed only Sunday afternoon that Pirelli's board would have held an extraordinary meeting to evaluate the offers. AT&T and America Movil valued Telecom Italia at EUR2.82 per share minus the EUR2.8 billion net debt of Olimpia. \u001d  Gentiloni added that \"the Italian government would watch the situation closely.\" \u001d  After Pirelli made public its decision to sell its stake in Olimpia last month, Gentiloni said the government would not meddle into private company's businesses, but that it considered Telecom Italia's fixed-line network a strategic asset that the country could not give up. \b \u001d  -By Giada Zampano, Dow Jones Newswires;

(T) and its Mexican affiliate America Movil (AMOV) to take a combined 66.6% stake in the holding company that controls Telecom Italia SpA (TIT.MI) for a total of 2.6 billion euros ($3.47 billion) stand to accelerate consolidation of the world's largest telecommunications firms, though the bids could first run into nationalist resistance from the Italian government. \u001d  The board of Italian tires-to-telecom group Pirelli & C. SpA (PC.MI) Sunday said it had entered into exclusive talks with U.S. telecommunication operator AT&T and America Movil to sell each company 33.3% of its 80% stake in unlisted holding company Olimpia SpA. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  AT&T is in the midst of a bold global expansion, and a substantial purchase of Olimpia would give it a beachhead in Europe. Olimpia holds an 18% stake in Telecom Italia, Italy's largest telecom group, which has allowed it to control the company's board. Italy's Benetton family owns the other 20% of Olimpia. If the deal goes through, the two foreign companies would each hold the largest, and equal, stakes in a company that the Italian government has long wanted to stay in Italian hands. \u001d  Pirelli Chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera had announced last month that he was looking to sell out of his money-losing investment in Telecom Italia. However, control of Telecom Italia has become a hot-button political issue, and Tronchetti Provera has been sparring openly with Prime Minister Romano Prodi over how much influence foreign firms should have in the Italian company. \u001d  Italy's Communication's Minister, Paolo Gentiloni, in a press release late Sunday, said he was \"extremely worried\" about the possible sale to foreign companies, and encouraged Italian banks and investors to counterbid. AT&T and America Movil, which is 8% owned by At&T, both valued Telecom Italia at EUR2.82 a share less the EUR2.8 billion net debt of Olimpia, though the price is subject to due diligence by the two companies and all the conditions of the contract. Selling at that price would amount to a loss of EUR3.6 billion for Pirelli. However, it amounts to a substantial premium over the EUR2.13 a share Telecom Italia was trading at the close Friday in Milan. \u001d  The offer comes after Swisscom AG (SCM)'s bid for Fastweb SpA (FWB.MI), which is Italy's second-largest Internet broadband provider and one of the country's largest fixed-line phone providers. Already, three of Italy's four mobile-phone providers are owned by foreigners. Telecom Italia's mobile unit is the last to have remained under Italian control. \u001d  The scenario that Telecom Italia could also wind up in foreign hands has alarmed Prodi, and he had moved in the past to undercut Troncehtti Provera's dealings with other foreign firms. \u001d  However, Tronchetti Provera has been looking for a way to salvage his investment in the telecom firm, which he took over in 2001. He has recently concluded that forging an industrial alliance with a large foreign telecom company would be the best way to halt Telecom Italia's slide in the stock market. \u001d  But members of the Italian government have been trying to hamstring his ability to recruit a foreign investor. The government rallied a group of Italian banks to negotiate with Tronchetti Provera, though the negotiations made little progress because of a difference over the value of the company. \u001d  However, the timing of the deal could be crucial. April 4 is the deadline by which shareholders must present nominations for a new board of directors at Telecom Italia, which will be voted on later in the month. If Tronchetti Provera succeeds in closing the deal before then, AT&T and America Movil would have tremendous sway over choosing new management. \u001d  The deal, if completed, would mark the latest step in a foreign expansion by AT&T, the biggest phone company in the U.S. by revenue and customers. The company has recently made investments in emerging markets, including Vietnam as well as South Africa and elsewhere. In October, AT&T won licenses to provide both national and international long-distance calling in India. \u001d  AT&T is also in talks with Telekom Malaysia Bhd. and Singaporean carrier Starhub Ltd. to build a cable line linking Southeast Asia and the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter. Verizon Communications Inc., the chief U.S. rival of AT&T, is also stepping up investments globally. AT&T has customers in 137 countries. \u001d  Though AT&T has made a string of acquisitions lately, including BellSouth Corp., the Italian move reflects that its chairman and chief executive, Edward Whitacre, may not be satisfied with the pace of expansion. Some analysts and industry experts speculate he could next move to acquire a U.S. satellite company to help along AT&T's major rollout of television, which it hopes will assist with its battle against U.S. cable companies. \u001d  (Dionne Searcey contributed to this story) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 17:53 ET (21:53 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

There are a number of reasons, but one big one is resistance from oil companies. \u001d  Although some oil executives voice enthusiasm for alternative fuels, oil-company policies make it harder for many service stations to stock a fuel called E85, a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. \u001d  These policies are hardly the only barrier to wider use of the ethanol fuel. Demand is limited by the small number of vehicles that can burn it -- only about 5% of those on the road in America. It can be slightly costlier to burn E85, even though it costs less per gallon, because a car doesn't go as far on a gallon of the ethanol fuel as on gasoline. These demand restraints would limit service-station owners' enthusiasm for spending on the equipment needed to offer E85 even if the policies of the oil companies were not a factor. \u001d  But those policies add a significant extra obstacle. Oil companies lose sales every time a driver chooses E85, and they employ a variety of tactics that help keep the fuel out of stations that bear the company name. For instance, franchises sometimes are required to purchase all the fuel they sell from the oil company. Since oil companies generally don't sell E85, the stations can't either, unless the company grants an exception and lets them buy from another supplier. \u001d  Contracts sometimes limit advertising of E85 and restrict the use of credit cards to pay for it. Some require that any E85 pump be on a separate island, not under the main canopy. \u001d  Oil companies say they will allow stations to sell E85, but they must have certain rules for the protection of customers and protection of their brand. They call the restrictions reasonable and in some cases necessary to make sure drivers don't fill up with E85 if their vehicle can't burn it. \u001d  Most of the U.S.'s 170,000 fuel stations aren't owned by oil companies but are either franchised from them or independent. Less than 1% stock E85. Some experts say that to really take hold and be seen as a viable alternative to gasoline, the fuel would have to be available at, roughly, 10% of stations. \u001d  Those pushing for ethanol are targeting two very different types of fuel stations: those run by big retailers like Kroger Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and independent ones owned by small businesses. These represent the biggest and smallest of businesses, but have one thing in common: They aren't under the thumb of the oil industry. \u001d  Nearly half of the gasoline sold in the U.S. does have some ethanol in it. Oil companies routinely use it as an additive, typically at 10% ethanol to 90% gasoline, because the corn-based fuel burns cleaner. The blending enables companies to meet government smog-reduction rules. They also add ethanol because of a federal mandate on the industry as a whole, requiring that it use a certain amount of \"renewable\" fuels in its products. \u001d  Among those pressing for wider use of E85 are domestic auto makers, especially Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. Ethanol is one energy initiative where they're out in front of Japanese car makers. While Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. are known for their gasoline-electric hybrids, Detroit, which has been heavily criticized for its sales of gas guzzlers, is far ahead in making \"flexible-fuel\" vehicles that can burn either gasoline or ethanol. \u001d  In Dwight, Ill., Becker's BP on Interstate 55 is one of just a few dozen major-brand gasoline retailers in the U.S. that sell E85. Owner Phil Becker says the governor wanted the state's vehicles to use E85 and targeted his station as a popular stop for state workers. He says BP PLC let him get the fuel from a non-BP supplier, and the Illinois Corn Growers Association gave him $100,000 for new tanks and pumps that BP required. \u001d  \"Because I've got E85 and we've advertised it, we've had four or five farmers that traded their trucks to get E85 vehicles,\" Mr. Becker says. \u001d  Exxon Mobil Corp.'s standard contract with Exxon stations bars them from buying fuel from anybody but itself, and it doesn't sell E85. A spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil says it makes exceptions case by case. \u001d  Even if one is granted, the station must follow rules including one that says E85 must be dispensed from its own unit, not part of an existing multihose dispenser. \"This minimizes customer confusion around vehicle compatibility issues and maintains product quality integrity,\" says the spokeswoman, Prem Nair. \u001d  A ConocoPhillips memo to franchisees says the company doesn't allow E85 sales on the primary island, under the covered canopy where gasoline is sold. Stations must find another spot. As a result, it isn't quite as simple for a driver to decide on the spur of the moment to fill up with E85. ConocoPhillips declines to comment. \u001d  A Chevron Corp. agreement with franchisees also appears to discourage selling E85 under the main canopy. It says dealers offering alternative fuels cannot \"deceive the public as to the source of the product,\" a phrase that some gas-station interests interpret to mean that E85 can't be sold under the main canopy. Chevron says it recommends, but doesn't require, that E85 pumps be outside the canopy. \u001d  Chevron says it requires Chevron- and Texaco-branded stations to keep \"E85\" off their primary signs listing fuel prices. To show the fuel's price, and alert approaching drivers that E85 is for sale, the stations have to erect a separate sign. \u001d  Another Chevron recommendation makes it much more expensive for a station to offer E85 at all. Stations usually have three tanks, for the three gasoline grades, regular, mid-grade and premium. The easiest way to offer E85 in addition to these three is to convert the mid-grade tank to E85. Such a station can still offer mid-grade gasoline, because a \"blender pump\" can mix some regular with some premium, and mid-grade will come out of the hose. \u001d  But Chevron's agreement with station owners recommends they install new pumps and tanks at their own expense if they want to stock E85. Doing so can cost more than $200,000 per station, according to a fuel-station trade group in Washington state called Automotive United Trades Organization. Chevron says it requires special tanks only if they're needed for safety. \u001d  Oil companies also require stations to stock all three grades, meaning stations may not simply replace a low-selling mid-grade with E85. \u001d  At BP, guidelines for stations that carry the company name bar any mention of E85 on signs on gasoline dispensers, perimeter signs or light poles. The stations also can't let buyers use pay-at-the-pump credit-card machines. \u001d  Selling E85 is \"not impossible -- it's just that they really kind of hassle you to not put it in,\" says Ron Lamberty, who owns two stations in South Dakota, one a BP station. Mr. Lamberty doesn't sell E85, even though he is director of market development for the American Coalition for Ethanol. He says he is looking into adding the fuel to his BP station in Sioux Falls. \u001d  Mr. Lamberty mocks BP's \"Beyond Petroleum\" slogan: \"It's 'beyond petroleum' but not so far beyond petroleum that it would contain anything but petroleum,\" he says. \u001d  BP says its guidelines are in place so customers realize the mostly ethanol fuel isn't a BP product. The company also bars stations from selling it under another brand name, such as VE85, the brand of a maker in Brookings, S.D., called VeraSun Energy Corp. \u001d  A BP spokesman, Scott Dean, says, \"When you've got 97% of your customers unable to use the product, you want to be very, very sure it is very clearly advertised.\" He says BP bought 718 million gallons of ethanol last year to blend into U.S. gasoline in small amounts. \"BP is one of the largest if not the largest purveyor of biofuels in the U.S. and the world,\" Mr. Dean says. \u001d  E85 also faces barriers having nothing to do with Big Oil, like the limited number of cars that can burn it. Domestic auto makers have vowed to double production of flex-fuel vehicles to about two million a year by 2010 and to make half of their new vehicles sold in America E85-capable by 2012. \u001d  While the fuel usually costs less, it can be costlier to drivers because they get about 25% fewer miles per gallon from ethanol than from gasoline. At a pro-ethanol group called the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, Executive Director Monte Shaw estimates that E85 has to be at least 20 to 30 cents a gallon cheaper to compete with gasoline on price. \u001d  Iowa statewide average prices on a recent day were $2.18 a gallon for regular gasoline and $1.97 for E85, according to a Department of Energy Web site. Because E85 is less energy-intensive, the site said, it would cost the average owner of a big Chevy Tahoe SUV about $2,364 a year to fuel it with E85, and $1,935 to fuel it with regular gasoline. \u001d  The price of ethanol has risen in the past year, partly because of demand from oil companies that want it for an additive. This usage creates something of a conflict for big ethanol producers like Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. Their main ethanol customers are the oil companies. Customers for E85 are far smaller and more fragmented. \u001d  ADM, whose yearly output of 1.1 billion gallons is more than 20% of the domestic ethanol market, says it is happy to sell E85 if someone wants it, but that is a \"very small\" part of its business. \"Near term, we have focused more attention on the\" additive side, says an ADM executive, Edward Harjehausen. \u001d  Even the main ethanol lobbying group in Washington, the Renewable Fuels Association, has focused mostly on developing the market for the fuel as an additive. \"If you have a pump that sells E85 but you don't have customers pulling up to that pump, why do you want to bother?\" says Bob Deneen, its chief lobbyist. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 23:05 ET (03:05 GMT)\u001d

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Ethan Smith and Nick Wingfield \u001d  In a major break with the music industry's longstanding antipiracy strategy, EMI Group PLC is set to announce today that it plans to sell significant amounts of its catalog without anticopying software, according to people familiar with the matter. \u001d  The London music company is to make its announcement at a London news conference featuring Apple Inc. Chief Executive Steve Jobs. EMI is to sell songs without the software -- known as digital rights management -- through Apple's iTunes Store and possibly through other online outlets. \u001d  DRM has been a contentious issue in online music sales. Record companies have insisted that digital retailers employ the software to prevent rampant copying. But because the DRM used by Apple is proprietary and doesn't work with services or devices made by competitors, it has had the additional consequence of locking owners of its popular iPod music players into buying the most popular mainstream music from the iTunes store, and not from its competitors. \u001d  Record companies have blamed this lock-in for limiting digital-music sales, which account for around 15% of all recorded-music sales in the U.S. \u001d  EMI's move comes after months of private discussions and public advocacy by Internet and technology-industry executives, including Mr. Jobs, aimed at encouraging the music industry to change its approach to licensing music for sale online. In February, Mr. Jobs took the unusual step of posting an 1,800-word essay on Apple's Web site urging major recording companies to consider dropping their insistence that music be sold over the Internet with DRM software. \u001d  Mr. Jobs contended that DRM software has been ineffective at solving digital piracy of music. That is in large part, he argued, because the vast majority of music is sold today on CDs, which generally don't contain copy protection, making them easily sharable over the Internet through file-sharing technologies. Although Mr. Jobs wasn't the first to suggest such a change for the music industry, his essay spurred a vigorous debate throughout the technology and entertainment industries. Also fueling the discussion recently has been a steepening drop in CD sales, which has forced the music industry to try to accelerate its digital future. \u001d  Privately, most labels rejected the idea out of hand, but EMI, the world's third-largest music company by sales after Universal Music Group and Sony BMG Music Entertainment, already was quietly exploring dropping DRM. EMI has struggled to overcome poor results and a laggard digital strategy, potentially contributing to its willingness to take a bold stance on DRM. \u001d  EMI temporarily shelved plans to drop DRM after various iTunes competitors declined to guarantee significant \"risk insurance\" payments designed to offset potential losses from the move. It is unclear whether Apple has guaranteed any such fee. \u001d  EMI's decision, if other major recording companies follow it, also may lessen increasing political pressure on Apple by consumer-rights organizations in several European countries, including Norway, that want Apple to make its digital music products, iTunes and the iPod, work with songs and hardware from other companies. \u001d  EMI competitors have been divided on the DRM debate. Warner Music Group Corp. has been opposed to the idea of removing DRM from its offerings, arguing that the technology will be increasingly important once digital sales eclipse CD sales. Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group and Sony BMG Music Entertainment, a joint venture of Sony Corp. and Bertelsmann AG, on the other hand, have conducted experiments. Neither company has moved as aggressively as EMI, though. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 22:05 ET (02:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"17a732035bf83b087bad6e4de10a7bb1","symR":["PDT"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for J Hancock Patriot Prem Div Fund II (PDT)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PDT"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  J Hancock Patriot Prem Div Fund II (PDT): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=PDT or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:29 ET (08:29 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"17c60eafa656ee5cd0836e5931cce405","symR":["PLD"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for ProLogis","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PLD"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  ProLogis: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=PLD or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:18 ET (09:18 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"17fda7067b6636becb5fbb827fdd600b","symR":["MXR.V","MXROF","CA57772U1093"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Max Resources","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MXR.V","MXROF","CA57772U1093"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG"],"Story":"\u001d  Max Resources: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=MXROF or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:38 ET (08:38 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"180fd1da0481204f6c75473d39674f39","symR":["WIA"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Western Asset/Claymore US Treasury Fund","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WIA"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Western Asset/Claymore US Treasury Fund: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=WIA or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:54 ET (09:54 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"18affcf447c8df48d15aa16cd305b273","symR":["TKO"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Telkonet Inc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TKO"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Telkonet Inc: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=TKO or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:37 ET (09:37 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"18bf807c9c80c5aec7fdbab0449f1ff6","symR":["MYE"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Myers Industries Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MYE"],"IndustryCodes":["CTR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Myers Industries Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=MYE or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:45 ET (08:45 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"18f7cafda1854befaa6823d256fcb1ec","symR":["LOQ.LN","GB0001771426"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Lo-Q PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LOQ.LN","GB0001771426"],"IndustryCodes":["RCS"],"Story":"\u001d  Lo-Q PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0001771426 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:32 ET (08:32 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"190f24c845c74d0358a46d057fe8d774","symR":["BLP.LN","GB0005327076"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Blue Planet Eur Fin.

Staffers and PGA of America pros will analyze swings and custom-fit putters at the event, expected to draw 10,000 women. Products throughout the store will be marked down, and coupons for drivers and gift certificates to local spas or Starbucks coffee shops will be distributed. \u001d  The goal is \"not just to get women to try our stores but to increase their love affair for the game,\" says Justin Royer, vice president of marketing at the Eden Prairie, Minn., retailer. \"That helps everyone.\" \u001d  Overlooked and ignored for years by an industry focused on their male counterparts, female golfers are finding themselves in an unfamiliar position: They are slowly becoming the object of retailers' attention. A smattering of chains and independent shops are catering to both new and experienced female players in a bid to nurture a consumer segment that could represent a bright spot in a stagnant industry. \u001d  The attention is a far cry from the treatment women say they traditionally receive in golf stores. A poll published in the March/April issue of Golf For Women magazine found that 44% of about 1,200 female golfers surveyed feel they have been treated negatively at golf retailers. Complaints include a lack of merchandise for women, and sales staffs that either push women to buy substandard equipment or assume they are buying for their husbands or boyfriends, says Susan K. Reed, the magazine's editor in chief. It's \"condescending, and hostile, to disregard the customer like that,\" Ms. Reed says. \u001d  Women haven't been on the industry's radar, partly because they still represent a minority of golfers, generating no more than 10% of the industry's annual sales, retailers and manufacturers say. Women are more likely to learn to play with hand-me-down clubs, and buy equipment less frequently than their male counterparts. \u001d  Women made up about 18% of the 12.5 million adult core golfers in the U.S. in 2005, according to the National Golf Foundation, in Jupiter, Fla. But retailers and manufacturers say women represent about 40% of new golfers -- a potentially potent source of new revenue. \u001d  So, club makers have spent more time and money tailoring products for women. The advent of clubs with higher lofts, for instance, addresses the major difference between many male and female golfers -- that women typically swing their clubs more slowly than men, resulting in shorter shots in general. \u001d  Golf Galaxy, whose Women's Night Out is part of a broader plan to attract female shoppers, was swayed by market research indicating that women influence 65% of sporting-goods purchases, Mr. Royer says. The company says female membership in a frequent-buyer rewards program has risen to 15% from 6% in 2003. \"They're turning into loyal customers,\" Mr. Royer says. \u001d  To lure and keep female customers, retailers and manufacturers are trying to better understand female golfers. Women often start learning golf at an older age than men and are more likely to be unfamiliar with the rules and lack golf partners. Many men, by contrast, learn to play at an early age through friends or professional colleagues. \u001d  Women also tend to shop for clubs differently. The typical male golfer often is inspired to buy a club after watching a pro such as Tiger Woods or Phil Mickelson use it. Women are far more likely to get product recommendations from their friends. \u001d  Those differences have resulted in a small but growing number of women's-only stores. Patricia Dixon opened Empowered Women's Golf more than a decade ago, after being sold what she called \"junky clubs\" when she started learning the game. \"I asked, 'What is the swing weight on that club?'\" she recalls asking the male salesperson at a national golf retail chain. She says his response was, \"'Little lady, you just don't need to worry about swing weight.' So I said 'Well, little man, you don't need to worry about selling me clubs.'\" \u001d  She consulted a Ladies Professional Golf Association pro she knew, took out a loan and opened her store in Dallas in 1993, says Ms. Dixon, a former telecommunications executive. \u001d  The store runs golf schools throughout the year, some sponsored by manufacturer Callaway Golf Co., providing hundreds of women with lessons on everything from putting to fairway shots. Ms. Dixon also holds seminars to explain golf rules and etiquette. \u001d  The goal, retailers say, is to put women at ease. Golf & Tennis Pro Shop Inc.'s PGA Tour Superstores -- a chain of stores that average about 65,000 square feet and feature chipping greens with bunkers -- hosts several free women's clinics a week. Jorge Cora, the company's vice president of merchandising, says that on a typical shopping day, about 30% of the customers in a store will be female. \"We've made the store an unintimidating place with friendly service,\" he says. \u001d  Part of the challenge, retailers say, is persuading women golfers, especially beginners, to buy higher-priced clubs. While women take up the game in large numbers, many of them stop playing, partly because they're using older clubs that hamper their performance, retailers say. In the past three years, the number of women playing golf has actually shrunk almost 5%, the biggest drop in any reported segment. \u001d  Retailers hope to attract women like Angie Kim, a mother of two young children and a beginner golfer, who was practicing her swing one recent day at Griffith Park in Los Angeles. Ms. Kim says she is looking to replace her old set of Callaway golf clubs. \"I'll definitely pay a little more -- if it means I'm going to play a lot better,\" she says. \u001d  Retailers also are learning they can dramatically increase sales of shoes and apparel to female golfers with the proper merchandising. Ms. Dixon's shop, with less than $2 million in annual sales, carries shoe styles in sizes from 5 to 11, narrow, medium and wide. She has a database of 6,000 women who get a newsletter filled with information about new products and a column she writes on golf rules. \u001d  Pittsburgh-based golf-shop owner Jackie Sorrenti uses fashion shows to entice women into buying golf apparel. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Sorrenti put on a small fashion show at the end of a luncheon for a local women's golf association. The nine looks featured in the show encapsulated what she thinks will be the hottest styles for 2007, including shorts of different lengths and dresses from Adidas AG, Isisport and others. Her store -- called Gals on and off the Green -- plans another fashion show at a dinner fund-raiser. \"Soon we'll be almost on a weekly schedule,\" Ms. Sorrenti says. \u001d  Her store stocks apparel from about 20 different brands, in sizes from 0 to 24. She sends out email blasts announcing the arrival of new merchandise and hosts \"Monday Night Football\" events, where men are treated to food, beverages and the game while they see golf products their wives, sisters or other female loved ones have picked out. If the men choose to purchase a \"gift,\" it will be wrapped and ready to take home by game's end. Sales at her store are growing by double-digits annually, she says. \u001d  The key, retailers say, is respecting the female golfer and encouraging her to make her own decisions. Ms. Dixon says she tries to convince women not to let their husbands buy clubs for them by asking, \"'Do you have him buy your bra?' If you can buy a bra, you can buy golf clubs.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  Ms. Kang is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Los Angeles bureau.

AirTran also upped its bid in January, and the latest offer of $9 a share plus 0.5842 AirTran shares represents an 83% premium over the average closing price of Midwest shares during the trading month preceding the initial AirTran bid last October. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  Midwest officials couldn't immediately be reached. \u001d  A subcommittee of AirTran's board of directors has approved the latest offer, according to people familiar with the situation. The move appears partly aimed at luring additional investors to Midwest shares before the deadline Tuesday by which shareholders must own the airline's stock in order to vote at a May 23 shareholder meeting. AirTran has proposed a slate of three directors for election at the meeting, and the airline now plans to extend the deadline of a tender offer to Midwest holders to May 16, these people said. \u001d  AirTran's persistence comes amid a cooling of the consolidation fever that gripped the U.S. airline industry just a few months ago. Delta Air Lines Inc. fended off a $9.75 billion hostile takeover bid by US Airways Group Inc. in late January, putting a number of possible takeover scenarios on hold at least for now. Still, many airline executives insist that far-reaching consolidation is needed, with carriers streamlining their route networks and trimming costs to help them withstand an inevitable downturn in travel demand. \u001d  AirTran is a discount full-service carrier that operates mainly through its Orlando and Atlanta hubs. The airline competes along the East Coast and through the Midwest, emerging as a potent rival to Delta in the much-larger airline's hometown. Midwest is known for its business-class seating arrangements and in-flight chocolate-chip cookies. \u001d  AirTran officials have expressed confidence they would be able to cut costs at Midwest, partly by using AirTran's young aircraft fleet more efficiently along Midwest's routes. But Midwest's directors have rejected the previous offers by AirTran, recommending that shareholders not tender their stock to AirTran. Midwest has insisted that it can grow successfully on its own. \u001d  Pressure on Midwest to reconsider might be building. In a letter to Midwest executives last week, Richard Hurowitz, chief executive of Octavian Master Fund LP, which controls over 5% of Midwest's stock, said the New York-based investment fund believes \"that under the right terms a combination of the two companies makes enormous strategic sense.\" Were AirTran to increase its offer, he added, \"we would strongly encourage and expect the board and management team of Midwest to...immediately enter into good faith negotiations.\" \u001d  At the close of New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Midwest shares rose 24 cents, or 1.8%, to $13.51. AirTran was up seven cents at $10.27. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 20:27 ET (00:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"262fe430c5780c32205d92fba9f4030e","symR":["EPC","EPC.XE","DE0005128003"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Epcos AG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EPC","EPC.XE","DE0005128003"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","XDJGI","XNMP","XNYA","XTDX"],"Story":"\u001d  Epcos AG: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0005128003 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:52 ET (07:52 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"265b3b6161298c0b8b1f2904a8019237","symR":["ROC"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Rothmans Inc.

With the opening, foreign lenders are planning aggressive expansion, with Citigroup's Citibank, Hongkong & Shanghai Banking and Standard Chartered all planning to roughly double their number of branches in China. \u001d  But the government is maintaining a cautious approach. The foreign banks have already been approved to form local corporations -- a condition for doing yuan business -- by the China Banking Regulatory Commission, or CBRC, and their China units have won licenses from local governments. But before the newly formed units can actually start taking deposits from Chinese customers, they must still go through a period of inspection by the CBRC. \u001d  Bank executives say they were expecting the trial period, although they aren't sure how long it will last. Asked in an interview when her bank expects to receive a license to provide yuan-based services, Katherine Tsang, Standard Chartered's chief executive in China, replied, \"I think it should be soon.\" \u001d  Richard Yorke, chief executive of HSBC Bank (China), said the CBRC will be watching, among other matters, how the banks train their staff and design their product roll-out. \"The quicker we became locally incorporated, the quicker we can move toward inspection, to allow us to offer [yuan] products to our local customers,\" he said in an interview yesterday. \u001d  HSBC has the largest presence in China of any foreign bank, with 35 outlets. Mr. Yorke said he expects that number to increase by about 30 in the next 12 months. \"We're looking to hire 1,000-plus [people] for this year, and 1,000-plus for next year,\" he said. \u001d  Standard Chartered has said it will have 40 outlets by year end, compared with 22 now, and Ms. Tsang said that it will expand its network of automated tellers in the country to between 80 and 100 ATMs from the current 22. Citigroup Chief Executive Charles Prince said last week that it will increase its number of China branches to more than 30 by year end from 16 now. \u001d  Without incorporating locally, foreign banks have been allowed since December to take some local-currency time deposits, from customers depositing at least one million yuan (about $129,000). The four banks opening local operations today were given in-principle approval to set them up in March. \u001d  The new operations that they are opening today won't initially be able to do any more business than they have been doing, but Ms. Tsang of Standard Chartered said the move is meaningful. \"The relationship to the regulators will be closer, with the media, with the customers and with the government, too,\" she said. \u001d  Foreign banks will face continued regulatory uncertainties as they expand -- even after they are given the final green light to do yuan retail business. For example, it remains unclear under the current rules if they can promote credit and debit cards with their own brands as Chinese banks can. \"It's like all other things in China. You just cannot assume\" that you can do it, Ms. Tsang said. Citigroup and HSBC already issue joint credit cards in cooperation with Chinese partners. \u001d  Expansion could be slowed by other factors, such as whether banks can find enough qualified candidates to fill positions throughout the country. HSBC has opened branches in three inland cities, away from the prosperous coast, and made a push into the northeast rust-belt region, where Mr. Yorke said expects to open a branch in Shenyang by mid-year. Both of those regions are relatively poor. \u001d  As part of their localization, foreign banks are seeking credit ratings for their new Chinese units. HSBC expects to announce today that Moody's Investors Service assigned its local corporation an A2 rating on its long-term local and foreign currency deposits, said James Burdett, chief financial officer of HSBC Bank (China). \u001d  The rating is three notches below the Aa2 level Moody's has assigned to parent Hongkong & Shanghai Banking, but is the same as China's sovereign rating. \b \u001d

WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Dennis K. Berman, Valerie Bauerlein and Robin Sidel \u001d  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. is in late-stage negotiations to purchase credit-card and payments processor First Data Corp. for more than $20 billion, people familiar with the matter said, marking the latest in a string of leveraged buyouts of established U.S. corporations. \u001d  KKR was hoping to make an official announcement over the next few days, these people said. The exact purchase price couldn't be learned yesterday, though two people described the price as a premium to First Data's $20 billion market capitalization. As in any large-scale negotiation, talks could falter at the last moment, as both sides jockey over final terms. \u001d  A spokesman for KKR declined comment. First Data was unavailable for comment. \u001d  A potential deal for First Data reflects KKR's voracious appetite but also shows how flush private-equity firms are in an environment of cheap credit. Even a year ago, a $20 billion offer by a private-equity firm would have been considered a stretch. But there have been a spate of large companies that have been taken private recently by buyout firms, who sometimes team up, thereby sharing the risk and reward. \u001d  Blackstone Group, which recently filed documents with regulators for an initial public offering, is paying $23 billion for Equity Office Properties and assuming $16 billion of debt. Bain Capital, KKR and Merrill Lynch & Co. teamed up to pay $21 billion and assume $11.7 billion in debt to acquire hospital operator HCA Inc. in 2006. In the first quarter, there were $50 billion in loans for leveraged buyouts, according to Reuters Loan Pricing Corp., a pace on track to put 2007 far ahead of the record-setting 2006. \u001d  The teaming up of private-equity firms in what is known as club deals has attracted the scrutiny of the Justice Department, which is trying to determine whether these firms are behaving in an anticompetitive manner. Indeed, one notable aspect in the bidding for First Data is that KKR appears to be acting alone. That reflects confidence on the part of KKR, which led the most famous leveraged buyout of all time, the $25 billion takeover in 1988 of RJR Nabisco, a deal that was made into a best-selling book and movie but whose financial returns proved anemic. \u001d  One reason First Data may be attractive to KKR is that processing companies have good cash flow, a key factor private-equity firms want in a business. First Data's operations underpin large parts of the nation's banking system as it processes checks, automated teller-machine, debit cards and credit-card transactions. The company posted revenue of $7.08 billion last year and net income of $1.51 billion. Many in the stock market have long expected a leveraged buyout of the Greenwood Village, Colo., company, especially after it separated its faster-growing Western Union payment-transfer business last year and has struggled to find a chief executive officer to succeed Henry C. \"Ric\" Duques. \u001d  At 4 p.m. composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of First Data rose 44 cents, or 1.7%, to $26.90. \u001d  First Data was split off from American Express Co. in 1992 as an information-processing company that would handle billions of credit-card and other transactions for third parties. The company has struggled in recent years to organize its international, commercial and retail-processing units in a compelling way, amid turmoil in the CEO suite. \u001d  Like the financial institutions that issue credit cards, the card-processing companies are grappling with a slowdown in growth. Even though consumers are using plastic for more purchases than ever before, American wallets are already stuffed with cards and it can be difficult to convince consumers that they need another one. The growth slowdown hurts large processors because they typically get paid based on the number of accounts rather than the amount of spending that takes place on those cards. At the same time, big banks are increasingly handling some of their own card processing as a way to cut costs. \u001d  Mr. Duques, 63 years old, ran the company for 10 years until he handed the reins to Charles Fote in 2002. Mr. Fote stepped down in 2005 after overseeing an aggressive strategy that alienated some customers and investors. Mr. Duques agreed to step back in for two years to reorganize the company's remaining businesses and cut operating costs. No successor has been named and Mr. Duques's two-year window closes later this year, and the lack of a new CEO has delayed a deal so far, people familiar with the matter say. \u001d  This year, First Data has been streamlining its business lines, announcing in February that it would gradually exit its official-check and money-order business, which it described as providing \"unacceptable\" returns. The company announced Friday that its First Data International unit would buy Polcard SA, a Polish credit-card firm, for $325 million, as it continues to push into Central and Eastern Europe. Polcard has the largest network of electronic-card acceptance devices in Poland, including more than 58,000 terminals and 1,700 ATMs. First Data manages more than 11 million cards in Central Europe. \u001d  It isn't clear if a sale of First Data would affect its 49% stake in Chase Paymentech, which is one of the largest companies that processes credit-card transactions on behalf of merchants. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. owns 51% of Chase Paymentech. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 21:07 ET (01:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"286ba9197e6c1a8f4c6373a50f9aaa56","symR":["MAMA"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Mamma.com Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MAMA"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV"],"Story":"\u001d  Mamma.com Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=MAMA or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:36 ET (08:36 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"288e322a76f359caea01a863ad9c9718","symR":["NUM"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen MI Quality Income (NUM)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NUM"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen MI Quality Income (NUM): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NUM or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"28ab6ab793bd0308e0667bf3b7fa7575","symR":["BMS.LN","GB0000600931"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Braemar Seascope Group PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BMS.LN","GB0000600931"],"IndustryCodes":["TRS"],"Story":"\u001d  Braemar Seascope Group PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0000600931 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:23 ET (07:23 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"28f8234f3770d308804d446d8b9f405f","symR":["NKE"],"date":"2007-04-02","ret":[0.9997144],"ret5":[1.01907],"Headline":"WSJ(4/2) Nike Gets Back To Basics, Reinventing The T-Shirt","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-02T03:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NKE"],"IndustryCodes":["FOT","TEX","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Stephanie Kang \u001d  For years, a vast army of apparel designers at Nike Inc. has tinkered with the seemingly simple task of making a T-shirt. \u001d  The result was a cache of more than 30 different designs, often with only tiny differences -- shirt sleeves that hung an inch or two longer or bottom hems that were curved rather than straight. Some designs were skin-tight. Others hung loose like sacks. \u001d  For the past year, however, a design team at Nike has been seeking to end the T-shirt proliferation. The result is a garment that the company says will be a template for its T-shirts, no matter what color or fabric. In the new design, each shirt will have sleeves that hit the bicep in the same place, a neckline that resists stretching over time, and a fit that is consistent even after multiple washings. \u001d  \"At some point, you had to ask, did we really need all these?\" says Trevor Edwards, vice president of global brand and category management for Nike. \u001d  It's a question that's been asked a lot lately at the Beaverton, Ore., company. The new shirt is part of a companywide effort to simplify its product lines and focus on its most popular styles. For years, the company has flooded stores with thousands of variations on its famous \"Swoosh\" products, resulting in a vast array of products that were expensive to manufacture and keep track of and that often confused shoppers. \u001d  The new T-shirts, along with sleeveless versions, shorts and women's capri pants are the first pieces of a collection called \"Sports Essentials\" that will likely later include other basics like fleece hoodies and sports bras. The suggested retail price for the Sports Essentials crewneck T-shirt is $25; the shorts are $35. After the collection officially launches today, Nike will begin evaluating whether to phase out old versions. \u001d  The Sports Essentials project is part of a fiscal plan for the company to reach $23 billion in revenue by 2011 -- a boost of 54% from this year -- by focusing on fewer, high-return opportunities. \u001d  It also represents an attitude shift at the world's biggest sport-shoe and apparel company, where designers could count on being able to rejigger designs year after year. \"In the past,\" says Mr. Edwards, \"we focused more on the technology than the need of consumers.\" \u001d  In fact, most of Nike's sales come from just a few areas. Last year, 35% of Nike's footwear styles accounted for 95% of revenue. In apparel, 40% of styles drove 95% of total sales in 2006. While Air Jordan and Air Force 1 are among the best-selling sneaker franchises ever, other Nike products never gained a following and dragged down the company's results with their costs for design, development, transportation and storage. \u001d  \"They're realizing they don't need 10 to 15 kinds of Jordan shoes,\" says J.P. Morgan analyst Robert Samuels. \"They're really focusing on those things that are selling.\" \u001d  Nike isn't the only one following the less-is-more strategy. Columbia Sportswear Co. recently said it's streamlining the number of the styles for its wind breakers and other outdoor apparel, says Mr. Samuels. \u001d  Nike is also reorganizing to focus on its highest-revenue-generating categories: basketball, running, soccer, sport lifestyle, men's training and women's products. All six categories are under the Nike brand. Those areas are expected to account for about 75% of Nike's revenue this year. \u001d  The emphasis on six areas puts a longtime Nike sport like tennis on the corporate backburner. It's also a departure from Nike's longtime practice of scattering its design and marketing muscle across nearly the entire sporting-goods world. Tiger Woods, however, won't have to worry: He's part of Nike Golf, which, like the Jordan brand (which centers on hoops legend Michael Jordan), is a separate division of the company. \u001d  Nike has gone through shifts in the past. For instance, many senior Nike executives disagreed with the decision to give its Jordan brand its own hub of dedicated design and marketing staff in 1997, according to people familiar with the move. But the maneuver paid off, with the Jordan brand (which sells basketball and nonbasketball sportswear) grabbing some of the biggest revenue gains at the company, posting $750 million in 2006 sales, a double-digit jump from the year earlier. A similar move has also worked for Nike Skate -- which designs and markets skateboarding shoes -- albeit with far smaller gains. \u001d  Many Nike executives feel that focusing on fewer, high-return areas is a way for the company to connect more deeply with people who are devoted to a specific athletic field, such as basketball fanatics, soccer kids or yoga lovers. The Jordan brand and Nike Skate represent a precursor to this kind of thought. \u001d  For Sports Essentials, Nike's apparel group wanted to make the best possible T-shirt, market it aggressively so consumers would recognize it and be confident that it would always be available. \"What we're looking to do is evolve into a predictable business that's driven by key styles,\" says Roger Wyett, a longtime Nike executive who took the apparel helm in April 2006. \u001d  To do that, Mr. Wyett's group obsessed about design details. The group decided to use a fabric that combines cotton with a moisture-wicking material. Designers used flatter seams to reduce chafing while moving side seams back to reduce bulk on the sides of the shirt. Double-needle top stitching increased the durability of the neckline, which, in other designs, often gets stretched out. \u001d  The group also tested numerous T-shirt prototypes. Mr. Wyett says he saw 74 variations on the neckline alone. The tops come in 10 core colors, about double the typical palette. \u001d  For Mr. Wyett, it was a challenge to redesign what many consider an \"unglamorous\" product. \"The hardest assignment to do is something as simple as a T-shirt,\" he says. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 23:09 ET (03:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Joann S. Lublin \u001d  Many U.S. corporate directors are grumbling about complex new federal rules requiring more disclosure of executive pay, perquisites and retirement benefits. Yet a surprising number of major corporations are going beyond the requirements, offering investors additional details about compensation, in the name of improved transparency. \u001d  Nearly 30% of proxy statements filed so far this year contain supplemental pay information, estimates Mark Borges, a principal at Mercer Human Resource Consulting. El Paso Corp., Intel Corp., Corning Inc., EMC Corp. and Pfizer Inc. are among those disclosing more than the Securities and Exchange Commission requires. \u001d  The most common extra details: alternate summary compensation tables that typically include the initial value of 2006 equity grants; numerical performance targets; and potential conflicts of interest involving boards' pay consultants. \u001d  Though such moves are aimed at staving off investor complaints stemming from the SEC's confusing proxy rules, they could backfire by sowing suspicion. Enhanced disclosures \"may not ward off public criticism about excessive CEO pay,\" warns Connecticut Treasurer Denise Nappier, who oversees a $24 billion public-employee pension fund. \u001d  That is the case at El Paso. The Houston natural-gas producer and pipeline concern offers investors a one-page profile for each top officer featuring a photo, a biography, the initial value of 2006 equity grants and related pay highlights. Chief Executive Douglas L. Foshee wanted \"to be as transparent as possible,\" explains Bruce Connery, a vice president. \"It's meant to supplement, not take the place of, what's [required] in the proxy.\" \u001d  Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard law professor and El Paso investor who has clashed with the board, isn't impressed. He says the profiles don't comply with the SEC rules -- leaving out, for instance, total compensation -- and are more prominently placed than they should be. \u001d  Last year, Mr. Bebchuk sought to revise El Paso's corporate bylaws to require more disclosure about executive pensions. His proposed amendment received nearly 49% of the votes cast. Mr. Connery says the vote didn't prompt this year's additional disclosures. \u001d  Other businesses are exceeding the requirements by disclosing specific performance targets -- such as increasing revenue by 10% or recording earnings of $2 a share -- for executive bonuses or equity grants. The SEC allows companies to conceal such targets for competitive reasons, and nearly half of 100 big companies didn't disclose them, according to an analysis of 2007 proxies by consultants Watson Wyatt Worldwide. \u001d  EMC discloses some -- but not all -- of its targets. The Hopkinton, Mass., technology company says top officers earned their 2006 targeted bonuses because EMC achieved its earnings goal of 63 cents a share, excluding expenses for stock options. For 2007 targeted bonuses, EMC must increase per-share earnings by 18.5%, increase revenue by a set amount and boost free cash flow. \u001d  But EMC doesn't disclose the specific targets for executives to make money from restricted shares tied to performance hurdles. The proxy says only that the shares will start to vest in 2009 if EMC reaches \"a threshold cumulative EPS goal\" between 2006 and 2008, without revealing the goal. \u001d  Michael McCauley, corporate-governance director for Florida's State Board of Administration, applauds the specific disclosure about bonus targets. But he says that omitting the targets for the restricted shares means shareholders don't understand \"what performance is being incentivized.\" The Florida board manages about $135 billion of public-employee pension assets and owns about 9.8 million EMC shares. \u001d  Divulging the earnings target for the restricted shares would go beyond what EMC has told investors and might cause \"competitive harm,\" says Michael Gallant, an EMC spokesman. \u001d  The role played by board pay advisers represents another way that some companies are going the extra distance. In October, Ms. Nappier and officials of 12 other large pension funds wrote 25 big businesses seeking information about whether compensation consultants hired by directors had conflicts of interest. Activists fear a consulting firm won't give the board impartial advice about pay if the firm also advises management. The new disclosure rules don't address such conflicts. \u001d  Most of the 25 recipients, including Pfizer, agreed to disclose any additional work that the consultants do for the company. Pfizer's latest proxy goes further. It reveals that Frederic W. Cook & Co. was paid $184,555 for advising its board's compensation committee last year. The proxy also says Cook provided only one other item for the giant drug maker -- an executive-compensation survey that cost less than $5,000. Pfizer's 2006 proxy contained a similar description of that annual survey. \u001d  The company's latest proxy exceeds the SEC rules in other ways, such as specifying the value of equity grants made so far in 2007 and executives' target bonuses for this year. Pfizer did \"a very good job on disclosure\" this year, says Richard Ferlauto, director of pension investment policy for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. \u001d  Mr. Ferlauto was among the activists who last year criticized the compensation package for then-Chief Executive Henry \"Hank\" McKinnell. Ironically, the activists took advantage of Pfizer's voluntary proxy disclosure that he could have pocketed a lump sum of $83 million if he had retired at the end of 2005. Mr. McKinnell unexpectedly quit as CEO in July. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 19:48 ET (23:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

\u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Barclays PLC (BCS) intends to make cost cuts of more than GBP3 billion in its proposed merger with ABN Amro Holding NV (ABN), a move likely to lead to the loss of hundreds of jobs in the Dutch bank's investment banking operations in London, the Sunday Telegraph newspaper said without citing sources. \u001d  The two banks are nearing the final phase of negotiations, with Barclays expected to table an offer worth about EUR33 per share, or EUR60 billion, within the next two weeks, the report says. \u001d  Separately, the Sunday Times said Barclays chairman Marcus Agius is expected to stay on as deputy chairman of a combined group if the merger goes ahead. \u001d  Although a final decision has not been taken, such a position would put Agius in a pivotal role and well placed to take over as chairman within a couple of years of a merger's completion, the report says without citing sources. \u001d  A Barclays spokesman declined comment Sunday. \b \u001d  Newspaper

These days, he is landing a different catch: cash payments from foreign rivals. \u001d  Mr. Williams, executive director of the Southern Shrimp Alliance, co-founded the group in 2002 to help American shrimp fishermen fight competition posed by cheap, pond-raised shrimp from Asia and Latin America. The alliance petitioned the U.S. government to slap tariffs on shrimp imports from six countries at the end of 2003, arguing they were dumping crustaceans in the U.S. at unfairly low prices. \u001d  But after winning the case -- which both raised tariffs and eventually netted $100 million in compensation for U.S. shrimpers -- Mr. Williams and his alliance wanted even more. With the help of their New York law firm, the shrimpers filed a special appeal with the U.S. government that threatened the overseas shrimp producers with even higher tariffs. The action spooked more than 100 foreign shrimp suppliers into paying millions of dollars to the U.S. shrimp alliance in return for its promise to drop the action. \u001d  The alliance says it is using the money to help the U.S. industry recover from a flood of cheap imports. The payouts have funded lawyers to spearhead trade actions and pay lobbyists to rally government support for the industry, among other priorities. \u001d  \"We now have a voice we never had before,\" Mr. Williams says. \u001d  The practice has sparked a fight over the shrimp alliance's winnings, as well as concern that U.S. shrimpers unjustly exploited laws designed to protect domestic businesses from unfair trading practices. \"We know it's unfair, but have to play the game,\" said Vuong Quang Khanh, head of international sales for Can Tho Import Export Seafood Joint Stock Co., a Vietnamese shrimp exporter that says it paid $68,000 to the shrimp alliance. \u001d  Dan Ikenson of the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank, says, \"There's something unseemly about the domestic industry extorting large sums of money from foreign shrimp producers.\" \u001d  For nearly 100 years, U.S. law has protected domestic businesses from aggressively low-priced imports. Current law allows domestic businesses to seek tariffs to mitigate the price advantages of foreign competitors when they ship to the U.S. at below production costs in order to grab market share. \u001d  More controversial is the Byrd amendment, which since 2000 has enabled the government to funnel antidumping tariffs to U.S. companies that had complained about low-priced imports. That law is set to be abolished in October, because the World Trade Organization said it punished exporters twice, hitting them with tariffs and then handing over the money to rivals. \u001d  Critics fear the shrimp alliance's tactics will point the way for other enterprising U.S. industries to win payments from overseas competitors, even after the Byrd amendment expires. \u001d  Mr. Williams, 56 years old, grew up in a North Carolina coastal fishing community and moved to Florida to work as a boat hand before buying his own vessels in the 1970s. Domestic industry was thriving, with more than 5,000 American shrimp trawlers plying the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean, from the Carolinas down to Florida. \u001d  In Tarpon Springs, a long line of boats, their outriggers bristling above the waterline, tied up along the Anclote River, which feeds into the Gulf of Mexico. \"There was a lot of competition, but everyone made money,\" Mr. Williams recalls. \u001d  Changes were afoot. Farmers in Asia and Latin America, taking advantage of their regions' warm climate and cheap land and labor, began raising shrimp in ponds carved out of rice paddies or coastal mangroves. Unlike American shrimpers, who spent weeks at a time on open seas, the foreign producers raised shrimp larvae in carefully controlled conditions. The four-month cycle allowed for three harvests a year. By the 1990s, water-filtering and other technological advances enabled some foreign shrimpers to export at prices far below market prices in the U.S. \u001d  The volume of imported shrimp in the U.S. surged between 2000 and 2004, and prices tumbled by 39%, according to data of the U.S. government and International Trade Commission. Today foreign producers provide almost 90% of the shrimp eaten by Americans each year. \u001d  As shrimp prices fell, Mr. Williams faced a cash crunch, and had trouble making debt payments, especially on his boats. He canceled his medical insurance and turned over his wife's Chevy Suburban to the dealer because he couldn't make the final year of payments. He began looking for ways to fight back. \u001d  In mid-2002, at a hotel outside New Orleans, Mr. Williams and fellow shrimpers convened the first of several strategy sessions, bringing together boat operators and processors from eight coastal states across the South. \u001d  The group agreed to lodge a \"dumping\" complaint that would trigger an investigation by the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission. If successful, the case would lead to tariffs on shrimp imports. Under the Byrd amendment, revenues from the tariffs would go to U.S. shrimpers and processors. \u001d  The shrimpers, which had organized into the Southern Shrimp Alliance, selected New York law firm Dewey Ballantine LLP to explore whether a case could be won. On Dec. 31, 2003, the firm delivered 148,800 pages of petitions and supporting documents in two vans to the Commerce Department and ITC. The petitions cited imports from Brazil, China, Ecuador, India, Thailand and Vietnam. \u001d  In February 2005, the Commerce Department imposed tariffs ranging from 3.5% to more than 100% of the value of shrimp imports from those countries. For Mr. Williams and the other shrimpers, the decision meant the price advantages of foreign competitors stood to be eroded. It also opened the prospect that Byrd money would soon flow. \u001d  Indeed, later in 2006, hundreds of shrimpers and processors would divvy up $100 million under the Byrd law. But as 2005 unfolded, alliance leaders worried shrimp prices were still too low and imports high. Moreover, at the end of 2005, Congress was moving to repeal the Byrd amendment -- and end the fishermen's new source of cash. \u001d  Mr. Williams and other alliance members decided to turn up the heat on foreign competitors. The goal was to persuade Commerce to raise tariffs or to win additional concessions outside the trade case. \u001d  Under U.S. law, any party in a dumping case can seek a Commerce Department review of tariff levels at the annual anniversary of the imposition of the tariffs. Such a request can be withdrawn within 90 days, ending the government review. For U.S. shrimpers, the right to withdraw would serve as critical leverage in negotiations with overseas competitors. \u001d  In February 2006, the first anniversary of the shrimp tariffs, the alliance's lawyers filed a sweeping review request, citing some 800 foreign producers and processors. The scope caught many foreign producers off guard. \u001d  \"I've never seen anything done on this scale, that's for sure,\" says Ken Pierce, a partner at Vinson & Elkins LLP, who represents shrimp producers in Thailand and Vietnam. \u001d  That request, along with another that the Commerce Department ultimately rejected, added to the uncertainty facing foreign exporters. Rather than fight, many quickly offered to settle with the alliance. \u001d  Among the first was Charoen Pokphand Foods PCL, a Thai agribusiness which in 2004 exported $900 million in shrimp to the U.S. Mr. Pierce, CP Foods' lawyer, feared the deck was stacked against his clients. \u001d  Bradford Ward of Dewey Ballantine says the alliance was not interested only in money. The group wanted foreign producers to stop using antibiotics that were banned in the U.S. in its shrimp ponds. It wanted to prevent shrimp from being shipped through third countries, or mislabeled in the country of origin, in an effort to skirt the U.S. tariffs. \u001d  Mr. Ward says lawyers for the overseas producers brought up cash settlements first. \"[They] approached us and, in essence, said, 'What would it cost?'\" he says. \u001d  In May 2006, CP Foods agreed to pay a cash settlement to the alliance, in return for its withdrawal of the company from the tariff review-request list. The company also agreed to address food-safety and transshipment concerns. \u001d  CP Foods wasn't the first firm to settle, but the compromise by such a major player set the stage for others to follow suit. \u001d  Can Tho Import Export, or CASEAMEX, had already seen profit margins shrink on its imports to the U.S. after getting hit with a 4.57% tariff in 2005. To fend off further tariffs, it agreed to pay the shrimp alliance the equivalent of 1.5% of its U.S. shrimp sales in 2006. The payout was expected to rise to 3% over the next three years. \u001d  The foreign shrimpers admitted no wrongdoing, but said they settled with the alliance to eliminate market uncertainties. \"It's very risky doing business in a place where you don't know what the price and the value of the tariff will be,\" said Nguyen Hoang Phuong, a director at Vietnam's Ut Xi Aquatic Products Processing Corp. He said his company paid the alliance because it needed to know how to price U.S.-bound shrimp. \u001d  Eventually, Mr. Williams's group reached settlements involving cash payments with 104 foreign shrimp companies. Unlike the Byrd money, which was divided among individual shrimp producers and processors, the settlement payments went to the shrimp alliance. The alliance and foreign exporters declined to give dollar figures. \u001d  Stephen Claeys, Commerce's deputy assistant secretary for antidumping, says the department was not party to the settlements. \"That was purely an agreement between private parties,\" he says. \u001d  That hasn't stopped free-trade advocates from decrying the deals as a tax on the shrimp-eating public. Wally Stevens, head of the American Seafood Distributors Association, which represents U.S. importers of seafood, says the payments amount to \"extortion.\" \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 23:04 ET (03:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4075890068ff0d878529cda8968d09a3","symR":["PCW.XE","DE0006910904"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for PC-Ware Info Technologies AG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PCW.XE","DE0006910904"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX"],"Story":"\u001d  PC-Ware Info Technologies AG: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0006910904 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:51 ET (08:51 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"40c9259228dd12faa8c6c92a82dfa3e1","symR":["FEO"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for First Trust Aberdeen Emerging Opp Fund","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FEO"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  First Trust Aberdeen Emerging Opp Fund: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=FEO or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"40f874ecd35c0bad2a7522104ac5c622","symR":["RB.LN","GB0007278715"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Reckitt Benckiser Plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RB.LN","GB0007278715"],"IndustryCodes":["HPN","HPR","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  Reckitt Benckiser Plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0007278715 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:04 ET (09:04 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"411e6466f6e7517ea2737607d75fbd75","symR":["ALE"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for ALLETE, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ALE"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  ALLETE, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=ALE or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:01 ET (07:01 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"412acab3c1bc8402343c830302421dcb","symR":["POT.NZ","NZPOTE0001S4"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": S&P: Port Of Tauranga Rtgs Unaffected By End To Merger>POT.NZ","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T23:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POT.NZ","NZPOTE0001S4"],"IndustryCodes":["TRS","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's: \b \u001d  MELBOURNE (Standard & Poor's) April 2, 2007--Standard & Poor's Ratings Services today said that Port of Tauranga Ltd.'s (POT; BBB+/Stable/A-2) withdrawal from formal merger discussions with Ports of Auckland (POA; unrated) has no immediate impact on the ratings or outlook on POT.

Nevertheless, the ratings on POT will continue to be underpinned by the company's established regional market position as New Zealand's largest bulk-export port and second-largest container port, the port's moderate diversification from coal and container trade, and POT's moderate financial profile. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 19:02 ET (23:02 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"412d52ae54d816ad9349f0e45bf1c0f6","symR":["SOO.LN","GB0007922114"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Southampton Leisure Holdings PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SOO.LN","GB0007922114"],"IndustryCodes":["RCS"],"Story":"\u001d  Southampton Leisure Holdings PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0007922114 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:17 ET (09:17 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"414642be3caf72cbd59d783400bc68db","symR":["YHOO","US9843321061"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Yahoo, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["YHOO","US9843321061"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\u001d  Yahoo, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=YHOO or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:56 ET (09:56 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"41b548e69400ca0ab20fc795bfd72cbf","symR":["MEX.FR","FR0010187096"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Meilleurtaux","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MEX.FR","FR0010187096"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\u001d  Meilleurtaux: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=FR0010187096 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:39 ET (08:39 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"41c05037b0b363cc7ea692d149a1fc59","symR":["JNJ","PFE","US4781601046","US7170811035"],"date":"2007-04-02","ret":[1.008985,1.013023,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.030283,1.044199,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(4/2) Ads For Pfizer's Celebrex To Return To TV","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-02T00:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JNJ","PFE","US4781601046","US7170811035"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","MDV","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \u001d  CELEBREX ADS to return \b \u001d  Pfizer will run the first TV ads for arthritis-pain drug Celebrex since it was tied to heart risks in 2004. \u001d  A two-and-a-half-minute commercial to begin airing today on ABC discusses the safety risks of Celebrex and similar pain relievers, then states the benefits of using the drug.

Berman, Valerie Bauerlein and Robin Sidel \u001d  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. is in late-stage negotiations to purchase credit-card and payments processor First Data Corp. for more than $24 billion, people familiar with the matter said, marking the latest in a string of leveraged buyouts of established U.S. corporations. \u001d  KKR was hoping to make an official announcement over the next few days, these people said. The exact purchase price couldn't be learned yesterday, though two people described the price as a premium of at least 20% to First Data's market capitalization of about $20 billion. As in any large-scale negotiation, talks could falter at the last moment, as both sides jockey over final terms. \u001d  A spokesman for KKR declined comment. First Data was unavailable for comment. \u001d  A potential deal for First Data reflects KKR's voracious appetite but also shows how flush private-equity firms are in an environment of vast and accessible funding. Even a year ago, a $24 billion offer by a private-equity firm would have been considered a stretch. But there have been a spate of large companies that have been taken private recently by buyout firms, who sometimes team up, thereby sharing the risk and reward. \u001d  Blackstone Group, which recently filed documents with regulators for an initial public offering, is paying $23 billion for Equity Office Properties and assuming $16 billion of debt. Bain Capital, KKR and Merrill Lynch & Co. teamed up to pay $21 billion and assume $11.7 billion in debt to acquire hospital operator HCA Inc. in 2006. In the first quarter, there were $50 billion in loans for leveraged buyouts, according to Reuters Loan Pricing Corp., a pace on track to put 2007 far ahead of the record-setting 2006. \u001d  The teaming up of private-equity firms in what is known as club deals has attracted the scrutiny of the Justice Department, which is trying to determine whether these firms are behaving in an anticompetitive manner. Indeed, one notable aspect in the bidding for First Data is that KKR appears to be acting alone. That reflects confidence on the part of KKR, which led the most famous leveraged buyout of all time, the $25 billion takeover in 1988 of RJR Nabisco, a deal that was made into a best-selling book and movie but whose financial returns proved anemic. \u001d  One reason First Data may be attractive to KKR is that processing companies have good cash flow, a key factor private-equity firms want in a business. First Data's operations underpin large parts of the nation's banking system as it processes checks, automated teller-machine, debit cards and credit-card transactions. The company posted revenue of $7.08 billion last year and net income of $1.51 billion. Many in the stock market have long expected a leveraged buyout of the Greenwood Village, Colo., company, especially after it separated its faster-growing Western Union payment-transfer business last year and has struggled to find a chief executive officer to succeed Henry C. \"Ric\" Duques. \u001d  At 4 p.m. composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of First Data rose 44 cents, or 1.7%, to $26.90. \u001d  First Data was split off from American Express Co. in 1992 as an information-processing company that would handle billions of credit-card and other transactions for third parties. The company has struggled in recent years to organize its international, commercial and retail-processing units in a compelling way, amid turmoil in the CEO suite. \u001d  Like the financial institutions that issue credit cards, card-processing companies are grappling with a slowdown in growth. American wallets are already stuffed with cards and it can be difficult to convince consumers that they need another one. \u001d  At the same time, big banks are increasingly handling some of their own card processing as a way to cut costs. In February, First Data said that three of its bank customers, including Wells Fargo & Co., had decided to bring some of their debit-card processing in-house. First Data didn't name the other two banks, but Wall Street analysts said those moves would likely jeopardize First Data's goal to increase revenue by 8% in 2008. \u001d  Mr. Duques, 63 years old, ran the company for 10 years until he handed the reins to Charles Fote in 2002. Mr. Fote stepped down in 2005 after overseeing an aggressive strategy that alienated some customers and investors. Mr. Duques agreed to step back in for two years to reorganize the company's remaining businesses and cut operating costs. No successor has been named and Mr. Duques's two-year window closes later this year, and the lack of a new CEO has delayed a deal so far, people familiar with the matter say. \u001d  This year, First Data has been streamlining its business offerings, announcing in February that it would gradually exit its official-check and money-order business, which it described as providing \"unacceptable\" returns. The company announced Friday that its First Data International unit would buy Polcard SA, a Polish credit-card firm, for $325 million, as it continues to push into Central and Eastern Europe. \u001d  It isn't clear if a sale of First Data would affect its 49% stake in Chase Paymentech, which is one of the largest companies that processes credit-card transactions on behalf of merchants. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. owns 51% of Chase Paymentech. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 22:45 ET (02:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4289244d8df94425a8d0b0452e2d5382","symR":["NRK"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen Insured NY Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NRK)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NRK"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen Insured NY Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NRK): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NRK or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:58 ET (08:58 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"42c9341888fef00d797a8e84a4343e38","symR":["BBND","CLWR"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(4/2) Tech Revival Keeps IPO Market Bubbling","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T23:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BBND","CLWR"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Yvonne Ball \u001d  Despite a turbulent start, the market for new issues remained buoyant last month, placing it on track for a strong second quarter. \u001d  Last week's seven stock-market debutantes took the number of companies that went public in March to 18, excluding special-purpose acquisition companies and real-estate investment trusts. That is twice as many as a year earlier, when only nine deals were priced. \u001d  The 18 IPOs raised $2.9 billion, according to Dealogic. That is up from $2 billion in March 2006, though down from the $4.6 billion raised by February's 20 IPOs, which included one for hedge fund Fortress Investment Group. \u001d  The March deals raised the total for the first quarter to 48, spurred by a revitalized technology sector that accounted for six deals in March and 12 for the quarter. \u001d  \"A welcome sign to technology investors was the re-emergence of several technology deals that went public in the first quarter, and the IPO pipeline for technology stocks looks strong going into the second quarter,\" said Scott Sweet, managing director of IPO Boutique.com, an IPO-research service near Tampa. \u001d  Despite some early-March volatility, induced by a selloff in Chinese stocks, the IPO calendar remained largely intact for the month. There was one withdrawal, by OncoGenex Technologies Inc., a small health-care company. \u001d  David Topper, co-head of equity capital markets at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s securities unit, said the high level of cash being invested in stocks helped cushion the impact of the China-led selloff. \u001d  \"One factor that has offset the recent volatility has been the tremendous amount of liquidity in the equity market,\" Mr. Topper said. \u001d  The shaky markets, however, may have affected investor demand for some companies that did go public. The average one-day return for the 18 IPOs in March was 7.8%, below the February average of 13.7% or the 10.6% of March 2006. \u001d  Two of the best performers last month were technology stock BigBand Networks Inc. and investment company FCStone Group Inc. BigBand Networks surged 31% on its debut and closed Friday at $18.01, 39% above its IPO price of $13. FCStone soared 30% on its first day and closed Friday at $37.32, a gain of 56% from its $24 offer price. \u001d  But one of highest-profile deals, for wireless-broadband company Clearwire Corp., was among the most disappointing. The stock fell 1.5% on its first day of trading and is languishing 18% below its $25 IPO price, at $20.47. \u001d  Overall, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1% in March, while the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.2%. \u001d  \"The IPO market is company-specific,\" said Linda Killian, manager of Renaissance Capital LLC's IPO Plus Fund in Greenwich, Conn. \"It is to some extent a function of the broader market, but the correlation is not that great, simply because investors in IPOs will look at the individual deals. The IPO market is correlated mostly strongly with the overall market in periods of real booms or busts. For example, IPO investors in the late 1990s were buying the momentum. Now they are buying the individual companies.\" \u001d  The technology sector is expected to account for an increasing number of IPOs in the second quarter, following a drought in technology stocks in the past three to four years, Ms. Killian said. \u001d  \"Those are the companies that have recently been driving up the returns in the market,\" she said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 19:50 ET (23:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"42d0270b978f2b72aa4732a8d4d462a6","symR":["NVX"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen CA Dividend Adv Muni Fund 2 (NVX)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NVX"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen CA Dividend Adv Muni Fund 2 (NVX): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NVX or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:52 ET (08:52 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"430a24327fbb9bc1aa7b0838fb8f2b6d","symR":["BIW"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BIW Limited","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BIW"],"IndustryCodes":["WAT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  BIW Limited: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BIW or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:16 ET (07:16 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"431a2f55413d94c89978a4293de0aace","symR":["ABF.UN.T","CA0454991005"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": TorQuest Issued Additional Units Of Associated Brands Income Fund>","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T14:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABF.UN.T","CA0454991005"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP"],"Story":"\bTORONTO, March 30 /CNW/ - TorQuest Partners Inc. (\"TorQuest Partners\") announced today that two of its funds, TorQuest Partners Value Fund L.P. and TorQuest Partners Value Fund (Parallel Partnership No. 1), L.P. (together, the \"TorQuest Funds\"), have received, in aggregate, an additional 585,629 units (the \"Units\") of Associated Brands Income Fund (the \"Fund\"). The Units were issued to the TorQuest Funds today in satisfaction of interest accrued from September 30, 2006 to March, 29, 2007 on the $10 million principal amount of 9% subordinated exchangeable debentures (the \"Exchangeable Debentures\") of Associated Brands Holdings Limited Partnership held by the TorQuest Funds, in accordance with the terms of the Exchangeable Debentures. \b \bThe Units are being held for investment purposes. The TorQuest Funds may acquire additional units of the Fund from time to time, in accordance with applicable laws, or be issued additional units of the Fund in satisfaction of future interest payments on the Exchangeable Debentures. This press release is being issued as required under the early warning requirements of applicable securities laws. As previously announced by the Fund on March 18, 2007, a fund managed by an affiliate of TorQuest Partners entered into an agreement with the Fund to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions of that agreement, 100% of the Fund's operating subsidiaries. \b \bPrior to the issuance of Units today, the TorQuest Funds owned 892,912 units of the Fund, which had previously been issued by the Fund to the TorQuest Funds. After giving effect to the issuance of the Units today, the TorQuest Funds will own approximately 1,478,541 units of the Fund, representing approximately 10.1% of all of the issued and outstanding units of the Fund (based on 14,696,162 units outstanding as at March 30, 2007). In addition, the Exchangeable Debentures held by the TorQuest Funds are exchangeable, at various exercise prices, for an aggregate of 6,895,237 units of the Fund. If all of the Exchangeable Debentures held by the TorQuest Funds were exchanged into units of the Fund, the TorQuest Funds would hold an aggregate of 8,373,778 units of the Fund, representing approximately 38.8% of all of the issued and outstanding units of the Fund (based on 14,696,162 units outstanding as at March 30, 2007 and assuming the exchange of all of the Exchangeable Debentures held by the TorQuest Funds). \b \bThe TorQuest Funds own and exercise control over the units of the Fund and the Exchangeable Debentures held by them and are not acting with any joint actor in connection with the receipt or ownership of such units and Exchangeable Debentures. \b \bTorQuest Partners \b \bFounded in 2002, TorQuest Partners is a Canadian-based manager of private equity funds.

There are no significant differences between the carrying value of these financial instruments and their estimated fair values. There are no unusual off-balance sheet arrangements and the Trust does not use any financial instruments such as derivatives. Of the Trust's financial instruments, only accounts receivable represents credit risk, and management views the credit risk related to accounts receivable as minimal. The operating loan and the extendible revolving term loan bear interest at a floating interest rate. Therefore, the extent that the Trust borrows under these facilities, the Trust is at risk to rising interest rates. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bOutlook \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bThe outlook for the Trust is positive. Demand for services has remained strong to date in 2007, and Deepwell implemented a general price increase of approximately 10 percent on processing fees on January 1, 2007. \b \bThe addition of the second well and solids treatment pad at the Grande Cache facility should add to capacity and efficiency, and the facility was back up to full operations on February 1, 2007, following the outage of the vacuum truck unloading system from the December 7, 2006 fire. In addition, Deepwell received approval from the EUB to increase wellhead pressure at the second well at Grande Cache. The cost to upgrade equipment for the increased operating pressure is estimated at approximately $100,000, and the upgrades were put into service on March 26, 2007. Assuming that the upgraded Grande Cache facility operates at full capacity, Deepwell estimates that the increase in capacity can result in additional annualized EBITDA of approximately $400,000. \b \bDeepwell received approval from the EUB for a second Class Ib disposal well at its Rycroft facility. A second well adds significant capacity without requiring an immediate increase in staff, or a significant investment in infrastructure at the facility site. Tests indicate that the well will increase injection capacity at Rycroft by approximately 40 percent. Construction of a 1.2 km pipeline to the well will commence as soon as crews and equipment are available. Costs to complete the project are estimated at approximately $900,000. Assuming completion of the pipeline and that the expanded Rycroft facility operates at full capacity, Deepwell estimates that the increase in capacity provided by the second well can result in additional annualized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of approximately $800,000. \b \bDeepwell is also in the final stages of the EUB approval process for its fourth facility, near Claresholm, Alberta. Deepwell believes that it is nearing approval of the facility, although no date for approval has been provided by the EUB. Construction commencement cannot be confirmed at this time, but Deepwell remains optimistic that construction of the facility will be completed during 2007. \b \bIn addition, Deepwell owns rights to a location and disposal well for future expansion after Claresholm, and anticipates that an application for approval of this facility may be submitted to the EUB in the second quarter of 2007. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bCritical accounting estimates \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bManagement is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods. The most significant estimates relate to depreciation, amortization, asset retirement obligations, and accretion. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The consolidated financial statements have, in management's opinion, been properly prepared using careful judgment with reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the Trust's

The formal Notice of Meeting will be forwarded to shareholders by April 12, 2007 together with the Company's Annual Report. The Record Date is May 18, 2007. Excerpts from the Management's Discussion and Analysis, and the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations and Statements of Cash Flows are included below. \b \bComplete copies of these documents are available on the Company's website www.motogoldmines.com. \b \bNominated adviser for the purposes of AIM: RFC Corporate Finance Ltd \b \bContact: Stephen Allen \b \bMoto Goldmines Limited \b \bManagement's Discussion and Analysis \b \bFor the year ended December 31, 2006 \b \bThe following discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations of Moto Goldmines Limited is presented as of March 28, 2007. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report for the 12 month period ended December 31, 2006. Moto Goldmines Limited's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. All amounts in the discussion are in Australian dollars unless otherwise stated. \b \bMoto Goldmines Limited (\"the Company\", formerly King Products Inc.) is continued under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). Hereinafter the consolidated group comprising Moto Goldmines Limited and its subsidiaries is referred to as \"the Group\". By an agreement dated 23 December 2004 \b \bKing Products Inc. (\"King\") and Moto Goldmines Limited (an Australian incorporated company, \"Moto Australia\") agreed to combine the companies. The combination was completed on May 26, 2005 pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under Australian law. Under the terms of the scheme of arrangement King became the Canadian parent company of Moto Australia and King changed its name to Moto Goldmines Limited. \b \bThe Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared to reflect the combination occurring on May 26, 2005 and are based on a business combination under the purchase method, applying reverse takeover accounting. As a result of the combination, control of King passed to the shareholders of Moto Australia. Under reverse takeover accounting, Moto Australia is deemed to be the acquirer and the continuing entity. The financial statements of the combined entity are issued under the name of the legal parent, Moto Goldmines Limited, but are considered to be a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary, Moto Australia. \b \bUpon completion of the business combination, the Company elected to adopt the financial year-end of King Products, resulting in a change of the financial year-end from June 30 to December 31. Consequently comparative figures are as at and for the 6 months ended June 30, 2006. \b \bThe Company's securities are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange's AIM market. \b \bSummary \b \bMoto Goldmines Limited is a gold exploration and development company listed on the TSX and the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (\"AIM\"). \b \bDuring the 12 month period ended December 31, 2006 the principal focus of the Company was to progress the Moto Gold Project in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of Congo from advanced exploration and pre-feasibility through to a definitive feasibility and project pre-development. \b \bAt the corporate level, the following significant events occurred: \b \b \b    << \b        -  Mr Mark Arnesen joined the Company's Board of Directors in the \b           position of Finance Director and Chief Financial Officer and will \b           have principal responsibility for all financial and financing \b           aspects of the development of the Moto Gold Project.

(Nikkei)--Sizzling demand for passenger cars in India is likely to help Suzuki Motor Corp.'s (7269.TO) new-car sales there roar past those in Japan in fiscal 2007, the Nikkei reported in its Saturday morning edition. \u001d  The automaker has seen domestic sales stagnate, selling 594,000 new cars between April 2006 and February 2007, down 2.7% on the year. The fall was blamed on cuts in minivehicle output implemented to boost production of cars for export. \u001d  On the other hand, Suzuki's Indian subsidiary, Maruti Udyog Ltd., saw sales surge 22.6% to 571,000 cars during the same period, according to an Indian automobile association. The difference between the two markets came to a mere 23,000 units, with the gap likely to shrink further with the inclusion of figures for March, the last month of fiscal 2006. \u001d  With Suzuki's domestic sales expected to remain in the doldrums, it seems almost certain that its Indian sales will exceed those in Japan. \u001d  Maruti, which commands a roughly 50% share of the Indian passenger car market, has to date specialized in minicars ranging from 800cc to 1,000cc. But in response to the growing ranks of affluent customers resulting from India's economic growth, Maruti has gone on the offensive with midsize cars, and will soon launch its global strategic SX4 model. \u001d  In addition, Maruti intends to have a network of 600 dealerships by 2010, up 50% from the current 405. \u001d  In February, Suzuki began full-scale operations at a second Indian plant, churning out around 100,000 units a year of its mainstay Swift model. By 2010, the automaker intends to spend an additional Y200 billion to double production capacity on the subcontinent to 1 million cars a year. It predicts that Maruti can keep posting double-digit increases in sales volume. \u001d  Meanwhile, domestic demand is expected to slip 2% in fiscal 2007, registering the second annual drop in a row, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. With its reduced minivehicle output likely to continue, Suzuki expects to see its sales decline 3% on a calendar-year basis. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 18:21 ET (22:21

Berman, Valerie Bauerlein and Robin Sidel \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. is in late-stage negotiations to purchase credit-card and payments processor First Data Corp. for more than $24 billion, people familiar with the matter said, marking the latest in a string of leveraged buyouts of established U.S. corporations. \u001d  KKR was hoping to make an official announcement over the next few days, these people said. The exact purchase price couldn't be learned Sunday, though two people described the price as a premium of at least 20% to First Data's market capitalization of about $20 billion. As in any large-scale negotiation, talks could falter at the last moment, as both sides jockey over final terms. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  A spokesman for KKR declined comment. First Data was unavailable for comment. \u001d  A potential deal for First Data reflects KKR's voracious appetite but also shows how flush private-equity firms are in an environment of vast and accessible funding. Even a year ago, a $24 billion offer by a private-equity firm would have been considered a stretch. But there have been a spate of large companies that have been taken private recently by buyout firms, who sometimes team up, thereby sharing the risk and reward. \u001d  Blackstone Group, which recently filed documents with regulators for an initial public offering, is paying $23 billion for Equity Office Properties and assuming $16 billion of debt. Bain Capital, KKR and Merrill Lynch & Co. teamed up to pay $21 billion and assume $11.7 billion in debt to acquire hospital operator HCA Inc. in 2006. In the first quarter, there were $50 billion in loans for leveraged buyouts, according to Reuters Loan Pricing Corp., a pace on track to put 2007 far ahead of the record-setting 2006. \u001d  The teaming up of private-equity firms in what is known as club deals has attracted the scrutiny of the Justice Department, which is trying to determine whether these firms are behaving in an anticompetitive manner. Indeed, one notable aspect in the bidding for First Data is that KKR appears to be acting alone. That reflects confidence on the part of KKR, which led the most famous leveraged buyout of all time, the $25 billion takeover in 1988 of RJR Nabisco, a deal that was made into a best-selling book and movie but whose financial returns proved anemic. \u001d  One reason First Data may be attractive to KKR is that processing companies have good cash flow, a key factor private-equity firms want in a business. First Data's operations underpin large parts of the nation's banking system as it processes checks, automated teller-machine, debit cards and credit-card transactions. The company posted revenue of $7.08 billion last year and net income of $1.51 billion. Many in the stock market have long expected a leveraged buyout of the Greenwood Village, Colo., company, especially after it separated its faster-growing Western Union payment-transfer business last year and has struggled to find a chief executive officer to succeed Henry C. \"Ric\" Duques. \u001d  At 4 p.m. composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of First Data rose 44 cents, or 1.7%, to $26.90. \u001d  First Data was split off from American Express Co. in 1992 as an information-processing company that would handle billions of credit-card and other transactions for third parties. The company has struggled in recent years to organize its international, commercial and retail-processing units in a compelling way, amid turmoil in the CEO suite. \u001d  Like the financial institutions that issue credit cards, card-processing companies are grappling with a slowdown in growth. American wallets are already stuffed with cards and it can be difficult to convince consumers that they need another one. \u001d  At the same time, big banks are increasingly handling some of their own card processing as a way to cut costs. In February, First Data said that three of its bank customers, including Wells Fargo & Co., had decided to bring some of their debit-card processing in-house. First Data didn't name the other two banks, but Wall Street analysts said those moves would likely jeopardize First Data's goal to increase revenue by 8% in 2008. \u001d  Mr. Duques, 63 years old, ran the company for 10 years until he handed the reins to Charles Fote in 2002. Mr. Fote stepped down in 2005 after overseeing an aggressive strategy that alienated some customers and investors. Mr. Duques agreed to step back in for two years to reorganize the company's remaining businesses and cut operating costs. No successor has been named and Mr. Duques's two-year window closes later this year. The lack of a new CEO has delayed a deal so far, people familiar with the matter say. \u001d  This year, First Data has been streamlining its business lines, announcing in February that it would gradually exit its official-check and money-order business, which it described as providing \"unacceptable\" returns. The company announced Friday that its First Data International unit would buy Polcard SA, a Polish credit-card firm, for $325 million, as it continues to push into Central and Eastern Europe. \u001d  It isn't clear if a sale of First Data would affect its 49% stake in Chase Paymentech, which is one of the largest companies that processes credit-card transactions on behalf of merchants. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. owns 51% of Chase Paymentech. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 21:11 ET (01:11 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

Collins & Aikman Corp. (CKCRQ) plant in Toronto and said they won't leave until the Michigan-based auto parts supplier agrees to pay severance to 200 workers. \u001d  Doors were barricaded Saturday and about 100 workers inside were preventing production at the plant, which is scheduled to close at the end of July. \u001d  Bob Chernecki, assistant to the Canadian Auto Workers' president, said the company told workers the U.S. operations are refusing to release the money for severance. \u001d  Southfield-based Collins & Aikman said it is aware of the situation and was trying to work toward a resolution. \u001d  \"We are in a continuing dialogue with CAW and our customers to see if we can work constructively and cooperatively,\" said spokesman David Youngman, who noted the company has one week to pay severance. \u001d  Chernecki said there were a few hundred workers outside the plant as well. He said the purpose of the occupation was to force the company into complying with a previous agreement to pay severance. \u001d  \"They have absolutely every obligation, lawful and otherwise, including an agreement with us, our union - CAW, to pay that severance out,\" Chernecki said. \u001d  Collins & Aikman filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May 2005. In November 2006, the company said it expected to sell part or all of its operations in an effort to get the most money to repay creditors and save as many jobs as possible. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones

\u001d  LOS ANGELES (AP)--Stars-on-ice Will Ferrell and Jon Heder took the box office gold for the weekend. \u001d  Paramount and DreamWorks' \"Blades of Glory,\" with Ferrell and Heder playing figure-skating rivals who become the sport's first men's pair, debuted as the No. 1 movie with $33 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. \u001d  Disney's animated adventure \"Meet the Robinsons,\" about the time-traveling journey of a brilliant but lonely orphan, debuted in second place with $25.1 million. \u001d  The previous weekend's top movie - the Warner Bros. animated tale \"TMNT,\" a revival of the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle\" franchise - slipped to fourth place with $9.2 million, down a steep 62% from its $24.3 million debut. \"TMNT\" raised its 10-day total to $38.4 million. \u001d  After a monthlong surge, the overall box office declined. The top 12 movies took in $115 million, down 13% from the same weekend last year, when \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" opened with $68 million. \u001d  \"This is still a good weekend, a pretty healthy one-two punch with `Blades of Glory' and `Meet the Robinsons' at the top,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Media By Numbers. \u001d  Movie attendance is up 4% so far this year, Dergarabedian said. \u001d  Teaming with \"Napoleon Dynamite\" star Heder on \"Blades of Glory,\" Ferrell scored the second-best opening of his career, behind last summer's \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,\" which took in $47 million in its first weekend. \u001d  \"It starts with a great concept, and the whole picture was cast so well,\" said DreamWorks spokesman Marvin Levy. \"Another part of the surprise was, we got a ton of very, very good reviews.\" \u001d  \"Meet the Robinsons\" played in about 3,400 theaters and did especially well in a 3-D version at 600 cinemas, said Chuck Viane, head of distribution for Disney. The studio did not have a precise breakdown, but cinemas reported that screens playing the 3-D version pulled in about double the grosses of theaters running the regular 2-D version, Viane said. \u001d  Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Media By Numbers LLC. Final figures will be released Monday. \u001d  1. \"Blades of Glory,\" $33 million. \u001d  2. \"Meet the Robinsons,\" $25.1 million. \u001d  3. \"300,\" $11.2 million. \u001d  4. \"TMNT,\" $9.2 million. \u001d  5. \"Wild Hogs,\" $8.4 million. \u001d  6. \"Shooter,\" $8 million. \u001d  7. \"Premonition,\" $5.1 million. \u001d  8. \"The Last Mimzy,\" $4 million. \u001d  9. \"The Hills Have Eyes 2,\" $3.9 million. \u001d  10. \"Reign Over Me,\" $3.7 million. \u001d  --- \u001d  Universal Pictures and Focus Features are owned by NBC Universal, a joint venture of General Electric Co.

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Karen Richardson and Jason Singer \u001d  With U.S. private-equity firms taking initial steps to go public, investors who wonder how these firms will fare as publicly traded stocks should look globally. \u001d  Numerous private-equity firms in Europe and elsewhere have been publicly traded for decades. Their records show that the asset class can be lucrative for investors willing to dig through their many different structures to get a handle on their various fee arrangements. \u001d  In the U.S., Blackstone Group is the first of the big-name private-equity giants out of the starting gate, with a plan to take public 10% of its management company, but Wall Street executives say rivals such as Apollo Management LP and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. are also eyeing public offerings. But many European money managers -- and internationally savvy U.S. funds -- have been investing in publicly traded buyout firms for decades. These investors have been well rewarded as the global boom in mergers and acquisitions has allowed private-equity firms to post strong profits. \u001d  One of the largest of the publicly traded private-equity firms, London-based 3i Group PLC, says it is buying companies at a record clip. \"We've been growing our investment levels and getting into new business lines,\" Chief Executive Philip Yea said in an interview. Being publicly traded enables 3i to use its own balance sheet to start new businesses quickly or buy minority stakes in other companies, he added. \u001d  Beginning as a government agency to finance start-ups in the aftermath of World War II, 3i dates back about 60 years and has had shares publicly traded since 1994. The company's shares are up 67% over the past two years on the London Stock Exchange. On Thursday, 3i said it will return an additional GBP 800 million  ($1.57 billion) to shareholders after windfall gains from selling companies it had taken over and restructured. On Friday, its shares closed at GBP 11.36, down four pence. \u001d  \"Their core business areas across buyouts, growth capital and venture capital continue to perform strongly,\" said Simon Haines, a fund manager at Threadneedle Investments, one of the largest 3i shareholders, with more than 3% of the company. The recent payment to shareholders \"underlines their success.\" \u001d  Going public has several advantages for firms in an industry dominated by private partnerships. The ones that have made the leap say it can make them appear more reputable and enduring than rivals that operate funds that typically exist for no more than 10 years. It also can help them raise money from the stock market for a variety of uses, cash that is better suited to more long-term investments because it doesn't need to be paid back like money raised from institutional investors and the wealthy. (Blackstone and Fortress Investment Group LLC, a hedge fund and private-equity firm that recently went public, are selling stock in their management companies, not in the funds they use to buy companies, so public stockholders won't own a direct stake in the firms' buyouts.) \u001d  There are many types of public companies involved in private-equity investing. And the different structures give investors access to a variety of sources of profit -- from the returns from the investments themselves to fees from managing other investors' money. Some, such as 3i, are a mix, making minority investments through the publicly traded company and also earning money from managing funds from other partners. \u001d  Canada's Onex Corp. was founded in 1984 with money from rich individuals and institutions. Three years later, Gerald Schwartz, the former Wall Street banker and founder of Onex, realized a permanent pile of capital was needed to fund his long-term acquisition ambitions as private-equity shops specializing in leveraged buyouts were still a novelty to Canadian investors. Going public has produced \"a very steady and regularly increasing amount of capital for us to invest,\" said Mr. Schwartz, Onex's chief executive. \u001d  Since raising 240 million Canadian dollars (US$207.9 million) in its 1987 initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Onex now has C$4 billion in capital, which it invests along with private money it raises from outside investors, known as limited partners. In total, it has C$7.5 billion in assets under management and has made some high-profile acquisitions. The firm is part of a consortium that recently launched a buyout offer for Australia's Quantas Airways. In the late 1990s, the firm made a failed bid to merge Canada's two largest and most troubled carriers, Air Canada and Canadian Airlines. Onex owns Cineplex Entertainment, which operates theaters under the brand names Famous Players, Cineplex Odeon and Galaxy Entertainment. \u001d  Onex shares have climbed an average of 18% each year since it went public. Friday, Onex shares closed down 1.4%, or 44 Canadian cents, to C$32.06, up about 13% this year. \u001d  The stock, however, is viewed by some analysts as a good deal because it is trading at about a 5% discount to the company's net asset value. Some analysts argue it deserves a premium because of the fees the firm generates. It is trading at 13.7 times estimated 2007 earnings, about flat against the financial sector. \u001d  Private-equity groups like Onex can suffer from concern among shareholders that management is taking fees that are too hefty, something investors need to watch for, and that can weigh on the stock. \"The fees paid to Onex managers do not impair Onex's returns to the extent that investors generally perceive,\" Peter Sklar, an analyst in Toronto at Nesbitt Burns Research, wrote in a January research note about Onex's fee structure. \u001d  Ewout Heersink, Onex's chief financial officer, said structuring different classes of shares, compensation and distribution of fees between management and shareholders have been key areas of concern for management. Mr. Schwartz maintains control of Onex through multiple-voting shares, giving him the right to elect 60% of the board, even though he owns less than one-fourth of the company. \u001d  Blackstone's future shareholders will have even fewer voting rights, as they won't be able to elect directors, and the firm won't be required to have a minimum number of outside investors under the terms of its listing. The firm's offering is structured as that of a master limited partnership, instead of a traditional public company, allowing the firm's principals to exercise unusual control. \u001d  As private-equity firms attempt to buy increasingly high-profile companies, they are facing some backlash from shareholders in the targets who complain that the vehicles are secretive and interested only in short-term profits. Being a public stock, with some disclosure obligations, can help argue against that attack, private-equity executives say. \u001d  In France, Wendel Investissement SA dates back 300 years, with origins in the steel industry starting in 1704. Eurazeo SA, which competes with big U.S. firms for deals, dates to 1881, when it began as a gas-and-water distributor. Both companies have market capitalizations of more than $8 billion. Wendel shares have more than doubled in the past two years, and Eurazeo is up more than 80% in the same time period. \u001d  Eurazeo has been focusing more on doing its own buyouts and selling investments in other areas. The Paris-based company announced in February it agreed to sell its portfolio of investments in 28 other private-equity funds to AIG Global Investment Group for $214 million. \u001d  Wendel reported on Wednesday that its annual net income grew 23% and its dividend would be raised 21% to 1.70 euros ($2.27) a share. The company has been growing more international. It made four acquisitions in 2006, three of them outside France including its first U.S. purchase, of Deutsch Group, a maker of electrical connectors. \u001d  A smaller way in for patient investors to invest in the buyout boom: Buy shares in funds that the private-equity firms list. Last May, KKR raised $5 billion from listing a fund publicly on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam. And Apollo Management raised $1.5 billion from listing shares of AP Alternative Assets LP fund, also in Amsterdam. Both are trading below their listing prices and at a price below their net asset value because the new style has no track record. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 23:00 ET

\u001d  Weiqiao Textile Company Limited (\"the Company\" or \"Weiqiao Textile\") and its subsidiaries, collectively the \"Group\") (HKEX: 2698), the largest cotton textile producer in China, today announced its annual results for the period ended December 31, 2006 (the \"Period\"). \b \u001d  During the Period, the Group enhanced its marketing effort, achieving strong sales income. Revenue of the Group was RMB19,826,000,000, up 46.0% compared with 2005; Gross profit was RMB 3,323,000,000, up 48.1% compared with 2005; The Group performed well in the control of operating costs. Operating costs of the Group grew at a relative lower percentage when compared with the growth of revenue of the Group in 2006. As a result, the Group recorded an operating profit of RMB 3,027,574,000, an increase 63.1% over 2005. \b \u001d  Net profit attributable to shareholders rose 35.7% to RMB 1,685,000,000. Basic earnings per share were RMB 1.43, 5.9% higher than that of last year. The board proposed a final dividend of RMB 0.44, up 53.3% compared with 2005. \b \u001d  Leveraging its efficient operating model and effective strategic moves, the Group continued to perform satisfactorily. Commenting on the Period's performance, Ms. Zhang Hongxia, Chairman of Weiqiao Textile, said: \"In 2006, the Group worked to enhance its marketing effort. As a result, utilization rate of our production facilities was further improved. We also focused on continuously upgrading of our production facilities and technology in order to provide the markets with more high-end products. Such efforts proved effective as we reached record-high revenues and net profits since our listing.\" \b \b   Operations Review \b \u001d  In 2006, China's economy maintained relative healthy development trend while exports further increased. Exports of textile and clothing reached US$147.085 billion, representing a growth of 25.14% as compared with the previous year. During the year, the trade tensions between China and the US & Europe was gradually eased after these regions implemented the agreed safeguards which had limited the growth rate of China's exports of clothing and textiles to those markets. Such changes created relatively stable operating environment for the textile industry in the PRC, at the same time providing good opportunities in the continued exploration and industrial upgrading of the textile industry. \b \u001d  For the twelve months ended 31 December 2006, the Group's gross profit margin was 16.8%, 0.3 percentage point higher than that of 2005. The increase was mainly attributable to the Company's effort on product mix optimization and stringent cost control during the Period. \b \u001d  During the Period, high energy price, cotton price and the appreciation of the Renminbi continued to challenge to the Group's efforts to control cost. However, the thermal plant acquired by the Group from its parent in 2005 provided the Group's with adequate supply of electricity and significantly helped reduce the Group's operating costs. During the Period, the Group obtained tax relief of approximately RMB 163,000,000 in respect of purchases of domestically produced machinery and equipment required for technological upgrades and investment projects. \b \u001d  The Group continued to execute its plan to upgrade facilities, enhance its sales efforts for core products and rationalize product mix. Sales of grey fabric, cotton yarn and denim, the Group's core products, generated 49.5%, 41.8% and 8.4% of total revenue respectively. Sales figures for these three products were as follows: \b \bProducts     Revenue        Revenue    Change     Gross       Gross \b             in 2006        in 2005       %     margin in   margin in \b                                                   2006        2005 \b                                                   (%)         (%) \b---------------------------------------------------------------------- \bCotton \b yarn     8,291,334,000  5,425,822,000   52.8          13.6      21.7 \b---------------------------------------------------------------------- \bGrey \b fabric   9,811,971,000  6,990,851,000   40.4          19.1      12.0 \b---------------------------------------------------------------------- \bDenim     1,668,749,000  1,080,229,000   54.5          18.7      22.2 \b---------------------------------------------------------------------- \bOthers       54,100,000     87,487,000  (38.2)         23.7     (10.5) \b---------------------------------------------------------------------- \bTotal    19,826,154,000 13,584,389,000   45.9          16.8      16.5 \b---------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \u001d  In 2006, the Group's production volume of cotton yarn, grey fabric and denim were 882,000 tons, 1,634,000,000 meters and 175,000,000 meters respectively, growing at about 33.8%, 13.4% and 41.1% respectively as compared with 2005. \b \u001d  During the Period, the Group's gross profit margin increased to 16.8%. The increase was mainly attributable to the Company's implementation of flexible and effective sales strategies, controls over production costs, market-driven sales mix adjustment, increased sales in high-end grey fabrics while reduced sales of high-end cotton yarn. As a result, the gross profit margin of cotton yarn was reduced, while gross profit margin of grey fabric was increased. On the other hand, due to unfavorable market environment and low utilization rate of new production capacity, the gross profit margin of denim decreased. \b \u001d  For the year ended 31 December 2006, the Group's domestic sales increased substantially. This was mainly due to the strong growth in domestic demands of the PRC during the year. The Group modified its sales strategy, strengthened domestic marketing efforts, and expanded its market share in the domestic market.

As at 31 December 2006, the Group had a total of around 7,500 domestic customers and over 720 overseas customers, representing a growth of 29.3% and 20.0% respectively as compared with last year. \b \b   Cost analysis \b \u001d  During the Period, relatively stable global demand and supply of cotton helped the cotton textile industry has a better control on production cost. \b \u001d  In 2006, with an increase of 46.0% in the Group's revenue, the selling and distribution expenses only increased by 4.1%. Following the continuous increase in the Group's transportation volume, the Group conducted tendering on the sea-freight and inland freight charges respectively, thereby significantly reducing the unit prices in transportation. The transportation expenses increased by only 7.4% from approximately RMB 256,000,000 in 2005 to approximately RMB 275,000,000 in 2006. At the same time, due to the Group's market development efforts, commission-bearing sales through intermediaries decreased, and ultimately the sales commission paid to intermediaries was decreased by 26.5% from approximately RMB 49, 000,000 in 2005 to approximately RMB 36, 000,000. \b \u001d  Administrative expenses for the year ended 31 December 2006 amounted to approximately RMB 177,000,000, representing an increase of 17.2% as compared with approximately RMB 151,000,000 in the previous year. The increase in administrative expenses was mainly due to expansion in the Group's production scale. \b \u001d  The Group continued to maintain an appropriate mix of equity and debt to ensure an efficient capital structure. As at 31 December 2006, the debts of the Group included interest-bearing bank borrowings and long-term payables to the immediate holding company totaling approximately RMB 9,867,000,000. Cash and cash equivalents was approximately RMB 4,210,000,000 and debt-to-equity ratio was 46.7%. \b \b   Outlook \b \u001d  Ms. Zhang is optimistic about the Group's prospects and those of the industry. She commented, \"As the economic cycle continues its upward trend, China's economy will be developing rapidly and steadily. The Government has indicated that expansion of domestic demands will be a significant duty of macro control in 2007, and making efforts to expand consumption of residents is the long term policy of the Government going forward. Stable macro control policy and higher domestic consumption market will definitely increase the consumption level of textiles products, creating favorable conditions for the development of the textile industry. Growth prospects for the global economy look promising, and economic growth in developed countries will directly promote growth in consumption and trading, bringing greater opportunities for textile exports in the PRC.\" \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 20:45 ET (00:45

But clouding the horizon is the theme of government intervention that has marked Argentine President Nestor Kirchner's administration. \u001d  Upon signing a bill promoting biofuels into law last month, Kirchner proclaimed: \"This places our country in harmony with the interests of the globalized world.\" Days later, however, the government published a regulatory decree that came up thin or vague on important details such as tax incentives, government controls on pricing, and export approvals. \u001d  The law mandates a 5% content of biodiesel or ethanol in the nation's fuel by 2010 and provides tax breaks and incentives for projects aimed at supplying the domestic market that are at least 50% owned by Argentines. \u001d  In a review of the 22 articles in regulatory Decree 109/07, Claudio Molina, who heads the Argentine Biofuels and Hydrogen Association, found some 16 points of concern. \u001d  \"The most worrisome aspect is the lack of clarity regarding tax breaks,\" Molina said. \"The concern is that you make investments and then the rules of the game change.\" \u001d  The domestic price for biofuels will be set by the government, which adds to the uncertainty. \u001d  \"If I'm going to invest I want to know at least how the government plans to set and adjust prices,\" said Martin Fraguio, the head of Argentine corn growers association, Maizar. \u001d  That pricing mechanism could be adjusted by inflation, exchange rates, or by using world prices for oil or wheat, Fraguio said. \"It's unfortunate that the regulatory decree didn't clear this up,\" he added. \u001d  Many investors are looking into export projects betting that world market prices will be higher than domestic ones, but the new law is disconcertingly vague on export rules, observers said. \u001d  Approval to ship these fuels abroad will be given \"only to the companies that are duly registered.\" Registry requirements are not specified, which causes concern given prior intervention in both the agricultural and energy sectors. \b \u001d  Government Has A Poor Track Record \b \u001d  The government has slapped various export limits on the agricultural sector since last year in a bid to ease double-digit inflation. \u001d  In March of last year, Kirchner banned all beef exports as domestic prices rose because of strong demand from abroad. The government has since eased that restriction somewhat. \u001d  This month, Argentina suspended the registration of wheat exports as bread and pasta prices at home started to rise; the government had previously suspended the corn registry in November because of a similarly surging exports. Closing the export registries prevents companies from lining up new export commitments. \u001d  Wading deeper into the market, the government earlier this year announced that wheat millers would receive subsidies to compensate them for rising costs. To fund the program, the government hiked soy export taxes by four percentage points, to 27.5% for soybeans, and 24% for soy oil, meal, and pellets. \u001d  As for energy, government intervention in fuel pricing has led to a distorted market where there is an excess of gasoline, a shortage of diesel, and a large amount of cars running on artificially cheap - yet scarce - compressed natural gas. \u001d  Argentina has faced chronic diesel shortages over the past several years, especially during planting and harvest periods. The trouble, say industry officials, is that diesel and gasoline pump prices have been subject to de facto price controls since Kirchner called on citizens to boycott the local unit of Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSB.LN) two years ago after it tried to raise pump prices because of higher crude oil prices. \u001d  With refineries operating at capacity, the government began authorizing tax-free diesel imports in 2005. Industry officials complain that importing diesel at world prices still forces them to sell at a loss given the low domestic pump prices. \u001d  Argentina should be able to produce enough biodiesel to meet domestic demands and some exports, but market observers believe the state may try to make up for the shortages with more biodiesel, reducing the scope for exporting to the more lucrative overseas market. \u001d  \"If I were thinking about producing biodiesel for the external market, I would be very worried about the possibility that the government would restrict exports to substitute imports (of diesel),\" said Gabriel Sustaita, the director of a sugar-to-ethanol plant that is mulling plans to expand into corn ethanol. \b \u001d  Silver Lining... \b \u001d  Despite the concerns, interest remains high, said Molina, of the Argentine Biofuels and Hydrogen Association. Molina has compiled a list of some 38 groups working on biodiesel plans representing $733 million in investment, and more than 10 others mulling ethanol projects worth $600 million. \u001d  The projects include a mix of local and international agricultural and energy heavyweights including Bunge (BG), Cargill, Glencore International, and Repsol-YPF (REP). \u001d  Although only a couple of the projects have moved beyond preliminary studies, Molina said he is unaware of any investors scrapping plans entirely. \u001d  Julio Gutierrez, whose local BGS Group is studying a $57 million biodiesel project that would produce 200,000 tons a year, said Argentina's vast agricultural potential makes the sector a risk worth betting on. \u001d  Gutierrez, a player in the consolidation of Argentina's cable TV industry in the 1990s, is helping organize an Americas-wide biofuels congress in May that former U.S. Vice President Al Gore is slated to attend. \u001d  As it stands, \"the regulatory decree doesn't benefit investment, especially foreign investment, very much,\" Gutierrez said. \u001d  \"We have to work to modify and correct the regulatory decree and I think the Congress could be very helpful in getting that done,\" he added. \"The good news is that the law is there - the good news is that Argentina produces a lot of high quality grains needed to make biofuels.\" \b

(AP)--Two days after a right-to-work group unsuccessfully sought to cancel or delay a union vote at Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, more than two thirds of dealers there have voted to join a union. \u001d  The dealers voted 324 to 149 late Saturday night to join the United Auto Workers union, the group announced on its Web site. \u001d  \"The election victory is superb news for Trump Plaza dealers and all Atlantic City dealers,\" said UAW Secretary-Treasurer Elizabeth Bunn. \"We look forward to bargaining with Trump Plaza management to secure a great first contract that benefits casino workers and the gaming industry in New Jersey.\" \u001d  A spokesman for Trump Plaza did not immediately return a call for comment. \u001d  Trump Plaza is the second Atlantic City casino to approve unionization. Dealers at Caesars Atlantic City had their union approved earlier this week when the casino's parent company declined to contest the results of a vote in which workers chose to join the UAW by a 4-to-1 margin. \u001d  The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, a Virginia group that says it fights \"compulsory unionism abuses,\" sought to halt the election by filing an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board Friday. \u001d  The group charged that U.S. Rep. Robert Andrews, a Democrat from Haddon Heights, tampered with the election when he held a rally last week to count union authorization cards signed by employees. Andrews said the claims where \"absurd and false.\" \u001d  The NLRB told the right-to-work group it would look into its complaint, but that it would only halt the election or impound ballots if either Trump Plaza or the union itself asked them to. \u001d  The UAW has also filed documents with the labor board seeking union certification for workers at a third casino, the Trump Marina Hotel Casino. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 11:16 ET (15:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"61cbf3a770cb4fa0f03fce48d243662f","symR":["NFZ"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen AZ Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NFZ)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NFZ"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen AZ Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NFZ): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NFZ or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:51 ET (08:51 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"61d580010be7c81c3eec1e84568d91bd","symR":["OCN.LN","BMG6699D1074"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Ocean Wilsons Holdings Ltd","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OCN.LN","BMG6699D1074"],"IndustryCodes":["MAR"],"Story":"\u001d  Ocean Wilsons Holdings Ltd: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=BMG6699D1074 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:49 ET (08:49 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"61d8509e9fe55206d41cb629dd6d159f","symR":["NEA"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen Ins Tax-Free Adv Muni","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NEA"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen Ins Tax-Free Adv Muni: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NEA or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:56 ET (08:56 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"61dc6ba7c3da34bf30ea531b47c36c19","symR":["RTC"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Riviera Tool Company","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RTC"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Riviera Tool Company: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=RTC or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:23 ET (09:23 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"61f06a661f83273f8e7e75374d5fa76f","symR":["SLOU.LN","GB0008141045"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Slough Estates plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLOU.LN","GB0008141045"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\u001d  Slough Estates plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0008141045 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:15 ET (09:15 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"623a3d6e21785e3b656146f0c05cd3d4","symR":["MGL.T","CA61981U1084"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Moto Goldmines Limited - Issue Of -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T14:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MGL.T","CA61981U1084"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bThe Moto goldfields are located primarily within rocks of the Moto greenstone belt, which consists of Archaean rocks of the Lower Kibalian System. The Moto greenstone belt is bounded to the north by the Archaean West Nile Gneiss complex and to the south by the (younger) Upper Zaire granitic complex. \b \bThe Moto greenstone belt has a history of gold production. Three of the deposits in the area, Gorumbwa, Agbarabo and Durba, which were exploited primarily in the 1950s and 1960s by the Belgians, have produced more than 60% of the +3 million ounces of recorded production from the Moto area. Most of the remainder of production has come from placer, alluvial and small oxide-zone workings. Many of the past-producing high-grade gold mines in the Moto greenstone belt fall within a 7km by 5km area near the towns of Doko and Durba (the \"Durba Gold Camp\"). At present the Moto goldfields remain relatively unexplored by today's standards. \b \bThe activities undertaken by the Company during the period have continued to highlight the world class potential of this previously underexplored project. Whilst the consolidated lease covers an area of approximately 2,350 sq kms, activities to date have primarily focussed on the 35 sq kms of the Durba Gold Camp. As a result a large number of untested gold occurrences remain to be systematically explored using modern techniques. \b \bThere are presently 4 drill rigs (one RC and three diamond) operating on the Moto site, with soil sampling teams also collecting samples from various project areas. The RC and soil samples are shipped to SGS in Mwanza, Tanzania for assay, whilst the diamond core samples are dispatched to Genalysis Laboratory Services in Perth, Australia for assay. \b \bThe principal focus of the programme during the period was to progress the Moto Gold Project from the exploration stage to project feasibility and development. \b \bTenure \b \bThe Company has entered into a joint venture through a wholly owned subsidiary with the privately owned company Orgaman sprl (\"Orgaman\") to form a number of local operating companies, including Borgakim sprl (\"Borgakim\"). \b \bThese local operating companies had in turn entered into leasing agreements and a contract of technical and financial assistance (\"the Existing Contracts\") with the L'Office des Mines d'Or de Kilo-Moto (\"OKIMO\"), the state-owned company that holds mineral rights in the north-east of the DRC. The Company is the operator in respect of all activities at the Moto Gold Project. Most of these agreements are of indefinite duration. However, Okimo can terminate, with 60 days notice, for: \b \b \b    << \b        -  non-payment of State taxes and duties; \b \b        -  non-compliance with laws and regulations that can lead to the \b           financial and administrative prejudice to Okimo; or \b \b        -  non-payment of rents due to Okimo. \b    >> \b \b \bIn November 2006 the Company entered into an agreement (\"November 2006 Protocol\") with Okimo to enter into a simplified contractual arrangement that will govern the development of and future production activities at the Moto Gold Project in the north east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (\"DRC\"). Under the November 2006 Protocol the parties re-iterated the validity of the existing contracts and agreed the following principal terms: \b \b \b    << \b        -  The Existing Contracts be amalgamated in favour of a 30 year lease \b           in respect of a newly consolidated perimeter in favour of Borgakim \b           or an exploitation company covering approximately 2,350 sq kms, \b           with the balance of the area being released to Okimo. \b \b        -  The interests of the partners in the exploitation company be \b           Okimo 30% (non-dilutable), the Company 60% and Orgaman sprl \b           (\"Orgaman\") 10%. \b \b        -  The Company will pay to Okimo through Borgakim, US$5 million, and \b           the exploitation company will pay ongoing monthly rentals of \b           US$350,000 until the commencement of production. \b \b        -  Okimo currently owes Orgaman approximately US$21 million. The \b           Company has agreed through Borgakim to purchase this debt from \b           Orgaman on terms to be negotiated in an agreement between the \b           Company, Borgakim, Okimo and Orgaman. The Company has agreed to \b           purchase the debt from Orgaman and to pay Orgaman approximately \b           US$8 million in respect of interest accrued to date on this debt \b           as described below. \b \b        -  Borgakim has agreed to provide Okimo with the funding required to \b           pay the arrears and balance due to its employees of retirement age \b           according to the findings of an audit to be conducted by Okimo; \b           such funds form a non-interest loan to Okimo which is to be repaid \b           by Okimo with its share of income generated by the project. \b    >> \b \b \bThe mineral rights held by Okimo are granted until November 2008, subject to extension for force majeure. Pursuant to the new DRC Mining Code Okimo is required to transform its existing rights into an exploitation licence under the Mining Code. Okimo is yet to commence this procedure. Once the rights have been transformed into an exploitation licence such mineral rights are renewable (subject to satisfying certain conditions) on application for periods of fifteen years (upon granting of an application), until the deposits are exhausted. \b \bIn January 2007, certain of the Company's subsidiaries received letters from the then Chief Executive Officer of Okimo and now Vice Minister of Mines claiming certain obligations under the Existing Contracts had not been satisfied and giving the relevant company ninety days to rectify matters. The Company strongly disputes that it has failed to satisfy any performance criteria under any of the contracts with Okimo and is seeking formal withdrawal of the letters. The Company has received a copy of a letter to the former CEO of Okimo from the Chairman of Okimo making it clear that he had no authority to write the letters, but the Company is still awaiting formal withdrawal of the letters. \b \bFurther documentation has been prepared by the Company to implement the November 2006 Protocol. However the Company was requested to wait until the appointment of the new Government of the DRC and the appointment of officials to the state companies following the recent elections before progressing the documentation. The relevant appointments have been made; however the recent outbreak of unrest in the capital may delay the withdrawal of the letters from the former CEO of Okimo and finalisation and implementation of these ancillary documents. These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the agreements contained in the November 2006 Protocol. \b \bIn light of the current potential challenges to the Group's title, the Company has been actively updating influential people in the DRC and internationally, including the board and current executive team at Okimo and the new ministers, as to the Company's activities and has engaged both international and local DRC legal experts to prepare and take the appropriate legal action. The Board is also meeting frequently both to review the position and to determine the appropriate action. The Board is seeking to achieve resolution of the issues as soon as practicable. \b \bResource Estimate for Moto Gold Project Deposits \b \bIn December 2006 independent consultants Cube Consulting estimated the following resources, which are all within the consolidated lease area, at a nominal 1/gt Au lower cutoff: \b \b \b    << \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    Deposit                     Indicated                   Inferred \b                        ----------------------------------------------------- \b                         Tonnes              Au      Tonnes             Au \b                           Mt      Au g/t  '000Oz      Mt     Au g/t  '000Oz \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    Pakaka                16.13      2.7    1,414 \b    Gorumbwa                                          8.29      5.2    1,374 \b    Kibali                                            16.6      2.2    1,173 \b    Mengu Hill             6.26      3.5      699     0.15      2.5       12 \b    Mengu Village          1.28      1.8       76 \b    Karagba                6.23      2.6      523    21.13      3.2    2,142 \b    Chauffeur             21.88      3.4    2,407    34.91      5.8    6,533 \b    Durba                                             4.66      2.5      376 \b    Megi                                              3.88      2.2      270 \b    Marakeke                                          2.34      1.8      133 \b    Kombokolo              1.79      2.9      166      .01      1.6        0 \b    Sessenge               6.68      2.5      540     0.74      2.4       58 \b    Ndala                                             0.24      4.3       33 \b    Pamao                  5.23      2.0      337     4.26      1.9      260 \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    TOTAL                 65.49      2.9    6,163    97.22      4.0    12.36 \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    >> \b \b \bCube Consulting utilized the Australian standard of resource classifications, JORC, which are in principle equivalent to the CIM classifications used in Canada. \b \bUpon completion of the November 2005 Resource estimate extensive infill and extension drilling programmes were principally undertaken at Karagba, Chauffeur and Durba and to a lesser extent across a remainder of the principal economic orebodies as identified in the November 2005 Conceptual Study.

WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Jonathan Karp \u001d  After a string of high-profile contract wins and a stellar run on the stock market, Lockheed Martin Corp. is encountering turbulence in a number of weapons programs central to its expansion into new markets. \u001d  Cost overruns have prompted the Navy to demand tougher contract terms for a new warship that is intended to prowl enemy shores. Poor grades from the Navy for work on helicopters for ferrying the president undermined Lockheed's bid for a bigger, $15 billion Air Force chopper contract. The Coast Guard has taken away some work from a joint venture between Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp. because of snafus on a $24 billion, 25-year project to overhaul the service's ship and aircraft fleets. \u001d  Circumstances differ among the programs, and government agencies or Lockheed's corporate teammates on the various projects share responsibility for the hiccups, officials and industry executives say. The Navy, for one, changed aspects of its ship and helicopter programs after awarding the contracts. \u001d  Still, the cases highlight risks as Lockheed, the dominant warplane maker, seeks to maintain growth by aggressively venturing into areas it is less familiar with as a prime contractor. In such a role, a company manages the design work, subcontractors and relations with the government, and typically receives the biggest share of profit. \u001d  The various problems aren't likely to dent 2007 profit at Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., and the biggest U.S. defense company by sales, which forecasts revenue of more than $40 billion and operating margins of 10% as it benefits from the boom in defense spending. In the past two years, Lockheed has seen net income nearly double to $2.53 billion last year and added nearly $1 billion to its cash generation, which was $3.78 billion in 2006. Its financial returns and wide-ranging contract wins have made Lockheed the top-performing defense stock. It gained 45% in 2006 and is up 29% over the past 52 weeks. \u001d  But the current troubles could jeopardize future prospects, and they are raising questions about a company that prides itself on its ability to integrate and manage advanced technology programs -- whether it's the Joint Strike Fighter combat plane, a military-communications network or the next manned space capsule. \u001d  \"We wonder if the company's engineering base is stretched too thin or having trouble retaining talent,\" Merrill Lynch defense analyst Ronald Epstein wrote in a recent report. Byron Callan of Prudential Equity Group expressed confidence in Robert Stevens, Lockheed's chairman and chief executive, and the company's overall operations. But he said that recent challenges suggest Lockheed's program \"execution is not superior to other defense\" prime contractors. The stock doesn't deserve a premium to its peers, he added. \u001d  Lockheed spokesman Tom Jurkowsky said that the company is successfully performing on more than 3,000 contracts. \"While we are disappointed with issues that have occurred on a few of our prime programs, we understand that we are in the business of developing complex systems,\" he said. \"When issues occur, we will work with the customer and commit the resources of the corporation to resolve any problem.\" \u001d  Lockheed faces a tight deadline to salvage its role developing the Littoral Combat Ship, or LCS, a small, swift, supposedly inexpensive vessel that is designed for missions along enemy coasts. Navy Secretary Donald Winter halted work on Lockheed's second ship in January as cost projections for the hull of the inaugural ship climbed to between $350 million and $375 million from the Navy's target of $220 million. \u001d  Last month, Mr. Winter said Lockheed could resume work if it agreed by mid-April to switch to a fixed-price contract, instead of the current standard development contract, in which the government reimburses the contractor for costs and pays a fee on top. Fixed-price contracts shift risk to the contractor and typically are used by the Pentagon only after development kinks are ironed out and full production starts. \u001d  Lockheed executives have defended the company's performance and attributed the cost increases to higher steel prices; a subcontractor's faulty engine part, which caused a 27-week delay; and a change of Navy specifications for the ship in 2005, which added $50 million. Several financial analysts believe that Lockheed might reject a fixed-price contract. Lockheed and the Navy say they are negotiating the program but can't elaborate on the talks. \u001d  Lockheed says it regularly reported the cost increases to Navy program officials. Mr. Winter said he learned of them only early this year, and he removed some senior program officials after the revelations. Morgan Stanley analyst Heidi Wood says Lockheed may have erred by not alerting top Navy brass sooner. \"Handling your customer as a ship prime contractor is new lesson learned for Lockheed,\" she says. But Ms. Wood also questions the Navy's response, saying, \"Navy ships are commonly over budget, which makes it difficult to point a finger solely at Lockheed.\" \u001d  Veteran shipbuilder General Dynamics Corp. is developing a rival LCS and experiencing cost growth of between 50% and 75%, equivalent to Lockheed, a Navy spokesman says. The ship isn't as far along as Lockheed's, and Mr. Winter says General Dynamics may yet be required to work for a fixed price too. General Dynamics spokesman Kendall Pease says, \"our ship is 40% complete, so to give any meaningful cost estimate would be premature.\" \u001d  Lockheed also has butted heads with the Navy over the fleet of new Marine-piloted presidential helicopters. After Lockheed won the prestigious contract, the two sides haggled for months over Navy requests for equipment and testing changes despite a tight delivery schedule. Navy officials say they now have confidence in the development plan. But the Navy's earlier reservations dissuaded the Air Force from choosing Lockheed and the same European-built chopper as the service's new combat rescue helicopter. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones

Analysts are divided on the company's prospects, pointing to strong market share in clubs and balls, but acknowledging stiff competition and problems with one of its primary golf ball brands. Here's a sampling of analysts' pros and cons on the company's shares: \b \u001d  The Bull Case \b \u001d  'WINNEBAGO' OF GOLF: Callaway's products are among the most recognizable in the industry. It's \"much like 'Winnebago' in the RV world,\" writes Kathryn Thompson of Avondale Partners, \"and has a track record of strong customer loyalty and dependable products.\" Callaway is the top seller of irons and putters and the No. 2 seller of balls and woods in the U.S., with its Big Bertha drivers arguably the best-known club of all. \u001d  MORE IN THE BAG: Callaway is planning to launch 16 new products by June, with 2007 marking the most aggressive period of product introductions in Callaway's history, Ms. Thompson says. A big part of that is the company's effort to bolster the Top-Flite brand of golf balls, which it acquired in 2003. \b \u001d  The Bear Case \b \u001d  FEWER ROUNDS: Timothy Conder at A.G. Edwards, who downgraded the stock recently to hold from buy, says the \"long-term fundamental outlook for the golf industry remains challenging.\" The number of U.S. golfers has been roughly flat since 2000. \u001d  COMPETITIVE FIELD: Nike Inc.'s emergence in golf and consistently strong competition from other companies have hurt Callaway's market share in most categories. Callaway's ball business, which also includes its HX brand, has fallen further behind Acushnet, a Fortune Brands Inc. unit that makes Titleist and Pinnacle balls. \u001d  -- Worth Civils \u001d  --- \u001d  Online Today: WSJ.com subscribers can read more analysis of the outlook for Callaway, at WSJ.com/Reports. \b \u001d  A RIDE FOR DISABLED GOLFERS \b \u001d  FOR A DISABLED golfer who requires crutches or prosthetic limbs to stand, navigating a golf course can be tricky at best. \u001d  Single-rider golf cars, a relatively recent innovation, allow mobility-impaired golfers the chance to get back into the game. Tom Durbin, vice president of sales for Solo-Rider, a Colorado company that designs and makes the cars, spoke \u001d  recently with The Wall Street Journal Online about efforts to build interest among the disabled community and the reaction of golf courses to single-rider cars. \b \u001d  Q: What are single-rider golf cars? \u001d  A: Single-rider, or adaptive, golf cars are designed to give golfers with limited mobility full access to a golf course. These cars use hand controls to operate acceleration, braking and steering, while a specially designed seat raises and turns, permitting a golfer to swing from a seated position without ever having to leave the car. \b \u001d  Q: Why hasn't the golf industry embraced the cars? \u001d  A: Many golf-course operators . . . can legitimately make the claim that there's no demand because [many mobility-impaired golfers] don't call the golf course to say they want to play.

Revenues for the quarter were $4,059,296, with a gross margin of $2,453,804 (60 percent of revenue), EBITDA of $1,723,450 (42 percent of revenue) and net earnings of $396,196 (10 percent of revenue). Revenues improved for the quarter, relative to results in the prior quarters due to seasonally higher levels of activity in the fourth quarter in the industry, partially offset by lower prices on the sale of recovered oil compared to the second and third quarters of 2006. \b \bOn a basic and diluted per unit basis, earnings for the year were $0.20 per unit ($0.09 per unit for the quarter), and funds from operations for the year was $0.75 per unit ($0.36 per unit for the quarter). Basic and diluted distributions declared to unitholders for the year were $3,366,393 or $0.77 per unit ($0.29 per unit for the quarter). Distributions paid for the year were $2,949,085, or $0.68 cents per unit, basic and diluted ($0.29 per unit for the quarter). \b \bIn general, demand in the oilfield waste management business was strong for the year, although as is typically the case, seasonal fluctuations and weather conditions had an impact on activity at certain times. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bResults of operations \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bRevenue \b \bRevenues for the year were $9,647,020 ($4,059,296 for the quarter) comprising approximately 60 percent from processing and disposal fees and 40 percent from the sale of recovered oil (57 percent and 43 percent respectively for the quarter). \b \bDuring the year, the Trust experienced a number of challenges at the Grande Cache facility. In June the pipeline running from the plant to the disposal well breeched. There was no exposure to the environment, as the inner fiberglass pipeline was enclosed in a steel casing, however in order to minimize the risk of future pipeline breaches at the facility, the entire inner fiberglass pipeline was replaced. This resulted in a significant impact to revenues as the pipeline was not brought back on-line until September 28, 2006. During this time, Grande Cache was still receiving limited amounts of production fluids and trucking the water from the plant to the well site. Small volumes of oilfield waste were being processed during this period as well. \b \bIn October and November, a solids treatment pad was installed at Grande Cache to improve solid waste handling and treatment abilities; however, the installation disrupted the ability to receive and process waste in October and November. \b \bOn December 7, 2006, an explosion and subsequent fire occurred at the Grande Cache facility, The damage was isolated to a single tank in the vacuum truck unloading system, and the facility resumed operations on December 14, 2006. For the remainder of the year, the facility was only capable of receiving waste transported in tanker trucks, which could be offloaded directly into Deepwell's tanks. On February 1, 2007, Deepwell resumed receiving waste transported in vacuum trucks. \b \bThe above-noted operational issues at Grande Cache negatively impacted revenues by an estimated $743,000 for the year, and $473,000 for the quarter. \b \bThe Mayerthorpe facility provided consistent operational and financial results for the year and the quarter, and generally exceeded expectations. The Rycroft facility provided strong results except in June, when the facility was out of operation for two weeks during stimulation of the disposal well. The downtime while the well was stimulated decreased revenues, however at year end the facility was at a \"run-rate\" significantly beyond original expectations. \b \bExpenses \b \bOperating expenses \b \bOperating expenses were $4,594,714 for the year, and the relationship to revenues is generally consistent with management's expectations. Operating expenses include $1,133,828 in oil credits repaid to customers ($371,068 for the quarter), which mitigates the impact of oil prices on Deepwell's revenues. Certain expenses, such as oil credits, trucking, and landfill expenses are activity driven; however a significant portion of expenses can be considered fixed. Additional trucking costs of approximately $166,000 were incurred during the third quarter of the year, to transport water to the wellhead for disposal, while the disposal pipeline at the Grande Cache facility was out of service. \b \bSelling and administrative \b \bSelling and administrative costs for the year were $1,409,031 or 15 percent of revenue ($730,354 and 18 percent for the quarter). Professional fees, audit fees, wages and benefits for head office personnel, office supplies, and computer related expenses were the most significant cash costs. \b \bDepreciation, amortization and accretion \b \bDepreciation, amortization and accretion expense was $2,186,578 for the period ($993,621 for the quarter) and consists of depreciation of fixed assets of $1,875,595 ($867,586 for the quarter), amortization of intangible assets of $218,963 ($82,160 for the quarter), accretion of $36,188 ($14,243 for the quarter), amortization of deferred financing charges of $55,832 ($29,632 for the quarter). Intangible assets consist of regulatory approvals, customer relationships, and non-competition agreements. \b \bInterest \b \bTotal cash interest expense for the year was $359,740 ($149,325 for the quarter) comprised of interest on long-term debt of $341,375 and interest on the Trust's operating loan of $18,365. Interest rates are floating, with a range from 0.125 percent to 1.4 percent over the lender's prime rate, depending on the Trust's ratio of consolidated funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes depreciation, amortization, accretion, and unit-based compensation. Actual interest rates during the year ranged from 0.125 percent to 0.625 percent over the lender's prime rates. \b \bLoss on sale of assets \b \bDuring the fourth quarter, a plant vehicle and a tractor loader were sold, for total proceeds of $55,500, and recognized losses on disposal were $34,295. \b \bIncome taxes \b \bThe Trust is a taxable entity under the Income Tax Act (Canada) but is taxable only on income that is not distributed to the Unitholders. Any taxable income is distributed to the Unitholders and therefore no provision for income taxes relating to the Trust is included in these financial statements. \b \bIncome taxes in the Trust's corporate subsidiary are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Future tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Future tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on future tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment or substantive enactment date. \b \bOn December 21, 2006, the Federal Minister of Finance released draft legislation to implement proposals originally announced on October 31, 2006 relating to the taxation of certain distributions from certain trusts and partnerships (the \"Trust Taxation Proposal\"). Subject to the Trust Taxation Proposal, returns on capital are generally taxed as ordinary income in the hands of a unitholder who is resident in Canada for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (The \"Tax Act\"). Pursuant to the Trust Taxation Proposal, commencing January 1, 2011 (provided the Trust only experiences \"normal growth\" and no \"undue expansion\" before then) certain distributions from the Trust which would otherwise have been taxed as ordinary income generally will be characterized as dividends in addition to being subject to tax at corporate rates at that trust level. Returns of capital generally are (and under the Trust Taxation Proposal will continue to be) tax-deferred for unitholders who are resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax Act (and reduce such unitholder's adjusted cost based in the Trust Unit for purposes of the Tax Act). Distributions, whether of income or capital to a unitholder who is not resident in Canada for purposes of the Tax Act, or that is partnership that is not a \"Canadian partnership\" for purposes of the Tax Act, generally will be subject to Canadian withholding tax. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bDistributions to Unitholders \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bDuring the year, distributions declared to unitholders were $3,366,393, and distributions paid during the year were $2,949,085. Since inception, the Trust has made monthly distributions of $0.0958 per unit, with the first payment prorated for the two days following acquisition to the end of April, 2006. On March 19, 2007 the Trust announced a change in the monthly distribution and that the cash distribution for the period of March 1 to March 31, 2007 has been set at $0.06 per Trust unit; this cash distribution is payable on April 13, 2007 to unitholders of record on March 30, 2007. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 10:21 ET (14:21 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"6827d8d265b072872c488dec0e50c83b","symR":["JFR"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JFR"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=JFR or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:55 ET (08:55 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"682ddcd2a2f99118b36a9df2dca759ae","symR":["VLY"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Valley National Bancorp","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VLY"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Valley National Bancorp: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=VLY or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:42 ET (09:42 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"685c14631aaf0003b77a448277631e46","symR":["NEWC"],"date":"2007-04-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"=WSJ: New Century Might Announce Bankruptcy Filing Monday","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-02T02:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NEWC"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","REA","REI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \b   By James R. Hagerty and Joann S. Lublin \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  New Century Financial Corp. is expected to make an announcement early Monday about the home-mortgage company's efforts to cope with a cutoff of credit from its lenders, people familiar with the situation said. \u001d  The company is widely expected to seek relief from creditors through a bankruptcy filing. \u001d  New Century ranked second last year among lenders to subprime borrowers, those with weak credit records or large debts in relation to their income. The Irvine, Calif.-based company has become an emblem of the recent turmoil in the subprime market caused by a loss of confidence among investors who buy loans from such lenders. A rash of defaults has scared away investors and forced New Century and many other lenders to repurchase soured loans they had sold to Wall Street packagers of securities backed by mortgages. \u001d  New Century was one of the fastest-growing mortgage lenders until recently. Its loan originations jumped to $59.8 billion in 2006 from $6.3 billion five years before. But the company announced in early February that it would need to restate earnings for the first three quarters of 2006, partly to reflect the higher-than-expected costs of defaults. New Century also said it expects to report a loss for all of 2006 but couldn't yet quantify that loss. In addition, the company has announced that it is the subject of a federal criminal investigation into its accounting and trading in its shares. \u001d  In early March, New Century stopped making loans because too many creditors had cut off funding. Since then, the company's top officers have been closeted with lawyers and other advisers in an effort to sell assets and appease creditors, while state regulators have rushed to clamp tighter controls on the company. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 22:33 ET (02:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"686aaf104cf1974ec1052a83a7c76489","symR":["MVSN"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Macrovision Corporation","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MVSN"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Macrovision Corporation: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=MVSN or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:36 ET (08:36 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"6892804785361e75382791048f2db523","symR":["CLBR.LN","GB00B09LSD21"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Caliber Global Investment Ltd.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CLBR.LN","GB00B09LSD21"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","RED"],"Story":"\u001d  Caliber Global Investment Ltd.: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B09LSD21 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:28 ET (07:28 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"6894f6a3ac4fe5ce391d94b3b9ca4a9d","symR":["RNK.UN.T","CA75087Q1000"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Rainmaker Income Fund Reports -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T14:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RNK.UN.T","CA75087Q1000"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","MOV"],"Story":"\bDepreciation and Amortization \b \bDepreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment increased $1.6 million in 2006 to $5.5 million as compared to $3.9 million in 2005.

These transactions are not expected to recur and if excluded from the calculation, distributable cash for 2006 would have been $4.7 million or $0.27 per unit. \b \bAs discussed above under Results of Operations there are a number of other factors which have negatively impacted distributable cash including the payment of restructuring costs and the net loss of Rainmaker Entertainment. \b \bDistributions declared were $8.3 million or $0.48 per unit for both 2006 and 2005.

The Fund indirectly holds an interest in Specialty Foods Group, Inc. (\"SFG\" or the \"Company\"). \b \bResults of Continuing Operations \b \b ------------------------------- \b \bIn accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in Canada, operating results presented for 2006 and 2005 reflect continuing operations subsequent to the Company's decision to offer the Owensboro Business Unit and its related brands for sale. \b \bNet sales in 2006 totaled $160.9 million compared with $161.1 million for 2005, a decline of 0.1%. Sales unit volume decreased by 3.5% or 3.4 million pounds reflecting continued product portfolio management with a focus on higher margin products. \b \bGross profit in 2006 amounted to $29.6 million versus $25.2 million for 2005, an increase of 17.5%. Gross margin rates per unit improved due primarily to lower cost of raw material and product portfolio management efforts. \b \bSelling, general, and administrative expenses totaled $21.7 million in 2006 or an increase of $2.4 million compared with prior year. The primary contributors to the increase were higher royalties, brokerage fees, and medical costs. \b \bRestructuring charges in 2006 totaled $6.1 million representing (1) $4.1 million of expenses related to the closure of the Williamston, North Carolina plant, (2) $1.1 million for severance of Corporate employees, and (3) $0.9 million for professional services related primarily to Company restructuring activities. There were no restructuring charges in 2005. \b \bAmortization for 2006 of $2.9 million versus $2.7 million in 2005 was attributable to capital spending in support of the Company's operations. \b \b2006 EBITDA was $7.8 million compared with $5.9 million in 2005, an increase of 32.2%, reflecting primarily the increase in gross profit offset partially by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. \b \bNon-recurring Adjustments to Income \b \b ---------------------------------- \b \bThe debt forgiveness income in 2006 ($17.7 million) related to the issuance of Convertible Secured Debentures (\"CSDs\" - $6.9 million) on June 14, 2006 in full consideration of Exchangeable Subordinated Debentures (\"ESDs\" - $24.6 million) sold in a private placement transaction on February 26, 2004. \b \bImpairment loss of goodwill and intangible assets ($19.6 million) reflected the difference between implied goodwill for the Company and that recorded as of year-end 2005. The carrying amount for goodwill and intangibles as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was $31.0 million and $49.6 million, respectively. \b \bAmortization of deferred financing fees and debt discount in 2006 totaled $3.6 million and represented primarily transaction costs related to Company refinancing activities completed in 2006 and prior years. Costs are amortized over the lives of the financing agreements. \b \bInterest expenses in 2006 were $8.7 million compared with $7.0 million in 2005. Interest costs include interest incurred on bank related debt, CSDs, ESDs, and other debt of the Company. The increase in 2006 interest expense compared with the prior year reflected primarily interest on CSDs issued on June 14, 2006. \b \bManagement Actions \b \b ----------------- \b \bFiscal Year 2006 was a difficult year for the Company. Although the businesses that comprise continuing operations are quite healthy, operating income in 2006 for the consolidated Company declined to a loss of $10.5 million. Several actions have been taken to position SFG for improved profitability for 2007 and beyond: \b \b \b    << \b    1.  The decision was made to offer the Owensboro Business Unit and its \b        related brands (Field, William Fischer, Fischer's, Kentucky Legend, \b        and Mickelberry's) for sale. An Offering Memorandum was issued in \b        January 2007, and the sale process is ongoing. It is expected that \b        SFG will be a more profitable, focused enterprise; however, there is \b        no guarantee the business will be sold. The decision to sell the \b        Owensboro Business Unit requires that its results for 2006 and 2005 \b        be presented as discontinued operations. \b \b    2.  The Williamston, North Carolina hotdog manufacturing facility was \b        closed as of December 15, 2006 to align production capacity with \b        sales requirements. All production needs of Company branded hotdogs \b        were transferred to the Chicago, Illinois facility which should \b        reduce annual plant operating expenses by approximately $6 million. \b        The Williamston plant is currently for sale. \b \b    3.  The Mosey's brand was sold during the fourth quarter of 2006. \b        Profitability had been steadily declining, and management believed \b        that the brand represented limited growth opportunities. \b \b    4.  Company leadership was changed in December 2006 to provide greater \b        focus on improving business results. Bonita Then, a Trustee of the \b        Fund and a member of the Board of SFG, agreed to serve as interim \b        President and Chief Executive Officer. Joseph McCloskey, a former \b        Chief Executive Officer of the Company subsidiary, SMG Inc. was \b        appointed special advisor to the Company. \b \b    5.  The bank lending group and the lead administrative agent of the \b        Company's bank credit agreement were replaced during February 2007. \b        The amended and restated credit agreement is with The CIT \b        Group/Business Credit, Inc., a lender experienced in turnaround \b        situations. The new credit agreement provides the Company greater \b        flexibility during this transitional phase. \b \b    6.  In March 2007, the Company implemented a significant reduction in \b        staff that should reduce annual overhead expenses by more than \b        $3 million. While this was a difficult decision, it will help ensure \b        the Company returns to acceptable profitability and meet the needs of \b        all stakeholders. \b    >> \b \b \bIn summary, 2006 was a year of transition and positioning for the future. Difficult decisions were made that were necessary for SFG to return to acceptable profit levels. As usual, despite the difficult operating environment, the people at SFG continue to produce the highest quality products for which we are famous and to give the best service to our customers. \b \b \b    << \b     A recap of the selected financial and operating information follows. \b \b        Results of Continuing Operations for the Years Ended December 30, \b              2006 and December 31, 2005 (Dollars in thousands) \b \b                                                    Year Ended    Year Ended \b                                                   December 30,  December 31, \b    (in thousands of U.S. dollars)                        2006          2005 \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    Net Sales                                       $  160,902    $  161,075 \b    Cost of Goods Sold                                 131,342       135,925 \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b      Gross Profit                                      29,560        25,150 \b    Selling, General and Administrative Expenses        21,731        19,298 \b    Amortization                                         2,871         2,701 \b    Restructuring                                        6,126             -

The firm charged for its services by the hour, and the bill has reached more than $3 million, sources said, and continues to climb. The alliance is also paying lobbyists on Capitol Hill, who last year pushed for government funding to assist the industry. Some money is being used to raise consumer awareness of U.S.-caught shrimp. The money is also helping to pay for the alliance's office rental, and has allowed the group to lower annual membership dues to $25 from $200. \u001d  But the same old pressures loom for Mr. Williams and the rest of the industry. In Tarpon Springs, only a half-dozen boats now regularly tie up along the Anclote, down from 50 or so three decades ago. Mr. Williams says he only puts two of his four boats out on the water at a time, given what he expects to make in sales. He stopped going out to sea in the mid-1990s to focus on business operations. \u001d  Last year, Mr. Williams received $52,000 in Byrd payments. He also gets a $30,000 salary as the alliance's executive director. Still, Mr. Williams says he remains saddled with debt, carrying more than $30,000 on his credit cards alone. \"I'm one of thousands in the same shape\" in shrimping communities across the South, he says. \u001d  In February, on the tariff's second anniversary, the shrimp alliance requested the government conduct another broad tariff review. But now new shrimper factions want a piece of the action: A group representing shrimpers and processors, the Louisiana Shrimp Association, has filed its own review request. \u001d  The Southern Shrimp Alliance didn't \"give us a dime\" of the last settlement with foreign producers, complains fisherman A.J. Fabre, who heads the Barataria, La.-based group. \u001d  Meanwhile, the state of Louisiana, which had provided early funding to the shrimp alliance, has made inquiries about alliance's finances and whether the state should receive a share of the money. Mr. Williams says no money has been paid to Louisiana, and that the alliance has explained its handling of the money to state officials. A spokeswoman for the Louisiana attorney general says the state's inquiry is continuing. \u001d  Squeezing into a booth in the back of a restaurant on the Anclote River near the boat docks, Mr. Williams scans the menu, and decides against shrimp. Probably not locally caught, he muses, ordering a burger instead. \"We're not asking for anything out of the ordinary,\" he says, defending the hardball tactics. \"We're asking for what's fair.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  Thu Nguyen contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 23:04 ET (03:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"69aacfe063682c2eed906acf90912e1c","symR":["OMN"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for OMNOVA Solutions","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OMN"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  OMNOVA Solutions: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=OMN or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:08 ET (09:08 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"69aad44440c1c21fc454b865b43932b8","symR":["34569.AE","TEF","TEF.MC","ES0178430E18","NL0000345692"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(4/2) Telefonica Looks To Shed Endemol Unit","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T23:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["34569.AE","TEF","TEF.MC","ES0178430E18","NL0000345692"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","FTS","MED","MOV","TLS","XDJGI","XGTI","XIBEX","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Jason Sinclair and Jessica Hodgson \u001d  Seven years after acquiring Endemol Entertainment Holding NV in the middle of a dot-com-era splurge, Telefonica SA is on the verge of disposing of the Dutch television producer for sharply less than the original 5.5 billion euros($7.35 billion) price tag. \u001d  Friday is the deadline for initial offers that could value Endemol at 3 billion euros, according to a person close to the situation. Afterward, Telefonica will begin a second phase of the disposal effort with a short list, although a decision isn't expected until early May, a person familiar with the sale process said. \u001d  Telefonica's sale of its 75% stake comes as no surprise. The Spanish company, one of the world's largest telecommunications concerns by market volume, has said since 2005 that it regards Endemol, which makes and sells the rights to television formats such as \"Big Brother\" and \"Deal or No Deal,\" as a noncore business. \u001d  Telefonica repeatedly has said it wants to concentrate efforts on its core telecommunications, broadband and television business and sell off noncore assets. \u001d  Market observers have said Telefonica's disposal strategy could help fuel the company's aggressive acquisition strategy. To calm investors, Telefonica promised to limit its capital expenditures to 1.5 billion euros until the end of 2007, though an influx of fresh capital would allow the company to finance further buys. \u001d  Telefonica is particularly interested in the high-growth Brazilian market. But first, Telefonica needs to dispose of Endemol, which was a major part of a shopping spree conducted by previous Chief Executive Juan Villalonga. \u001d  In November 2005, Telefonica floated 25% of Endemol on the Amsterdam market at 9 euros a share. Since then, the shares have risen steadily, with the price taking off in recent months as takeover speculation gathered pace. \u001d  --- \u001d  Tjeerd Wiersma contributed to this article. \b \u001d

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(CCNMatthews - March 30, 2007) - Antrim Energy Inc. (\"Antrim\") (TSX:AEN)(AIM:AEY), an international oil and gas exploration and production company, today reported record financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 - and a strong outlook based on a significant increase in reserves. \b \b2006 Highlights \b \b- Proved and probable reserves increased 435% over 2005. \b \b- Oil and gas revenue grew 17% over 2005. \b \b- Oil and gas production increased 24.2% over 2005. \b \b- Average net gas production increased 50.7% over 2005. \b \b- Cash flow from operations grew 47.6% over 2005. \b \b- Net income reached a record $1.3 million. \b \b2006 Management Commentary \b \b\"Antrim generated outstanding results in 2006, registering significant increases in all key measures,\" said Stephen Greer, President and CEO. \"The most important highlights were the fact that reserves increased 435% year over year and drilling results in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina and at East Causeway in the UK North Sea met or exceeded our expectations. These results indicate that our focused strategy of increasing production in Argentina and high-impact exploration in the UK North Sea is generating significant value and strengthening our foundation.\" \b \bAdded Anthony J. Potter, Chief Financial Officer: \"The purchase of the majority interest in the Fyne & Dandy oil fields in the United Kingdom and acquiring Medianera in Argentina during 2006 definitely enhanced our position and prospects. Our strong cash flow performance, year-end working capital position and debt-free status support our business strategy and the achievement of all of our shareholder objectives in 2007.\" \b \b2007 Agenda \b \bMr. Greer expects 2007 to be an active and productive year for Antrim as \"we plan to accelerate our drilling successes on both international frontiers of Argentina and the UK North Sea by building on the momentum of 2006.\" \b \bAmong the activities planned or underway: \b \b- In Tierra del Fuego, work began in the first quarter of 2007 to acquire an additional 260 km2 of new 3D seismic to allow Antrim to identify both infield development locations and undrilled fault block exploration locations. Drilling of up to 10 wells in Tierra del Fuego is expected to resume in the second quarter of 2007. \b \b- Also in Tierra del Fuego, an expansion of gas processing facilities and installation of a pipeline that will connect the Las Violetas concession to the San Martin pipeline is in progress. The expansion, projected for completion August 2007, is expected to raise gas sales capacity from approximately 21 million cubic feet per day to between 35 and 40 million cubic feet per day at which time previous gas discoveries are expected to be placed on production. Negotiations are underway for liquids-rich gas sales prior to the start-up of the expanded processing facilities. Additional oil pipeline, storage and treatment facilities are also planned for 2007 to enable increased oil production. \b \b- At least one exploration well is planned in 2007 for each of the Medianera and Capricorn blocks. In the Puesto Guardian concession, processing of 330 km2 of 3D seismic data is expected to be completed in May 2007, leading to a drilling program on the concession in 2007-2008. \b \b- In the United Kingdom, Antrim intends to follow-up the East Causeway discovery with a drilling program of up to three wells commencing in the second quarter of 2007. Antrim also plans to participate in the drilling of the Kerloch prospect in the northwest area of Block 211/22a in the fourth quarter of 2007. A seismic acquisition program on the Fyne & Dandy oil fields is expected to begin shortly in the second quarter of 2007. \b \b \bAnnual Results \b \b                                                    2006     2005     2004 \b                                                -------------------------- \b (Cdn $000's except per share amounts) \b Oil and gas revenue                              12,644   10,807    6,900 \b Cash flow from operations                         3,733    2,530      400 \b Cash flow from operations per share                0.06     0.06     0.01 \b Net income (loss)                                 1,342   (3,190)  (5,586) \b Net income (loss) per share                        0.02    (0.07)   (0.16) \b Total assets                                    145,151   60,227   35,124 \b Working capital                                  55,392   29,969   20,325 \b Capital expenditures                             61,163   17,976    6,362 \b Debt                                                  -        -        - \b \b Common shares outstanding (000's) \b End of year                                      87,059   54,886   39,487 \b Weighted average - basic                         66,918   43,824   33,966 \b Weighted average - diluted                       76,326   44,669   34,644 \b \bAnnual Operating Highlights \b \b                                                    2006     2005     2004 \b                                                -------------------------- \b Proved and probable reserves (mmboe)               33.3      6.2      1.4 \b Oil, natural gas and NGL production BOE(1)/day    1,157      931      491 \b \b(1)The BOE conversion ratio of 6 mcf:1 bbl is based on an energy \b    equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip \b    and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. \b \b \bNote to Reader \b \bThe audited consolidated financial statements, notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2006 are available on Antrim's website at www.antrimenergy.com and will be available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. \b \bForward-Looking Statements \b \bCertain forward-looking statements are made in this news release, including statements regarding possible future business.

and outstanding shares of Deepwell Disposal Services Inc. (\"DDSI\") in exchange for 356,000 Class B Trust Units valued at $3,560,000. Due to common management and directors, the Trust and DDSI were related parties at the time of the acquisition. The exchange amount was used for financial reporting purposes because the change in the ownership interests in the assets transferred is substantive, and estimated fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill for both acquisitions were provided by an independent evaluator. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bAccounting changes and pronouncements \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bFinancial instruments, other comprehensive income \b \bThis pronouncement, effective for fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 2006, addresses when to recognize, and how to measure, a financial instrument on the balance sheet and how gains and losses are to be presented. An additional financial statement, other comprehensive income, is required in certain circumstances. The Trust currently has no items that would create other comprehensive income. The fair values of those financial instruments, which are designated as hedges, are to be included on the balance sheet as a financial asset or liability with the related mark-to-market gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income. Because the Trust did not have any derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2006, this required change will have no effect on the Trust's reported financial position or net income. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bDisclosure and internal controls \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bThe Trust's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that material information related to the Trust is made known. In addition, internal controls over financial reporting have been designed or have been caused to be designed under the supervision of the CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. They are assisted in these responsibilities by other members of the Trust's management team. \b \bThe Trust has conducted a review and evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Trust's CEO and CFO conclude that as at December 31, 2006, the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures are adequate to provide reasonable assurance that material information related to the Trust is made known to them by others within the Trust. \b \bDuring the Trust's assessment of its system of internal controls as defined under Multilateral Instrument 52-109, the Trust identified the following weakness in internal controls over financial reporting: \b \bDue to the limited number of staff, it is not feasible to achieve the \b \bcomplete segregation of incompatible duties. \b \bThe broad scope of senior management's oversight and strong entity level control are expected to compensate for any individual internal control weakness. In addition, the weakness identified is mitigated by: the active involvement of senior management in all the affairs of the Trust; open lines of communication within the Trust; the present levels of activities within the Trust being relatively transparent; the thorough review of the Trust's financial statements by management and the establishment of a whistle-blower policy. However these mitigating factors will not necessarily eliminate the likelihood that a material restatement will occur as a result of the aforesaid weakness in the Trust's internal controls over financial reporting. \b \bIt should be noted that a control system, including the Trust's disclosure and internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met and it should not be expected that the disclosure and internal controls will prevent all errors or fraud. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bForward looking statements \b \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 10:22

expected during 2007 as new drilling information becomes available and is incorporated to existing geological models. \b \bPre-Feasibility Study \b \bOn the basis of the results of the November 2005 Conceptual Study completed by Cube Consulting which indicated that a gold mine supporting production of approximately 240,000 ozs of gold per annum was possible, the company engaged Lycopodium Engineering and Cube Consulting to undertake a pre-feasibility study on the Moto Gold Project. This study commenced in December 2005 and was completed in July of 2006, based on approximately 5 million ounces of indicated resources, the study showed that project economics were robust and that it was worth advancing to a bankable feasibility study which was subsequently commenced in October 2006. It is expected the bankable feasibility study will enhance the project physicals and economics. The principal pre-feasibility study findings are listed below. \b \b \b    << \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    Design and modelling gold price assumption           US$500 per ounce Au \b    Resource base used for PFS modelling                5.077 million ounces \b    Average Throughput                            3 million tonnes per annum \b    Average Gold Production                         290,000 ounces per annum \b    Mine, Plant and infrastructure capital \b     expenditure                                              US$296 million \b    Project pay back period at \b     US$600 per ounce Au                               Approximately 3 years \b    Estimated cash costs                                    US$274 per ounce \b    Mining Reserves (probable)                  25.6mt at 3.4 g/t for 2.8moz \b    Estimated Mine Life                                Approximately 8 years \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    >> \b \b \bThe pre-feasibility study used only indicated resources and did not take into account approximately 10.8 million ounces of inferred resources. The study was based on the mining of 6 open pits with an average strip ratio of 6.1:1 and a nominal plant throughput of 3 million tonnes per year at an average grade of 3.6 g/t gold and an estimated cash cost of US274 per ounce. The mining schedule was optimised within the limits of the study however the opportunity remains to enhance this side of the project/this will be reviewed as part of the bankable feasibility study. The process route chosen was a standard CIL circuit for the treatment of oxide ore with the inclusion of a floatation and ultra fine grind circuit prior to the leach circuit for fresh ore. Metallurgical test work for the pre-feasibility study was not optimised and early indications are that this area will present an opportunity for optimisation and improvement in the bankable feasibility study resulting in a positive impact on project economics. \b \bCosting for the project, as set out in the pre-feasibility study, assumes that hydro electric power is used to run the operation for approximately 80% of the year, and this is a key economic driver for the project. Approximately 30% of the project capital costs are attributed to infrastructure including US$53 million for the construction of a hydro electric facility, while mining fleet, pre-strip and processing plant comprise a further 36% of the estimated capital expenditure. Significant amounts were also allowed for logistics; engineering, procurement and construction management (\"EPCM\"); contingency and owners costs. \b \bBankable Feasibility Study \b \bThe Company has retained the same team who completed the pre-feasibility study to undertake the bankable feasibility study. The principal engineer Lycopodium Engineering Pty Ltd from Perth, Western Australia (WA) will manage key elements of and compile the bankable feasibility study. Their scope includes management of a significant metallurgical test work program, process flow sheet definition, design and costing of the process plant and infrastructure, management of Knight Piesold and compilation of the overall study. The team of consultants working with Lycopodium include: \b \b \b    << \b        -  Cube Consulting (Perth WA) - Resource Estimates and Mine Design \b \b        -  Ammtech (Australian Metallurgical and Mineral testing consultants) \b           (Perth WA) - Metallurgical test work \b \b        -  SGS Ghana - Environmental and Social studies \b \b        -  George Orr & Associates (Perth WA) - Geotechnical studies \b \b        -  Knight Piesold (through Lycopodium, Perth, WA) - Tailings dam \b           design, hydrogeological studies, civil engineering and hydro \b           electric facility study and design. \b    >> \b \b \bActivities in relation to bankable feasibility study are ongoing and the Company is continuing to work towards completion of the bankable feasibility study by mid to late 2007. Following approval of the bankable feasibility study by the Company's Board and relevant stakeholders, including Okimo, the Company intends to move into the value engineering stage of the project in the second half of 2007 and review the requirements for securing long lead items needed for the construction and start up of the mining operation. The Company has continued with the work to prepare the bankable feasibility study since the challenges to the Company's title have been received as the Board considers this to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders, including Okimo and the DRC Government. Consequently the Board does not currently envisage any delay in the process, but this will need to be kept under review and the shareholders informed appropriately. \b \bRegional Exploration \b \bThe Company continued soil sampling programmes on a number of untested gold occurrences. Several regional targets were tested using the RC drill rig with encouraging results as reported throughout the course of 2006. Follow up work is planned as a matter of process in respect of significant gold-in-soil anomalies identified to date with a number of potential areas to follow up. \b \bExpenditure \b \bExploration and feasibility costs during the period ended December 31, 2006 on the Moto Gold Project totalled approximately $22.8 million. These costs included infill and exploration drilling, sterilisation and geotechnical drilling, consumables, staff costs, fuel, equipment, consultants, metallurgical test work, mine design and environmental analysis costs. These costs are in accordance with budget expectations. As noted above the work being undertaken is expected to result in completion of bankable feasibility work by mid to late 2007. Estimated expenditures to complete the bankable feasibility study are set out below. \b \bOther Mineral Interests \b \bThe Company also holds interests through joint ventures in a number of other exploration properties in Burundi in Central Africa and in Western Australia. \b \bBurundi Joint Venture (Moto diluting to 15%) \b \bThe Group is a party to an agreement in respect of three areas of Central Burundi in Central Africa totalling 376 square kilometres. The projects are prospective for nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum. A major North American mining company can earn a 65% interest (Moto diluting to 15%) by sole funding US$4.875 million exploration expenditure. \b \bGidji Joint Venture (Moto 30% and diluting) \b \bThe Group is party to a joint venture with Placer Dome covering approximately 50 km2 in the eastern goldfields region of Western Australia. Moto has an interest of approximately 30% in the joint venture, and this interest is reducing as Moto is not contributing to the current exploration programme. \b \bPilbailey Joint Venture (Moto 16% and diluting) \b \bThe Group is party to a joint venture with Harmony Gold Mining Ltd covering approximately 75 km2 in the eastern goldfields region of Western Australia. Moto has an interest of approximately 16% in the joint venture, and this interest is reducing as Moto is not contributing to the current exploration programme. \b \bCorporate \b \bIn conjunction with the change in the focus of the Company from the exploration stage at the Moto Gold Project to project feasibility and development, a number of significant appointments were made to the board of directors and the management team. \b \b \b    << \b        -  In August 2006 Mr Mark Arnesen was appointed Chief Financial \b           Officer and was appointed to the board as a Finance Director. \b           Mr Arnesen has extensive experience in the structuring and \b           negotiation of finance for major resource projects in Africa. \b           Mr Andrew Dinning, the Company's Chief Operating Officer, has also \b           joined the board as an Executive Director. \b \b        -  In February 2006 Mr Louis Watum was appointed as General Manager \b           for the DRC operations. Mr Watum is Congolese and a metallurgist \b           by training and has extensive international mining industry \b           experience, he was the operations manager at Yatela in Mali for \b           Anglogold Ashanti prior to joining the company. Mr Watum has \b           direct responsibility for daily management of operations in the \b           DRC and is involved in in-country affairs. \b \b        -  In January 2007 Mr Antony Cronin was appointed as Group Chief \b           Accountant and with effect from March 2007 as Company Secretary, \b           following the resignation of Mr Patrick Flint. Mr Cronin has \b           extensive experience in public company administration, corporate \b           regulation and mine site operations within the resources industry. \b    >> \b \b \bIn March 2006 the Company completed a bought deal of 5.5 million common shares at C$7.65 per share for gross proceeds of C$42.1m to be used primarily to fund the exploration programme, the feasibility study and proposed mine development at the Moto Gold project. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 10:15 ET (14:15

PetroFalcon Corporation (\"PetroFalcon\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX:PFC), which has oil and gas operations in Venezuela through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Vinccler Oil and Gas, C.A. (\"Vinccler Venezuela\"), today released its annual consolidated financial statements and related Management Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for the year ended December 31, 2006. \b \bFor the year ended December 31, 2006, the Corporation reported a net loss of US$6.7 million (a loss per share of US$0.08) compared to net income of US$1.0 million (earnings per share of US$0.01) for the year ended December 31, 2005. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2006, is due to lower production on a net basis and higher operating expenses caused by the transition to the new joint venture structure, as well as higher stock-based compensation and interest expense. \b \bJuan Francisco Clerico, the Corporation's Chairman and CEO, said, \"Despite our financial results, we made significant operational progress in 2006 by finalizing the transition from the former operating service agreements to PetroCumarebo, our new joint venture with PDVSA. PetroCumarebo mobilized a rig in December 2006 and began drilling its inventory of development prospects in the East and West Falcon blocks. We are committed to Venezuela and look forward to increasing production of oil and natural gas.\" \b \bAs at December 31, 2006, the Corporation had working capital of US$4.3 million, compared to working capital of US$6.5 million on September 30, 2006. Production before royalties for the year ended December 31, 2006, was 323,316 barrels of oil equivalent (\"boe\") net to PetroFalcon, compared to 328,367 boe for the same period in 2005. The average price received for the year ended December 31, 2006, was US$59.34 per barrel (\"bbl\") of oil and US$1.48 per thousand cubic feet (\"mcf\") of natural gas, for a combined average price received of US$35.72 per boe. This compares to US$35.46 per bbl of oil and US$1.33 per mcf of natural gas for a combined average of US$34.49 per boe for the same period in 2005. \b \bCurrent Status of PetroCumarebo \b \bPetroFalcon, through Vinccler Venezuela, owns 40% of PetroCumarebo, a joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (\"PDVSA\"), the Venezuelan state-owned oil and gas company. As previously announced, PetroCumarebo, S.A. was legally incorporated on October 24, 2006. On November 24, 2006, PetroCumarebo received the presidential transfer decree to operate the East Falcon Block and West Falcon Block, the ceremonial last step in the conversion from the previous East and West Falcon operating service agreements to PetroCumarebo. On December 28, 2006, Vinccler Venezuela contributed its 40% share of PetroCumarebo's first month of working capital, a total of approximately US$2.1 million. As a result of the conversion to PetroCumarebo, Management has included Vinccler Venezuela's proportional share of PetroCumarebo's revenues and earnings in PetroFalcon's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2006. \b \bAs of March 30, 2007, Vinccler Venezuela has been reimbursed by PDVSA for the operating and capital expenditures advanced by Vinccler Venezuela on behalf of PetroCumarebo during the transition period in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2006. However, due to the delay in the transition to the new joint venture, PetroCumarebo was not able to officially invoice PDVSA for oil production delivered in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2006 until March 29, 2007. PetroCumarebo has now invoiced PDVSA for oil production (net of royalties), and PDVSA has officially received the invoice, totaling approximately US$12.3 million. PetroCumarebo expects payment from PDVSA within 45 days. PetroCumarebo has not yet officially invoiced PDVSA for natural gas production delivered in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2006 (approximately US$1.7 million net of royalties), because it has not yet received confirmation from the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy and Petroleum for the natural gas volumes delivered during this period. However, PetroCumarebo expects to finalize the natural gas invoice in the second quarter of 2007. \b \bGiven the sequence of events and the recent submission of the initial invoice to PDVSA, PetroCumarebo does not have a history of payment from PDVSA. Until the parties have established a pattern of invoicing and receiving payment, it is possible that amounts invoiced may not be paid by PDVSA in a timely manner in accordance with the contractual terms. \b \bOperations Update \b \bPetroCumarebo delivers natural gas into PDVSA's Interconnection Centro Occidente (\"ICO\") natural gas pipeline, which then transports the natural gas to the nearby Paraguana Refinery Complex. As previously announced, the ICO pipeline section leading to PetroCumarebo's production in the Cumarebo Field was closed on December 6, 2006. As a result, most of PetroCumarebo's natural gas production is temporarily shut-in, but its wells and facilities are unaffected. As of March 30, 2007, Management has not received official notice regarding the timeframe for resuming natural gas deliveries into ICO. Currently, PetroCumarebo has approximately 8 mmcf/d of natural gas and 150 bbls/d of oil shut-in at the Cumarebo Field in the East Falcon Block, which is almost 65% of PetroCumarebo's total oil and natural gas production. \b \bThe current gross production of PetroCumarebo is approximately 875 bbls/d of oil. Depending on available financing and the results of PetroCumarebo's drilling and workover program, PetroCumarebo's 2007 budget of US$27.6 million is estimated to significantly increase production for the East Falcon Block and the West Falcon Block to approximately 2,500 bbls/d of oil and 20 mmcf/d of gas (40% net to Vinccler Venezuela being 1,000 bbls/d of oil and 8 mmcf/d of natural gas). \b \bPetroFalcon has filed its annual consolidated financial statements and related Management Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2006, with Canadian securities regulatory authorities on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (\"SEDAR\"). Copies of these documents may be accessed electronically on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or at www.petrofalcon.com. \b \bPetroFalcon Corporation is a natural resource company currently engaged in oil and gas operations in Venezuela. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Vinccler Oil and Gas, C.A., PetroFalcon owns 40% of PetroCumarebo, S.A., a joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (\"PDVSA\"), the Venezuelan state-owned oil and gas company. Subject to government approval, an assignment agreement and a joint operating agreement, PetroFalcon, through Vinccler Oil and Gas, is acquiring 30% of the offshore natural gas license for the Cardon III Block in the Gulf of Venezuela, where Chevron Corporation is operator and majority partner. The common shares of PetroFalcon trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"PFC\". \b \bCautionary Statement regarding Forward-Looking Information \b \bExcept for statements of historical fact, all statements in this press release, without limitation, regarding PetroCumarebo, joint ventures, new projects, forecasted production, future plans, objectives and results constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation, which involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control.

(TRB) set to announce the results of its six-month-long strategic review passed Saturday without the media giant revealing a decision about its future. \u001d  Members of Tribune's board of directors met Friday and Saturday to consider two offers to buy the nation's second-largest newspaper publisher by circulation. \u001d  Los Angeles billionaires Eli Broad and Ron Burkle have reportedly made an offer valued at $34 per share, according to a person familiar with the offer who was not authorized to disclose details and asked to remain anonymous. A bid by real estate mogul Sam Zell is reportedly valued at $33 per share. \u001d  The Burkle-Broad bid includes $500 million in cash and would use an employee stock ownership plan to raise money for a buyout. It is believed that Zell was proposing to invest $300 million and also would use a stock ownership plan. \u001d  Tribune also is said to be considering a \"self-help\" plan that would involve spinning off the company's broadcast division and borrowing money to pay a one-time cash dividend to shareholders. \u001d  A meeting of the full Tribune board is reportedly scheduled for Sunday. \u001d  Like most newspaper companies, Tribune has been struggling with declining profits, circulation and advertising revenues. Earlier in March the company announced revenue fell 3.4% in February as its publishing division continued to struggle. \u001d  Tribune's share price fell about 50% from early 2004 until last spring and has languished at just above $30 for months, down from an all-time high of $60.88 in 1999. \u001d  The company, owner of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, originally set a January deadline for offers to purchase the company, but none carried the price tag the company had hoped to attract when it began soliciting bids. \u001d  Then came a late-game bid from Zell, 65, who made his fortune reviving moribund real estate. Zell, who proposed using an employee stock ownership plan as a way to lower the taxes of any sale, said he had no plans to break up the company. \u001d  Specific details of how the competing offers would create an ESOP were not available, but experts said it would allow some shareholders, such as the Chandler family, to avoid a capital-gains tax. \u001d  An ESOP is similar to a profit-sharing plan, but allows the company to borrow money and repay loans using pretax dollars. Payments of both interest and principal are tax-deductible and would create more leverage for a buyer. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 00:26 ET (04:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"71657b25bf0ac5f0e9041cfba5752d21","symR":["CB.LN","GB0033696344"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for CBG Group PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CB.LN","GB0033696344"],"IndustryCodes":["INB","INS"],"Story":"\u001d  CBG Group PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0033696344 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:25 ET (07:25 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"71a250a102c4f8cfea0e96b7438d5124","symR":["NUO"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen OH Quality Inc (NUO)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NUO"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen OH Quality Inc (NUO): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NUO or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:03 ET (09:03 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"71a771d706147824669e38601e1fd9b2","symR":["BCV"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Bancroft Fund Ltd.

(7731.TO) group net profit is expected to surge 83% to roughly Y53 billion in the fiscal year ended March, thanks to brisk sales of digital SLR (single-lens reflex) cameras as well as semiconductor steppers, the Nikkei reported in its Saturday morning edition. \u001d  The figure would mark a Y2 billion increase over an earlier projection and the third straight year of record profits. \u001d  Sales are seen rising about 10% to approximately Y805 billion. Operating profit is projected to jump 50% to just over Y100 billion, reaching that threshold for the first time and surpassing the previous forecast by roughly Y5 billion. The firm benefited from cost reductions, streamlined procurement of raw materials and the cheap yen, with operating profit margin estimated to climb over 3 percentage points to about 12%. \u001d  The imaging business, which is responsible for the company's highly profitable digital SLR cameras, served as the main profit engine. Shipments are seen nearing 2.1 million units, over 300,000 more than projected at the beginning of the fiscal year. Nikon bolstered its lineup of SLR cameras with the introduction last December of the D40, a model geared towards novices. The D40 proved popular among owners of Nikon's compact digital cameras, prompting many to upgrade. The firm expects its global market share to inch up several percentage points to almost 40%. \u001d  Sales of steppers, advanced devices used in semiconductor fabrication, are expected to remain unchanged from previous forecasts. The business, however, is enjoying improved profitability thanks to brisk shipments of top-of-the-line models. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 18:18 ET (22:18 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"729bbda23d71576c32f746ada8d863fd","symR":["IPCR"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for IPC Holdings, Ltd.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IPCR"],"IndustryCodes":["INS","INU","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  IPC Holdings, Ltd.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=IPCR or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:24 ET (08:24 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"72a25e821795d29f0e8cdefcc0031820","symR":["VLT"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Van Kampen High Income Trust II (VLT)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VLT"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Van Kampen High Income Trust II (VLT): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=VLT or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:44 ET (09:44 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"72b09556170988084365b1f2deeafb60","symR":["6502.TO","7011.TO","JP3592200004","JP3900000005"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Toshiba Buys U.S. Turbine Servicer For Y2B -Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T22:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6502.TO","7011.TO","JP3592200004","JP3900000005"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","IDD","X225","XATI","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Toshiba Corp.

\u001d  (This article was originally published Friday.) \b \b  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Shai Oster \b \u001d  BEIJING -- With China still tightly regulating fuel prices, big oil companies are increasingly looking at the country's surging demand for chemicals. \u001d  In one of the biggest deals of its kind, Exxon Mobil Corp. Friday signed a deal with Saudi Aramco and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., better known as Sinopec, to expand an oil refinery in China's rich southern province of Fujian. The deal also involves construction of a large chemical facility scheduled for completion by 2009, which executives said was essential to making the broader deal financially attractive. \u001d  Exxon Mobil and Aramco, the Saudi government oil company, will each own 25% of the $5 billion project, with the rest held by Sinopec and the local government. The figure announced Friday is much higher than an earlier announced figure of $3.5 billion. Company executives declined to explain why the project's cost had risen, but higher costs have been felt across the industry because of rising prices for steel and other materials. \u001d  The investors will more than triple capacity at the existing oil refinery in Quanzhou to 240,000 barrels of fuel a day. The deal has been under negotiation since 2001, and important approvals were handed down earlier this year. Aramco will provide oil for the project. \u001d  \"When you look at price controls, refining is a difficult business in China,\" Steve Simon, Exxon Mobil's senior vice president and director in charge of downstream refinery and chemicals, said in an interview. \u001d  Instead of being dependent solely on fuel sales, the new venture will rely initially on its integration with the huge chemical facility -- which will produce millions of tons a year of different chemicals -- to tap into China's quickly expanding market for chemicals. The project will convert oil into the materials used to make plastics, paints, fibers and other basic chemicals essential to China's surging manufacturing sector. Prices for such chemicals aren't regulated in China. \u001d  Mr. Simon said that by 2015, about half of global chemical demand will come from Asia, with China by itself accounting for a fourth. Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC are among the major oil companies already investing in petrochemicals in China. \u001d  The signing Friday at the Great Hall of the People, China's main building for government meetings, also marked Exxon's first big foray into retail gasoline marketing in China. \u001d  A separate contract was signed by Sinopec, Exxon Mobil, and Saudi Aramco for a retail joint venture to manage and operate about 750 filling stations and a network of terminals in Fujian. Royal Dutch Shell and France's Total SA have already established limited regional networks of retail gasoline stations in China. Exxon Mobil is looking into alliances with fast-food outlets or convenience stores for the new gas stations, Mr. Simon said. \u001d  As China grows richer, its middle class is buying cars. Even as the growth in demand for fuel in Japan, Europe and the U.S. tapers off, Exxon expects China's fuel demand to rise at a pace of 4.3% over the next five years, creating an attractive market, Mr. Simon said. \u001d  But China's refiners have been operating at a loss because of government fuel-price controls. China fears raising fuel prices could spark inflation or lead to social unrest among its poor farmers. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 19:47 ET (23:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"75c697b0379e4970d6b64f7057b46998","symR":["AUK.LN","GB0000617950"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Aukett Fitzroy Robinson Plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AUK.LN","GB0000617950"],"IndustryCodes":["ENR","ICS","SVC"],"Story":"\u001d  Aukett Fitzroy Robinson Plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0000617950 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:14 ET (07:14 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"75ed438411e7a4d565b9800e38699310","symR":["CYE"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund III, Inc.

Rick Adams is a director of Cube Consulting Pty Ltd. Rick Adams has sufficient experience which is relevant to gold mineralisation and resource estimation to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the December 2004 Edition of the \"Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves\" (the JORC Code). Rick Adams consents to the inclusion in this report of the Information, in the form and context in which it appears. \b \bThe November 2005 Conceptual Study was undertaken by Cube Consulting Pty Ltd. The objectives of this high level study were a) to provide a first pass indication of the potential of the resource, and b) to provide guidance for exploration drilling with the aim of improving the confidence level of the resource. The assessment is preliminary in nature, and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the preliminary assessment will be realized. \b \bThe July 2006 pre-feasibility study was principally undertaken by Lycopodium Engineering and Cube Consulting Pty Ltd. The objectives of this study were a) provide initial project economics including a capital expenditure estimate for the Moto Gold Project, estimates of operating expenditures and overall project economics, b) provide estimates of project physicals including mining rates and gold output, c) define a way forward to enable planning for completion of a bankable feasibility study in a timely and cost effective manner. The study was completed to a pre-feasibility level of confidence using indicated resources. \b \b \b \b     /CONTACT: in respect of the Company's activities, please contact: Klaus Eckhof, President and CEO, Tel: (61 8) 9240 1377, Email: eckhofk@crcpl.com.au; Mark Arnesen, Financial Director and Chief Financial Officer, Tel: (61 8) 9240 1377, Email: marnesen@motogoldmines.com; Andrew Dinning, Chief Operating Officer, Tel: (61 8) 9240 1377, Email: adinning@motogoldmines.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 10:15 ET (14:15 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"782f78b6b2b56487048ee670de342ae0","symR":["EMI"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Eaton Vance Michigan Municipal Income Trust (EMI)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EMI"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Eaton Vance Michigan Municipal Income Trust (EMI): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=EMI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"786dce8809ee88125d20ef63cad6de98","symR":["APSG"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Applied Signal Technology","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["APSG"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Applied Signal Technology: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=APSG or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:12 ET (07:12 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"78cb6e841b9c090b839331c3a7c996af","symR":["QPN.DB","IE0007172707"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Qualceram Shires PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["QPN.DB","IE0007172707"],"IndustryCodes":["FTR","HPR"],"Story":"\u001d  Qualceram Shires PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=IE0007172707 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:01 ET (09:01 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"792af63a1149a27a49a943c9c814576e","symR":["EFT"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Eaton Vance Floating Rate Income Trust (EFT)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EFT"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Eaton Vance Floating Rate Income Trust (EFT): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=EFT or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:58 ET (07:58 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"7934f44716d523183fe5b0e0840551cd","symR":["SVI.LN","GB0007892358"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for SVG Capital PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SVI.LN","GB0007892358"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  SVG Capital PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0007892358 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:10 ET (09:10 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"7941eccca96743eb43d4ade1fcfdf4b0","symR":["CTO.LN","GB0002015021"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for T.

March 30, 2007) - Rainmaker Income Fund (the \"Fund\") (TSX:RNK.UN), a leading provider of services to the entertainment industry, reports its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. \b \bHighlights \b \b- The Fund had record revenue for 2006 of $47.9 million, an increase of $19.6 million or 69% from the $28.3 million in 2005 due mainly to growth in visual effects and the acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment (formerly Mainframe Entertainment). EBITDA for 2006 was $8.0 million, an increase of $1.2 million or 18% from $6.8 million in 2005. The net loss for 2006 of $2.6 million, compared with net earnings of $2.6 million in 2005 resulted from increased non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $4.1 million and restructuring costs of $2.1 million. \b \b- In the fourth quarter of 2006 revenue was $15.9 million, an increase of $4.8 million or 43% from the $11.1 million in 2005 due to the acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment. EBITDA for the forth quarter of 2006 was $1.6 million, a decrease of $1.7 million from $3.3 million in 2005 as operating costs for visual effects were higher. The net loss for the quarter was $3.6 million compared to earnings of $1.9 million in 2005 and the decrease was again due principally to higher depreciation, amortization and restructuring costs. \b \b- The Fund completed the acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment in October.

The increase in 2006 was due principally to the acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment Inc. (formerly Mainframe Entertainment, Inc.) (\"Rainmaker Entertainment\"), which accounted for revenue of $4.1 million, of which $3.8 million was from animation services. Revenue from visual effects services increased $2.1 million as work on a number of significant feature film projects continued. Offsetting these increases were a decrease in Post production services of $0.3 million, a decrease of $0.8 million in tax credit services of Canada Film Capital and a decrease of $0.3 million in other revenue resulting for the sale of a business line. \b \bOperating and general and administration expenses \b \bOperating costs increased $6.6 million to $13.9 million in 2006 from $7.3 million in 2005. The increase in 2006 was due mainly to the acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment which accounted for $3.4 million of the increase and the balance of $3.2 million was due to the increased operations in visual effects. \b \bGeneral and administration expenses were down slightly due to lower accounting costs. \b \bDepreciation and Amortization \b \bDepreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment increased $0.6 million to $1.8 million in 2006 from $1.2 million in 2005 and amortization of intangible assets increased $1.7 million to $2.0 million in 2006 from $0.3 million in 2005. The increases are due to the acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment. \b \bRestructuring costs \b \bRestructuring costs are comprised of severance costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Rainmaker Entertainment and are not expected to be of a recurring nature. \b \bInterest expense \b \bInterest expense increased $0.3 million in 2006 due to the acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment. \b \bNet (loss) earnings for the period \b \bNet (loss) earnings for the period decreased $5.5 million in 2006 to a loss of $3.6 million from net earnings of $1.9 million in 2005. The decrease was due to the acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment which reported a net loss of $3.2 million for fourth quarter of 2006 as a number of animation projects were delayed into 2007 and $1.2 million was recorded for restructuring costs. Rainmaker LP's visual effects reported a loss of $0.8 million as costs were higher due to the challenging nature of the current projects as we build our technical capabilities to take on bigger and more complex projects. \b \bYear ended December 31, 2006 compared with December 31, 2005 \b \bRevenue \b \bRevenue increased $19.6 million to $47.9 million in 2006 from $28.3 million in 2005. The increase in revenue in 2006 was due principally to growth in visual effects, the acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment and the inclusion of a full year of payroll and tax credit services following the acquisition of EP Canada and Canada Film capital in August 2005. \b \bVisual effects revenue increased $9.3 million in 2006, which includes an increase of $2.3 million for the London office, to a record $16.2 million. The increase was derived from continued growth in feature film projects as services on Night at the Museum, Garfield 2 and The Da Vinci Code were completed and work on Blades of Glory and Vantage Point commenced. \b \bThe acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment effective July 31, 2006 accounted for an increase in revenue of $5.7 million, which includes $5.2 million from animation services and $0.5 million is from other sources. \b \bEP Canada and Canada Film Capital, which provide the services of payroll processing and tax credit administration and financing, respectively, accounted for an increase in revenue of $5.8 million as the results for 2006 include a full year of operations as compared to only five months in 2005 following the acquisitions on August 4, 2005. \b \bFinally, the sale of the Crossing Studio resulted in a decrease in other revenue of $1.2 million. \b \bOperating and general and administration expenses \b \bOperating costs increased $17.7 million to $37.9 million in 2006 from $20.2 million in 2005. The increase was principally due to an increase in visual effects costs of $7.3 million. EP Canada and Canada Film Capital accounted for $4.7 million of the increase. The acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment accounted for an increase of $5.9 million. \b \bGeneral and administration expenses increased $0.7 million to $2.0 million in 2006 from $1.3 million in 2005. The acquisition of Rainmaker Entertainment accounted for $0.2 million of the increase. EP Canada and Canada Film Capital together accounted for $0.3 million, as 2006 included a full year of operations compared to only 5 months in 2005. The balance of the increase relates to higher legal and trustee fees. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 10:18 ET (14:18 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"7ae15cc4a20a012135b02bb93fd0cb19","symR":["JMC.LN","GB0003435012"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for JPMorgan Chinese IT plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JMC.LN","GB0003435012"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  JPMorgan Chinese IT plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0003435012 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:22 ET (08:22 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"7ae7ae1f598b19e04aead4a62fccbd83","symR":["NST.LN","GB0003286837"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for New Star Financial Opportunities","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NST.LN","GB0003286837"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  New Star Financial Opportunities: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0003286837 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:47 ET (08:47 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"7b03ac3575feeb8b312e96719dcd7391","symR":["C76.SG","CREAF","SG1A98006814"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Creative Technology Sees 3Q Loss Of $20M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T23:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["C76.SG","CREAF","SG1A98006814"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (This story was first published Friday.) \b \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Creative Technology Ltd.

The company boasted blockbuster on-air talent such as Howard Stern. \u001d  Today, CBS and the rest of the radio industry are in a tougher position. Radio revenue at CBS, now totaling $1.96 billion, or 14 % of the parent company's revenue, is 7.6% below where it was when Mr. Mason left in a 2002 management shake-up. Drastic programming changes have resulted in plummeting ratings in important markets like New York. And Mr. Stern has ditched CBS Radio, where he built his career, for Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. \u001d  Regaining momentum at the company will prove challenging, even for an executive with Mr. Mason's experience in radio and at CBS. \"He might be the only guy who can save this thing for them,\" says Jon Sinton, a consultant and former radio executive. \"He will take an active and swift hand in turning the fortunes there, and it ain't going to be easy.\" \u001d  Mr. Mason came up through the programming ranks, working at stations in cities like Atlanta, San Antonio and Washington. He joined Westinghouse as president of Group W radio in 1993 and helped integrate it with various other radio groups that rolled up with Westinghouse in the late 1990s: CBS, Infinity and American Radio Systems Corp. Since leaving in 2002, he has worked as a consultant, with CBS as one of his clients. \u001d  Mr. Mason says that one of his first big tasks will be fixing CBS's operations in the big markets like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, where downturns contributed to a 7% loss in radio revenue for CBS last year. Those cities have suffered from a double whammy of losing Mr. Stern's top-rated morning show at the end of 2005 and format changes on other stations that haven't always worked. \u001d  Finding successors to Mr. Stern turned into a disaster in New York and Chicago, with the replacement shows themselves getting the axe within months. In Los Angeles, the \"Adam Carolla Show\" is muddling along, with hopes that new sidekick Danny Bonaduce will boost ratings. \u001d  CBS also made unpopular format changes. It ditched oldies stations in those three cities and others in favor of the eclectic \"Jack FM\" format, which hops among genres playing hits from the past couple of decades. While Jack is doing fine in Los Angeles, it has been slow to catch on in New York and Chicago. Mr. Mason says it's too early to say what will happen to specific stations. \u001d  One possible opportunity: luring some talent back from satellite radio. \"Any satellite-radio talent would want to be on radio,\" said Mr. Mason. \"It reaches 90% of the population, and satellite has a long way to go before it gets to those levels.\" \u001d  Mr. Mason, whose consulting business focused on digital initiatives, also plans to continue CBS's push into that area. Over the past few years, CBS has ramped up online streaming of its radio stations and moved hard into a new digital platform known as HD Radio. \u001d  Mr. Mason is studying how to beef up use of digital display screens that come with some radios, and evaluating radios that will come with screens big enough to allow streamed video along with audio. \"It's quite conceivable that a radio show would be a television show,\" he says. \u001d  Short term, he sees opportunity in the estimated $2 billion that political candidates will spend in the 2008 elections. \"We will aggressively go after that market next year with targeted research, even down to the Zip Code,\" he says. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 19:47 ET (23:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones

was originally published Saturday.) \b \u001d  MARSEILLE, France (AP)--Workers in the southern port of Marseille agreed Saturday to return to work after an 18-day strike that had tangled oil supplies to refineries around Europe. \u001d  A total of 59 tankers were stranded outside the Fos-sur-Mer oil and gas terminal Saturday due to the strike, which began March 13 because of a dispute over who should be authorized to discharge gas tankers - port employees or employees of gas giant Gaz de France. \u001d  After protracted negotiations, a preliminary deal was signed Friday night between the CGT union, the port management and French gas giant Gaz de France. \u001d  Workers approved the deal on Saturday, and CGT official Pascal Galeote said work could resume in the afternoon. \u001d  Under the deal, GDF workers will unload the gas under the supervision of port agents, Galeote said. He said the aim was to reach a balance between private sector and public sector jobs at the port. \u001d  \"We have managed to advance things in a positive way, but it's not all over yet,\" he said. \u001d  The terminal is part of Marseille's extensive port activities and feeds six refineries in France, Germany and Switzerland with a combined capacity of 1 million barrels a day. \b \u001d  (END)

WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Liam Pleven \u001d  After two years of upheaval, American International Group Inc. finally seems to be stabilizing. In February 2005, the giant insurer disclosed it had received subpoenas regarding its accounting. A month later, Maurice R. \"Hank\" Greenberg, the company's legendary leader, abruptly stepped down, leaving one of his proteges, Martin Sullivan, at the helm. \u001d  The silver-maned Mr. Sullivan, a 52-year-old native of England, has guided AIG through a $1.6 billion settlement with authorities over its accounting, as well as the costly 2005 hurricane season. The company has emerged on what appears to be solid footing, judging by a 34% leap in net income for 2006. Yet investors remain wary; AIG shares are basically unchanged 13 months after the settlement. \u001d  In an interview at his New York office, Mr. Sullivan described how he has tried to preserve the entrepreneurial atmosphere fostered by Mr. Greenberg while tightening oversight. Excerpts: \b \u001d  WSJ: Mr. Greenberg was known as a demanding CEO. You have an easy-going manner. How did people in the organization adjust? \u001d  Mr. Sullivan: One of my colleagues defines me as \"somebody who allows us to manage but ensures we don't go off the reservation.\" I worked with Mr. Greenberg for 35 years, and clearly during that period of time he could see that we had different management styles. But nonetheless I had a very successful career. There's different ways of getting the best out of people. There are people you have to put your arm around and cajole to get better out of them. And there are others you seriously have to kick. I have an open style of management. I will tell you that people realize when I'm not pleased, though. And that's where it has effect because it's rare. \b \u001d  WSJ: How do you get people to change the things you want them to change, and not change the things you don't want them to change? \u001d  Mr. Sullivan: It was important for me to make sure that the message was getting out that we shouldn't lose focus on our customers. One thing about AIG: It's a reasonably flat management structure. So I haven't got to tell too many people before it starts cascading through the global franchise. \b \u001d  WSJ: Was there dissent within AIG about the changes to make? \u001d  Mr. Sullivan: No, I think everybody wanted to maintain the entrepreneurial culture that differentiates AIG from the rest, but recognizing that we had to employ the best governance and compliance that we possibly could. They're not mutually exclusive. What we've done over the last two years is demonstrated quite clearly that we can do it. For me to wake up and find the entrepreneurial culture of AIG had disappeared after 35 years, I'm not sure I'd know what to do. \b \u001d  WSJ: AIG operates in more than 100 countries. Did you have to travel to these other places? \u001d  Mr. Sullivan: Initially, a lot of my attention was on 70 Pine Street, and a lot of time was spent on that very couch. Clearly there were things I had to address in New York City. And then I sent out a couple of key executives who traveled around the world, really just answering employees' questions. It was really making sure they were getting out there before I could then follow up. \b \u001d  WSJ: Did you have to persuade people to stay? \u001d  Mr. Sullivan: There were different people that were going through different feelings, and I addressed them as required, and clearly, reasonably well. I hope I'm not tempting fate. The next guy in here will probably resign. Certainly, people were confused a little bit. So there were people that needed some advice, some guidance and really mentoring. \b \u001d  WSJ: Has AIG turned the page? \u001d  Mr. Sullivan: I'm not sure -- and I wouldn't know, because I'm a lifer here -- but I'm not sure how many other companies could have actually gone through what AIG has gone through and come out of it in the position that AIG is at the end of 2006, as per our results. We had to conduct what many consider the most extensive internal review in corporate America. We've gone through two restatements. We've enacted what I consider to be, and many others consider to be, a very high standard of corporate governance. We've added seven new directors. And we've come out of that at the end of 2006 with adjusted net income of [$15.4 billion], just shy of $1 trillion in assets, over $100 billion in shareholder equity. Whilst we were tackling the issues that had to be confronted, we didn't lose focus on the business. \b \u001d  WSJ: Where do you see AIG going in the coming years? Will the company look largely the same as it does now? \u001d  Mr. Sullivan: Building out on the global franchise that we have is clearly a key priority for us. There are opportunities for us to add to that footprint. Our foreign general [insurance] business, we do billions in Japan, for instance, we have 3.5% market share on the nonlife side. So when my colleagues tell me we're outperforming the market or we're doing better than the economy, I say so we should, there's 97% of the market we don't have. If an M&A came across the transom that made sense, then obviously we would seriously consider that. And then all the time, over and above that, we're dropping little seedlings in around the world that'll grow. Vietnam, for instance, which I'm very excited about -- we have a life and nonlife business there, and I think in 10 years time, we're going to look back and start thinking about Vietnam very similar to the way people were looking at Shanghai 10, 15 years ago. \b \u001d  WSJ: AIG's share price has been trading about where it was when you announced the settlement in February 2006. Some competitors have done better. What's going on with AIG's share price? \u001d  Mr. Sullivan: The management needs to stay focused on generating the quality of the earnings that we can, and hopefully whatever hesitations there are in the stock will dissipate. So I think, from my perspective, just drive the business forward and hopefully you won't have that analysis to make on our share price. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 23:10

 By Paulo Prada \u001d  AirTran Holdings Inc. is expected to announce today that it is sweetening its takeover offer for Midwest Air Group Inc. by about 13%, valuing the Milwaukee-based discount carrier at $389 million, according to people familiar with the situation. \u001d  The higher cash-and-stock proposal, valued at $15 a share, is the latest attempt by AirTran, of Orlando, Fla., to persuade Midwest to negotiate a deal that would unite two low-cost carriers with flight networks and aircraft types seen as complementary by some analysts and investors. \u001d  AirTran also raised its bid in January. The latest offer of $9 a share plus 0.5842 AirTran share represents an 83% premium above the average closing price of Midwest shares during the trading month preceding the initial AirTran bid last October. \u001d  A Midwest spokeswoman said the company's board \"will thoroughly evaluate any future offer and if there is one at this time it will do so and respond appropriately.\" \u001d  A subcommittee of AirTran's board of directors has approved the latest offer, according to people familiar with the situation. The move appears partly aimed at luring additional investors to Midwest shares before the deadline tomorrow, by which time shareholders must own the airline's stock in order to vote at a May 23 shareholder meeting. AirTran has proposed a slate of three directors for election at the meeting. The airline now plans to extend the deadline of a tender offer to Midwest holders to May 16, these people said. \u001d  In 4 p.m. American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Midwest shares rose 24 cents, or 1.8%, to $13.51. AirTran was up seven cents at $10.27 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 22:12 ET (02:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones &

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Gabriel Kahn \u001d  Offers by AT&T Inc. and Mexican affiliate America Movil SA to take a combined 66.6% stake in the holding company that controls Telecom Italia SpA stand to accelerate consolidation among the world's largest telecommunications providers. The bids, which total about 2.6 billion euros ($3.47 billion), will first have to get past nationalist resistance from the Italian government. \u001d  The board of Italian tires-to-telecom group Pirelli & C. SpA yesterday said it had entered into exclusive talks with AT&T and America Movil to sell each company a 33.3% stake in the unlisted holding company Olimpia SpA, which in turn owns 18% of Telecom Italia. (Pirelli owns 80% of Olimpia.) \u001d  AT&T is in the midst of a bold global expansion, and a substantial purchase of Olimpia would give it a beachhead in Europe. Olimpia's 18% stake in Telecom Italia, Italy's largest telecom group, has allowed it to control the company's board. Italy's Benetton family owns the other 20% of Olimpia. If the deal goes through, the two foreign companies would each hold the largest, and equal, stakes in the firm that controls Telecom Italia, a company the Italian government has long wanted to stay in Italian hands. \u001d  Pirelli Chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera had said last month that he was looking to sell out of his money-losing investment in Telecom Italia. However, control of Telecom Italia has become a hot-button political issue, and Mr. Tronchetti Provera has been sparring openly with Prime Minister Romano Prodi over how much influence foreign interests should have in the Italian company. \u001d  Italy's communication's minister, Paolo Gentiloni, in a news release late yesterday, said he was \"extremely worried\" about the possible sale to foreign companies and encouraged Italian banks and investors to counterbid. AT&T and America Movil, which is 8% owned by AT&T, both valued Telecom Italia at 2.82 euros a share less the 2.8 billion euros net debt of Olimpia, implying a value of about 2.6 billion euros for the 66.6% stake. The price is subject to due diligence by the two companies and all the conditions of the contract. Selling at that price would amount to a loss of 3.6 billion euros for Pirelli. However, it amounts to a substantial premium over the 2.13 euros a share Telecom Italia was trading at as of the close Friday in Milan. \u001d  The offer comes after Swisscom AG's bid for Fastweb SpA, which is Italy's second-largest Internet broadband provider and one of the country's largest fixed-line phone providers. Already, three of Italy's four mobile-phone providers are owned by foreigners. Telecom Italia's mobile unit is the last to have remained under Italian control. \u001d  The possibility that Telecom Italia could also wind up in foreign hands has alarmed Mr. Prodi, and he had moved in the past to undercut Mr. Troncehtti Provera's dealings with other foreign firms. \u001d  However, Mr. Tronchetti Provera has been looking for a way to salvage his investment in the company, which he took over in 2001. He has recently concluded that forging an industrial alliance with a large foreign telecom company would be the best way to halt Telecom Italia's slide in the stock market. \u001d  But members of the Italian government have been trying to hamstring his ability to recruit a foreign investor. The government rallied a group of Italian banks to negotiate with Mr. Tronchetti Provera, though the negotiations made little progress because of a difference over the value of the company. \u001d  However, the timing could be crucial. Wednesday is the deadline by which shareholders must present nominations for a new board at Telecom Italia, which will be voted on later this month. If Mr. Tronchetti Provera succeeds in closing the deal before Wednesday, AT&T and America Movil would have tremendous sway over choosing new management. \u001d  The deal, if completed, would mark the latest step in a foreign expansion by AT&T, the biggest phone company in the U.S. by revenue and customers. The company has recently made investments in emerging markets, including Vietnam and South Africa. In October, AT&T won licenses to provide both national and international long-distance calling in India. \u001d  AT&T is also in talks with Telekom Malaysia Bhd. and Singaporean carrier Starhub Ltd. to build a cable line linking Southeast Asia and the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter. Verizon Communications Inc., the chief U.S. rival of AT&T, is also stepping up investments globally. AT&T has customers in 137 countries. \u001d  Though AT&T has made a string of acquisitions lately, including BellSouth Corp., the Italian move reflects that its chairman and chief executive, Edward Whitacre, may not be satisfied with the pace of expansion. Some analysts and industry experts speculate he could next move to acquire a U.S. satellite company to help along AT&T's major rollout of television, which it hopes will assist with its battle against U.S. cable companies. \u001d  --- \u001d  Dionne Searcey contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 19:48 ET (23:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow

Zell","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-02T02:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TRB"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Sarah Ellison \u001d  After months of drama in its boardroom and declining performance at its newspapers, Tribune Co. late yesterday appeared to be firming up a deal to sell itself to Chicago real-estate tycoon Sam Zell, according to people familiar with the matter. \u001d  Over the weekend, Tribune's special committee of the board reviewed competing offers from Mr. Zell and a joint bid from Los Angeles businessmen Eli Broad and Ron Burkle. Both offers propose taking the company private using an employee stock ownership plan. \u001d  Tribune was negotiating late last night and pressing for better terms from both Mr. Zell and Messrs. Burkle and Broad, according to people familiar with the matter. Despite the late wrangling, it appeared that Mr. Zell was likely to clinch the deal, these people said. \u001d  After six months, it appeared that Tribune's board was finally in the place it had been trying to reach: running a real auction. A letter last week from Messrs. Burkle and Broad, proposing a deal valued at $34 a share, pushed Tribune's special committee to try to extract better terms from Mr. Zell, whose offer was valued a dollar less per share than that of Messrs. Burkle and Broad. At the same time, the board demanded better contract terms from the Broad-Burkle team. \u001d  Still, it was possible the board could decide to further extend its self-imposed deadline of March 31. And final important details remained to be ironed out. \u001d  Representatives from the Broad-Burkle camp appeared resigned over the weekend to Mr. Zell's likely success. \"They just don't want to do [a deal] with us,\" said a person familiar with the duo's thinking, referring to Tribune's board. The special committee had asked for additional information from Messrs. Broad and Burkle Friday, but the joint proposal isn't as far along as Mr. Zell's, this person said. The pair requested a merger agreement from the company and expressed surprise that they didn't receive one, according to a person familiar with their thinking. \u001d  The offer from Messrs. Broad and Burkle remained less certain and would take more time to complete, a strike against it in the minds of members of the special committee of Tribune's board. \u001d  Under the terms of his offer before the last-minute talks, Mr. Zell was expected to put in less than $300 million in equity, a fraction of the company's total value of about $7.9 billion, not counting Tribune's existing $4.5 billion in debt. The deal would then unfold in two steps, according to a person familiar with its structure. In the first step, Mr. Zell would invest his equity and receive convertible preferred stock in Tribune. Then, Tribune would borrow money and pay out about $17.50 a share to shareholders. If approved, the company would be taken private, with shareholders receiving an additional payout and the majority of the company being held by an employee stock ownership plan, which would roll future contributions to employee 401(k) funds into the ESOP, effectively providing capital for the buyout without increasing Tribune's debt. \u001d  Should the deal go through, Mr. Zell, who entered the bidding for Tribune at the 11th hour and is known for picking up out-of-favor businesses that scare away most investors, will end up as chairman of the company, which owns newspapers including the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, and a string of TV stations. He has said his interest in the company is financial, and not to promote any political agenda. Messrs. Broad and Burkle, for their part, both talked about their strong emotional ties to the L.A. Times and their desire to protect the paper. \u001d  The sale of the 160-year-old media conglomerate would be the latest sign of the retrenchment of the newspaper industry, which is undergoing a historic shift. Newspapers are under direct assault as never before, mostly from the Internet, which is siphoning off readers and advertisers. Investor confidence has plummeted. \u001d  The past year has been a particularly punishing period. From the moment Tribune first disclosed that its major shareholder -- the Chandler family --  was in open rebellion against company management, Tribune and other newspaper companies have revealed a consistently declining picture of their business. The auction of the company, sparked last summer by the Chandler's complaints about Tribune's stock price, has been stymied by deterioration in the newspaper business. \u001d  --- \u001d  Dennis K.

\u001d  MILAN (Dow Jones)--The board of Italian tires-to-telecom group Pirelli & C. Spa (PC.MI) Sunday entered exclusive talks with U.S. telecommunication operator AT&T (T) and Mexican mobile phone operator America Movil (AMX) to sell 60% of its stake in Italian unlisted holding company Olimpia SpA, people familiar with the situation said Sunday. \u001d  This would pave the way for the two telecommunication operators to take control of Italy's largest telecom group Telecom Italia SpA (TI). Pirelli indirectly controls an 18% interest in Telecom Italia through its 80% stake in Olimpia. \u001d  Italian unlisted holding company Edizione Holding, controlled by the Benetton family, owns the remaining 20% of Olimpia. \u001d  AT&T and America Movil valued Telecom Italia at EUR2.82 per share minus the EUR2.8 billion net debt of Olimpia, the same people said, noting however that the price is subject to due diligence by the two companies and all the conditions of the contract. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 14:56 ET (18:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"93232848b751234f73c5cfe30efffc6f","symR":["FRA"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Blackrock Floating Rate Income Strategies Fund (FRA)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FRA"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Blackrock Floating Rate Income Strategies Fund (FRA): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=FRA or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:25 ET (07:25 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"93c410eb971fc2c2b37b247d6a463ed4","symR":["3681.FR","FR0000036816"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Soci&#233;t&#233; de la Tour Eiffel","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["3681.FR","FR0000036816"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Soci&#233;t&#233; de la Tour Eiffel: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=FR0000036816 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:16 ET (09:16 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"93d3b054085252970911862a3ecd8d19","symR":["NGO"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen CT Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 (NGO)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:53:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NGO"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen CT Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 (NGO): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NGO or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:53 ET (08:53 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"945dc338832cfa463a8f75db71d27918","symR":["GCH"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Greater China Fund Inc.

The following is a press release from Moody's Investors Service: \b \bMoody's Assigns Hsbc Bank (China) First-Time Bfsr And Deposit Ratings \b \u001d  Hong Kong, April 01, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has today assigned first-time ratings to HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited (HSBC China). They are local and foreign currency deposit ratings of A2 (long-term) and Prime-1(short-term), and a bank financial strength rating (BFSR) of D. The outlook for the long-term deposit ratings is positive and for the BFSR stable. \u001d  HSBC China is wholly owned by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC HK) (Aa2 positive/B+ stable) in Hong Kong, which is in turn also wholly owned by HSBC Holdings Plc (Aa2/positive) in the UK. HSBC China is a newly locally incorporated bank, which was converted from the branches of HSBC HK in Mainland China. \u001d  The A2 long-term deposit ratings incorporate Moody's view on the strong implicit support from its parent HSBC HK. However, they are also constrained by China's A2 sovereign country ceilings. The positive outlook for HSBC China's deposit ratings reflects Moody's positive outlook on China's sovereign ceilings. \u001d  \"Its D BFSR reflects its strong intrinsic value as an integrated and strategically crucial part of the HSBC group, its solid brand name in China, and its position as the leading franchise among foreign bank subsidiaries in the Mainland,\" says Yan. \"The BFSR also considers its well-designed strategy to take advantage of opportunities presented by the opening of a rapidly growing Chinese banking sector, and its relatively stable financials as compared to its local peers,\" adds Yan. \u001d  \"On the other hand, these strengths are offset by HSBC China's small national banking market share as well as the significant challenges HSBC China faces in its ambitious growth strategy, in particular the shortage of experienced banking professionals and the pressure to maintain sound operational control and risk management, \" says Yan. \"In addition, various hurdles still exist for foreign bank operations in China, and the banking environment is increasingly competitive,\" adds Yan. \u001d  As a locally incorporated foreign bank subsidiary, HSBC China can, once approved, conduct local currency (RMB) retail business with Chinese nationals pursuant to China's commitment -- under its World Trade Organization agreement -- to open its banking sector. This last point was reinforced by the China Banking Regulatory Commission's recent guidelines for \"foreign-funded banks in China\" issued in November and December 2006. \u001d  HSBC China's strategy for the next few years is to focus on the high-end wealth management retail business as well as deepen cross-sales to corporate clients and expand into local clients with either significant needs overseas or demand for global products. In addition, the bank will continue to expand its physical distribution footprint. With the retail market opening to locally incorporated foreign banks, it will enjoy significant growth in its retail business for which it plans to leverage its reputable high-end wealth management brand product \"HSBC Premier.\" \u001d  The growth of its retail business will balance HSBC China's revenue mix. Currently, the bank's operation in China is predominantly in corporate business, wherein large, mostly multi-national corporate clients account for the largest share of operating income and after-tax profit, followed by middle-market & local commercial banking clients. The growth in retail business will provide earnings stability as well as lower overall risks for HSBC China's business. On a pro forma historical basis, HSBC China shows profitability above its Chinese peer average, thanks to proper risk-pricing practices and high value-added non-interest income from services to its more sophisticated, largely, multinational clients. But because of its relatively small scale and ongoing, significant investment, the cost to income was relatively high and above its Chinese peer average, and is likely to remain so for the next few years. \u001d  As a leading foreign bank in China with a long operating history, HSBC has a solid brand name on the Mainland. It has 35 outlets in China, the largest network among foreign banks. Its principal business lines comprise banking services for large and/or highly sophisticated customers, a number of whom are HSBC group clients globally. Its treasury, cash management and other corporate banking services incorporate the benefits of its expertise, products, and the group's very large trading books. Its trade finance activities utilize the group's global network and direct relationships with companies worldwide and which trade with China. \u001d  Asset quality has been healthy. Its non-performing loan ratio was only 1.08% at end-2006, much lower than that of its Chinese peers, although the special-mentioned loan category was relatively high. Liquidity risks and market risks are well managed and in accordance with group policy and practices. The bank runs a commercial surplus and expected growth in RMB deposits should further diversify its funding sources, thereby further improving liquidity. HSBC China has a target total capital adequacy ratio of 10%. Surplus capital will be recycled to the parent, which centralize capital use plans. \u001d  HSBC China serves as a local base for its parent's cooperation with its strategic Chinese partners, including the Bank of Communications (Baa2/D), Bank of Shanghai (not rated) and PingAn Insurance (not rated). Its cooperation with local banks and insurers constitutes another important part of HSBC group's expansion strategy in China. As a result, HSBC China will gain local market knowledge and outsource some local services, but also bear some costs for its parent's activities in China. \u001d  Nonetheless, HSBC China will face significant challenges in its business in China. The aggressive expansion plans need to be supported by a large number of new hires and the shortage in experienced professionals could be a bottleneck. In addition, the rapid growth in loans and assets could exert considerable pressure, especially on control and risk management, to the franchise. Although the bank will be established with RMB8 billion of capital and is expected to be self-capitalizing through internally generated earnings, capital may come under pressure as it rapidly expands. \u001d  In terms of support, Moody's believes that HSBC China is very strategic to HSBC HK and HSBC Holding's global operations. Therefore, it will receive very high parental support, if needed. The bank's long-term A2 ratings enjoy a multiple-notch uplift as a result of parental support, but stay constrained by China's A2 local currency and foreign currency deposit ceilings. \u001d  Because of its small national market share, the bank is unlikely to receive any systemic support from the Chinese government, if need arises. Therefore, no systemic support has been assigned to HSBC China. \u001d  HSBC China's BFSR is likely to move upwards if the bank can demonstrate that it can deliver its targeted growth in a quality manner. The BFSR is unlikely to be downgraded, except if the bank suffers a significant deterioration in asset quality, capital level, and negative shocks due to bad management. HSBC China's deposit ratings are likely to be raised if China's sovereign rating enjoys an upgrade or vice versa. \u001d  HSBC China, headquartered in Shanghai, is one of the largest foreign bank subsidiaries locally incorporated in China. At end-2006, it had total assets of RMB91.5 billion (USD 11.8billion). \u001d  The following ratings were assigned: \u001d  Long-term local currency and foreign currency deposit ratings of A2, positive outlook \u001d  Short-term deposit rating of P-1, stable outlook \u001d  Bank financial strength rating of D, stable outlook \b \u001d  Copyright 2007, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and/or its licensors and affiliates including Moody's Assurance Company, Inc.

(From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Theo Francis \u001d  The best thing about an employee-stock-ownership plan is that it gives workers a stake in their company's future. Which is also, of course, the worst thing about it. \u001d  That may never be more apparent than in the $8 billion sale of Tribune Co., under negotiation over the weekend. Both bidders -- Chicago real-estate magnate Sam Zell is vying against the duo of Los Angeles businessmen Ron Burkle and Eli Broad -- propose using an ESOP representing Tribune's 21,000 employees to take a majority stake in the company. While use of an employee share plan offers the company's suitors a powerful tool to finance the deal, including attractive tax breaks, it can pose significant risks for the company as well as its employees. \u001d  \"It's a tax-and-financing tool,\" said Mary Josephs, senior vice president for ESOP financial services at LaSalle Bank, a unit of ABN Amro Holding NV, in Chicago. \"But you cannot ignore the human-resources side of it if you want it to work for the long run.\" \u001d  Financing a deal in part with an ESOP works because the employee-benefit plan invests almost exclusively in the employer's shares. And because ESOP deals can involve the newly private company going heavily into debt, employees can see their retirement benefits eroded if the business is hurt by an industry downturn. That is a real danger for Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Newsday of Long Island and a string of other newspapers and TV stations, struggling to cope with a severe slump in the newspaper business. \u001d  Some major ESOP transactions have foundered, perhaps most notably at United Airlines. In 1994, the airline's pilots, managers and machinists acquired 55% of the company through an ESOP in return for six years of wage and benefit cuts, part of an effort to save jobs. Labor-management tensions remained high, however, and ESOP consultants say too little effort went into fostering a cooperative workplace. Employees lost control of the company in 2003, and United employees lost much of their stakes as the airline the industry struggled after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. \u001d  Even so, ESOPs appear to be gaining popularity, Ms. Josephs said. Her firm has $5 billion of transactions in its pipeline, five times its 20-year average, including three public companies and three private-equity transactions. \"The ESOP is highly competitive,\" she said. \u001d  The proposed buyout of Tribune is expected to be a standard ESOP deal. In one typical scenario, Tribune would borrow cash from banks or other lenders and then immediately lend it to a newly created ESOP. The ESOP, in turn, would use the cash to buy out existing shareholders. \u001d  That leaves the ESOP owning a significant chunk of the company, and both ESOP and corporation with substantial debt. As the company contributes cash to the ESOP over time -- much as it would contribute to a 401(k) or other retirement plan -- the money is used to pay down the loans. \u001d  Because those contributions amount to principal and interest payments on loans owed by an employee-benefit plan, they are fully tax-deductible, up to 25% of payroll per year. By contrast, companies ordinarily can deduct only interest on their loans. \u001d  But the Tribune proposals could take advantage of another dramatic tax break as well, sharply reducing any federal taxes that could be still payable. That is a result of a tax break available only to companies with a limited number of owners, known as S corporations. Tribune will likely qualify for S-corporation status after the buyout, as the ESOP and either Mr. Zell or Messrs. Broad and Burkle will be its main shareholders. \u001d  Unlike other corporations, S corporations aren't taxed directly on their profits. Instead, their shareholders pay income tax on their share of each year's profits. Where an ESOP is a shareholder -- as will be the case with Tribune -- it won't pay taxes on its share of the profits because ESOPs don't pay taxes. \u001d  So, if Tribune is 70%-owned by an ESOP, that portion of each year's profits aren't taxed. Companies in this situation have an edge over competitors, able to reinvest more of their profits into operations or acquisitions, ESOP advocates say. \u001d  Tribune could try to tap employees' existing 401(k) accounts for capital in the transaction as well, by offering employees a chance to roll those assets into the ESOP, effectively investing alongside those taking the company private -- and compounding the risk the employees take on in the process. Tribune's 401(k) plans had more than $2.3 billion in assets at the end of 2005, including nearly $610 million already invested in Tribune shares. \u001d  Employees might also find their power as shareholders limited. They won't necessarily get full voting rights, for example -- ESOP participants can often be limited to voting only on the most significant decisions, including liquidations and major asset sales. Just 20% of closely held firms give ESOP participants full voting rights, according to figures from the National Center for Employee Ownership, which promotes ESOPs. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 19:43 ET (23:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"99473b6f27e45b97f24dae8d389aac47","symR":["BHV"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Blackrock VA Muni Bond Trust (BHV)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BHV"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Blackrock VA Muni Bond Trust (BHV): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BHV or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:33 ET (07:33 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9976ff3750f1321e812c2cd66d7be891","symR":["CBST"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBST"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=CBST or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:50 ET (07:50 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"99f746c8e21fd494fe88ca1edb6c62b5","symR":["HYV"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund, Inc.

(AP)--The days of casino patrons puffing on a cigarette while pushing buttons on a slot machine or shuffling stacks of chips may be coming to an end in nearly half this resort's gambling halls. \u001d  In two weeks, the city's 11 casinos must comply with a new law restricting smoking to no more than 25% of the gambling floor. \u001d  At least five of them plan to comply with the ban by creating non-gambling smoking lounges, where patrons can go to light up, have a smoke, and then return to the tables or slots. \u001d  Other casinos have decided to wall off sections of their casinos where patrons will be able to smoke while gambling, but the lounges are seen as a cheaper, easier way to satisfy both the law and casino employees, many of whom have vehemently complained about having to work around smokers. \u001d  \"You get problems with your sinuses, problems with your lungs,\" said Nate Chait, a veteran Atlantic City table games supervisor, who claims he and many co-workers have been sickened by second-hand smoke. \"Your eyes burn. You get sore throats. You get more colds.\" \u001d  The smoking lounges have also won praise from anti-smoking groups who see them as momentum toward a total smoking ban in casinos. \u001d  \"We think this smoking lounge idea makes good sense,\" said Peter Slocum, a vice president of the American Cancer Society. \"It is not perfect, and some people are still going to be exposed to toxic smoke. But not nearly so much as they are now, and will be in other casinos which go with the fig leaf of a 75-25 split on the gaming floor.\" \u001d  But some smokers are dreading the coming changes. \u001d  \"I think I have the same rights as non-smokers,\" said Suetta Kyer of Mullens, W.Va. as she played the slots last week while puffing on a cigarette in a long-handled holder. \"Why should I have to leave?\" \u001d  She said she would smoke in a lounge if there were no other option, but would prefer to patronize a casino that still allowed smoking while gambling. \u001d  Harrah's Entertainment Inc. (HET) owns four casinos here - Harrah's Atlantic City, Bally's Atlantic City; Caesars Atlantic City and the Showboat Casino-Hotel. All plan to establish smoking lounges to comply with the new law within a few months. \u001d  \"It is an alternative that is appealing to us because it would take the employees out of the smoking situation,\" said Juan Carlos Tolosa, the company's eastern division president. \"We would make a nice, comfortable lounge so patrons can go in, smoke and then come out. The only times employees would have to go in there was when it was shut down for cleaning.\" \u001d  Since construction will take time, casinos going with the smoking lounge option won't have them up and running immediately on April 15. In the meantime those casinos say they will designate 25% of their gambling halls as smoking areas. \u001d  All the casinos must put up signs with the universal symbol for no smoking - a drawing of a cigarette surrounded by a circle with a slash through it - in the gambling areas where smoking will not be allowed after April 15. \u001d  Fred Buro, president and chief operating officer of Tropicana Casino and Resort, said his casino plans to be the first in Atlantic City to have smoking lounges up and running, although he couldn't say when that might be. \u001d  Tropicana is owned by privately-held Columbia Entertainment Corp. \u001d  Other gambling facilities are still trying to figure out how they'll comply with the regulation. \u001d  The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa says smoking lounges are one option it is considering. But as of April 15, it plans to simply increase the non-smoking areas it now has. \u001d  Borgata is a co-owned by Boyd Gaming Corp. and MGM Mirage. \u001d  \"Today we have non-smoking and smoking areas spread out throughout the casino floor,\" spokesman Michael Facenda said. \"All we're doing is reversing the process. On April 15 and thereafter, you'll still be able to find a smoking table and smoking section of slots.\" \u001d  The three casinos operated by Trump Entertainment Resorts (TRMP) - Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, and Trump Marina Hotel Casino - haven't yet decided how they will comply with the ban, spokesman Tom Hickey said. \u001d  Hilton Hotel Corp.'s (HLT) Resorts Atlantic City and the Atlantic City Hilton Casino Resort are still studying long-term options, but plan to allow at least some areas where customers will still be able to smoke while gambling, said Tony Rodio, regional president for both casinos. \u001d  The call for a casino smoking ban started last April. The state had passed one of the strictest laws in the nation banning smoking in public places, but it specifically exempted casinos, fearing an economic impact on tourism dollars. \u001d  The Atlantic City Council was poised late last year to enact a total smoking ban in the casinos. But it backed down under fierce pressure from the casino industry, which feared the loss of 20% of its revenue, and as many as 3,400 jobs. \u001d  It then adopted a compromise ordinance in February requiring at least 75% of the casino floor to be non-smoking. \u001d  The most likely way most casinos will do that on April 15 is simply by putting up dividers similar to those used to designate lines at airports, casino executives said. Then, by Sept. 15 the casinos must submit plans for constructing permanent, walled-off, ventilated areas to the state Department of Community Affairs. \u001d  Once the state approves a casino's plan, the gambling hall has 90 days to begin work on the enclosures, and must \"expeditiously\" complete it. There is no deadline for the state to approve the plans or to having the enclosures up and running. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 00:01 ET (04:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9abe52d3f038400d1dbe9035b2bd3121","symR":["DJAN.LN","GB0002502036"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Daejan Holdings plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DJAN.LN","GB0002502036"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","RED","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Daejan Holdings plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0002502036 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:40 ET (07:40 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9ad7a56af52dc2c9e7c53de4b244fabe","symR":["FLC"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Flaherty & Crumine/Claymore Total Return Fund (FLC)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FLC"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Flaherty & Crumine/Claymore Total Return Fund (FLC): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=FLC or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:13 ET (08:13 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9b113cd400696f4e2074999037a64844","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","FNC.MI","GKN.LN","GKNLY","OHB.XE","SPR","DE0005936124","GB0030646508","IT0003856405","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"INTERVIEW:DAE Prepared To Partner Bidders For Airbus Plants","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","FNC.MI","GKN.LN","GKNLY","OHB.XE","SPR","DE0005936124","GB0030646508","IT0003856405","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","CMT","DFN","OTA","XCA4","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XMDAX","XMIB","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Steve McGrath and Sarmad Khan \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DUBAI (Zawya Dow Jones)--Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, or DAE, is prepared to be an investment partner to a possible bidder for Airbus plants up for sale, but wouldn't bid alone for any plant, and is far advanced in setting up its own Middle East aircraft leasing unit, Chief Executive Bob Johnson told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. \u001d  Airbus, which is owned by European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. NV (5730.FR), posted a sizable loss last year following costly delays to its A380 double-decker plane program. Under the Power8 program, some plants that make parts for Airbus planes could be sold with partners found at others. \u001d  The Airbus plant disposals \"could be an opportunity, either through an acquisition or a partnership,\" Johnson said, adding that DAE wouldn't be interested in investing on its own in a plant because it doesn't have an existing part-making capability. \u001d  German companies OHB Technology AG (OHB.XE) and Diehl Stiftung & Co. Kg have already expressed an interest in buying the German Airbus plants that are up for sale. Airbus officials have also said U.K.-based GKN PLC (GKN.LN), Italy's Finmeccanica SpA (FNC.MI) and Spirit Aero Systems(SPR) of the U.S. are among possible partners for the plants that Airbus is considering selling or inviting investment for. \u001d  DAE is part of a drive to broaden Dubai's economy by building a collection of global businesses around aircraft finance, manufacturing and engineering. The company has investment backing from some of the region's biggest investors, including investment fund Isthimar, property developer Emaar, and publicly listed Islamic financing group Amlak Finance, but is majority-owned by the Dubai government. \u001d  It has huge investment plans on a global basis, with Johnson saying total capital - both equity and borrowing - of around $15 billion in the next 15 years \"would be welcome.\" \u001d  The company's focus will be on its existing six business units - Aircraft leasing, finance and insurance; manufacturing; airport development and operations; aviation maintenance and support; aviation support services; and the DAE University, which aims to train pilots and staff for other aviation industry functions. \u001d  Johnson said DAE, which was only established in February 2006, would focus on building the six business areas across the globe through partnerships and acquisitions. The focus is on better service, on more value, if it's a source of pilots and engineers and if it's helping this region, specifically Dubai and the U.A.E. become significant contributors to a growing industry, he said. \u001d  On the manufacturing side, \"I would want to be partners and contributing in the supply chain to those companies that make airplanes,\" Johnson said. The company wants to \"participate as a partner with people that make engines. We want to be a partner to help companies in the industry to grow globally and have more reach at a time when I think the  industry wants a consolidated set of suppliers.\" \u001d  The Dubai-based investment company said it has had plenty of expressions of interest in partnerships, notably from Airbus rival Boeing Co. (BA) in the Middle East. \u001d  \"Boeing, like others, have expressed an interest - whether it's training, service, airports, a relationship with leasing companies. We've had conversations (with Boeing), like we have with others, to discuss which the right relationships would be and we would look at any relationship we could form with Boeing and Airbus,\" the CEO said. \u001d  In terms of its leasing business, DAE plans to have a fleet of between 50 and 100 aircraft for lease in the near term, focused on younger, single-aisle planes like the Airbus A320 family and the Boeing 737, to address a growing set of low-cost carriers in the region as well as the incumbent carriers. \u001d  \"We hope that starting this month, we'll have in place our own leasing team, looking to see which of these aircraft assets are most appealing,\" he said. \"If the right transactions are there, we hope to be in the aircraft leasing business in the next two or three months.\" \u001d  DAE had been looking at acquiring existing leasing companies - it was linked with the sale of U.S.-based  Pegasus Aviation Finance Co. and with Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise - but Johnson conceded \"the right transactions weren't available to us,\" so DAE decided to set up its own business focused on the region. \u001d  The CEO wouldn't say how much the company was prepared to invest in the planes, saying that would depend on the age of the aircraft it buys and the leasing market conditions. \u001d  -By Steve McGrath, Dow Jones Newswires; +97142235676;

Berman \u001d  Nothing lasts forever. Just don't tell that to Wall Street's investment bankers. \u001d  The corporate-deals market began a fifth-straight year of expansion with a record first quarter, and is showing no signs of slowing. Across the globe, $1.1 trillion of companies traded hands between January and March, 27% higher than the same period in 2006, according to data provider Thomson Financial. \u001d  The figures were more startling in the U.S., where the volume of deals surged 32% from a year ago to $439 billion, according to Thomson. \"It continues to be an incredible first quarter,\" said Mark Shafir, global head of mergers and acquisitions at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. He added that \"recent market turmoil would suggest a lot more uncertainty for the rest of the year.\" Of the 10 industry sectors tracked by data provider Dealogic, eight of them have increased in deal volume since last year. The two laggards -- telecom and oil and gas -- had big transactions last year that would have been difficult to repeat. \u001d  The deals came in all stripes and colors. Large private-equity transactions such as the $32 billion proposed takeover of Texas utility TXU Corp; massive cross-border hookups such as Barclays PLC's potential $80 billion bid for premier Dutch Bank ABN Amro Holding NV; and competitive situations, such as IntercontinentalExchange Inc.'s $9.91 billion bid for Chicago Board of Trade parent CBOT Holdings Inc., hoping to break up a vaunted cross-town merger with Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. \u001d  \"How long can the boom last? My hunch is for most of this calendar year, and that by March of 2008, you'll see a contraction in multiples. Some deals will begin to go bad, and people will generally be cautiously pulling back,\" said Gerald Rosenfeld, chief executive of investment bank Rothschild North America Inc. \u001d  Perhaps that is why a sense of marvel continues to pervade Wall Street, which has been sucking up billions of dollars of advisory fees to map out and launch these transactions. And beneath the surface, a sense of urgency is lurking. Both corporations and advisers are trying to get deals done before what is expected to be an inevitable slowdown. \u001d  \"There is no better time to sell a business than now,\" says Paul Stefanick, a vice chairman at Merrill Lynch & Co. \"We're telling our clients that even if a business might have more earnings growth in the future, the sale [value of companies] might come down\" as the M&A cycle enters its later stages. \u001d  As usual, private-equity firms are fueling the buying. When Cadbury Schweppes PLC announced plans to dump its U.S. beverages unit, which makes Dr Pepper and 7 UP, the London company quickly turned to a group of buyout shops. The same appears to be the case for DaimlerChrysler AG, which is expected to sell off its venerable, although slumping, Chrysler division to private equity, referred to on Wall Street as \"financial sponsors.\" \u001d  Private-equity firms were involved in 17% of all corporate purchases, according to Thomson. That is a steep drop from the 27% figure at the end of 2006, but still the third highest on record. \u001d  The total is more than double the volume of 2005 and five times the volume of the deal-crazed days during the first quarter of 2000. Jimmy Elliott, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s global co-head of M&A, said buyout shops continue to target \"the best-of-breed, biggest companies, across every industry sector,\" with ones valued at between \"$15 billion and $30 billion being the sweet spot.\" \u001d  Yet it is more than just cheap financing aided by low interest rates that is driving the deals market. Chief among the trends is pressure from shareholders, who have been candid about their own desires. \u001d  Insurrection has broken out at San Antonio radio firm Clear Channel Communications Inc., which is trying to convince shareholders of the merits of its $18.7 billion deal to sell to two private-equity firms. \u001d  Such stances are easy to take when the hot markets present so many alternatives. Companies, for instance, may be able to take on big slugs of debt themselves instead of doing a leveraged buyout. Or they could find buyers for divisions, given how frothy the market for corporate carve-outs has become. \u001d  In addition, \"the IPO markets are strong again, and companies that might otherwise have been sold are going public,\" said David Popowitz, a managing director covering high-technology companies at Credit Suisse Group. \u001d  Despite the frenzied pace of deals, some industry insiders say things are bound to slow. \u001d  Louis Friedman, vice chairman of investment banking at Bear Stearns Cos., says the stock-market swoon in late February is a sign things at some point will calm down. \"How quickly that spread through capital markets globally, was an indication that at some point this will stop, or at least slow down,\" he said, noting that the first-quarter results were \"staggering.\" \u001d  Among advisers for the quarter, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. worked on the largest volume of deals, as measured by Thomson's criteria. J.P. Morgan placed second, followed by Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Lehman Brothers. \u001d  Among lawyers, New York's Sullivan & Cromwell took the first-quarter league table crown, followed by London's Clifford Chance, New York's Simpson Thacher & Bartlett; Hunton & Williams, of Richmond, Va.; and New York's Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d

 By Eric Bellman and Tom Wright \u001d  Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \u001d  Tata Power Co.'s (500400.BY) $1.3 billion purchase of a 30% stake in coal companies owned by Indonesian mining concern PT Bumi Resources (BUMI.JK) shows how Indian companies are continuing on their global search for the commodities and businesses they need to power the country's growth. \u001d  On Saturday, Tata Power said it has signed an agreement to acquire a coal trading company and 30% stake each in PT Kaltim Prima Coal and PT Arutmin Indonesia-all three concerns controlled by Jakarta-listed Bumi Resources. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  Tata Power is India's largest nongovernment power company and part of the same Tata Group which agreed in January to buy European steelmaker Corus Group PLC for around $12 billion. Tata Power said the Indonesian deal will give it access to the coal and technology it needs for big expansion plans. \u001d  \"This move not only secures our fuel requirements in light of the aggressive growth plans charted out by the company, but also opens up opportunities for Tata Power to own and operate a range of world class, competitive and profitable electricity and energy businesses,\" Prasad. R. Menon, managing director of Tata Power said in statement. \u001d  The coal from Indonesia will be used to feed Tata's new power plants on India's west coast. The planned plants, scheduled to be completed in five years, will have a total capacity of 7,000 megawatts and require almost 21 million metric tons of imported coal a year. The deal with Bumi Resources entitles Tata Power to buy about half of the amount needed from the Indonesian companies. \u001d  With India's economy expanding at more than 8% a year for the last three years, its companies can at last afford multibillion-dollar deals needed to get access to coal, steel, oil and technology and sales networks they need abroad. The Tata Power deal would be the fifth largest international acquisition ever by an Indian company. Last year Indian companies announced a record $21 billion in overseas acquisitions, according to Dealogic Holdings PLC. Indian companies are expected to make even more foreign acquisitions this year. \u001d  The deal also represents growing interest in Indonesian coal resources. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of thermal coals, which are used for power generation. (Australia is the largest exporter of higher-quality metallurgical coal used in steel-making.) With coal prices rising 30% in the first three months of this year, many Indonesian business groups have moved in to coal mining recently. Meanwhile, foreign mining companies have been stymied by Indonesia's failure to pass a new law governing investments in the minerals sector. BHP Billiton Ltd.(BHP), for instance, wants to invest in two major coal mines on Borneo island, but has put these plans on hold due to regulatory uncertainty. \u001d  India' booming economy has turned Indian companies in to important customers for Indonesian coal. Sandiaga Uno, who runs an investment fund with a stake in PT Adaro coal mine, says Indian companies \"are important customers\" and account for 10% of that mine's output, compared with nothing three years ago. \u001d  Bumi Resources, which is controlled by the family of Aburizal Bakrie, a wealthy businessman and a senior government minister, entered the coal mining business in 2001 when it bought a controlling stake in Arutmin from BHP Billiton for $148 million. In 2003, it pulled off a coup by beating out rivals to take 100% in Kaltim Prima for $500 million. Kaltim Prima, a world-class open-pit coal mine, was previously owned by Rio Tinto Ltd. and BP PLC. Like BHP, Rio Tinto and BP had to sell their stakes to an Indonesian company under the terms of their original operating contracts with the Indonesian government. \u001d  Last year, Bumi Resources tried to sell 100% stakes in Arutmin and Kaltim Prima to Indonesian investors for $3.2 billion. But that deal fell through amid disagreements over valuations. \u001d  -By Eric Bellman and Tom Wright, The Wall Street Journal \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 07:09 ET

Trust -5-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T14:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DWL.UN.T","CA24380C2022"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE"],"Story":"\bThe demand for oilfield services is largely dependent on the activity levels of oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which the Trust has no control, including: the level of oil and natural gas prices and production; expectations about future oil and natural gas prices; the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; the expected rates of declining production from maturing basins; the discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves; available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity; weather conditions: global political stability, military actions, regulatory and economic conditions; the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas; and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices. \b \bOil and natural gas prices \b \bThe revenue, cash flow and earnings of the Trust are substantially dependent upon and affected by the level of activity associated with oil and natural gas exploration and production. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect the level of such activity. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, may affect both the demand for and the supply of oil and natural gas. Weather conditions, governmental regulation, levels of consumer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other factors beyond Deepwell's control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas lead to future price volatility. \b \bSeasonal weather \b \bIn Canada, the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry is influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Spring break-up during the second quarter of each year leaves many secondary roads temporarily incapable of supporting the weight of heavy equipment, which results in severe restrictions in the level of energy services. The timing and duration of spring break-up is dependent on weather patterns and the duration of this period will have an impact on the level of business of the Trust. \b \bDependence on key personnel \b \bThe success of the Trust will likely continue to be dependent on the skills and expertise of the officers of the Trust. Deepwell does not currently carry \"key man\" insurance that would compensate the Trust for the loss of any senior executives. \b \bCompetition for human resources \b \bDuring periods of high activity for oil and natural gas exploration and development, demand for experienced and skilled employees increases. The success of the Trust is dependent upon the ability to retain the services of experienced and skilled employees and the ability to recruit and retain other key employees. \b \bReliance on major customers \b \bIt is estimated that the top 10 customers of Deepwell accounted for approximately 49.8 percent of revenue for the year, with no single customer accounting for more than approximately 8.5 percent. Deepwell does not generally enter into long-term contracts with their customers and there can be no assurance that the current customers will continue their relationships with Deepwell. \b \bCompetition \b \bDeepwell faces competition from a variety of competitors. Many of these competitors have strong financial, marketing and other resources. There can be no assurance that such competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of oilfield services that compete with those of Deepwell or that new competitors will not enter the various markets in which Deepwell is active. \b \bOperating risks and insurance \b \bThe business of Deepwell will be subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as equipment defects, malfunction and failures, accidental release, natural disasters which result in fires, vehicle accidents and explosions that can cause personal injury, loss of life, suspension of operations, damage to formations, damage to facilities, business interruption and damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment. These risks could expose Deepwell LP to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution, and other environmental damages. The frequency and severity of such incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. \b \bManagement will monitor the activities of Deepwell LP for quality control and safety. However, there are no assurances that Deepwell LP's safety procedures will always prevent such damages. Although Deepwell maintains insurance coverage that management believes to be adequate and customary in the industry, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover such liabilities. \b \bEnvironmental risks \b \bThe Canadian oil and natural gas industry is regulated by a number of federal and provincial governmental bodies and agencies under a variety of complex federal and provincial legislation that sets forth numerous prohibitions and requirements, with respect to planning and approval processes related to land use, sustainable resource management, waste management, responsibility for the release of presumed hazardous materials, protection of wildlife and the environment and the health and safety of workers. Legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on the transport of dangerous goods and the release or emission of various substances, including substances used and produced in association with certain oil and natural gas industry operations. The legislation addresses various permits, drilling, access road construction, camp construction, well completion, installation of surface equipment, air monitoring, surface and ground water monitoring in connection with these activities, waste management and access to remote or environmentally sensitive areas. \b \bDeepwell is subject to a complex and increasingly stringent array of legal requirements and potential liabilities, including with respect to the ownership and management of property, the need to obtain and comply with permits and approvals, the health and safety of employees, and the handling, use, storage, disposal, intentional or accidental release, and transportation of certain substances, including hazardous materials and dangerous goods. Failure to comply with these requirements could expose Deepwell to substantial potential penalties. There can be no assurance that Deepwell will not be required, at some future date, to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws, or that its operations, business, assets or cash flow will not be materially adversely affected by existing conditions or by the requirements or potential liability under current or future environmental laws. \b \bCredit risk \b \bAll of the accounts receivable of Deepwell are with customers involved in the oil and natural gas industry whose revenues may be impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices. Collection of these receivables could be negatively influenced by any prolonged substantial reduction in oil and/or natural gas prices which could have a material adverse effect on the financial results and cash flows of Deepwell. \b \bAccess to additional financing \b \bDeepwell may find it necessary in the future to obtain additional debt or equity financing to support ongoing operations of Deepwell, to undertake capital expenditures or to undertake acquisitions or other business combination transactions. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to Deepwell when needed or on terms acceptable to Deepwell. The inability to raise financing to support ongoing operations or to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit Deepwell's growth and may have a material adverse effect on the financial results and cash flows of Deepwell. \b \bCapital expenditures \b \bThe timing and amount of capital expenditures by Deepwell will directly affect the amount of cash generated from operating activities. The cost of labour and equipment has escalated over the past several years. \b \bLeverage and restrictive covenants \b \bDeepwell has credit facilities which contain a number of financial covenants that require Deepwell to meet certain financial ratios and financial condition tests. Failure to comply with the obligations in the credit facilities could result in a default which, if not cured or waived, could result in a termination of distributions by Deepwell and would permit acceleration of the relevant indebtedness. If the indebtedness under the credit facilities were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that the assets of Deepwell would be able to repay in full that indebtedness which could result in the lenders realizing on the assets of Deepwell. There is no assurance that Deepwell will be able to refinance any or all of the credit facilities at their maturity dates on acceptable terms, or on any basis. \b \bUncertainty of cash distributions \b \bThe actual amounts of distributions paid by the Trust to the Unitholder will depend upon numerous factors, including profitability of operations, debt covenants and obligations, the availability and cost of acquisitions, fluctuations in working capital, the timing and amount of capital expenditures, applicable law and other factors beyond the control of Deepwell. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bRelated party transactions \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bDuring the year the Trust made payments in the amount of $318,954 for legal expenses to a Partnership of which one of the Trustees is a Partner. These transactions were conducted in the normal course of operations, on commercial terms established and agreed to by the parties. As at December 31, 2006, $6,176 was outstanding in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 10:22 ET (14:22 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a7a862103fd83409eb44bea129e5c5c0","symR":["KSP.DB","IE0004927939"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Kingspan Group plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KSP.DB","IE0004927939"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  Kingspan Group plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=IE0004927939 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:28 ET (08:28 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a7b87554ef59a0732630fa343431db7b","symR":["AGIBY","ANGL.DB","IE00B06H8J93"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AGIBY","ANGL.DB","IE00B06H8J93"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=IE00B06H8J93 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:10 ET (07:10 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a7c0ac968732f44e459e3a34ccd0fb43","symR":["PEI"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Pennsylvania REIT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PEI"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Pennsylvania REIT: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=PEI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:15 ET (09:15 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a7c7bd4a687f9d7086f285eed55d7fa8","symR":["HYT"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund, Inc.

In response, EADS warned that the Moscow bank would not be welcomed as a decision-making industrial shareholder. \u001d  Some observers say tighter links with Russia could endanger the European defense group's U.S. business, and generate concern about governance at EADS and the transfer of sensitive technologies. \u001d  Moscow, though, is determined to increase its role in Airbus, which is struggling to recover from costly delays to the A380 superjumbo, losses because of the weak dollar, and a year of management turmoil that has sent EADS stock tumbling. \u001d  Gref expressed frustration at resistance to a greater Russian stake, saying it could help the aircraft-maker expand into a potentially vast Russian market against competition from U.S.-based Boeing Co. (BA). \u001d  He suggested that if Airbus continues to balk, Russia's banks and investors - flush with oil profits and eager to expand in international markets - could turn elsewhere. \u001d  \"Russian companies are growing at a very fast pace and local markets are now too narrow for them, including in the aviation industry,\" Gref said. \u001d  If Airbus agrees, \"we're ready to work as

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \b   By Andrew Morse \u001d  Tokyo -- JAPANESE companies are increasingly tapping the country's stock market for capital, a development that underscores their confidence in both their business prospects and their share prices. \u001d  Last year, supermarket operator Aeon, liquid-crystal-display television giant Sharp and car maker Suzuki Motor all sold shares or convertible bonds to fund ambitious expansion plans. \u001d  So many companies sold stock or equity-linked securities in 2006 that a record $82.2 billion in equity financing was raised in Japan, according to Thomson Financial, a data tracker. That's up 28% from $64.2 billion in 2005 and more than triple the $23.5 billion raised 10 years ago. \u001d  The volume has fallen a bit from last year's pace, but strategists say that's because turbulence in global markets earlier this year forced some companies to reconsider the timing of securities sales. If the markets pick up, so will the issuance, they say. \u001d  The boom in equity financing could provide an opportunity for investors looking for strong companies with capable management teams, strategists say. They say they're impressed because much of the fund raising is to allow companies to pay for acquisitions, build plants or invest in other growth projects, which should ultimately generate profits that will propel shares higher. \u001d  The fund raising, as well as the expansion plans, also mark a shift in corporate thinking. After Japan's asset bubble burst in the early 1990s, many companies were left with lots of debt that they had little ability to pay off. So for more than a decade, companies adopted a defensive posture, hunkering down and getting back to basics. Now, they're looking for ways to grow. \u001d  \"For a long time Japanese companies were very cautious. They were busy repairing their balance sheets,\" said Jonathan Allum, a strategist at KBC Financial Products. \"Now, they clearly feel more comfortable about their prospects.\" \u001d  One such company is Aeon, Japan's biggest supermarket chain by revenue and a regular acquirer of other companies. It counts U.S. apparel retailer Talbots Inc. as a group company and has the Japan franchise for British fashion and furnishings chain Laura Ashley Holdings. Last year, executives at Aeon, which operates about 4,200 stores around the world, saw an opportunity to expand business by buying a chunk of a struggling competitor, Daiei. But Aeon wasn't sure how to finance the nearly $535 million deal. \u001d  Aeon, with headquarters just outside of Tokyo, decided in October to sell about 75 million new shares -- a little more than 10% of its issuance outstanding at the time -- raising $1.7 billion. Last month, it said it would buy 15% of Kobe-based Daiei and 20% of an Tokyo-based affiliate, Maruetsu. \u001d  \"We wanted to buy a stake in Daiei, and we were looking for ways to open new stores in Japan and expand in China,\" says Kenichi Suenami, an Aeon investor relations officer. \u001d  To be sure, a boom in equity financing is sometimes associated with the top of a market. In such cases, companies often make use of their high share price to raise money. During Japan's bull market in the 1980s, some companies issued new shares and then used the money raised to trade stocks, bonds and currencies. \u001d  Historically, equity financing can cause problems for the overall market as the new stock being sold depresses prices. But that hasn't happened in Japan because companies are actively buying back their own shares, reducing the balance of stock available. A rise in private-equity deals, which involve delisting companies, also has limited the impact. \u001d  Suzuki Motor had committed to an $85 billion five-year capital-spending plan to help it expand in fast-growing markets like India. But the company, based in central Japan, had spent much of its cash to buy back a 17% stake that General Motors was selling. \u001d  So Suzuki sold convertible bonds, or bonds that can be converted into stock. Companies often like convertible bonds because they carry a lower interest rate than regular bonds. \u001d  \"There isn't a feeling that equity values are over-inflated and companies are just raising cash for its own sake,\" says Patrick Mohr, a strategist at Nikko Citigroup. In general, the activity is \"sober and directed,\" he says. \u001d  --- \u001d  Ayako Nomura contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 17:31 ET (21:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ac2dbe9f589cdcec347f24cee130ec4d","symR":["MVF"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Blackrock MuniVest Fund, Inc.

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Emily Steel \u001d  It's no secret that the Web, with its ability to disseminate news at the touch of a button, has become the go-to outlet for breaking news. But as competition increases and advertising dollars follow consumers online, news sites increasingly are trying to distinguish themselves. \u001d  MSNBC.com, the No. 2-ranked news Web site behind Yahoo News, is starting its first branding ad campaign this week. Instead of selling itself as a \"breaking news\" destination, as it once did, the site is trying to highlight the range of news and entertainment it offers. Spots in print, on TV, outdoors and online will carry the tagline \"A Fuller Spectrum of News,\" highlighting both MSNBC.com's original reporting and its partnerships with news outlets such as NBC, Newsweek and the Washington Post. MSNBC.com, jointly owned by Microsoft and NBC Universal, is spending $4 million on the campaign which runs through June, not including the cost of spots on NBC-owned networks. New York communications firm SS+K designed the campaign. \u001d  The marketing push comes as MSNBC.com's market position, long one of the strongest in the news sector thanks to its Microsoft ties, shows signs of strain. MSNBC.com's traffic fell 3% in February, despite strong growth in the overall news category, according to comScore Media Metrix. Yahoo News, CNN.com, FoxNews.com and AOL News each posted double-digit percentage gains. \u001d  MSNBC.com's executives say its internal figures -- backed up by another firm, Nielsen/NetRatings -- show that its traffic is increasing. They say the campaign isn't a response to traffic patterns but a desire to differentiate the site from other online news hubs. \u001d  Even so, the campaign shows how online news is maturing. When MSNBC.com began in 1996, it aimed to be a destination for breaking news on the Web, says Merrill Brown, editor of the site for its first six years. Aside from promotional support on MSN and onscreen references on NBC-owned networks, particularly MSNBC, the site did little in the way of traditional marketing. \u001d  Things have changed. The Web has become a conventional medium for news. Almost 100 million people visited online news sites in February, up 12% from the year-earlier period, according to comScore Media Metrix. \u001d  \"For a long time, people viewed this as an experiment. The experiment, in our opinion, is over. We are mainstream news now,\" says Charlie Tillinghast, president and publisher of MSNBC.com. \u001d  But that shift has intensified competition and has made it harder for sites to stand out. With advertisers shifting dollars from newspapers and TV to the Web, most papers and TV networks are pouring resources into their Web sites. Not only do most sites now offer breaking news, a variety of other features are standard, including video, blogs and podcasts. As a result, customers find it hard to tell one news site from the other, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, a survey of consumer behavior by ForeSee Results and the University of Michigan's business school. \u001d  MSNBC.com hopes its marketing campaign will give its brand name a clearer definition for consumers -- and draw more direct traffic to the site. Right now, MSNBC.com is heavily reliant on traffic from Microsoft sites such as MSN. In February, just 7.8% of MSNBC.com's 25.8 million visitors logged on directly, according to comScore, while 47.7% came from Microsoft sites, which often are loaded as the standard home page on personal computers. \u001d  While CNN.com has a smaller audience, more come directly to the site -- 17.8% of February's traffic, comScore estimates. Because they are choosing to go to CNN, those visitors are more valuable for advertisers than people who are simply linked from another site. CNN has \"an audience that are much more hard-core news followers. That's really valuable,\" says Jay Krihak, partner and group director of MediaEdge:CIA. CNN saw 50% growth in digital ad revenue in 2006, the company said, compared with 20% for MSNBC.com. \u001d  CNN is benefiting from its decades-old news brand name, of course. But the Time Warner-owned channel has also made efforts to beef up original reporting for the Web site. The channel says its entire staff contributes to CNN.com. While covering stories, reporters frequently create material both for the cable network and for the Web. CNN also has devoted a lot of energy to promoting its site. Aside from journalists mentioning the Web hub on the air, CNN has run marketing campaigns for the site with taglines such as \"The Power of CNN Under Your Command.\" \u001d  Much of MSNBC.com's content comes from other outlets, but the site also is focusing on increasing original video and reporting for the Web. MSNBC.com's editorial staff -- about 80 people -- is relocating from New Jersey to NBC News headquarters in New York to promote more integration between the two organizations. Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Bill Dedman joined MSNBC.com last fall to work for the online news network's investigative-reporting team. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007

WWE(R) fans packed the stadium from ringside to the rafters, including thousands with standing room only tickets, in setting the all-time Ford Field attendance record. \b \u001d  The 80,103 fans in attendance and millions worldwide saw quite an unforgettable pay-per-view event. Donald Trump's representative in the \"Battle of the Billionaires,\" Bobby Lashley(TM), defeated Vince McMahon's representative, Umaga(TM), \"the Samoan Bulldozer.\" As part of the match stipulation, Trump and Lashley shaved McMahon completely bald, much to the WWE chairman's great embarrassment. Trump did not leave the WWE ring unscathed, however, as during the post match celebration special guest referee Stone Cold Steve Austin(TM) put a \"Stone Cold Stunner\" on Trump, leaving him lying flat in the ring. \b \u001d  In title matches, John Cena(R) defeated Shawn Michaels, the \"Heartbreak Kid,\" to retain the WWE Championship. The Undertaker(R) defeated Batista(TM) to win the World Heavyweight Championship and extend his undefeated streak at WrestleMania to 15 wins. \b \u001d  The action was box office gold for WWE and WrestleMania's host city, Detroit. WrestleMania 23 was the highest grossing one-day live event in WWE history, with more than $5.38 million in ticket sales. Fans converging on Detroit from 24 countries, all 50 states and 9 Canadian provinces, pumped an estimated $25 million into the local economy. \b \u001d  This marks the second time World Wrestling Entertainment has established an attendance record in Detroit. In 1987, at WrestleMania III, 93,173 fans filled the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., setting the all-time indoor attendance record. \b \u001d  \"Who says lightning doesn't strike twice,\" said Kurt Schneider, Executive Vice President of Marketing. \"Ford Field shook to the very core of its foundation with the thunderous noise from the record-setting crowd. The support of our fans in Detroit and around the world made WrestleMania 23 a tremendous success.\" \b \u001d  Additional information on World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

These measures include: \b \b \b    << \b    -   Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \b        (EBITDA); and \b    -   Funds from operations, which refers to cash flow from operating \b        activities before changes in non-cash working capital; \b    >> \b \b \bThese measures are identified and presented, where appropriate, together with reconciliations to the equivalent GAAP measure. However, they should not be used as an alternative to GAAP, because they may not be consistent with calculations of other companies or Trusts. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bDeepwell overview \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bThe Trust is an unincorporated investment trust governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta. The business of the Trust is conducted through its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, Deepwell Energy Services Commercial Trust, Deepwell Energy Services Ltd., and Deepwell Energy Services LP (\"Deepwell LP\"). The Trust and its subsidiaries (collectively \"Deepwell\") are based in Calgary, Alberta and were established to acquire and operate businesses that engage in oilfield waste management services. The principal undertaking of Deepwell is to provide a variety of services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in western Canada. \b \bOn April 27, 2006, Deepwell completed its private placement which raised $40,000,000 in gross proceeds. On April 28, 2006, Deepwell closed the acquisition of the oilfield waste management businesses operated by Producers Oilfield Services Inc. for cash consideration of approximately $43,000,000. The acquisition was funded with approximately $37,000,000 in net proceeds from the April 27, 2006 private placement, and approximately $6,000,000 drawn from the Trust's credit facilities. The acquisition included three operating facilities in Alberta located at Grande Cache, Mayerthorpe, and Rycroft. \b \bThe Mayerthorpe and Grande Cache facilities are oilfield waste management facilities and are operated in association with Class 1B disposal wells. These facilities are designed to receive, treat and separate oilfield wastes into recoverable oil and disposable water and solids. Recovered oil is shipped from the facility and sold into the oil market at prevailing market rates. The solids are transported and disposed of in a landfill approved by the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) and the water is injected into a Deepwell LP Class 1B disposal well. Deepwell LP's facilities can also receive, treat and separate oil/water emulsions to obtain pipeline specification crude oil. Treated oil is then shipped from the facility and sold into the oil market at prevailing market rates and credited back to the customer and the separated water is injected into a Deepwell LP Class 1B disposal well. \b \bThe Rycroft facility is a water injection facility operated in association with a Class 1B disposal well. This facility is designed to receive and treat produced water to recover residual amounts of oil. The residual oil is shipped from the facility and then sold into the oil market at prevailing market rates. The water is disposed of in the Deepwell LP Class 1B disposal well at Rycroft. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bStrategy \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bDeepwell is committed to building value for its Unitholders through disciplined management and the implementation of its long-term strategy. The key aspects of Deepwell's strategy are: \b \b \b    << \b    -   Focus on oilfield waste management: Deepwell currently operates \b        exclusively in the oilfield waste management business, and intends to \b        continue that focus; \b    -   Growth: Deepwell is primarily focused on organic growth through \b        adding new facilities, and increasing capacity and services provided \b        at existing facilities; \b    -   Operational efficiency: Attain and maintain efficient operations and \b        a high standard of customer service within a safe working \b        environment; and \b    -   Environmental stewardship: Meet or exceed regulatory requirements and \b        industry standards. \b    >> \b \b \b

Bulkeley \u001d  Increasingly, the public face of International Business Machines Corp. is that of Steve Mills. \u001d  Mr. Mills heads IBM's rich and acquisition-hungry software unit, which has buoyed results in recent quarters. He frequently represents the company at investor conferences and software-customer gatherings, and his rising profile reflects a new reality at the technology giant. \u001d  IBM still gets most of its reputation from its computers and most of its revenue from services, but most of its profit growth comes from software. After 44 software acquisitions since 2000 for about $9.5 billion, the company is trolling for more. \u001d  Mr. Mills says his group is likely to become increasingly visible because more than half of its revenue is finally coming from fast-growing software areas, offsetting declines in old mainframe-related software. \u001d  \"I've been doing off-Broadway for years,\" says Mr. Mills. \"Now, it's like I have a hit series.\" \u001d  On a stand-alone basis, IBM would have had the second-highest revenue of any software company after Microsoft Corp. Software revenue grew 14.4% in the fourth quarter and reached $18.2 billion last year. Software accounts for only 20% of total revenue -- but 40% of earnings. Fast-growing IBM brands include WebSphere, a variety of Internet tools for business, which gained 23% last year; Tivoli, which manages computer systems, up 26%; and Lotus, which makes email software, up 12%. \u001d  Mr. Mills is credited with helping to persuade the company to emphasize software, and with taking a disciplined approach to making and integrating acquisitions. IBM buys smaller, often closely held, companies with arcane products and little reputation outside the tech community. The most it has paid for a company in the past six years is the $2.1 billion it laid out in 2002 for Rational Software, a maker of tools used by software developers. \u001d  The idea, Mr. Mills explains, is to buy companies with unique products that can grow faster when sold by IBM's giant sales force. Mr. Mills says he won't buy a company just to get more salespeople or new customers, since IBM already sells some products to virtually all large enterprises. Instead, he tries to make sure they \"can accelerate their revenue two or even three times\" as fast as part of IBM. \u001d  Once acquired, companies are put through an integration process that was initiated in 2000 at Mr. Mills's instigation. \u001d  John Patrick, a former software group executive, says that one of the keys to IBM's success in software was Mr. Mills's recognition in 1995 that the Internet would be used by big business for more than advertising. That led Mr. Mills to order programmers to develop its WebSphere software using open standards that other companies could easily link up with -- a risky decision because it could have made it easy to replace it, Mr. Patrick says. \u001d  John Swainson, chief executive of rival CA Inc., who used to work for Mr. Mills at IBM, says his former boss \"fought the battles when it wasn't popular to say that IBM had to be in software.\" \u001d  Mr. Mills, 55 years old, is the same age as IBM Chairman Samuel Palmisano, so he's not regarded internally as a candidate for the top job. Both are likely to retire in five years at IBM's normal retirement age of 60. \u001d  Mr. Mills, one of just two of IBM's top executive team who hasn't been replaced or moved since Mr. Palmisano became CEO, is an IBM lifer. He started as a mainframe salesman on the AT&T account in New York City after graduation from Union College and worked in finance for several years before taking over management of one of IBM's software labs. His total compensation was $6 million last year. \u001d  Today, he says he still spends a number of hours each week with customers. He jokes: \"I was a psychology major. Unlike most IBM executives, I use my degree every day.\" \u001d  IBM's ever-expanding suite of software touches some unexpected corners of corporate activity. Franklin Alvarez, manager of construction services for Consolidated Edison Inc., says that software made by Filenet, a 2006 IBM acquisition, allows the New York utility's construction workers to use wireless hand-held devices to confirm they have signed permits from the city before they open up a street, something that used to require couriers physically bringing the documents. \u001d  After acquiring a company, Mr. Mills's 5,000-person sales force has to move fast to get trained in the acquired software, and to pitch it to their customers. IBM says companies acquired from 2002 to 2004 averaged 25% revenue growth the year after they were acquired -- including closely held Candle Corp., which IBM bought for $430 million in June 2004 and saw its revenue surge to $300 million the subsequent year. \u001d  Six years ago, while acquiring database maker Informix, Mr. Mills ordered executives to keep a record of what worked and what didn't in order to standardize the way acquisitions are integrated. He also started IBM's sophisticated \"signature selling system\" that categorizes and tracks sales opportunities on a weekly basis. Some salesmen groused about the paperwork, but IBM later adopted the system for its entire sales force. \u001d  As soon as an acquisition is completed, IBM sends in a transition team. \"Every employee gets an IBM employee as a buddy,\" Mr. Mills says. On the very day IBM completed its acquisition of Las Vegas-based SRD Inc. in 2005, founder Steve Jonas says the new owner renamed all SRD products. \"There's a process called blue-washing,\" he says. \u001d  SRD specialized in software that helps casinos comb public and private databases to check whether a job applicant might be living at the same address as someone Nevada regulators had banned, or if a contractor had an arrest record. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security adopted the software after 2001 to check on suspected terrorists. Last year, Mr. Mills asked Mr. Jonas to speak about the products' uses at a presentation he made to IBM's top customers on Wall Street, opening up another potential market. \u001d  The road to such a successful transition started before the acquisition, Mr. Jonas says, when Mr. Mills spent time with him discussing the technology and how it fit with IBM products. He was, Mr. Jonas says, \"paying attention.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 23:08 ET (03:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

UAW Vows To Help Toyota's Hourly Workers In

related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \b \b   By Norihiko Shirouzu \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  LEXINGTON, Ky. (Dow Jones)--The United Auto Workers union Saturday stepped up pressure on Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) as it geared to launch a fresh drive to organize hourly workers at the auto maker's vehicle assembly plant near here, holding a town-hall-style rally at which half a dozen current and former Toyota workers complained about how the company fails at safety, relies heavily on lower-paid temporary workers, and harbors a \"secret\" plan to reduce their wages and benefits. \u001d  UAW Vice President Terry Thurman, who moderated the meeting at a church near downtown Lexington, said the UAW has begun working to assist Toyota workers at its plant in Georgetown, Ky., to establish a \"workers' rights board\" in Kentucky where concerned workers can make public statements about the Japanese auto maker. The Georgetown plant, like most U.S. Toyota facilities, is not unionized. \u001d  The UAW, Thurman said, is committed to provide \"all the assistance we can\" to Toyota workers. \u001d  The Toyota workers and their supporters, many wearing shirts garnering the UAW logo, sought the union's support for their fresh campaign, although they explained they are willing to take time with their latest effort. \u001d  \"It's time for the (plant) team member to join the others to make (it) a better place to work,\" said Tim Unger, one of the Toyota workers who spoke at the event and an 18-year veteran at the Georgetown plant. It's critical for shop-floor workers to have \"a voice\" they don't have today, for they have been victimized by Toyota's reputed quest for efficiency, he said. \u001d  A group of about a few hundred workers at the plant, some of the workers said, has been trying to organize 6,000 hourly associates at the plant on and off over the years, but there has been a \"renewed energy\" in their effort in recent months, especially after a discovery earlier this year of an internal company document that described a possible plan by Toyota to cut worker wages and benefits at a time when it is posting massive profits year after year. \u001d  The UAW, on its part, has been trying for some time to penetrate the largely non-unionized ranks of auto workers working for Asian and European automakers at factories located mostly in the southern U.S. The union has seen a consistent decline in its membership as U.S. automakers and parts suppliers that employ UAW workers cut jobs in an effort to deal with shrinking domestic-vehicle market share. The UAW is scrambling to organize further in the auto industry and in new industries in order to restore influence and financial clout. \u001d  The UAW's Thurman was careful to say Saturday's rally in Lexington didn't mark a start of any official campaign to represent Toyota workers at the Georgetown plant, which builds America's best-selling car Camry, among other vehicles. The meeting was intended as an effort to provide Toyota workers a forum to voice their concerns and \"send Toyota a message workers deserve justice, dignity and respect.\" Thurman said he believes the union needs \"a lot more worker support\" if it were to launch a campaign today. \u001d  The workers who spoke at the hour-long meeting expressed discontent over a host of issues that included a treatment of injured workers and liberal use of lower-paid temporary workers to cut wages. Thurman said approximately 150 workers and their family members and supporters attended the rally. \u001d  One of the biggest complaints voiced in the meeting was what the workers described as a lack of equitable profit-sharing with hourly workers even as Toyota has been hugely profitable, posting more than $10 billion in net profit over the past few years. \u001d  Cornelia James, a worker with 18 years of experience at the plant on her belt, said that in 1988, Fujio Cho, the then-top manager of the Georgetown plant and now chairman of Toyota in Japan, stood before plant workers and promised that wages at the plant would go up and plant workers would become the highest-paid workers in the world if they worked hard to make Toyota a success in the U.S. A Toyota spokesman couldn't immediately confirm Cho's alleged promise. \u001d  James said along with her colleagues, she has done her part to make sure Toyota succeed in the U.S. \"But my (hourly) wage has not gone above\" wage levels of workers at the Detroit auto makers as Cho promised, she said. \u001d  \"Toyota is a success and I want to be a success,\" James said. \"I want to be the highest auto worker Mr. Cho said I would be.\" \u001d  Toyota spokesman Dan Sieger said the company believes wages and benefits for Toyota plant workers in the U.S. are \"competitive\" compared with even generously compensated shop-floor workers of the U.S. Big Three auto makers. They are so especially considering performance bonuses the company has been paying its workers at the Georgetown plant and elsewhere in recent years. Sieger said workers in Kentucky received bonuses totaling $7,000 to $10,000 a worker last year. \u001d  Toyota executives have said the company prefers to keep the union out of its North American plants, and that it has no plan to cut benefits or wages at the Georgetown plant as the workers claimed Saturday. \b \u001d  -By Norihiko Shirouzu, The Wall Street Journal \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 10:22 ET (14:22 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c34e5ee5d4e2d293d8077d9d525250fd","symR":["ACS"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Affiliated Computer Services","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACS"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  Affiliated Computer Services: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=ACS or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:05 ET (07:05 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c3975d795dfc4239542136d3998159ee","symR":["PML"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for PIMCO Municipal Income Fund II (PML)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PML"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  PIMCO Municipal Income Fund II (PML): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=PML or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c3bc53e19949dbaa0b3ff7312b27fd07","symR":["SLV.AU","AU000000SLV8"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Sylvania Resources PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLV.AU","AU000000SLV8"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG"],"Story":"\u001d  Sylvania Resources PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=AU000000SLV8 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:21 ET (09:21 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c3da4da200c194f21a5c906d7cd5c222","symR":["WPP.LN","WPPGY","GB00B0J6N107"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for WPP Group PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WPP.LN","WPPGY","GB00B0J6N107"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","MED","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\u001d  WPP Group PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B0J6N107 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:36 ET (09:36 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c41b8c8d6375ec591a21ee3ce979d21c","symR":["VDE"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Vanguard Energy ETF","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VDE"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\u001d  Vanguard Energy ETF: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=VDE or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:47 ET (09:47 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c421f6542cb7bedeb1bdb4e840e8d520","symR":["QED.LN","GB0007184442"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Quintain Estates & Develop plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["QED.LN","GB0007184442"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","RED","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Quintain Estates & Develop  plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0007184442 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:01 ET (09:01 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c44b25e83975ffca68a0352a9993596d","symR":["CII"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Merrill Lynch Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc.

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Ray A. Smith \u001d  FOR A GROWING number of golfers, even the shoes they wear don't mean a thing if they don't help that swing. \u001d  Footwear makers are increasingly focusing on engineering shoes that promise to give golfers more stability and flexibility when swinging their clubs. The idea is that those qualities will result in better shots -- and golfers apparently are buying it. \u001d  In 2006, sales of golf footwear at on-course shops and off-course specialty stores in the U.S. rose 5.1% to a record $258 million, according to Tom Stine, co-founder of Golf Datatech, a market-research company based in Kissimmee, Fla. Sales of golf shoes have increased steadily in the past four years, he says. He attributes that partly to \"golfers buying more pairs of shoes, perhaps influenced by new styles and new technology in footwear, which have been prevalent in footwear over all the brands over the last four or five years.\" \u001d  That's a big deal for a once-sleepy category in the golf industry. For the most part, manufacturers and golfers alike long treated shoes as a mere accessory, more on a par with apparel than with clubs. \u001d  The new emphasis on performance is part of a continuing evolution of the golf shoe and of the sport itself, industry experts say. In recent years, golf shoes have been incorporating styles, colors and technologies typically found in other athletic shoes. Part of that is because a newer generation of athletic golfers, most notably Tiger Woods, has played a role in getting the world to think of golf more as a physical sport, not just a leisurely activity for out-of-shape retirees and part-time duffers. \u001d  \"The perception of golf has changed,\" says Mike Forsey, global product director for footwear and equipment at Nike Golf. \"Before, the perception was you can kind of come and drink while playing. But now, athletes are playing the sport of golf. Tiger has a pretty rigid workout program. So the shoe construction and performance needs have definitely changed. There's more sport influence.\" \u001d  One of the newest entries in the performance-shoe market is from Nike Inc. The company came out with a shoe in February called the SP-8 TW Tour, which it lists for $220. The shoe is designed so that the instep side of the sole flexes independently from the rest of the sole. The company says this keeps the rear foot grounded longer during a swing, generating more power in the stroke. \u001d  That same month, Adidas AG began selling a line of golf shoes called Powerband. The shoes feature a supportive shell that wraps around the perimeter of the sole, which is supposed to offer the golfer more leverage and stability when swinging. The $140 shoe also is designed to eliminate movement of the foot inside the shoe. \"It locks your foot in place so that throughout the swing, the foot and shoe act as a single unit,\" says Dave Ortley, global director of footwear for adidas Golf. \"By eliminating foot-slip inside the shoe, we erase a common power leak that golfers face with conventional, less technical footwear.\" \u001d  A new $225 shoe from Fortune Brands Inc.'s FootJoy brand, called ReelFit, eschews laces in favor of a dial on the back of the shoe that is supposed to allow for a more precise fit. The shoe, introduced last fall, won't loosen during play like a laced shoe can, FootJoy says, and of course untied laces aren't a problem. \u001d  Cleats are also getting more attention, with shoemakers focusing on keeping golfers' feet solidly planted during a swing. Arnold Ravick, a podiatrist with a private practice in Washington and a spokesman for the American Podiatric Medical Association, says golf \"is like track in a way -- it's totally about how you grip the ground. If you don't grip the ground as well, you don't get as much push with your swing.\" \u001d  He adds that the combination of stability and flexibility is important, because \"when you swing and you twist your torso, you want to keep your feet as a stable support base, but you need a little bit of flexibility or you'd sprain your ankle. Before, in old golf shoes, there was less adherence and no flexibility. This is a big improvement.\" \u001d  A new line of shoes from ECCO Sko AS, under the name Flexor, is one of several that feature removable cleats that lock in place, to ensure that the cleats are fully tightened and that they won't come loose. The Flexor shoes also have multiple points on each cleat, to enhance their grip. \"Similar to a claw,\" says C.B. Tuite, general manager, golf, at ECCO USA. The shoes cost between $160 and $200. \u001d  Adidas says its Tour360 line has lugs -- the small gripping elements attached to the bottom of the shoe -- spaced amply apart to reduce the chances of debris and grass getting caught in between and affecting traction. The Tour360 shoes, introduced last year, also feature a wrap that hugs the instep, outstep and arch of the foot to keep golfers centered as they are swinging. \u001d  New shoes from Callaway Golf Co. under the XTT name ($110 to $185) have cleat receptacles that shift to better conform to the surface the golfer is standing on. (XTT stands for what the company calls its \"xtra traction technology.\") \"Each of those spikes adjusts, similar to an off-road vehicle with independent suspension on every tire,\" says James Gorman, director of global operations for footwear at Callaway Golf. \u001d  Almost all of the newest models of golf shoes also feature improved waterproofing and comfort cushioning. And styles have changed along with design. In fact, bright colors, logos and the occasional use of clear materials in portions of the shoe are often meant to call attention to the shoe's performance-oriented features. \u001d  New styles and colors have done a lot to boost interest in golf shoes, Mr. Stine says, but \"stability, traction and comfort\" are the most important features in the end. \u001d  --- \u001d  Mr. Smith is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.

But as competition increases and advertising dollars follow consumers online, news sites increasingly are trying to distinguish themselves. \u001d  MSNBC.com, the No. 2-ranked news Web site behind Yahoo News, is starting its first branding ad campaign this week. Instead of selling itself as a \"breaking news\" destination, as it once did, the site is trying to highlight the range of news and entertainment it offers. Spots in print, on TV, outdoors and online will carry the tagline \"A Fuller Spectrum of News,\" highlighting both MSNBC.com's original reporting and its partnerships with news outlets such as NBC, Newsweek and the Washington Post. MSNBC.com, jointly owned by Microsoft and NBC Universal, is spending $4 million on the campaign which runs through June, not including the cost of spots on NBC-owned networks. New York communications firm SS+K designed the campaign. \u001d  The marketing push comes as MSNBC.com's market position, long one of the strongest in the news sector thanks to its Microsoft ties, shows signs of strain. MSNBC.com's traffic fell 3% in February, despite strong growth in the overall news category, according to comScore Media Metrix. Yahoo News, CNN.com, FoxNews.com and AOL News each posted double-digit percentage gains. \u001d  MSNBC.com's executives say its internal figures -- backed up by another firm, Nielsen/NetRatings -- show that its traffic is increasing. They say the campaign isn't a response to traffic patterns but a desire to differentiate the site from other online news hubs. \u001d  Even so, the campaign shows how online news is maturing. When MSNBC.com began in 1996, it aimed to be a destination for breaking news on the Web, says Merrill Brown, editor of the site for its first six years. Aside from promotional support on MSN and onscreen references on NBC-owned networks, particularly MSNBC, the site did little in the way of traditional marketing. \u001d  Things have changed. The Web has become a conventional medium for news. Almost 100 million people visited online news sites in February, up 12% from the year-earlier period, according to comScore Media Metrix. \u001d  \"For a long time, people viewed this as an experiment. The experiment, in our opinion, is over. We are mainstream news now,\" says Charlie Tillinghast, president and publisher of MSNBC.com. \u001d  But that shift has intensified competition and has made it harder for sites to stand out. With advertisers shifting dollars from newspapers and TV to the Web, most papers and TV networks are pouring resources into their Web sites. Not only do most sites now offer breaking news, a variety of other features are standard, including video, blogs and podcasts. As a result, customers find it hard to tell one news site from the other, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, a survey of consumer behavior by ForeSee Results and the University of Michigan's business school. \u001d  MSNBC.com hopes its marketing campaign will give its brand name a clearer definition for consumers-and draw more direct traffic to the site. Right now, MSNBC.com is heavily reliant on traffic from Microsoft sites such as MSN. In February, just 7.8% of MSNBC.com's 25.8 million visitors logged on directly, according to comScore, while 47.8% came from Microsoft sites, which often are loaded as the standard home page on personal computers. \u001d  While CNN.com has a smaller audience, more come directly to the site -- 17.8% of February's traffic, comScore estimates. Because they are choosing to go to CNN, those visitors are more valuable for advertisers than people who are simply linked from another site. CNN has \"an audience that are much more hard-core news followers. That's really valuable,\" says Jay Krihak, partner and group director of MediaEdge:CIA. CNN saw 50% growth in digital ad revenue in 2006, the company said, compared with 20% for MSNBC.com. \u001d  CNN is benefiting from its decades-old news brand name, of course. But the Time Warner-owned channel has also made efforts to beef up original reporting for the Web site. The channel says its entire staff contributes to CNN.com. While covering stories, reporters frequently create material both for the cable network and for the Web. CNN also has devoted a lot of energy to promoting its site. Aside from journalists mentioning the Web hub on the air, CNN has run marketing campaigns for the site with taglines such as \"The Power of CNN Under Your Command.\" \u001d  Much of MSNBC.com's content comes from other outlets, but the site also is focusing on increasing original video and reporting for the Web. MSNBC.com's editorial staff -- about 80 people -- is relocating from New Jersey to NBC News headquarters in New York to promote more integration between the two organizations. Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Bill Dedman joined MSNBC.com last fall to work for the online news network's investigative-reporting team. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007

\u001d  PARIS (AP)--Russia's economics minister pressed his country's bid for a greater role in Airbus parent company EADS on Sunday, saying Moscow wants a clear answer on whether it is a welcome partner in the European aircraft manufacturer. \u001d  \"We have given clear signals that we want to cooperate with Airbus,\" including by raising Russia's stake in Franco-German EADS, German Gref told reporters in Paris. \"For now we do not have a comprehensive strategy from the Airbus side.\" \u001d  Last year Russia's state-owned Vneshtorgbank, or VTB, announced it had acquired 5% of European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. (5730.FR). In response, EADS warned that the Moscow bank would not be welcomed as a decision-making industrial shareholder. \u001d  Some observers say tighter links with Russia could endanger the European defense group's U.S. business, and generate concern about governance at EADS and the transfer of sensitive technologies. \u001d  Moscow, though, is determined to increase its role in Airbus, which is struggling to recover from costly delays to the A380 superjumbo, losses because of the weak dollar, and a year of management turmoil that has sent EADS stock tumbling. \u001d  Gref expressed frustration at resistance to a greater Russian stake, saying it could help the aircraft-maker expand into a potentially vast Russian market against competition from U.S.-based Boeing Co. (BA). \u001d  He suggested that if Airbus continues to balk, Russia's banks and investors - flush with oil profits and eager to expand in international markets - could turn elsewhere. \u001d  \"Russian companies are growing at a very fast pace and local markets are now too narrow for them, including in the aviation industry,\" Gref said. \u001d  If Airbus agrees, \"we're ready to work as partners,\" he said. \"If not, then we will build a different strategy of cooperation with other companies.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 12:37 ET (16:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d3304ec032b47e5cf0c535480ae1d0cb","symR":["SLET.LN","GB0006039597"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Standard Life Equity Inc trust","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLET.LN","GB0006039597"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Standard Life Equity Inc trust: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0006039597 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:19 ET (09:19 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d341977d75f0de7873f00efd01824393","symR":["DSU"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Merrill Lynch Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.

Both offers propose taking the company private using an employee stock ownership plan. \u001d  Tribune was negotiating late last night and pressing for better terms from both Mr. Zell and Messrs. Burkle and Broad, according to people familiar with the matter. Despite the late wrangling, it appeared that Mr. Zell was likely to clinch the deal, these people said. \u001d  After six months, it appeared that Tribune's board was finally in the place it had been trying to reach: running a real auction. A letter last week from Messrs. Burkle and Broad, proposing a deal valued at $34 a share, pushed Tribune's special committee to try to extract better terms from Mr. Zell, whose offer was valued a dollar less per share than that of Messrs. Burkle and Broad. At the same time, the board demanded better contract terms from the Broad-Burkle team. \u001d  Still, it was possible the board could decide to further extend its self-imposed deadline of March 31. And final important details remained to be ironed out. \u001d  Representatives from the Broad-Burkle camp appeared resigned over the weekend to Mr. Zell's likely success. \"They just don't want to do [a deal] with us,\" said a person familiar with the duo's thinking, referring to Tribune's board. The special committee had asked for additional information from Messrs. Broad and Burkle Friday, but the joint proposal isn't as far along as Mr. Zell's, this person said. The pair requested a merger agreement from the company and expressed surprise that they didn't receive one, according to a person familiar with their thinking. \u001d  The offer from Messrs. Broad and Burkle remained less certain and would take more time to complete, a strike against it in the minds of members of the special committee of Tribune's board. \u001d  Under the terms of his offer before the last-minute talks, Mr. Zell was expected to put in less than $300 million in equity, a fraction of the company's total value of about $7.9 billion, not counting Tribune's existing $4.5 billion in debt. The deal would then unfold in two steps, according to a person familiar with its structure. In the first step, Mr. Zell would invest his equity and receive convertible preferred stock in Tribune. Then, Tribune would borrow money and pay out about $17.50 a share to shareholders. If approved, the company would be taken private, with shareholders receiving an additional payout and the majority of the company being held by an employee stock ownership plan, which would roll future contributions to employee 401(k) funds into the ESOP. \u001d  Should the deal go through, Mr. Zell, who entered the bidding for Tribune at the 11th hour and is known for picking up out-of-favor businesses that scare away most investors, will end up as chairman of the company, which owns newspapers including the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, and a string of TV stations. He has said his interest in the company is financial, and not to promote any political agenda. Messrs. Broad and Burkle, for their part, both talked about their strong emotional ties to the L.A. Times and their desire to protect the paper. \u001d  The sale of the 160-year-old media conglomerate would be the latest sign of the retrenchment of the newspaper industry, which is undergoing a historic shift. Newspapers are under direct assault as never before, mostly from the Internet, which is siphoning off readers and advertisers. Investor confidence has plummeted. \u001d  The past year has been a particularly punishing period. From the moment Tribune first disclosed that its major shareholder -- the Chandler family --  was in open rebellion against company management, Tribune and other newspaper companies have revealed a consistently declining picture of their business. The auction of the company, sparked last summer by the Chandler's complaints about Tribune's stock price, has been stymied by deterioration in the newspaper business. \u001d  --- \u001d  Dennis K.

 Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. (TEL.NZ) met with Telecommunications Minister David Cunliffe Monday in a bid to fast track discussions on an operational split being imposed on the company, people familiar with the talks said. \u001d  One person told Dow Jones Newswires that several law makers, including Cunliffe, met with Telecom management as part of the ongoing talks relating to a planned three-way split into network, wholesale and retail divisions. \u001d  \"There (was) a meeting. It's not just with Cunliffe, it's several ministers and (Telecom) senior management. It's part of the operational separation discussion,\" the person said. \u001d  The participants are understood to have included officials from the Ministry of Economic Development, which provides policy advice on the regulatory environment for the telecommunications sector. \u001d  Cunliffe, who as Telecommunications Minister is charged with implementing the split along with introducing legislation that will force Telecom to open its fixed-line local network to rivals later this year, declined to comment Monday on whether the talks took place. \u001d  \"I do not normally comment on my meetings,\" Cunliffe said, adding: \"the Government has an open door policy and I regularly consult with industry.\" \u001d  Telecom declined to comment on the matter. \u001d  The split and other changes are part of the Telecommunications Amendment Bill, passed in December last year. The bill is designed to weaken Telecom's monopoly grip on the local phone network and increase the country's uptake of high-speed Internet services. \u001d  Telecom, New Zealand's biggest listed company, brokered the operational separation with law makers in November in order to avoid an even more onerous structural split, which would have led to separate ownership and stock listings for each of its units. \u001d  But local media reports suggest progress since then has been slow, distracting Telecom from preparing to meet the increased competition the changes will likely bring. \u001d  \"It's a huge weight on the business trying to do this at the same time as trying to monitor technology shifts, and invest in this and that,\" the person close to the talks said. \"It takes a lot of resources on something that is quite logistically challenging.\" \u001d  He added, however, that \"there is an understanding that it doesn't get done overnight.\" \u001d  Telecom, a former state-owned monopoly, controls just over 80% of New Zealand's telecommunications market, estimated at NZ$8 billion a year. The company estimates increased competition will reduce its share of the retail market from 84% as at Dec. 31, to between 60% and 70% by 2012. \u001d  The company is currently mulling how to use the proceeds of last month's NZ$2.24 billion sale of its Yellow Pages directories business. \u001d  Investors are hoping for a substantial capital return, although analysts caution that over NZ$1 billion may be earmarked for capital expenditure, including funding its NZ$360 million purchase of Australia-based junior telco PowerTel Ltd. (PWT.AU), recapitalizing its joint venture with Hutchison Australia (HTA.AU) in the H3GA mobile network, and a potential upgrade of its CDMA mobile network in New Zealand. \u001d  Telecom is expected to update the market on its capital spending plans at its fiscal third quarter result early next month. \b \u001d  -By Rachel Pannett, Dow Jones Newswires; 64-4-471-5990; rachel.pannett@dowjones.com

SAN ANTONIO, April 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) today said it is in negotiations for a potential indirect investment in Telecom Italia S.p.A. The proposal is for AT&T to purchase a one-third stake in Olimpia S.p.A., a holding company with approximately 18 percent of Telecom Italia's ordinary shares, subject to satisfactory completion of AT&T's due diligence, agreement on other terms of the transaction, and satisfaction of other conditions.  As part of these negotiations, America Movil, S.A.B. de C.V. (AMX) also is considering an investment for one-third of the shares of Olimpia. AT&T's investment is contingent on America Movil's investment. \b \u001d  AT&T is in negotiations on the potential investment to acquire the interest from Pirelli & C S.p.A., which owns 80 percent of Olimpia.  Olimpia holds only Telecom Italia assets. \b \u001d  The valuation of the stakes in Olimpia which are the object of the possible sale would be based on a price per Telecom Italia share equal to euro 2.82, minus the net debt of Olimpia on the closing date of the transaction, subject to the satisfaction of the terms of the proposal. \b \u001d  As a global telecom leader in wireless, broadband and IP networks with customers in 137 countries, AT&T is continually reviewing opportunities that will help it serve the company's growing global customer base.  AT&T believes its potential investment in Olimpia would provide Telecom Italia with a strategic partner with whom it can share best practices and pursue joint interests. \b \u001d  AT&T has proven itself to be a capable, committed partner in its international investments, partnering with local owners and managers, and working with governments to bring the latest in telecommunications networks, products and services to consumers and businesses. Examples of this include AT&T's 17-year partnership with Telmex, whose successful collaboration has helped deliver one of the most modern telecommunications networks in North America, as well as AT&T's investment in South Africa, which resulted in a mutually beneficial relationship that helped consumers and business customers alike. \b \u001d  Telecom Italia is one of Europe's largest and best-run communications service providers with a market capitalization of about euro 40 billion ($53.4 billion). It has 24 million landline, 57.9 million mobile and 8.6 million broadband connections, including broadband interests in the Netherlands, France and Germany, and wireless in Brazil. \b \u001d  AT&T, which Forbes magazine recognized as \"Company of the Year\" in 2006, is an industry leader in convergence, integrating networks and applications to deliver services to the \"three screens\" that matter most to consumers: the TV, personal computer and wireless device. AT&T plans to invest about $18 billion in capital in 2007 to strengthen its wireless, wireline and international networks. \b \u001d  Note: This AT&T release and other news announcements are available as part of an RSS feed at www.att.com/rss. \b \b    About AT&T \b \u001d  AT&T Inc. is a premier communications holding company.

ICBC has just nosed ahead in this extraordinarily tight race. But that means ICBC is probably one of the world's most overvalued banks -- and a Chinese stock-mania bellwether. \u001d  Since its initial public offering last October, ICBC stock has risen around 70% on the Shanghai exchange. The Chinese bank's market capitalization of $228 billion, at Friday's close, means it trades at 3.3 times its book value and 28 times its forecast 2007 earnings, according to data provider JCF Factset. By comparison, Bank of America, which boasts a similar return on equity, is a steal. The U.S. bank trades at around half the book value and about one-third the earnings multiple of ICBC. Bank of America's dividend yield of 4.4% is also twice as generous. \u001d  Not only is Bank of America a better value, it's also decades ahead of ICBC in business strategy. Commercial loans account for only a quarter of its lending and 11% of its assets. Its net interest income from these loans is only 6% of revenues. Like most large banks nowadays, Bank of America makes most of its money from consumer lending, and from fees and trading. \u001d  By comparison, ICBC resembles a U.S. money-center bank from half a century ago. Seventy percent of its loans were made to domestic companies as of last June, and net interest income from these accounted for 46% of its operating revenues. Typical of its transactions is the five billion yuan ($646 million) loan it made last Wednesday to the state-owned Zhanjiang Port Group. Western banks still make large corporate loans, but they do so in groups, and after taking their fees they pass them on as quickly as possible. ICBC kept the entire loan on its books. \u001d  China may be the future, but ICBC looks like the past. Of course, it will adapt as Chinese financial conditions change. But there will be tough challenges ahead, including problems with nonperforming loans. The Chinese banking giant is unlikely to retain its global No. 2 slot for long. \b \u001d  Conflicted Buyouts \b \u001d  Management-led buyouts are fraught with conflicts of interest. Corporate insiders, after all, know far more about the state of their businesses than anyone else. That's why special committees are set up to run the bidding process when senior executives want to take their companies private. These groups of independent directors are the best protection shareholders have against being short-changed. Unfortunately, they're not always up the job. \u001d  Take the case of Houston-based freight company EGL, which founder Jim Crane is trying to take private. Two weeks ago, EGL's directors agreed to Mr. Crane's offer to acquire the business for $38 per share. Not only is this price around 25% below where the stock was trading last summer, but it's the same price that private-equity firm Apollo Management had expressed a willingness to pay. And Apollo says it might have bid more if it had been given fuller access to EGL's books and management. \u001d  To make matters worse, the special committee has agreed to pay a breakup fee of $30 million, or about 1.5% of the value of the company, if anyone trumps Mr. Crane's bid. Half of that fee goes directly to Mr. Crane. New York-based Apollo has responded by suing the independent directors for \"blatant breaches of fiduciary duty.\" Lawyers working on behalf of the special committee couldn't be reached to explain its decisions. Mr. Crane declined to comment. \u001d  Breakup fees generally serve a useful purpose. They both encourage potential buyers to make serious offers, while compensating them for their expenses if their bid is topped. But the case of EGL highlights how they may fail to add shareholder value in the case of management buyouts. After, all the odds are already stacked against outsiders. Special committees shouldn't make matters worse. \u001d  -- Martin Hutchinson and Lauren Silva \u001d  --- \u001d  This column is written by breakingviews.com, an online financial commentary site. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 19:55 ET (23:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e2450b463f041cc2e631fefeffadf7ac","symR":["NNN"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for National Retail Properties Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NNN"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  National Retail Properties Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NNN or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:47 ET (08:47 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"e28e9edc98884ad9d2dfa94bbee9456a","symR":["BAM","BAM.A.T","CA1125851040"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Brookfield Asset Management Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BAM","BAM.A.T","CA1125851040"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","RED","XDJGI","XNYA","XSTF","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  Brookfield Asset Management Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BAM or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:34 ET (07:34 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"e298b8f027eb090b271d7ff0bb8e36aa","symR":["RTC.XE","DE0007008906"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for realTech AG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RTC.XE","DE0007008906"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX"],"Story":"\u001d  realTech AG: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0007008906 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:42 ET (09:42 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"e2dfdd15b5e9377ca9cca64dfc276e1c","symR":["VBF"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Van Kampen Bond Trust (VBF)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VBF"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Van Kampen Bond Trust (VBF): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=VBF or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:43 ET (09:43 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"e2f3d9ccae0fe2109c1866703ff22e45","symR":["BEC"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Beckman Coulter Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T07:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BEC"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Beckman Coulter Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BEC or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 03:18 ET (07:18 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"e30b4a36b2ed5b6a64a0ac8600fa8365","symR":["USU"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for USEC Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T09:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["USU"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  USEC Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=USU or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 05:40 ET (09:40 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"e3165e244a5ae1757b2817727895f758","symR":["MRK","US5893311077"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Merck & Co.

Zell","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T23:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TRB"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Sarah Ellison \u001d  After months of drama in its boardroom and declining performance at its newspapers, Tribune Co. late yesterday appeared to be firming up a deal to sell itself to Chicago real-estate tycoon Sam Zell, according to people familiar with the matter. \u001d  Over the weekend, Tribune's special committee of the board reviewed competing offers from Mr. Zell and a joint bid from Los Angeles businessmen Eli Broad and Ron Burkle. Both offers propose taking the company private using an employee stock ownership plan. \u001d  To be sure, it was possible the board could decide to further extend its self-imposed deadline of March 31 and take more time to reach a decision. And final important details remained to be ironed out. But people close to the discussions said that Mr. Zell's offer -- which is valued at $33 a share -- was preferred. Tribune's shares traded up 58 cents Friday to $32.11 on the New York Stock Exchange. \u001d  The offer from Messrs. Broad and Burkle, while valued Tribune at $34 a share, is less certain and would take more time to complete, a strike against it in the minds of members of the special committee of Tribune's board, who have been laboring over the sale process for six months. But with many twists and turns in the auction process, people close to the situation cautioned that a last-minute turn was still possible. \u001d  Representatives from the Broad-Burkle camp appeared resigned over the weekend to Mr. Zell's likely success. \"They just don't want to do (a deal) with us,\" said a person familiar with the duo's thinking, referring to Tribune's board. The special committee had asked for additional information from Messrs. Broad and Burkle Friday, but the joint proposal isn't as far along as Mr. Zell's, this person said. It would take additional time to firm up a deal with the California businessmen. That uncertainty is likely to give Mr. Zell the edge in closing a deal. \u001d  A spokesman for Tribune and a spokeswoman for Mr. Zell declined to comment. \u001d  Mr. Zell is expected to put in less than $300 million in equity, a fraction of the company's total value of about $7.9 billion, not counting Tribune's existing $4.5 billion in debt. The deal will unfold in two steps, according to a person familiar with its structure. In the first step, Mr. Zell will invest his equity and receive convertible preferred stock in Tribune. Then, Tribune would borrow money and pay out about $17.50 a share to shareholders. If approved, the company would be taken private, with shareholders receiving an additional payout and the majority of the company being held by an employee stock ownership plan, which would roll future contributions to employee 401(k) funds into the ESOP, effectively providing capital for the buyout without increasing Tribune's debt. \u001d  Should the deal go through, Mr. Zell, who entered the bidding for Tribune at the eleventh hour and is known for picking up out-of-favor businesses that scare away most investors, will end up as chairman of the company, which owns newspapers including the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, and a string of TV stations. He has said his interest in the company is financial, and not to promote any political agenda. Messrs. Broad and Burkle, for their part, both talked about their strong emotional ties to the Los Angeles Times and their desire to protect the paper. \u001d  The sale of the 160-year-old media conglomerate would be the latest sign of the retrenchment of the newspaper industry, which is undergoing an historic shift. Today, newspapers are under direct assault as never before, mostly from the Internet, which is siphoning off readers and advertisers. Investor confidence has plummeted. \u001d  Should a sale go through, it would come after a particularly punishing year for newspapers. From the moment Tribune first revealed that its major shareholder -- the Chandler family -- was in open rebellion against company management, Tribune and other newspaper companies have revealed a consistently declining picture of their business. The auction of the company, sparked last summer by the Chandlers' complaints about Tribune's stock price, has been stymied by deterioration in the newspaper business. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones

\u001d  (This updates an item published at 1829 GMT with further details, comments from shareholders, Italy Telecommunication minister) \b \u001d  MILAN (Dow Jones)--The board of Italian tires-to-telecom group Pirelli & C. Spa (PC.MI) Sunday entered exclusive talks with U.S. telecommunication operator AT&T (T) and Mexican mobile phone operator America Movil (AMX) to sell 60% of its stake in Italian unlisted holding company Olimpia SpA, the company said Sunday. \u001d  This would pave the way for the two telecommunication operators to become the two single largest shareholders of Italy's largest telecom group Telecom Italia SpA (TI). \u001d  Pirelli indirectly controls an 18% interest in Telecom Italia through its 80% stake in Olimpia. Italian unlisted holding company Sintonia, controlled by the Benetton family, owns the remaining 20% of Olimpia. \u001d  AT&T and America Movil valued Telecom Italia at EUR2.82 per share minus the EUR2.8 billion net debt of Olimpia, the same people said, noting however that the price is subject to due diligence by the two companies and all the conditions of the contract. \u001d  \"The deal is worth around EUR2.7 billion, a person familiar with the matter said Sunday. \"The dividend that Olimpia will receive from Telecom Italia EUR0.14 per share, or EUR336 million and more than compensates the financial charges of the first three months of the year.\" Olimpia's debt will be cut by at least EUR200 million. \u001d  Later Sunday Italy's Telecommunication Minister Paolo Gentiloni Sunday said he is \"deeply worried\" about the news Pirelli entered exclusive talks AT&T (T) and America Movil (AMX) adding that \"the government would watch the situation closely.\" \u001d  Gentiloni said he and the government had been informed only Sunday afternoon that Pirelli's board would have held an extraordinary meeting to evaluate the offers. \u001d  In November, Pirelli wrote down the value of its Olimpia stake by EUR2.1 billion, valuing Telecom Italia shares at EUR3 each, still well above Telecom Italia current market price. \u001d  According to the terms of the agreement the right of first refusal on Olimpia shares is recognized to Italian merchant bank Mediobanca SpA (MB.MI) and Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G.MI). Olimpia shares control of Telecom Italia with investment bank Mediobanca SpA, which owns 1.5%, and insurer Assicurazioni Generali SpA, which has a 3.7% stake. \u001d  If they take up those rights, AT&T and America Movil will each get an indemnification equal to EUR16 million. \u001d  AT&T and America Movil have also said they would offer a put option to Pirelli and Sintonia on their remaining Olimpia stake and their Telecom Italia holdings for a year after any deal. \u001d  In the case the deal is completed by April 30, the share capital of Olimpia will be equally subdivided into three quotas among AT&T, Am&#233;rica M&#243;vil and the current shareholders, Pirelli & C. and Sintonia. \u001d   AT&T said in an emailed statement it believes its potential investment in Olimpia would provide Telecom Italia with a strategic partner with whom it can share best practices and pursue joint interests. \u001d  AT&T was advised by JPMorgan while Pirelli has been advised by Credit Suisse. \b \u001d  -By Sabrina Cohen, Dow Jones Newswires; +39 347 3563 463; sabrina.cohen@dowjones.com \u001d  (Giada Zampano contributed to the report) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 18:01 ET (22:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"eb3f37747a1a8ee3c0ffe134e173151a","symR":["HCFT.LN","GB0004254875"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Highcroft Investments plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-01T08:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HCFT.LN","GB0004254875"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI"],"Story":"\u001d  Highcroft Investments plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0004254875 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 01, 2007 04:11 ET (08:11 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"eb55980924ae14f2c778bd7a9603ab51","symR":["TROW"],"date":"2007-04-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for T.

Under NI 51-101, proved reserve assignments are based on a 90 percent probability that total quantities recovered will equal or exceed proved reserve estimates. Proved plus probable reserves are the expected case where there is an equal chance that the Proved plus Probable reserves will be higher or lower than estimated. \b \bThe year-end reserves for 2006 and 2005 presented include company working interests before and net after royalties and using forecast and constant price and cost assumptions. Where amounts and volumes are expressed on a gas equivalent basis, liquids volumes have been converted to cubic feet of gas at a ratio of 6,000 cubic feet of gas per barrel (6 Mcf/bbl). A conversion ratio of one bbl to six Mcf is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent equivalency at the wellhead. \b \b \b    <<

(IDC or the Company) (TSX: IDL) a global supplier in the high growth digital radiography (DR) equipment market, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2006. For the 2006 year, IDC reported a loss of $0.14 per share before one time write downs, for a full-year loss of $0.25 per share after write downs on revenues of $39,030,402. For the fourth quarter, the Company reported a loss of $0.07 per share before one-time write downs, on revenues of $12,533, 867 and a loss of $0.19 per share after write downs. \b \bCommenting on the results of 2006, Darryl Stein, President & CEO of IDC said, \"In 2006, the Company focused its efforts on top line sales growth, market share capture and channel development. Significant investments were made in new products, new geographies and new markets. These investments added over 50 new channel partners globally and growth through new products into the veterinary and chiropractic markets. IDC has invested into building a global distribution network, and a broad array of products to meet the growing demand for digital technology. \b \bThe Company has experienced exceptional growth over the last two years - revenues growing by over 550% in that period - with a strategy that has taken more time, money and resources than was anticipated, negatively affecting the Company's financial performance with respect to expenses and write downs. \b \bThe introduction of new products to displace earlier models equated to a higher rate of inventory obsolescence than in the past, and an increased learning curve for the Company's technical personnel and integration efforts. \b \bThe focus in 2007 is to reap the benefits of investments made in 2006. The Company's operations and infrastructure are being revamped to more effectively support the sales engine we have created. We started restructuring the operations of the Company in late Q3 of 2006. New management and staff were hired; new processes and new tools are being implemented, including the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. In January 2007 the financial modules were implemented, and the testing and validation of the manufacturing, inventory, purchase order and sales order modules has been completed and will go live during April 2007. This provides full financial and operational connectivity with a direct impact on the efficiencies and profitability of the organization. \b \bThe internal restructuring and implementation efforts have been arduous but essential to the long-term health of the business. We made a deliberate decision to give the Company time to complete implementing all of the restructuring efforts and as such revenues booked for Q1 will be soft, but for all the right reasons. I am confident that within 60 days IDC will not only be positioned, but capable of delivering on the significant opportunities ahead of us.\" \b \b \b    << \b    Imaging Dynamics Company Ltd. \b

Neither company would comment further. \b \b   Latest In A String Of Deals \b \u001d  In the past year, three such deals have made headlines in the retail currency trading platform industry. \u001d  In April, VantagePoint Venture Partners announced it had invested $40 million in foreign exchange trading platform GAIN Capital Group Inc. \u001d  The investment was twice the amount of capital invested in GAIN's three previous capitalization rounds, which netted the company approximately $20 million from investors including Tudor Investments, Edison Ventures, Cross Atlantic Capital Partners, and Blue Rock Capital. \u001d  A month later, private equity firm General Atlantic invested $127 million in Saxo Bank, which specializes in Internet-based technology systems for trading foreign exchange, foreign exchange options, equities and futures options. \u001d  In July, Technology Crossover Ventures bought a minority stake in FXall, the electronic foreign-exchange trading platform, for $77.5 million. \u001d  Private equity investors are not the only ones trying to make headway into this market, however. A number of banks have also recently launched their own retail trading platforms - usually with the help of an already existing provider - in an attempt to cater to the growing number of retail traders. \u001d  Last May, for example, Deutsche Bank (DB) launched DBFX, a Web site that offers retail customers 24-hour online margin currency trading, and ABN Amro (ABN) rolled out a new trading platform last summer aimed at retail currency, equity, fixed income and commodity traders. \b \b   Explosive Growth Has Drawbacks \b \u001d  Although interest in online retail currency trading has clearly grown, so too, have regulatory problems. \u001d  Just over a week ago, a U.S. District Court judge froze the assets of Forefront Investments Corp., an online retail trading provider also known as CFG Trader, after the company failed to meet minimum net capital requirements. \u001d  The action came after it was discovered that the company had liabilities of $8 million but assets of just $6.8 million, putting its 3,800 day-trader customers at risk of not being able to get their money back. \u001d  Rules require such firms to maintain assets of $1 million more than their liabilities. The NFA is considering bumping up the minimal capital requirements to better protect customers, who are often gambling with their savings without full knowledge of the risks associated with currency trading. \u001d  Indeed, more than 25,000 investors have been defrauded in currency-enforcement cases pursued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission since Congress gave the regulator authority over a small slice of currency trading in the U.S. in late 2000. \b \u001d  -By Isabelle Lindenmayer, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5063; Isabelle.Lindenmayer@dowjones.com \u001d  (Dan Molinski in New

Trustees concluded that retention of more cash to provide capital for growth would be most appropriate. A reduction in the cash distribution will provide greater financial flexibility to exploit Deepwell's high-return growth opportunities. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bInvesting activities \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bNet cash used in investing activities during the year was $49,215,940. \b \bBusiness acquisitions \b \bOn April 27 the Trust purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of Deepwell Disposal Services Inc. in exchange for 356,000 Class B Trust Units valued at $3,560,000. The Trust incurred transaction costs of $57,068. \b \bOn April 28, 2006, the Trust purchased the oilfield waste management assets of Producers Disposal Services Ltd. and Rycroft Disposal Well Inc. (\"PDS\" and \"Rycroft\" respectively) for cash consideration of $42,754,509. The Trust also incurred transaction costs of $241,279. The Trust acquired all of the assets of PDS and Rycroft, excluding security deposits held by the EUB. The Trust assumed the asset retirement obligations of PDS and Rycroft; however the Trust assumed only those operating liabilities accruing to PDS and Rycroft subsequent to March 31, 2006. The Trust also did not assume any bank indebtedness or amounts due to affiliates. \b \bCapital expenditures \b \bExcluding investment on the original acquisition, (which is detailed above) the Trusts' capital expenditures for purchase of property and equipment for the year were $6,808,967. \b \bIn the third quarter of 2006, a new pipeline from the Grande Cache facility to the disposal well was installed at a cost of approximately $1,290,000. \b \bTo increase capacity at Grande Cache, a second disposal well was placed into operation by stimulating an out-of-service disposal well at a cost of approximately $1,900,000. The well was put into service in late September and some productivity increases were realized in the fourth quarter, although the positive impact was mitigated by the operational downtime at Grande Cache in the fourth quarter. In March, 2007, Deepwell received EUB approval to increase wellhead pressure at this well, and further increases in injection rate are expected as a result. \b \bA solids treatment pad was installed at Grande Cache in the fourth quarter at a cost of approximately $390,000. The pad allows solids to be treated, such that landfill disposal costs can be significantly reduced. The pad was damaged in the December 7, 2006 fire, but should be repaired and placed back into service in the second quarter of 2007. \b \bApproximately $350,000 was invested in computers, furniture and other head office equipment upon the establishment of the Trust's head office location in August, 2006. \b \bApproximately $170,000 was invested in preliminary costs for acquisition and conversion of a second disposal well at Rycroft. An application was made in 2006 to the EUB for approval to add the second well into service, and approval was granted in March, 2007. The existing well at Rycroft was stimulated in June, 2006 at a cost of approximately $260,000, and the well's performance has improved substantially since that time. \b \bApproximately $730,000 was invested in preparation of the well, and application to the EUB for approval of Deepwell's planned facility at Claresholm., Alberta. An additional $30,000 was invested in costs related to other future facilities. \b \bThe remaining cost relate primarily to improvements of drainage and retention ponds at the facilities, new injection pumps, new tanks, mobile equipment. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bUnitholders' equity \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bOn April 27, 2006, the Trust completed a private placement offering of 4,000,000 Class B Trust units at $10 per unit, for total gross proceed of $40,000,000 less agents' commission of $2,400,000 and other expenses of $669,133. The net proceeds of $36,930,367 were used to complete the acquisition of PDS and Rycroft. An additional 356,000 Class B Trust units were issued as purchase consideration for Deepwell Disposal Services Inc. \b \bPursuant to the Trust's prospectus dated August 18, 2006, the Trust exchanged all outstanding Class B Trust Units on a one for one basis for Units of Deepwell Energy Services Trust. Subsequent to the exchange of Units, the Trust received approval to list the Units for trading on the TSX, and the Units commenced trading on the TSX on August 24, 2006. As of the March 28, 2007, the Trust had 4,356,000 Units outstanding. \b \bTrust unit option plan \b \bThe Trust has established a unit option plan for trustees, directors, officers, employees and consultants. The Trust recognizes unit-based compensation expense in the consolidated statement of income for all unit options granted based upon their fair value at the time of grant. The fair value is determined using an accepted option pricing model, with total compensation expense recognized over the period the options vest. Compensation expense is offset with a corresponding increase to contributed surplus. Consideration paid by the option-holder upon the exercise of the options, together with the amount previously recognized in contributed surplus, is recognized as an increase in Unitholders' capital. \b \bAs at December 31, 2006 a total of 314,500 options issued pursuant to the Trust incentive stock option plan (\"Option Plan\") were outstanding at an average exercise price of $10.01. All of these units were issued during the period and remain outstanding at December 31, 2006. No options are exercisable at December 31, 2006, and the weighted average contractual life remaining is 4.65 years. The total number of outstanding options shall not exceed 10% of the outstanding Trust Units. The options carry a five year term and vest equally over a period of three years from the date of grant. The exercise price of each option is based upon the weighted average trading price for a period prior to the date of grant. The exercise price is adjusted downwards by 100% of the amount of distributions paid on outstanding Trust Units. As at December 31, 2006, the exercise prices of outstanding options range from $9.62 to $10.26 per unit and the weighted average exercise price of granted options is $9.63 per unit. \b \bThe Trust recorded unit option compensation expense and contributed surplus of $251,432 during the period. The fair value of options issued during the period was estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of 4.25%; volatility of 35%; life of 5 years; the impact of monthly distributions and corresponding changes in exercise price during the life of the options are assumed to be equal and offsetting, and so no provision is made in the pricing model for either factor. \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bLiquidity \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bAs at December 31, 2006, the Trust had cash of $28,861. The Trust also has credit facilities in place in the aggregate of $17,500,000. \b \bNet cash provided by financing activities for the year was $45,385,577. The Trust realized $36,930,377 in net proceeds of its private placement on April 27, 2006. At December 31, 2006, the Trust had drawn $11,500,000 million on its long term credit facility. Deferred financing costs of $95,711 were paid relating to the establishment of the Trust's credit facilities. A total of $55,841 of deferred financing costs was amortized during the period. Other financing activities include the payment of $2,949,088 in distributions to Unitholders related to the periods from April 29, 2006 to December 31, 2006. \b \bCredit facilities \b \bDeepwell LP established credit facilities on April 27, 2006 with a Canadian chartered bank (the \"credit facilities\") which consist of a $2,000,000 demand revolving operating loan and a $15,500,000 364-day extendible revolving term loan, as well as a credit card facility. As of December 31, 2006, the borrowing base for the demand revolving loan was at $1,808,000 and the amount drawn was nil. As at December 31, 2006, an aggregate of $11,500,000 was drawn on the revolving term loan. \b \bThe operating loan bears interest ranging from the lender's prime rate plus 0.125 percent to prime plus 0.625 percent depending on the rate of debt to EBITDA, with interest payable monthly. The extendible revolving facility does not require principal payments thereunder until May 31, 2007, unless otherwise extended. If extended, the facility will continue not to require the payment of principal. If not extended, the credit facility reverts to a three-year term with principal payments thereunder commencing monthly after the date such facility is not renewed. \b \bAs security for the credit facilities, Deepwell LP granted the lenders a security interest over all of its assets. In addition, each of the Trust, Deepwell Energy Services Commercial Trust and the Deepwell Energy Services Ltd. guaranteed the indebtedness of Deepwell LP under the credit facilities, with such guarantee being secured by all of the assets of each such guarantor. In respect of any proceeds resulting from enforcement of the Credit Facilities or the above-mentioned guarantees, the lenders, as creditors, will have a prior-ranking claim relative to the Unitholders. \b \bThe credit facility is subject to customary terms and conditions for borrowings of this nature, including limits on incurring additional indebtedness, granting liens or selling assets without the consent of the lender and maintenance of certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. \b \bInterest rate risk \b \bThe operating loan and the extendible revolving term loan bear interest at a floating interest rate. Therefore, the extent that the Trust borrows under these facilities, the Trust is as risk to rising interest rates. \b \b \b    << \b    Contractual obligations \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones
