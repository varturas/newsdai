Prior to the announcement they were bid at 99.25% of face value and they were trading above par at the beginning of the year. \u001d  The company has a 30-day grace period on the interest payment before the  bondholders can call an event of default. Teksid also said it had support from its senior and second lien lenders to waive certain covenants under its senior credit facility and second lien credit facility. \u001d  The company has been negotiating with its bondholders on a price at which to tender for the bonds after agreeing to sell its operations in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, China and Poland to Mexican automotive supplier Tenedora Nemak SA de CV, a unit of Mexican conglomerate ALFA. \u001d  Teksid, which produces aluminum engine cases, offered to buy back the senior notes due 2011 at 95% of face value, but terminated the tender offer for the bonds in December after very few of the bonds were tendered for. \u001d  The bondholders, which had initially been expecting to have the opportunity to exercise the change-of-control put on the bonds at 101% of face value if the Tenedora Nemak transaction goes through, have been holding out for a sweetened tender offer from the company. Teksid said it now expects to re-launch the tender offer, but it said the amount available for any potential bond repurchase will represent a significant discount from par. \u001d  The closing of the sale to Tenedora Nemak is subject to bondholders providing consent and waivers, and a majority of the notes being tendered, people familiar with the situation said. \u001d  While some bondholders were surprised by the non-payment of the interest on the senior notes, analysts said the company's high rate of cash expenditure was a reason it could be struggling with the interest payment. \u001d  There is a view among bondholders, however, that the company is trying to play hardball with investors in order to negotiate a cheaper tender price for the bonds. \u001d  \"The company has essentially put a gun to the bondholders' head. But it's not clear to me why the bondholders would accept an even lower tender price for the bonds. The company would have to prove that an awful lot has changed and that there is no value left in the equity,\" said one bondholder, who didn't wish to be named. \"If there is no equity value left then the bonds will be impaired and in a default scenario the bondholders will get the company.\" \b \u001d  -By Kate Haywood, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0) 7842 9315; kate.haywood@dowjones.com \u001d  (Anousha Sakoui contributed to this article). \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 11:21 ET (16:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"00ea9c0768460250adf0dabbf49f50d2","symR":["AZA.MI","IT0003918577"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Alitalia Says Bd Member Gabriele Checchia Has Resigned -2","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T13:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AZA.MI","IT0003918577"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XMIB"],"Story":"\u001d  Checchia also noted the incompatibility of his two roles at what is a critical time for Alitalia, the statement said. \u001d  Italy's government put the struggling airline up for sale in early January and will accept expressions of interest from potential bidders until January 29. \u001d  Checchia began his tenure at Alitalia in 2004. \u001d  Alitalia's board of directors is due to meet on Friday following a request by the country's market watchdog Consob to discuss the company's financial situation and the possible sale of non-strategic assets.

The agreement, which also involves other related parties, is subject to court approval in Canada under CCPL's Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act proceedings. \b \b\"This agreement significantly advances the interests of the Fund's unitholders,\" said Robert Hodgins, Chairman of the Board of Trustees. \"By removing a potential source of uncertainty and simplifying the Fund's ownership structure, this agreement, if approved by the Court, will enable us to more effectively develop potential alternative transactions that may offer unitholders superior value to Harbinger Capital Partners' unsolicited offer.\" \b \bAs of Friday's market close, the Fund's units are trading at a 5.1% premium to Harbinger's offer to acquire all of the outstanding units of the Fund it does not currently own for $12.25 per unit. The Board of Trustees continues to unanimously recommend that unitholders reject Harbinger's offer and not tender their units. \b \bToday's settlement agreement allows the Fund to terminate CCPL, an indirect subsidiary of Calpine Corp., of San Jose, CA., as the Fund's manager and administrator. This right will provide the Board with improved access to information and control over the management of the Fund's assets. There will be a transition period, after which the Fund will directly employ the personnel required to manage the Fund. \b \bA second element of the agreement allows the Fund to acquire CCPL's 30% subordinated ownership interest (also known as the \"B\" units) in Calpine Power, L.P., a limited partnership in which the Fund has a 70% priority ownership interest. In conjunction with the transaction, the Fund and CCPL have agreed on a formula by which they will split certain claims being made by Calpine Power, L.P., including claims against the estates of Calpine Corporation and Calpine Energy Services Canada Partnership, an affiliate of CCPL. Calpine Power, L.P. owns the 300-megawatt Calgary Energy Centre in Alberta and the 240-megawatt Island Cogeneration Facility in British Columbia. \b \bA third element of the agreement eliminates a potential impairment of a loan owed to Calpine Power, L.P. by Calpine Canada Whitby Holdings Company, which has an ownership interest in the 50-megawatt Whitby Cogeneration Facility in Ontario. The Fund in 2005 accrued an allowance of $16 million to reflect the potential impairment. \b \bA fourth element of the agreement is the reduction of the previously-disclosed Manager's Loan from $39.3 million to $21.3 million. The Manager's Loan, which CCPL owes to the Fund, remains in default but is secured and the Trustees are confident that as a result of the Settlement Agreement and the anticipated receipt of monies from claims referred to above, the remaining amount will be repaid in full. \b \bFurther terms of the settlement agreement will not be disclosed pending court approval except to constituents in the CCAA proceeding who sign confidentiality agreements that protect confidential information of Calpine Power, L.P., the Fund and the Manager.

Using a single performance management system ensures bottom-up planning across the enterprise to support business strategies for growth, margins, market share and customer satisfaction. \b \b\"Success in retail depends on the chain's ability to balance supply and demand to meet customer needs while protecting margins. Chains that have an integrated process and give merchandise planners a single tool to complete top-down and bottom-up planning have a significantly higher chance of success,\" said Brian Hume, president of Martec International, a leading consulting and training firm that specializes in merchandise management, supply chain management and store operations business processes. \"Building a solid, integrated merchandise planning process that links merchandisers with marketing, operations and finance ensures that the chain is managing to common financial goals and business objectives. This helps pave the way for higher sales, improved inventory turnover, fewer markdowns, and by extension, higher profits.\" \b \bAnchored on Cognos 8 Planning and Cognos 8 BI and based on retail industry best practices, the Cognos Strategic Merchandise Planning Blueprint delivers an intuitive planning and reporting environment where retailers can capitalize on: \b \b<< \b \b *Top-down target-setting capabilities to forecast annual sales and gross \b \b  profit for divisions or channels \b \b *Calendaring adjustments to accommodate year-over-year changes in \b \b  holidays to smooth demand patterns \b \b *The ability to spread top-down targets across departments or categories \b \b  based on historical data \b \b *Department or category-level planning for key financial indicators, \b \b  including sales, returns, markdowns, promotions, shrink, cost of goods, \b \b  gross margin, supply chain costs and gross profit \b \b *Pre-season stock planning to manage the value of inventory at the \b \b  department or category level \b \b *Exception-based planning to adjust line items \b \b *Break-back capabilities to pro-rate costs to meet profitability \b \b  requirements that support sales and margin targets \b \b *Seamless visibility into plans from other parts of the organization, \b \b  eliminating possible discrepancies and organizational silos \b \b *Embedded, integrated workflow, complete with visual scorecard and \b \b  alerting capabilities, that enables managers to easily determine latest \b \b  plan status, drive collaboration to plan completion, and uphold \b \b  accountability \b \b *Calculated metrics summarization and links to scorecards and reports \b \b  that help accurately measure and compare planned versus actual \b \b  performance of merchandise by department, category and/or channel \b \b>> \b \b\"The analytical, modeling, workflow and planning capabilities found in Cognos have made a difference in the way we operate and make decisions. Greater visibility into merchandise sales and profitability enabled us to better manage our Fall 2007 Season for our merchandising, sourcing, sales and retail operations,\" said Craig Valero, director of financial operations at Columbia Sportswear, one of the world's largest outerwear brands and the leading seller of skiwear in the United States. \b \bAvailable immediately to customers, the Cognos Strategic Promotions Planning Blueprint is the fourth retail solution launched by Cognos in the past year, joining the Cognos Store Operations (P&L) Planning Blueprint, which helps retail chains build top-down and bottom-up budgets and performance reports for comprehensive profit and loss management; the Cognos Store Development Blueprint, which helps retailers more effectively plan capital- intensive projects like new store construction, remodels and upgrades; and the Cognos Strategic Promotions Planning Blueprint, which is designed to help chains optimize the effectiveness and return for both retailer- and vendor- funded promotional activities. Together, these retail solutions integrate all operational silos - including operations, marketing, merchandising and finance - to ensure all parts of the organization are planning to a single set of financial goals and business objectives. \b \b\"The need for integrated strategic merchandise planning is becoming increasingly important. Retailers have traditionally experienced difficulty in planning, managing and evaluating merchandise performance for a variety of reasons - limited modeling and forecasting abilities; functional and information silos; and poor plan synchronization between top-down and bottom- up processes,\" said Patricia Vekich Waldron, retail industry director at Cognos. \"Our new Blueprint delivers the kind of enhanced visibility retailers need to accurately and swiftly respond to inevitable fluctuations in merchandise supply and demand that can have a profound impact on cash flow and profitability as well as other operational areas like marketing and store operations.\" \b \bCognos is a recognized leader in delivering business intelligence and performance management solutions for the retail industry.

(TSX:ISA) announced today that its partner, Lux Biosciences, has been granted orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ISA247, referred to as LX211 by Lux, for the treatment of non-infectious posterior, intermediate and panuveitis. \b \u001d  Orphan drug designation is a special status for diseases or conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, granted by the FDA upon request by a sponsor. Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor for exclusive marketing rights in the United States for seven years if the Company is first to receive marketing approval. The designation also positions Lux Biosciences to benefit from certain tax credits and waives the company's obligation to pay FDA application user fees for these products as required by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). \b \u001d  \"We are pleased to receive Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for LX211 (ISA247), a late-stage product in our pipeline,\" said Ulrich Grau, President and CEO of Lux Biosciences. \"LX211 has the potential of establishing new treatment paradigms in these an indication of high medical need.

There is substantial evidence implicating T-lymphocytes, key cells involved in inflammatory processes, in the development of the disease. Uveitis is an under-diagnosed and under-recognized medical condition that causes vision impairment, ocular pain, and loss of vision. Experts estimate that 10% of new U.S. cases of blindness result from this disease. Approximately 300,000 people suffer from uveitis in the United States alone, the majority of whom are affected by anterior uveitis. The only therapeutic class approved by the FDA for treatment of uveitis is corticosteroids, which are burdened with multiple side effects, such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and in the eye, cataract formation and glaucoma. \b \b    About Isotechnika Inc. \b \b    ---------------------- \b \u001d  Isotechnika Inc. is an international biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

The acquisition is to be financed through a share issue of a maximum of 6,071,427 shares in Carnegie, corresponding to a transaction value of SEK 856 million based on the share price as of 10 January 2007. The full year-end report for Carnegie 2006 will be presented 1 February. \b \u001d  Carnegie's preliminary net profit for 2006 was SEK 999 million (SEK 667 million), an increase of 50%. The net profit generated in the fourth quarter was SEK 279 million (SEK 267 million). Earnings per share for 2006 were SEK 14.46 (SEK 9.98), fully diluted SEK 14.34 (SEK 9.80). Dividend proposal - Carnegie's Board of Directors will propose a dividend of SEK SEK 10.50 per share, corresponding to a total dividend amount of SEK 815 million, based on the total number of shares outstanding of 77,573,027, including new shares issued to Max Matthiessen's shareholders and assuming full utilisation of Carnegie's warrant programme. \b \u001d  Total income for 2006 increased by 27% to SEK 4,475 million (SEK 3,514 million). Income in the fourth quarter was SEK 1,219 million (SEK 1,213 million). \b \u001d  Total expenses before profit-share for 2006 were SEK 1,659 million (SEK 1,674 million), a decrease of 1% from last year. \b \u001d  Capital structure - Carnegie's current business volume, including the proposed acquisition of Max Matthiessen, is estimated to require a risk capital corresponding to a regulatory capital base of approx. SEK 1.9 billion. The acquisition of Max Matthiessen will slightly decrease the capital adequacy ratio in the coming years. Assuming the proposed dividend of SEK 815 million, retained earnings for 2006 would be around SEK 185 million1.

(the \"Company\" or \"Cross Lake\") (TSX:CRN) is pleased to provide this update of operations for the QR Mine Project, which is located approximately 60 kilometers southeast of Quesnel, British Columbia. \b \bOver the past several months, the final information was compiled and submitted to the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources in support of the application by the Company to restart operations at the QR Mine. By way of a letter dated December 20, 2006, the Company received the formal approval of the amended permit approving the mine re-opening. \"The receipt of this permit is the last major hurdle the Company had to overcome to allow for a smooth transition to operations of the QR Mine,\" stated Gordon Keevil, President. \b \bWhile the permit application was being completed, Cross Lake and its development team have been busy completing the preparatory work in anticipation of the commencement of operations. This has included: \b \b- The acquisition and installation of the 42 man camp on the mine site, including the necessary infrastructure and support and a new dry in support of mining operations. \b \b- Work has commenced on the rehabilitation of the electrical distribution system in support of Mill operations and general overall site operations. \b \b- Final detailed engineering studies of the tailings containment system have also been completed but final construction must now wait until early spring due to weather constraints. \b \b- Rehabilitation and addition to the onsite electric generator capacity to allow for mill upgrade and testing prior to the availability of Hydro through the power line. \b \bIn June, the necessary security was put in place to allow for the construction of the three phase power line by BC Hydro from the Gavin Lake sub-station. The power line will be completed and power available for the commencement of operations. The project will have a significantly lower cost of electricity connected to the B.C Hydro grid, compared to its previous operation when the required power was generated on site by diesel generators. This saving is even more dramatic given the high price of diesel fuel. \b \bAs part of the final preparation for operations, Cross Lake's engineers are continuing to evaluate all aspects of the proposed operations to achieve greater efficiency and cash flow. Surface preparations are underway on the West Zone and Northwest Zone for mining. The Midwest Zone has been dewatered and is being prepared for underground mining. These three zones will be the source of the initial development as outlined in the Technical Report prepared on behalf of Cross Lake by Wardrop Engineering Inc. of Vancouver. \b \bWhile work continues towards the commencement of mining operations in the West, Northwest and Midwest Zones, underground development of the North Zone has also commenced. The access road was completed in 2006 at a design grade that can be used as a haul road to the mill. The portal has been collared and initial development of the North Zone decline has now commenced. \b \bThe North Zone is a faulted extension of the Main Zone, which was mined by open pit methods during previous mining operations. Company geologists and consultants have studied the detailed technical information from the exploration and subsequent mining of the Main Zone. These studies have confirmed that the Main Zone, which has a strike length of only 300 meters and produced over 100,000 ounces of gold, is an extension of and is similar in character to the North Zone. Furthermore, a detailed geo-statistical analysis of the gold distribution and grade of the Main Zone has confirmed that approximately 300,000 tonnes within the Main Zone formed a contiguous block with an indicated grade of over 5 grams. This grade could be economically mined by underground mining methods, assuming the parameters of the Technical Report on the proposed operations of the QR Mine (News Release dated May 20, 2006). It is important to note that the North Zone is the only Zone on the QR Property that is not known to be limited by faulting. To date, it has been defined along a strike length in excess of 1000 meters and remains open. Therefore, based on historic production records from the Main Zone, there is the potential to identify a significant additional gold resource to that which will be developed by the planned mining operations. If successful, this mineralization could add several years to mine operations. \b \bOver the past several months, in spite of current tight employment market conditions, Cross Lake has been successful in securing the services of most of the key employees and contractors that are necessary for successful operations. The Company would like to thank Mr. Ross Hollinger, P. Eng. who was appointed Mine Manager and since that time has worked to move the QR Project forward and secure the support needed for a successful operation. The QR Project is being supervised by Mr. Hollinger who is the designated Qualified Person and Mine Manager. The Company is very pleased with the development of Cross Lake's QR Project to date and is looking forward to an orderly and efficient transition from an exploration to a production company. \b \bThis release includes certain statements that may be deemed to be \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: SLNK), the leader in workplace wireless telephony, has extended its Wi-Fi telephony capabilities to third-party mobile devices by introducing the NetLink Softphone (NetLink SP) application.  The NetLink SP application allows voice-enabled mobile devices to function as full-featured business telephones integrated with an enterprise telephone system.  NetLink SP operates as a thin client, offering optimized performance both over the wireless LAN and on the handheld device. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20050324/LATH060LOGO ) \b \u001d  NetLink SP is a simple, easy-to-use mobile application that runs on Microsoft Windows Mobile 5.0 and PocketPC operating systems.  It works in conjunction with SpectraLink's NetLink Telephony Gateway using SpectraLink Radio Protocol (SRP), a lightweight protocol developed specifically to provide optimal performance and voice quality over converged wireless networks.  The NetLink Telephony Gateway's unique digital interface technology makes it possible to extend the advanced features and functions of a company's telephone switch, such as call transfer, conferencing and voicemail integration, to the end-user device.  The NetLink SP softphone also supports text messaging through SpectraLink's Open Application Interface (OAI), integrating with applications such as customer service call boxes and inventory management systems. \b \u001d  \"An increasing range of enterprise-grade devices support voice over Wi-Fi, as well as third-party software applications.  However, integrating these products with companies' existing telecoms infrastructure is not a trivial task -- it requires specialist VoWLAN handset skills to manage QoS, and a deep understanding of corporate voice platforms to enable a good user experience,\" said Dean Bubley of Disruptive Analysis.  \"SpectraLink has considerable expertise in both these areas, and so its soft client strategy fits well with recent trends in handheld technology.\" \b \u001d  \"We are continuing to deliver on the promise of enterprise wireless telephony with the NetLink SP application,\" said John Elms, SpectraLink president and CEO.  \"We're giving customers more choice in the devices they deploy to make their mobile employees more responsive and productive while leveraging their telephone and Wi-Fi network investments.\" \b \u001d  The NetLink SP application is initially targeted at retail enterprises with support for Symbol Technologies' MC50 and MC70 devices, although additional devices are expected to be supported with future releases.  The NetLink Telephony Gateway provides analog and digital telephone station integration with most traditional circuit-switched enterprise PBX systems, and supports both NetLink Wireless Telephones and third-party devices utilizing the NetLink SP application. \b \b    Availability & Pricing \b \u001d  The NetLink SP application is available in the first quarter of 2007 with pricing based on an enterprise-wide licensing agreement. \b \b    About SpectraLink \b \u001d  SpectraLink, the leader in workplace wireless telephony, delivers the power of mobile voice and messaging applications to businesses worldwide. Seamlessly integrating with VoIP and traditional telephony platforms, SpectraLink's scalable technology provides instant access to people and business-critical information.  SpectraLink handsets free on-premises employees to be more accessible, productive and responsive.  For more information, visit www.spectralink.com or call 1 800 676 5465. \b \u001d  This release may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including new product offerings may be delayed and/or may not generate increased future sales; difficulties integrating new software product offerings with other third party devices which may affect performance which SpectraLink cannot control; new mergers or acquisitions may not result in increased future sales of SpectraLink's products and services; adverse changes in economic and business conditions affecting SpectraLink's customers; the intensely competitive nature of the wireless communications industry, and a customer preference to buy all telephone communications systems from a single source provider that manufactures and sells PBX or key/hybrid systems; changes in rules and regulations of the FCC; and the anticipated growth of the market for on-premises Wireless Telephone Systems.

Eurotunnel's essentially retail shareholder base is notoriously dispersed. Only 45% of shareholders cast their votes at the meeting in June 2005, when Gounon won his battle for control of the company. \u001d  In addition, legal challenges from aggrieved creditors may well continue, in the U.K. and in France, where they can take their case to higher courts. But none can now suspend the rescue program. \u001d  With Eurotunnel set to publish 2005 and 2006 accounts and name the date for a shareholder meeting, there is momentum to create the new Groupe Eurotunnel. Gounon has promised a strong set of 2006 numbers, which should bolster confidence that a debt-lightened Eurotunnel can pay its own way. \u001d  The successful creation of a new company would be testament to Gounon's hardheadedness in forcing shareholders, notorious for having irrational expectations of how the company might be saved, and around 10 different classes of creditors to agree on a commercially-sound rescue. They may have stitched together the most painful but the most finite of Eurotunnel's three major restructurings. \u001d  The Eurotunnel example also represents what some consider an aggressive application of France's new bankruptcy regime, where different creditors with different recoveries were lumped together in the same voting group rather than being organized into separate schemes. \u001d  In a major test of France's refined bankruptcy law, some lenders will worry this sets a dangerous precedent. \u001d  And the Eurotunnel story remains a reminder to investors of the perils of investing in infrastructure companies with apparently fail-safe returns. \b \u001d  (Matthew Curtin has been a financial news reporter since 1990, and has reported on international finance and business for Dow Jones Newswires - from South Africa, Singapore and now Paris - since 1994.

The company said its overall reserves would last 14.5 years at current output levels. \u001d  The reduction in overall reserves came mainly due to a 26% plunge in overseas oil and gas reserves to 885 million BOE at the end of 2006, from 1.197 billion BOE a year earlier. \u001d  The massive reduction came mostly as Petrobras had to cede part of its production in Venezuela to state-oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela (PVZ.YY) in an early 2006 revision of production contracts with the Venezuelan government. \u001d  International reserves will increase in the future once new reserves in Nigeria and Bolivia enter more advanced stages of development, Petrobras said. \u001d  According to the less strict criteria of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, or SPE, Petrobras' 2006 Brazilian reserves actually rose by 3.9% to 13.753 billion BOE at the end of 2006, from 13.232 billion BOE a year earlier. \u001d  The SPE also accepts as reserves areas in earlier stages of development. \u001d  The increase came as the company incorporated new discoveries into its reserves, among them the Maromba field in the Campos Basin and the Catua field in the Espirito Santo Basin. \u001d  Petrobras also incorporated discoveries into nearby producing fields, among them the Mexilhao gas field in the Santos Basin. \u001d  According to the SPE criteria, Petrobras' overseas reserves fell 24% to 1.27 billion BOE at the end of 2006 from a year earlier. \u001d  The firm's combined domestic and overseas reserves according to SPE criteria rose to 15.023 billion BOE at the end of 2006, from 14.913 billion BOE at the end of 2005. \b \u001d  -By Bernd Radowitz, Dow Jones Newswires; +5521-3288-5004; bernd.radowitz@dowjones.com; \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 08:37 ET (13:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0a52ac81249d410be7ecb9ffa61f2f63","symR":["1004086.FR","5219.FR","CCE.YY","COL.MC","MVC.MC","ES0153440419","ES0154220414","FR0000052193","FR0010040865"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Banque Populaire Steps Into French Real-Estate","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T11:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1004086.FR","5219.FR","CCE.YY","COL.MC","MVC.MC","ES0153440419","ES0154220414","FR0000052193","FR0010040865"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","REA","RED","REI","XDJGI","XIBEX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Digby Larner \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--Mutual bank Groupe Banque Populaire Monday said it has agreed to buy a 61% stake in real-estate business Foncia Groupe (5219.FR) for around EUR800 million, marking its first foray into the real-estate market and giving it the chance to offer retail bank services to Foncia's one million clients. \u001d  Apart from financing real-estate lending, Banque Populaire will also offer Foncia clients consumer loans and insurance. \u001d  Banque Populaire Chairman Philippe Dupont said in an interview published by Le Figaro Monday that the move is part of the bank's plan to expand into markets with high growth potential. \u001d  \"The real-estate financing market represents EUR8 billion while property services are worth EUR7 billion,\" he said. He added that over 85% of Foncia's revenue is recurrent and not sensitive to cyclical market trends. The company reported EUR360 million in revenue for 2005. \u001d  He said the acquisition should generate revenue synergies in future but didn't say how much they would be. \u001d  Foncia earns 92% of its revenue from the French market while the remaining 8% comes from Switzerland, Germany and Belgium. Banque Populaire said it will help the company expand its foreign activities. \u001d  Banque Populaire is paying Foncia founder Jacky Lorenzetti EUR40 per-share for the 61% stake. This represents an 11% premium Foncia's Jan. 12 share price, Banque Populaire said. \u001d  The bank expects to acquires the stake in March and, under French stock market rules, it must then offer to buy minority interests on the same terms as the original offer. Dupont told Le Figaro that Foncia won't have to be delisted as part of the deal but said he didn't rule out this option. \u001d  Lorenzetti will continue to manage the business and will retain a Foncia stake of around 7%. \u001d  In November, Banque Populaire and fellow French mutual bank Groupe Caisse d'Epargne launched Natixis - a listed joint-venture corporate and investment bank. Each partner owns a 34% stake in the business which combined most assets from the two banks apart from their retail networks. \u001d  Caisse d'Epargne itself has a number of real-estate interests but Dupont said its Foncia acquisition won't damage its partner's market share. \"We don't have the same sort of (retail bank) clients as Caisse d'Epargne,\" Dupont told Le Figaro. \u001d  French real-estate businesses have become attractive acquisition targets in recent years following a 2003 law change giving publicly quoted property investment companies a favorable tax treatment. \u001d  Spanish companies have been particularly active in the French market. In 2004, Spain's Immobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) bought Societe Fonciere Lyonnaise. Fellow Spanish real-estate company Metrovacesa SA (MVC.MC) recently took control of France's Gecina (1004086.FR) in a deal valued at more than EUR5 billion. \u001d  At 10.59 GMT, Foncia shares were unchanged at EUR36.

The number outstripped an average expectation of $698.4 million expected by seven analysts surveyed by the company. \u001d  FTSE 100-listed Vedanta produces a range of metals, with key products including aluminum, copper, zinc and lead. Its main operations are in India. \u001d  The production and earnings update got a mixed reception from analysts. \u001d  One analyst, who asked to remain nameless, said the results looked \"pretty solid to us,\" adding that the numbers were \"pretty much in line with our expectations.\" \u001d  Vedanta's shares \"should trade pretty positively\" Monday, the analyst added.    At 1047 GMT Vedanta's shares were trading up 2.2% or 25 pence at 1135 pence, outperforming a mixed mining sector. \u001d  But another analyst, while saying the company had posted a \"reasonably good\" set of numbers, with a strong performance from its Indian assets, highlighted the problems in Zambia. \u001d  Costs at Konkola Copper Mines - Vedanta's Zambian business - are \"astronomically high,\" the analyst said, calculating that they are running at $1.71 per pound of copper. \"I think you need to see a bit of progress there to get radically positive on the stock.\"   The second analyst pointed to the stock of copper miner Kazakhmys PLC (KAZ.LN) as providing better exposure to base metals - pointing out that it is cheaper on the basis of price to earnings ratio. \u001d  In terms of production, the biggest increase on the same quarter last year came for the company's aluminum division, which produced 98,000 metric tons, up from 60,000 tons in the third quarter of last year. The first analyst said this performance offset the disappointing showing in Zambia. \u001d  Copper cathode production in Zambia was 35,000 tons, down from 46,000 tons in the third quarter of the previous year. A mine effluent spillage late last year caused the company's copper leach plant to be closed and 50,000 residents in a local town to be left without water. The company said the environmental issues had been resolved and \"steady and cautious steps are now being taken to bring the leaching plant back to its normal levels of production,\" Vedanta said in its press release. \u001d  Vedanta's revenues rose to $1.76 billion, up from $974.7 million in the previous year period. The company attributed the gain to higher volumes and prices. \u001d  Lehman Brothers said Vedanta's third-quarter numbers were disappointing, and cut its target price for the shares to GBP14 from GBP15. Lehman rates Vedanta equal weight. \u001d  The volumes of commodities produced by Vedanta were in line with Lehman's expectations, but revenue and EBITDA came in lower. \"We view these results as somewhat disappointing. We believe Vedanta shares trade at an attractive valuation, but we would wait for pullbacks to be a buyer,\" Lehman said. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.vedantaresources.com \b \u001d  -By Jackie Range, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 9257; jackie.range@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 05:58 ET (10:58 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0e2bec65fede09a58f03cc4d7ddb57a7","symR":["BAD.UN.T","CA05651Q1037"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Badger Income Fund January Cash Distribution>BAD.UN.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T15:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BAD.UN.T","CA05651Q1037"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE"],"Story":"\u001d  CALGARY, Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - Badger Income Fund (\"Badger\") today announced that the trustees of Badger declared a cash distribution for the month of January of $0.105 per fund unit, representing $1.26 per fund unit on an annualized basis.

But a handful of big growth companies are discovering that to really improve profit growth, downshifting a little may be smarter than putting the pedal to the metal. \u001d  Thanks to the rapid growth at many firms in the 1990s, it's been difficult for many CEOs to fathom a future without hyperexpansion. Some, such as Time Warner, tried to keep it going through mega-mergers, while others, like Home Depot, saturated existing markets with new stores. But those efforts often backfired, lowering return on capital and, of course, weighing on share prices. \"A lot of the time, companies were so preoccupied with chasing the next big growth opportunity, they weren't good stewards of capital,\" says Todd Lowenstein, manager of the HighMark Value Momentum fund. \"But a few are beginning to get religion.\" In other words, they are realizing that it's time to generate better returns with what they have. \u001d  For some companies, of course, that means cutting costs or using excess cash to increase dividends or buy back shares. But growing old gracefully also includes dumping unprofitable businesses and focusing more on innovation than acquisition. Ultimately, investors should look for firms that are focused on maximizing shareholder return, says Susan Byrne, manager of the Westwood Equity AAA fund. \"Investors should look for companies generating a lot of free cash flow,\" Byrne says. \"Those are the stocks we want.\" \u001d  IBM is one example, Byrne says. Big Blue has successfully reinvented itself, leaving behind its hardware roots and making strides in the more profitable software and burgeoning services businesses. It has produced strong earnings surprises in the past two quarters and doubled its free cash flow-the amount of cash left over after paying all the bills and reinvesting in the business. It has also boosted its dividend an average 15 percent annually over the past five years. \"It's a highly profitable, quality company selling at a discount to the market,\" Byrne says. \"That doesn't happen often. People haven't realized how much  their business model has changed.\" Byrne thinks the stock can hit $150 in three years. \u001d  After years of acquisitions and expanding market share, Waste Management concluded that it won't do much good to keep getting bigger, says Friedman Billings Ramsey environmental services analyst Brian Butler. So the company is now focusing on its bottom line, in large part by raising rates. \"It's a sign of maturity,\" says  Butler. The country's largest garbage hauler is now tapping more of its expanding free cash flow to buy back stock and raise its dividend instead of servicing acquisition-related debt. Butler expects the stock to rise at least another 11 percent, to $42, as investors recognize the company's new strategy is not short-lived. \u001d  McDonald's is also betting on becoming better rather than bigger, boosting return on invested capital rather than crowding the world with too many golden arches. A couple of years ago, a quarter of the chain's new stores were placed within a mile of one another, leading to cannibalization, says UBS restaurants analyst David Palmer. Now McDonald's is trying to make its existing stores more profitable by attracting more per-store customers. (It's improved its breakfast offerings, for example.) The company is also selling stores in troubled markets, such as Brazil, and taking on the role of franchisor more frequently than operator, which frees up cash and creates a more stable income stream, says Palmer, who thinks the stock can rise to $47. \u001d  --- \u001d  SmartMoney.com: Find more mature growth companies at www.smartmoney.com. \u001d  --- \b                           GROWING OLD GRACEFULLY \b \b                                     Mkt.

While long considered Britain's best businessman for crafting a global oil giant from a former state monopoly, the chief executive of the oil giant became a dead duck after losing a series of power struggles with Chairman Peter Sutherland. His legacy was also tarnished by a series of mishaps. He will step down officially in July. \u001d  Lord Browne's days were numbered when the board failed to agree to his wish to stay on past the company's normal retirement age. He then tried to take control of the appointment process for his successor. When that failed, he faced a scenario in which he would have been reduced to impotence. The final blow came from Tony Hayward, now appointed to succeed him. The head of exploration and production launched what some perceived as a thinly-veiled attack on his boss's management style on BP's intranet just before Christmas. \u001d  Lord Browne may not have been as effective at boardroom politics as the pugnacious Mr. Sutherland. But that disadvantage might not have mattered if BP hadn't simultaneously suffered a series of serious operational problems in the U.S.: the Texas City refinery blast, corrosion on its Alaskan pipeline and alleged abuses in propane trading. \u001d  These didn't just cause bad publicity. They raised questions over whether BP was actually well-managed -- and, in particular, whether Amoco and Arco, Lord Browne's two big acquisitions, had been properly integrated. BP's shares, once a gusher, started to underperform. \u001d  Mr. Hayward takes over at a difficult time. He must restore confidence among investors that the colossus Lord Browne created can be run effectively. He also has to do this against a background of falling oil prices. The good news is that, with Lord Browne going in six months, there's no question about who's in charge. \b \u001d  EMI \b \u001d  It looks as though EMI Group has effectively run up the white flag. The British record company has warned on profits, sacked its two top music men and hinted at a balance-sheet restructuring. With negative free cash flow in four of the past five years, a dividend cut is also possible. Having narrowly fended off two takeover approaches last year, this no longer looks like a firm with much of an independent future, or much longterm shareholder support either. \u001d  That may sound harsh. But in many ways, the company's fate mirrors that of ITV, the U.K. broadcaster. Both have struggled to cope with the digital age. Both, too, were led by bosses known for their cost-cutting skills but not their media savvy. ITV's Charles Allen came from a catering firm, and eventually got the boot. The only reason ITV retained its independence is that it got in a heavy-hitting new boss to replace him. EMI, by contrast, is going the other way. Out goes its respected recorded-music boss Alain Levy. Down comes EMI Chairman Eric Nicoli instead, a former biscuit-company boss, with a stronger focus on marketing music than finding new hits. \u001d  So it seems that EMI may be getting ready to disappear, at least in its current form. Still, it has to go through the motions of independence. Hence its announced restructuring plan. Taxed and capitalized, the GBP 110 million, or $215.5 million, of annual savings it has targeted are worth almost 100 pence a share. But investors clearly take these plans with a pinch of salt; they marked down EMI stock by 20 pence following the announcement. The only reason the shares didn't fall further is because of hopes EMI will eventually be sold. \u001d  A tie-up with Warner Music still makes industrial and financial sense, regulatory approval allowing. Alternatively, private equity might make a repeat approach, buying EMI's stable publishing division and selling on its more volatile recorded-music business. There is little to suggest that Mr. Nicoli would be averse to this idea, at the right price. Indeed, the suggestion that EMI's debts might be re-apportioned between its two divisions can even be seen as a prelude to a break-up. \b \u001d  Endesa \b \u001d  Amidst all the noise surrounding the Endesa bid battle, Caja Madrid has kept unusually quiet. The Spanish regional savings bank, which owns 10% of the power company, hasn't said whether it plans to sell its stake to E.On or Gas Natural, or to side with Acciona, the Spanish construction company that has amassed a 21% stake in Endesa. But thanks to Endesa's quirky bylaws, Caja Madrid could ultimately decide who wins or loses. \u001d  The bylaws stipulate that no shareholder can vote more than 10% of the shares outstanding, which means Caja Madrid has as much power as Acciona. E.On's 36 billion euro ($46.5 billion) offer is conditional on removing the voting cap. That requires approval from 50% of the shares eligible to vote. \u001d  It won't be easy for E.On to prevail, as Acciona will probably vote against E.On's current offer and some shareholders won't show up at all. If Caja Madrid votes against a change, then 77% of the free float would need to show up at a meeting to push through the change, which is all but impossible. But if Caja Madrid votes in favor, then the odds improve to 67% of the votes -- hard, but conceivable. \u001d  Of course, E.On could waive the condition and plow ahead with its offer anyway, hoping to change the bylaws after the fact. But that would be risky. \u001d  Which way will Caja Madrid turn? Ultimately, it is a political animal, accountable to local politicians in Madrid. Caja Madrid's chairman, Miguel Blesa, is associated with the opposition party, the Partido Popular. The PP hasn't been as vocal against the German bid as the ruling Socialist party. But the Socialists, as well as other left-leaning parties, are also represented on Caja Madrid's board. \u001d  There is one way E.On could make the decision easier for Caja Madrid: Pay through the nose. Endesa's shares are trading more than 2 euros above E.on's already generous 34.50 euro-a-share offer. It may have to get closer to 40 euros to get the savings bank to speak up in E.On's favor. \u001d  --- \u001d  Hugo Dixon and Simon Nixon; John Paul Rathbone; Fiona Maharg-Bravo \u001d  --- \u001d  For more commentary, go to www.breakingviews.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 00:30 ET (05:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0f6545a57549cbeecf1bcc23df34e44b","symR":["C","US1729671016"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UK PRESS: Citigroup, CDC Create Dedicated Africa Fund","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T06:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["C","US1729671016"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Citigroup Inc.

The sheer scale of new airplane programs and the desire of top-level players like Boeing Co. (BA) and Airbus to have smaller supplier bases as they drive down prices and spread costs is likely to spur this trend on, say sector watchers. \u001d  Smiths Group Chief Executive Keith Butler-Wheelhouse said the evolving shape of the aerospace business is driving the need for consolidation. \"The structure of the aerospace industry is changing - in particular its increased capital requirements and the growing importance of supplier scale, especially as the next generation of large programs kicks in,\" he said. \u001d  A banker who worked on the Smiths/GE deal and asked for anonymity said more consolidation is likely in Europe but declined to name bid targets. The massive development costs of new airplane programs and the huge amounts of capital required are key drivers, he said. \u001d  In recent years, the earnings of Smiths' aerospace unit have been hit by both the weaker dollar and rising development costs on the new plane programs it's involved with. The key ones are Airbus' delayed double-decker A380 plane, Boeing's fuel-efficient 787 and the Boeing 767 midair refueling tanker program. \u001d  To help cut their costs of developing new airplanes the likes of Boeing now typically look to involve suppliers as partners that invest in an aircraft's development in return for a future share of revenues. They increasingly prefer to deal with fewer and larger suppliers that oversee the procurement of smaller components. \u001d  For the new 787, which is due to enter into service in 2008, Boeing expects to have some 100 to 200 top-tier suppliers compared with as many as 800 to 1,000 on past programs, according to Mike Bair, chief of the 787 project. Overall, the U.S. aerospace giant has gone from over 30,000 suppliers six years ago to just over 6,000 today, according to a spokesman. \u001d   Airbus, which is owned by European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. (5730.FR), is also making a similar drive to cut the number of suppliers as it battles the impact of a weaker dollar. Similar trends are also evident on programs to develop new military planes. \u001d  Speaking in Paris Monday, Denis Ranque, chief executive of French defense and aerospace electronics giant Thales SA (12132.FR), said the Smiths deal is a signal that the cycle of consolidation isn't over yet. He noted the desires of Boeing and Airbus to deal with fewer suppliers. \b \u001d              Number Of UK Suppliers Seen In Play \b \u001d   Other aerospace suppliers such as Cobham PLC (COB.LN), Meggitt PLC (MGGT.LN), Ultra Electronics PLC (ULE.LN) and Chemring Group PLC (CHG.LN) of the U.K. are all now seen as clear contenders for consolidation, according to analysts. These companies have been buying up a string of smaller suppliers in recent years to bulk up. \u001d  Although Thales isn't seen currently as a potential takeover target, analysts note that it competes directly with Smiths for avionics business and could target further smaller acquisitions. \u001d  All these U.K. suppliers benefited from the strong upturn in the past two years in the commercial airplane sector and from healthy defense equipment spending in the U.S.. Last year, both Boeing and Airbus had record order books and have huge backlogs they are now looking to fill. \u001d  Underlining the attractiveness of the sector, on Jan. 4 Cobham disclosed that Barcelona-based industrialist Francesc Rubiralta Vilaseca had built around a 5% stake. Analysts said the move clearly shows the industry still has substantial growth opportunities in both commercial and aerospace. \u001d  In a research note Monday, Numis Securities said companies such as Meggitt, Cobham and Ultra could all be attractive to a large U.S. predator. The read across from the Smiths deal is that these aerospace plays are now trading at hefty discounts to the price paid by GE, it added. \u001d  Evolution Securities, which has a buy rating on Smiths, said Cobham and Meggitt are the obvious standouts but there could also be some attention on GKN PLC's (GKN.LN) aerospace unit. These global niche value-added stocks are vulnerable to consolidation, Evolution said. \u001d  GKN has sold its 50% holding in helicopter maker AgustaWestland to Italian aerospace and defense company Finmeccanica SpA (FNC.MI), leaving GKN with a smaller aerospace unit alongside its automotive operation. Finmeccanica has also been linked as a possible suitor for the U.K.'s Ultra Electronics. \u001d  The likes of U.S.-based Honeywell International Inc. (HON), Rockwell Collins Corp. (COL) and General Dynamics (GD) have long been seen as potential buyers of European aerospace suppliers. Private-equity firms such as U.S.-based Carlyle Group LP and European players like Cinven have also shown a strong appetite for European aerospace assets. \u001d  The Panmure Gordon brokerage, meanwhile, also sees consolidation potential for Cobham, Ultra and Meggitt but said there's clearly scope for others to step in with a a bid for the whole of Smiths. The brokerage has a buy rating on Smiths Group. \u001d  Hopes of more takeover action pushed Smiths' main peers higher Monday. In early afternoon trading Cobham was up 3.4%, Meggitt ahead 4.6%, Ultra Electronics up 1% and GKN up 0.9%.

These new results confirm that the Regis kimberlite is diamond-bearing and provides further support for the Company's in-house exploration model for diamond-bearing kimberlites within this region of Brazil. The ongoing validation of this model further enhances the exploration potential of the other kimberlite targets within the Company's licence portfolio. \b \bThe Company has now received the results of caustic fusion testing for micro-diamonds from the second drill hole at the Regis kimberlite. This second drill hole, RDH02, returned a total of 20 micro-diamonds from 381.3 kilograms (kg) of kimberlite core processed. RDH02 was drilled vertically to a depth of 251 metres (m), with kimberlite core sampled from the 88 m to 251 m interval. Significantly, 18 of the 20 micro-diamonds recovered were encountered from the interval between 229.6 m and 243.9 m vertical depth, which weighed 32.5 kg in total. This prolific interval is now being examined further to determine whether it represents a high grade portion of the kimberlite. \b \bCore from RDH02 was split at the Company's Patos de Minas laboratory and shipped in 47 batches of approximately 8 kg each to the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) Laboratory, in Saskatoon, Canada. The kimberlite was tested for micro-diamonds using the caustic fusion method with a bottom screen size of 0.075 mm; micro-diamonds which remained on 0.075 to 0.212 mm screens were recovered (Table 1). \b \b \bTable 1: Size distribution of micro-diamonds from drill hole RDH02 at \bthe Regis Kimberlite Pipe, in central Minas Gerais State, Brazil. \b \b=-------------------------------------- \b                 No. of \b                  micro-   Total sample \bScreen size    diamonds          weight \b=-------------------------------------- \b \b=-------------------------------------- \b0.600mm               0 \b=-------------------------------------- \b0.425mm               0 \b=-------------------------------------- \b0.300mm               0 \b=-------------------------------------- \b0.212mm               1 \b=-------------------------------------- \b0.150mm               1 \b=-------------------------------------- \b0.106mm               9 \b=-------------------------------------- \b0.075mm               9 \b=-------------------------------------- \b \b=-------------------------------------- \b                     20        381.3 kg \b=-------------------------------------- \b \b \bRDH02 was drilled vertically 112 m east of RDH01, which was previously reported in a press release dated October 17, 2006 as yielding 129 micro-diamonds from 348.75 kg of kimberlite. Drill holes RDH01 and RDH02 were completed in August 2006 to depths of 317 m and 251 m respectively, in a central, pipe-like zone of approximately 20 hectares in size within the larger Regis kimberlite body. This central pipe-like body was previously untested by previous exploration and is now demonstrated to be diamond-bearing. \b \bDelineation of this central pipe at the Regis Kimberlite continues with drill holes RDH03 and RDH04 having been recently completed to vertical depths of 152.0 and 364.3 m respectively. Preliminary examination of core suggests RDH03 and RDH04 comprise multiple kimberlite phases including a new, previously untested mantle xenolith-rich interval in RDH03. Each kimberlite phase has the potential for carrying a different concentration of diamonds. Two additional holes (RDH05 and RDH06) are currently being completed in order to more fully delineate the central pipe. Core from each drill hole will be sent to SRC for micro-diamond testing and the results expected during the first and second quarters of 2007. \b \bIn addition to the caustic fusion tests completed on drill holes RDH01 and RDH02, selected intervals from the reference half split core from drill hole RDH01 were processed for indicator minerals at the Company's Patos de Minas laboratory, which is ISO 17025 rated for certain indicator mineral recovery processes. The intervals processed consisted of the two zones which produced high micro-diamond counts, 113.4 to 142.8 m and 301.7 to 311.5 m. The interval 301.7 to 331.5 m (start weight 10.0 kg) yielded high counts of typical kimberlitic Cr-pyrope garnets, chrome diopside, forsteritic olivine, enstatite, chromite, Mg-ilmenite and two diamond fragments. These diamond fragments are both 0.6 mm in the longest dimension and appear to be broken pieces of the same original stone. The indicator mineral samples from RDH01 were crushed until greater than 90% of material passed through a -1.0 mm screen, using a bottom screen size of 0.25 mm. The samples were concentrated for heavy minerals using water columns and then picked for indicator minerals including diamonds by hand under optical microscopes. \b \bThe Company considers that the recovery of micro-diamonds from both of the first two deep drill tests of the Regis Kimberlite to be an important advance, both for the ongoing testing of the pipe itself, and for our diamond exploration model, which will be further tested at other kimberlite targets within the region. Results from the next phase of drilling will be announced as soon as they become available. \b \bDr. Harrison Cookenboo, (P.Geo) and Consulting Geologist, is the Qualified Person as defined under National Instrument 43-101 responsible for the technical disclosure in this release, and has reviewed and approved the contents of this release. \b \bEditors' Note:- \b \bBrazilian Diamonds is a leading Brazil-based exploration company focused on the discovery of kimberlites on its extensive portfolio of properties in the States of Minas Gerais and Bahia, with the goal of becoming a significant producer of diamonds. \b \bThe Company is awaiting final approval before commencing the environmental licensing process for development of the Canastra 1 kimberlite body for which mine feasibility work has already been completed and the required Mines Department approvals are already in place. It is intended to bring Canastra 1 into production once this licensing process is completed. \b \bThe Company has recently acquired the Chapada Diamantina project in Bahia from De Beers which includes the diamondiferous Salvador 1 kimberlite. Plans are under-way to undertake a large bulk sample at Salvador 1 utilizing a 15 tonne per hour DMS treatment plant, which is currently located at the Company's Santo Antonio do Bonito property. De Beers retains a right to acquire up to 40% of any kimberlite found containing more that 200 carats of diamonds on the Chapada Diamantina properties. \b \bThe Company has a fully operational diamond separation/analysis laboratory at Patos de Minas, Minas Gerais which is strategically located near its properties in the Santo Antonio and Coromandel areas. The Company has a highly experienced team including four geologists most of whom are located at the Company's facilities in Brazil. \b \bThe Company's strategy for non-core activities on its properties is to form joint ventures. A Cdn$1,000,000 feasibility study is currently underway for a joint venture for the mining of alluvial diamonds on its properties in the Santo Antonio river drainage. The joint venture involves two important Brazilian companies: CODEMIG, the state owned mining development organization and Mineracao Rio Novo Ltda., a wholly owned subsidiary of Andrade Gutierrez SA, one of Brazil's largest civil engineering firms and an existing large scale, dredge based producer of alluvial diamonds. \b \b \b \b \b         FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT: \b \b         Brazilian Diamonds Limited \b         Ken Judge \b         Chairman \b         + 44 7733 001 002 \b         or \b         Brazilian Diamonds Limited \b         Stephen Fabian \b         President & CEO \b         + 55 31 8814 5111 \b         or \b         Brazilian Diamonds Limited \b         Investor Relations \b         Europe \b         + 44 207 590 5503 \b         or \b         Brazilian Diamonds Limited \b         Investor Relations \b         North America \b         (604) 689-2599 or 1-866-689-2599 \b         (604) 689-3609 (FAX) \b         Email: info@braziliandiamonds.com \b         Website: www.braziliandiamonds.com \b         or \b         Hanson Westhouse Limited (Nomad to the Company) \b         Tim Feather \b         + 44 113 246 2610 \b         or \b         Teather & Greenwood: Landsbanki (Broker to the Company) \b         James Maxwell \b         + 44 207 426 9000 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 06:32 ET (11:32 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1004e37ff946b4a5051a9623c664ac60","symR":["FER.MC","ES0162601019","FER.MC","ES0162601019"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"BAA: ADI To Refinance Sterling, Euro Bonds","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T09:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FER.MC","ES0162601019"],"IndustryCodes":["CON","XDJGI","XIBEX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 04:05 ET (09:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"10bb328c0183488a0d5f332172c0db40","symR":["MN.T","CA5662191017"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"March Networks Sees FY Revs C$80M-C$85M >MN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T07:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MN.T","CA5662191017"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 02:29 ET (07:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"10e1de26d13932b58b8e843ba3606d9d","symR":["532540.BY","TTA.YY","INE467B01029"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"India TCS Adds 7,835 Staff In 3Q","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["532540.BY","TTA.YY","INE467B01029"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","TSX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:28 ET (12:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"11142ffcc1a88be5841e44611e2f0b2a","symR":["GE","SMIN.LN","GB0008182700","US3696041033"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Smiths Group To Sell Aerospace Unit To GE, Form JV -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T07:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GE","SMIN.LN","GB0008182700","US3696041033"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","IDD","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  Smiths said following completion of the sale of the Aerospace unit, it is expected to generate improved returns on capital and enhanced margins. \u001d  The net effect of the sale and the intended return of capital to shareholders would have been accretive to Smiths headline earnings per share for pro forma 2006. \u001d  The board said it proposes, subject to completion of the sale and shareholder approval, to return GBP2.1bn - out of the net proceeds estimated to be GBP2.25bn - by means of a B share scheme, combined with a share consolidation, shortly after the completion of the sale. \u001d  The company said it will hold an extraordinary general meeting to approve the sale during the second quarter of 2007. \u001d  For the 53 week period ended Aug. 5, Aerospace recorded operating profits of GBP156 million on a turnover of GBP1.3 billion.

You dial the 1-800 reservations number, and suddenly, you're having a conversation. There's no touch-tone labyrinth prompting you to decide between English or reservations or technical support, just a bunch of ladies who sound as if they happened to pick up the phone in the middle of baking cherry pie. And they cheerfully answer just about anything: What's for dinner? \"Peanuts, maybe pretzels.\" When do prices rise? \"Two weeks before the flight date.\" Can I bring my hamster? \"No, but Delta, Continental and United allow pets -- would you like their numbers?\" \u001d  Discount brokerage Scottrade also puts you straight through to an actual human. Unfortunately, Southwest and Scottrade are exceptions. More than 90 percent of large businesses rely on phone trees to field calls. As you might guess, this is supposed to save money. Every time you get a live rep on the phone, it costs roughly $5. In comparison, an automated call costs 50 cents. That's why corporate America spent $565 million in 2005 on new ways to trap you in touch-tone hell. \u001d  Problem is, their plan isn't working very well. Consumers hate these systems, and most of us will do anything to bypass the phone tree and get a live rep. Millions visit sites like GetHuman.com, which lists the secret codes for accessing an agent. (Hint: To reach an operator at Discover, press the star key four times.) This is a big problem for business. According to a Datamonitor survey of companies that use phone trees, more than 85 percent of callers manage to hunt down a live operator. And once that happens, they burn up the line grousing about the !*&@!! system. No cost savings there. \u001d  Southwest and Scottrade are clever. So far, they've resisted the phone-tree temptation in favor of a simple business model that reduces call-center demand. Take ever-profitable Southwest. It has coach-only seating, simple fares, a clear-cut rewards program and a Web site so straightforward your cat could book a flight. Sure, folks refer to the no-frills airline as The Flying Bus, but if you find Southwest confusing, you probably have more problems than a reservations agent can solve. As a result, calls to Southwest are typically shorter and easier to resolve than calls fielded by other airlines, says Rick Rappe of VocaLabs, a survey firm that monitors call centers. The simplicity also enables each of Southwest's 3,000 agents to efficiently field questions on any topic, says Ellen Torbert, Southwest's VP of reservations. Compare that with American Airlines, which segments its call-center force into endless divisions: There are more than 20 different numbers to call for everything from refunds to reservations to lost baggage. \u001d  You might call fast-growing Scottrade the Southwest of brokerages. It's cheap (trades cost $7) and straightforward. Other discount brokerages offer complicated products like mortgages and retirement plans. Scottrade offers trades, and when you're tired of that, more trades. What's more, customer calls are usually routed to a local Scottrade branch and answered by whoever's free to pick up -- typically a peppy fellow who sounds like the town's youngest stockbroker. Scottrade's cost per call isn't cheap; the company says it's above the $5 industry average. But by keeping things simple and decentralized, the company keeps call volume relatively low. Scottrade needs just 65 brokers at its call center -- one for every 23,000 accounts. (Fidelity, another brokerage with fine service and a branch system, employs one call-center broker for every 3,500 accounts -- and still uses a simple phone tree.) \u001d  Perhaps the success of Southwest and Scottrade will convince their phone-tree-hugging competitors to follow suit. Meanwhile, consumers will keep tracking down agents. My new favorite weapon: NoPhoneTrees.com, a site that does the impossible -- it navigates the phone tree for you and rings you when it gets an agent on the line.

(NASDAQ: MANH), today announced that Argos Direct, the delivery to home operation of Home Retail Group, has completed its implementation of Manhattan Associates' Warehouse Management solution at its 650,000 ft(2) Marsh Leys distribution centre in Buckinghamshire, which serves the whole of the south of England. Manhattan Associates' Warehouse Management for Open Systems is now running in two of Argos Direct's three distribution centres. The first full implementation took place in the company's purpose-built Faverdale distribution centre near Darlington, which serves northern England and Scotland. The company intends to implement Manhattan Associates' technology in its third warehouse, at Acton Gate, Staffordshire, in May 2007. \b \u001d  The implementation of the solution, complemented by radio frequency (RF) technology from Psion Teklogix, is already bringing benefits in terms of reduced clerical work, enhanced operational efficiency, improved order accuracy levels and higher levels of customer service. The smoothness of the implementation has been remarkable because the Manhattan Associates Warehouse Management solution replaced an existing legacy system, a transition process which can be disruptive if not managed effectively. \b \u001d  \"We decided to avoid a 'big bang' approach,\" explained Pete Connor, IS director for Home Retail Group. \"Instead we meticulously planned and sequentially executed a progressive handover to the new system, supported by Manhattan Associates' consultants. This deployment methodology along with a clearly defined approach to data migration enabled us to transition to the new application extremely smoothly. Because of this approach, we were able to hand the support function back to our operational team within two weeks of completing the implementation. No deliveries were affected during the process - we did not miss a beat. This is testimony to the great planning, execution and commitment of the team and sets a very high standard.\" \b \u001d  \"We are very proud of the success we have achieved with Argos Direct at both Marsh Leys and Faverdale, and look forward to working closely with the Argos Direct team on their third implementation at Acton Gate next year,\" commented Allen Scott, UK managing director at Manhattan Associates. \"Home Retail Group is one example amongst a rapidly expanding list of companies in the UK and around the world that are deploying Manhattan Associates supply chain solutions to support their multi-channel retail initiatives as they look to exploit the opportunities presented by a retail revolution that is gathering pace.\" \b \b   About Argos \b \u001d  Founded in 1973, Argos is a unique catalogue retailer recognised for choice, value and convenience.

UP trains transporting coal out of the SPRB averaged just over 15,000 tons each in the fourth quarter--an increase of 200 tons over last year's average. Investment in capacity improvements and new processes helped UP achieve the increased tonnage. \b \u001d  \"Our employees are stepping up to the challenge to help meet our nation's crucial energy needs,\" said Jim Young, president and CEO. \"Their ideas and dedication helped fuel the increases we experienced in 2006, and together we are continuing to develop new ways to handle rising demand.\" \b \u001d  Additional rail line improvements in Wyoming are expected to help boost capacity on the Joint Line owned by UP and BNSF. Future improvements - a fourth main line on Logan Hill and a third main line north of Reno Junction - coupled with the addition of 14 landing spots at the mines for trains, also are expected to increase Joint Line capacity. \b \u001d  According to data released late last year by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of Energy, coal inventories at the nation's electric utilities were expected to end 2006 at their highest levels in four years. On Dec. 21, 2006, the EIA reported coal inventories at the nation's utilities stood at 125.6 million tons, up 27.9 percent over a year ago. In its Short-Term Energy Outlook released on Dec. 12, 2006, EIA said it expects inventory levels to rise again in 2007, reaching 138.9 million tons by the end of the year. \b \u001d  Also in December 2006, the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reported that utilities have ample supplies of coal on hand for the winter season, and that NERC had removed the SPRB from its reliability watch list. \b \b   About Union Pacific \b \u001d  Union Pacific Corporation owns one of America's leading transportation companies. Its principal operating company, Union Pacific Railroad, is the largest railroad in North America, covering 23 states across the western two-thirds of the United States. A strong focus on quality and a strategically advantageous route structure enable the company to serve customers in critical and fast growing markets. It is a leading carrier of low-sulfur coal used in electrical power generation and has broad coverage of the large chemical-producing areas along the Gulf Coast. With competitive long-haul routes between all major West Coast ports and eastern gateways, and as the only railroad to serve all six major gateways to Mexico, Union Pacific has the premier rail franchise in North America. \b \b    CONTACT: Union Pacific Corporation \b             Gene Hinkle, 402-514-9406 \b \b    SOURCE: Union Pacific Corporation \bCopyright Business Wire 2007 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 11:39 ET (16:39 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"131ef198488c45bc3b1a2928dbd63fa5","symR":["IBE.MC","SPI","SPW.LN","ES0144580018","GB00B125RK88"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EU: To Clear Deal Or Launch In-Depth Probe By Feb 16","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T15:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IBE.MC","SPI","SPW.LN","ES0144580018","GB00B125RK88"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XFT1","XIBEX","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 10:03 ET (15:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1349c27ce754570b2b60c299fd842f1d","symR":["UKDAY"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"DATA SNAP: UK Output PPI Inflation Picks Up In December","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T09:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b \b========================================================= \b      Producer Price Index    !Consensus: +0.1% on month! \b   Output PPI    Dec    Nov   !           +2.2% on year ! \b          on mo +0.2%   0.0%  !Actual:    +0.2% on month! \b          on yr +2.2%  +1.8%  !           +2.2% on year ! \b                              !                         ! \b   Input PPI                  !Consensus: +0.2% on month! \b          on mo +0.1%  +0.6%r !           +1.4% on year ! \b          on yr +1.9%  +3.3%r !Actual:    +0.1% on month! \b                              !           +1.9% on year ! \b========================================================= \b \u001d  By Natasha Brereton \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--U.K. factory gate prices rose more than expected in December leading to a higher annual inflation rate, data from the Office of National Statistics showed Monday. \u001d  The output price index for home sales and manufactured products lifted 2.2% on the year in December, compared with a rise of 1.8% in November, the ONS said.

We've run into situations where the roads have been blocked,\" Sexton said. \"It's kind of caused people to go into panic. They're struggling to try to get heat, to get electricity to their houses.\" \u001d  He said the county jail is operating on emergency generator power and that many other public facilities are relying on generators to stay open. Emergency workers are finding shelters for elderly residents and others with medical conditions who are without power, Sexton said. \u001d  The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said utility crews worked throughout the night to restore power. \u001d  Late Sunday, President Bush approved Oklahoma's request for a federal emergency disaster declaration. Gov. Brad Henry requested federal aid after it became clear the state would need federal support to recover from the statewide storm. \u001d  The disaster declaration covers direct federal assistance as well as 75% reimbursement for emergency protective measures by local and state personnel. \u001d  Authorities said 12 people have died due to collisions on slick highways since the storm struck on Friday, and three others apparently died of hypothermia following prolonged exposure to bitterly cold temperatures. \u001d  Seven people were killed before dawn Sunday near Elk City when the minivan they were riding in hit a slick spot along Interstate 40, crossed the median and slammed into an oncoming tractor-trailer, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported. \u001d  A wind chill advisory is in effect for parts of Oklahoma through Monday. Forecasters said gusty winds will drop wind chill indices to the teens and single digits. \u001d  Statewide, 122,338 electric customers were without power Sunday night, mostly in eastern sections of the state, OEM said. \u001d  Public Service Company, which provides power to 514,000 customers in eastern and southwestern Oklahoma, said 44,801 customers were without power. Oklahoma Gas and Electric Co. reported 19,000 customers without power, including about 10,000 in Muskogee in eastern Oklahoma. \u001d  The Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives said 58,550 coop customers were without power as up to four inches of freezing rain and brisk winds in eastern Oklahoma took a heavy toll on power lines and utility poles. \u001d  Electric coops said the storm had destroyed more than 700 utility poles statewide. \u001d  The storm caused flight delays and cancellations at airports in Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Amtrak canceled passenger rail service Sunday between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth, Texas, because of a Burlington Northern-Santa Fe (BNI) freight train that blocked the tracks. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 02:07 ET (07:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"14e4209f7e09bf663ad2c29e453660c7","symR":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021","30110.AE","ABN","RY","RY.T","CA7800871021","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"RBC Plans Two-Part, 3-Yr, 5-Yr Fixed Rate Benchmark Bond","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T10:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 05:25 ET (10:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"151c6a579ce0f743ed860a12c1d660ae","symR":["ATS.UN.T","CA00211C1086"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ATS Andlauer To Buy Back Up To 871,436 Trust Units >ATS.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T16:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ATS.UN.T","CA00211C1086"],"IndustryCodes":["TRS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 11:34 ET (16:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1595708676ccd8ebfc4fbd8e65416f1e","symR":["TWX","US8873171057"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": AOL Announces Recommended All Cash -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T07:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TWX","US8873171057"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b      respect of (i) 94,391 warrants in the 2004/2007 series and (ii) 867,300 \b      warrants in the 2006/2010 series. \b \b    2 The offer price for each series of warrants represents the difference \b      between the Offer Price and the strike price of each series of warrants. \b \b    3 This includes its former rulings with respect to the rules on public \b      offers for the acquisition of shares issued by the Swedish Industry and \b      Commerce Stock Exchange Committee, where applicable. \b \b    4 The company name, AOLS Holdings AB, is expected to be registered shortly \b      with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. \b \b \u001d  This Offer is not being made (nor will any tender of shares be accepted from or on behalf of holders) in any jurisdiction in which the making of the Offer or the acceptance of any tender of shares therein would not be made in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction.

(TSX: BZA)(FWB: AB2) (\"Bonanza\") is pleased to announce that it has acquired a further 25% interest in the Northway Project, increasing its interest from 75% to 100%. The current acquisition of the final 25% interest in the Northway project is a result of Bonanza's strategy to acquire advanced stage gold properties in mining friendly areas of Canada and the western United States. Bonanza continues to drill its portfolio of high grade gold properties. The current acquisition complements Bonanza's gold assets and increases the Corporation's total gold resources by over 215,000 ounces. These ounces are historical in nature and are not National Instrument 43-101 compliant. \u001d  The Northway property is located in Quebec, 25 kilometers south of Matagami and covers 3,600 hectares. The Northway property lies one kilometer along strike to the east of Agnico Eagle's Vezza deposit and may be a continuation of the same gold zone. As previously reported by Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd., the Vezza deposit is estimated to contain a historical resource of 2.76 million tons grading 0.136 ounces of gold per ton (375,000 contained ounces of gold). \u001d  On the basis of the current acquisition Bonanza controls 100% of the Northway property, which contains a historic resource of 18.2 million tonnes grading 1.48 grams per tonne gold, containing 866,000 ounces of gold. Within this resource, significant higher grade zones are present. The resource remains open to expansion along strike and down dip in several areas. \u001d  Bonanza plans an estimated 5,000 meters of Phase I drilling in 25 drill holes along the Northway gold zone planned to commence in first half of this year. The Phase I drilling program will focus on resource expansion and confirmation of the high grade zones. Following completion of Phase I drilling, a Phase II drilling program will support development of a National Instrument 43-101 compliant resource estimate. \u001d  Brian Kirwin, Chief Executive Officer stated, \"This acquisition and resulting addition to the Bonanza's total gold resources is a further step in accomplishing the Corporation's Mission of becoming a high grade gold producer based in stable areas of Canada and the United States.\" \u001d  The following is an updated summary of gold resources controlled by the Company which reflects the additional historical ounces acquired at Northway. \bTable 1.

(TSX:ISA) announced today that its partner, Lux Biosciences, has been granted orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ISA247, referred to as LX211 by Lux, for the treatment of non-infectious posterior, intermediate and panuveitis. \b \bOrphan drug designation is a special status for diseases or conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, granted by the FDA upon request by a sponsor. Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor for exclusive marketing rights in the United States for seven years if the Company is first to receive marketing approval. The designation also positions Lux Biosciences to benefit from certain tax credits and waives the company's obligation to pay FDA application user fees for these products as required by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). \b \b\"We are pleased to receive Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for LX211 (ISA247), a late-stage product in our pipeline,\" said Ulrich Grau, President and CEO of Lux Biosciences. \"LX211 has the potential of establishing new treatment paradigms in these an indication of high medical need. The only drugs currently approved in uveitis are steroids.\" \b \bDr. Randall Yatscoff, Isotechnika's President & CEO stated, \"The receipt of Orphan Drug designation for non-infectious uveitis may facilitate the introduction of ISA247 (LX211) for treatment of these serious disorders.\" \b \bAbout Uveitis \b \b=------------ \b \bUveitis is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the eye. There is substantial evidence implicating T-lymphocytes, key cells involved in inflammatory processes, in the development of the disease. Uveitis is an under-diagnosed and under-recognized medical condition that causes vision impairment, ocular pain, and loss of vision. Experts estimate that 10% of new U.S. cases of blindness result from this disease. Approximately 300,000 people suffer from uveitis in the United States alone, the majority of whom are affected by anterior uveitis. The only therapeutic class approved by the FDA for treatment of uveitis is corticosteroids, which are burdened with multiple side effects, such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and in the eye, cataract formation and glaucoma. \b \bAbout Isotechnika Inc. \b \b=--------------------- \b \bIsotechnika Inc. is an international biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Drawing upon its expertise in medicinal chemistry and immunology, the Company is focused on the discovery and development of novel immunosuppressive therapeutics that are safer than currently available treatments.

The company has a great reputation, strong history and big demand for its services.\" \u001d  -- Ray Neidl, airline analyst, Calyon Securities \b \u001d  YES: Southwest did a great job of hedging fuel prices several years ago, which kept its fuel costs down even as oil prices went up. Those high energy prices have kept rivals at bay, while Southwest's earnings have grown. \b \u001d  YES: Southwest is the only airline that has made money every quarter since Sept. 11. It has a strong balance sheet in an industry where bankruptcies are common. And the firm just announced a $400 million stock buyback plan. \b \u001d  YES: The airline has 283 planes on order, so it can fly more often to cities it already serves profitably. It plans to increase its service to Philadelphia by 40 percent, which gives it further reach into the profitable East Coast market. Canada and Mexico are potential new forays as well. The airline can grow profits 15 percent a year for several years. \b \u001d  YES: Southwest's culture of low cost and friendly service is unmatched in the industry. Other airlines can sometimes match Southwest on price, but its service wins the customer's loyalty. \u001d  --- \u001d  NO: \"This has been one of the best environments Southwest could possibly see -- full of planes and falling energy prices -- and yet it is losing pricing power.\" \u001d  -- Tom Stringfellow, chief investment officer, Frost Bank \b \u001d  NO: Southwest's hedging strategy has been great, but now it's being punished for its smart behavior. Those hedging contracts are expiring, and Southwest's fuel costs will go up. Meanwhile, all other carriers are seeing their unhedged fuel prices fall. That will have an impact on earnings and make this year's profits look bad compared with last year's. \b \u001d  NO: Sept. 11 issues aside, this is an industry not exactly known for rational behavior. An overly aggressive airline, say, a US Air-Delta combination, can go into any of Southwest's markets and initiate a profit-killing price war that lasts for months. \b \u001d  NO: Southwest has thrived as a smaller airline, but now it's the Big Kahuna. That brings about a whole set of issues. It can't just move into one new market and have its profits skyrocket. There's a lot of headwind keeping it from growing profits 15 percent a year. \b \u001d  NO: I love flying it, but Southwest is a mature company in a tough industry. And the stock is not cheap enough to justify those questionable growth prospects. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 06:01 ET (11:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"18f6a59f34fe1f2d29ac6f15f2a06ec3","symR":["BNK.T","CA0662861057"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Bankers Grants Options To Directors, Officers, Employees And Consultants>BNK.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T11:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BNK.T","CA0662861057"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","OIS","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 06:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"195d731cbf12ef3138fd39b108e91867","symR":["ARRS","TAT.OS","NO0003070906"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Arris To Acquire Tandberg Television In $1.21B Deal","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T08:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ARRS","TAT.OS","NO0003070906"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI","XISL","XOBX","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  STOCKHOLM (Dow Jones)--U.S. technology company Arris Group Inc.

And DSV has previously said that, in terms of air and sea logistics, it wants its operations to cover the U.S. and European markets, as well as large parts of Asia, within the next few years. \u001d  In January 2006, the company bought Dutch rival Frans Maas for 3.15 billion Danish kroner ($547.3 million). The company has estimated annual synergies from the acquisition at DKK450 million, starting in 2008, but many analysts expect the synergies to be even higher. \u001d  Larsen said he still feels comfortable with this guidance and that a realistic target for DSV's operating margin in Germany would be 2% in the short term. \u001d  While having been an aggressive buyer, some analysts have also argued that DSV is a potential takeover target itself, as the fragmented logistics industry continues to consolidate. \u001d  However, Larsen refrained from commenting on whether DSV has received any takeover approaches from other logistics companies. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.dsv.com \u001d  -By Malin Rising, Dow Jones Newswires; +45 33 111 524; malin.rising@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 06:38 ET (11:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"19b0bc65c6e0e5ee0d684c2158bd3a0d","symR":["NAS.T","CA66704N1096"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Northstar Aero Rtg Upped On Rev Growth Seen In '07: Versant","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T18:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NAS.T","CA66704N1096"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP"],"Story":"\u001d  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Versant Partners increased Northstar Aeropsace Inc.

Worries that soaring oil prices would derail global economic growth have faded as energy costs have subsided.  Though the US economy has slowed down, largely as a result of weakness in the housing market, the risks of a US recession now appear remote.  Six months ago, fears of inflation for the most part reflected anxieties about rising raw materials prices.  Currently, inflation concerns are broadening as pay settlements in the UK, the USA and the euro zone are threatening to exceed rates acceptable to the respective central banks.  The capital markets have reflected these shifts in economic expectations in a rational way, as our table below shows. \b \b   UK YIELD HISTORIES \b End-period %   I-L 2035   T 4.25 32   Diff   FTSE   Diff \b 2004  March      1.64      4.63       2.99   3.13   1.49 \b       June       1.76      4.83       3.07   3.16   1.40 \b       September  1.64      4.57       2.93   3.16   1.52 \b       December   1.46      4.43       2.97   3.00   1.54 \b 2005  March      1.68      4.70       3.02   3.13   1.45 \b       June       1.43      4.24       2.81   3.10   1.67 \b       September  1.28      4.25       2.97   2.98   1.70 \b       December   1.00      4.00       3.00   2.96   1.96 \b 2006  March      1.04      4.14       3.10   2.89   1.85 \b       June       1.25      4.39       3.14   3.11   1.86 \b       September  1.02      4.16       3.14   3.12   2.10 \b 2007  Current    1.12      4.40       3.28   2.86   1.74 \b Source: ONS and Insinger de Beaufort \b \u001d  In the table, we take representative yields for long-dated index-linked and fixed coupon gilts and for the FTSE All-Share index and compare how they have performed over the past three years.  The third column of figures tracks the yield-differential between the index-linked and fixed coupon gilt, while the final column shows the yield spread between the index-linked and the All-Share. \u001d  The index-linked yield is a proxy for the risk-free real yield demanded by investors.  With global economic growth sustained amidst ample liquidity, it is not surprising that the trend in this yield has been downwards since the beginning of 2004, as investors have competed aggressively to take advantage of investment opportunities.  There was a minor spike in the middle of last year, reflecting temporary anxieties over growth and the supply of liquidity, but these worries soon passed.  By contrast, the fixed coupon yield is now marginally above its level at the end of June last year.  In 2006Q3, the fall in the fixed coupon yield matched that in the index-linked but, in 2006Q4, the fixed coupon yield began to rise independently of the index-linked.  This divergence has resulted in a rise in the differential to a level well above the range that prevailed in 2004-05.  Whereas institutional factors relating to asset/liability matching have probably been favouring index-linked investment, as we pointed out last July, it seems even less plausible than it did then that the whole rise in the fixed coupon/index-linked yield-gap is to be attributed to this factor.  It does seem that the widening spread reflects investors' demand that increased compensation for future inflation be incorporated in the fixed coupon yield. A part of the differential reflects a premium to counter-balance the risk that a fixed coupon gilt will not give the expected real return.  But the gap is now so wide, it no longer seems consistent with a belief on investors' part that the Bank of England will, over the long run, keep inflation down in line with its target.  Even though RPI inflation, on which the inflation indexing of gilts is based, generally runs about 0.5 of a percentage point higher than inflation on the CPI target-measure, the fixed coupon/index-linked yield differential is now too wide to allow any interpretation other than a decline of confidence in the Bank of England's ability to deliver inflation on target. \u001d  The equity market was slow to respond to the fall in real yields, as signalled by index-linked gilts, in 2006Q3.  The equity/index-linked differential, which was already above the 2004-05 average in the middle of last year, rose further to exceed 2%.  Institutional factors were probably acting more powerfully on this spread than on the fixed coupon/index-linked gap. Subsequently, the equity yield has caught up with the fall in the index-linked yield.  This suggests these factors are less significant than they were, as long-term investing institutions complete their fund reallocations. \b \u001d  -By Stephen Lewis: (+44) 20 7190 7193; sjlewis@insinger.com \u001d  (Stephen Lewis is chief economist at Insinger de Beaufort Ltd., London, independent brokers specializing in institutional business.) \u001d  Opinions expressed are those of the author, and not of Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  This column is published for information only, and it neither constitutes, nor is to be construed as, an offer to buy or sell investments.

Nortel will be one of two suppliers of a carrier-scale Ethernet solution for 21CN that exploits Ethernet in a fundamentally new way and is expected to drive a radical change in the economics of carrier networks. \b \bBT aims to use the new Ethernet solution to transport high-bandwidth services - from mission critical business applications to full-streaming video - with new levels of simplicity, quality and cost-savings. \b \b\"Today's announcement marks a significant industry turning point,\" said Mike Zafirovski, president and chief executive officer, Nortel. \"BT is using Ethernet technology in a completely new way to provide an answer to the challenge of simplifying network management, redefining service quality and reducing costs,\" Zafirovski said. \b \b\"We have been anticipating the widespread deployment of Ethernet in our 21CN architecture for a while but have been waiting for development to help make the technology viable for deployment in carrier grade networks,\" said Matt Beal, director core convergence, BT Wholesale. \"The implementation of Ethernet also complements fully BT's well established MPLS strategy within 21CN.\" \b \bPBB-TE (Provider Backbone Bridging Traffic Engineering) is an emerging IEEE standard that incorporates a set of enhancements to Ethernet known as Provider Backbone Transport (PBT) that allows the use of Ethernet for a carrier class transport network. \b \b\"As one of the early pioneers of PBT we have already witnessed significant movement in the market for metro transport networks as it splits between an evolution of a router-based approach and a movement towards Ethernet,\" said Philippe Morin, president, Metro Ethernet Networks, Nortel. \b \b\"Nortel believes that BT's thought leadership and the pre-eminence of its 21CN strategy will speed wider-scale adoption of Ethernet-based solutions. It will also help continue the momentum to standardize the technology through the recognized standards bodies,\" added Morin. \b \bBT has selected Nortel's Metro Ethernet Routing Switch 8600 and Metro Ethernet Services Unit 1850 for the Ethernet component of its 21CN. PBB-TE promises to bring control to data paths within very large carrier networks, enabling true quality of service, meaningful service level agreements and the ability to set aside specific paths for communications, increasing network performance while providing carrier-grade resiliency. \b \bPBB-TE is currently progressing through industry standardization within the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) 802.1 Working Group. \b \bA number of service providers including The Chinese Academy of Sciences, COLT Telecom, MTC Kuwait, Pride, Shanghai Telecom, SURFNet and Versatel have already adopted various elements of Nortel's Metro Ethernet Networking solutions including the Metro Ethernet Routing Switch 8600, the Optical Multiservice Edge 6500 and Provider Backbone Bridges - which enable millions of services to be provisioned via the network, versus the thousands available in competing solutions. \b \bAbout Nortel \b \bNortel is a recognized leader in delivering communications capabilities that enhance the human experience, ignite and power global commerce, and secure and protect the world's most critical information.

These days, they may seem little more than a bad memory. They shouldn't. \u001d  Fears of a major outbreak of avian influenza among humans reached a high less than a year ago. Flocks of poultry, swans and wild birds were contracting the disease in Europe and Africa. The virus's spread into the U.S. bird population seemed just a matter of time. Some people rushed to stockpile antiviral drugs, and experts warned that a pandemic could be imminent. \u001d  It has been relatively quiet since then, and some of the fears now seem overblown. \u001d  But evidence continues to trickle in that the virus hasn't gone away. Birds continue to die from the disease in countries such as Vietnam and South Korea. In recent weeks, China, Indonesia and Egypt have reported cases of humans contracting the virus, most likely from close contact with sick birds. \u001d  Since its re-emergence in late 2003, the virulent strain of bird flu that worries scientists most, known as H5N1, has infected at least 267 people in 10 countries from Indonesia to Iraq, according to the World Health Organization. Of these, 161, or 60%, have died. Last year alone, the disease killed at least 80 people. \u001d  Such figures don't indicate a human pandemic is imminent. But public-health experts say the safest approach is to consider a human pandemic a somewhat permanent threat. The current casualty rate makes H5N1 a minor danger to people when compared with, say, seasonal influenza, which can kill more than 30,000 people a year in the U.S. alone. But in the future, a genetic mutation could make H5N1 -- which can pass from bird to human but currently isn't readily transmissible among humans -- contagious enough to wipe out millions of people. \u001d  That mutation might never take place -- but public-health experts say the world should continue acting as if it will. That, they say, is the best way to guard against a pandemic. \u001d  \"The virus has not mutated. We aren't any closer to reaching a pandemic stage than we were before,\" says Dida Connor, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization in Vietnam. \"If you ask me are we worried, my response would be: This time last year, the virus began to move out of Asia into Europe. The question is, Will it happen again? We don't know. But it would be foolish to bet against it.\" \u001d  The number of human cases of virulent bird flu has typically spiked around this time of year. In 2004, for instance, there was a clear surge in January, according to an analysis done by the WHO. In 2005 and 2006, the highest numbers of cases were recorded in March. \u001d  Influenza in general is seasonal, in that the virus seems to thrive during the colder months of the year. That explanation for the increase in flu cases, however, has limits. Indonesia, for instance, is on the equator and doesn't experience sharply defined seasons. \u001d  Some public-health officials worry that without continuing fear of a potential catastrophe, farmers, governments and health officials themselves may become lax about such protective measures as screening sick patients for the virus or testing poultry flocks. China recently reported its first human case of the disease in nearly six months, but not until weeks after the farmer fell ill, raising questions about why it took so long to diagnose the disease. \u001d  \"There is some evidence that some of these countries have been successful a bit with control over the virus. But it is not to say that the virus is not there,\" says Henk Bekedam, the WHO's chief representative in China, adding that health authorities there have done a good job of reporting human cases. \"This virus is definitely still circulating in a country like China, where it has been very well established for quite some time.\" \u001d  For its part, Indonesia seems to be making little progress in preventing bird-flu deaths. At least 61 people there have died of bird flu since 2005, the highest death count of any country. \u001d  Laurie Gleeson, the regional manager for the Food and Agriculture Organization's avian influenza programs in Asia, says the prevalence of the virus in Indonesia is alarming, and highlights the failure to implement a program of mass cullings, vaccinations and market closures like those organized by authorities in Thailand and Vietnam. \"The kind of disease-control measures that have been applied in other countries have not been applied in Indonesia,\" Mr. Gleeson says. \u001d  An Indonesian government minister told the Associated Press yesterday that the country would soon ban the raising of noncommercial fowl in residential areas in order to prevent the spread of the disease -- a bold move in a country where backyard poultry are commonplace. \u001d  On other fronts, progress has clearly been made in preparing for a pandemic. The surge in attention in the news media prompted some health officials to begin tracking the disease closely. Hong Kong, for instance, has meticulously been testing and reporting cases of infected wild birds. (There were 17 in 2006, ranging from an oriental magpie robin to a peregrine falcon.) \u001d  Steady progress is being made on a vaccine. And the Swiss drug manufacturer Roche Holding AG, which makes the antiviral oseltamivir -- marketed as Tamiflu and used to treat bird flu patients -- produced around 190 million courses of the drug last year and could now produce 400 million doses a year, according to David Reddy, the leader of Roche's influenza team. That compares with the average of eight million doses the company was making annually between 1999 and 2003. \u001d  In addition, Roche, after public pressure, granted licenses to drug makers in India and China, allowing them to make the drug as well. Dozens of countries now have sizable stockpiles. \u001d  Despite record production numbers, Roche recently has seen demand taper off somewhat. \"Orders are coming in, but they are slower than they were,\" says Dr. Reddy. He declined to provide more specific details about the sales figures. \u001d  There is still no sign that the virus has reached the U.S. bird population. \"I can't tell you when avian influenza is going to arrive in the Western Hemisphere,\" says David Nabarro, who heads up the U.N.'s work on avian influenza. \u001d  Indeed, the biggest challenge may be learning how to communicate the risks of a disease whose danger is still largely hypothetical. Public-health experts are eager to warn people of a threat they think is real, but wary of hyping one disease at the expense of taking attention from other diseases, such as AIDS and malaria, that already kill millions of people each year. \u001d  \"While the virus may have disappeared from the headlines for a few months, we have tried to make it clear that it never left the environment in affected countries,\" says Peter Cordingley, the spokesman in Manila for the World Health Organization's Western Pacific region. \"We have tried to pitch our message to keep awareness high while not adding to the signs we saw of avian-influenza fatigue. It's been a balancing act.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  Tom Wright in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 16:31 ET (21:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1d509d4d055f32c94b7d3ed8fe18c70c","symR":["GOL","GOLL4.BR","BRGOLLACNPR4"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": GOL Commemorates Sixth Anniversary as One of World's Leading Low Cost Carriers","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T11:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GOL","GOLL4.BR","BRGOLLACNPR4"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SAO PAULO, Brazil, Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (NYSE: GOL and Bovespa: GOLL4), Brazil's low-cost, low-fare airline, marks its sixth anniversary of operations today.  The Company, which took on the unprecedented responsibility of popularizing air transportation in Brazil and South America, celebrates this anniversary with some of the best numbers in the history of Brazilian aviation.  Over the last six years, GOL transported 55 million passengers; including five million first time flyers. GOL's current fleet of 65 aircraft operates over 600 daily flights to 55 destinations, including seven international routes to five countries in South America.  In December 2006, GOL had domestic and international Brazilian market shares of 37.1 percent and 13.3 percent, respectively.  The Company's average load factor in 2006 was 74%, the highest in the industry, and GOL has been the most punctual airline in Brazil for over 18 months. \b \u001d  The \"GOL Effect\" has been evident in Brazil's passenger transportation market over the last six years:  average domestic fares have been reduced by over 25% -- providing low-cost air travel for more Brazilian consumers; average load factors on domestic flights are at their highest levels ever (above 70%); and the number of first-time flyers increases year after year. \b \u001d  GOL's international expansion is one of highlights of its sixth anniversary, as the Company is one of the fastest growing \"international\" airlines.  In 2006 alone, GOL increased its operating capacity on South American international routes by over 150 percent.  In 2004, Argentina was the Company's first international destination; strong demand allowed GOL to expand its services to a total of three Argentinean cities: Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Rosario.  Based on the success of these routes, the Company increased the number of international destinations: in 2005, GOL began flights to Bolivia and, in 2006, the Company started service to Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.  In February of this year, GOL will begin operations to Peru and has plans to further increase it operations in Latin America with a new route to Mexico later this year. \b \b    About GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes \b \u001d  GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes is one of the most profitable and fastest growing low-cost, low-fare airlines in the industry worldwide.

The real action begins Tuesday, when the trading week shortened by a holiday starts and investors hear from Intel which is expected to earn 25 cents per share. \u001d  Among key data releases, Tuesday has the New York Fed's manufacturing survey for January. \u001d  Wednesday brings the U.S. Fed's beige book, which summarizes regional economic activity across the country. Release of the report precedes the central bank's first meeting of the year at the end of the month. \u001d  Also due is the Labor Department's December Producer Price Index and the Fed's report on industrial production and capacity utilization for December. \u001d  On Thursday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke testifies before the Senate Budget Committee on the long-term fiscal challenges facing the United States. \"Bernanke is typically more dovish in testimonies before Congress,\" said Lehman Brothers economist Drew Matis. \u001d  Thursday is also a big day for economic data, with readings on inflation at the consumer level. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index as well as the core CPI are due that day. Housing data and the Philadelphia Fed's regional manufacturing are also due. \u001d  FOREX: The dollar, which is inching lower against the euro, ended its three-day rally Friday, largely shrugging off a series of positive data releases. \u001d  While the dollar's rally may have ebbed, analysts say they expect the greenback to post further gains this week as the market focuses on renewed optimism about the state of the U.S. economy. \u001d  BONDS: U.S. Treasurys are under pressure, after having closed lower yet again Friday, placing the benchmark yield near its highest level since late October, following data above forecasts. \u001d  Recent data add credence to the argument that the economy remains strong enough to fuel inflationary pressures and prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates. In addition, signs of economic strength diminish safe-haven interest in Treasurys and cause investors to venture into higher-risk securities. \u001d  \"With December retail sales stronger than expected and import prices rising at the fastest pace since May, evidence is mounting that the economy appears ready to come out of its 2% plus [economic growth] range,\" said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group. \"It also means the Fed will remain disinclined to lower rates.\" \u001d  OIL: Futures, which gained Friday, are likely to remain firm on news OPEC was considering an emergency meeting and a new production cut. \u001d  \"It's imprudent for traders to continue to ride shorts because something bullish could come out,\" said Pete Donovan, vice president at floor brokers Vantage Trading in New York. \"That being said, it still looks like everything is pointing lower.\" \u001d  \"OPEC have lost credibility because they have not adhered to previously pledged output cuts,\" said Tom Bentz, an analyst at brokerage BNP Paribas Futures in New York. \"They need to shock the market to break the bearish mode, and I'm not sure what that would be.\" \b \u001d  ASIAN SUMMARY: Stocks Gain; Japan Machinery Orders Up \bUSD-Yen             120.20       loss  0.16    dn 0.1% \bAUD-USD             0.7858       gain  0.0012  up 0.2% \bNikkei 225          17224.96     gain  167.95  up 1.0% \bHang Seng           19902.90     gain  289.40  up 1.5% \bS&P/ASX 200         5646.70      gain  34.80   up 0.6% \bTaiwan Index        7788.64      gain  26.93   up 0.4% \bS.Korea Kospi       1390.22      gain  1.85    up 0.1% \bSpot gold           $625.40      loss  0.40    dn 0.08% \bBrent Crude Oil     $53.22       gain  0.27    up 0.5% \bJGB 10-year Yield  1.7550% up 0.0100 \b(All values as of 0550 GMT) \u001d  STOCKS: Asian stocks started the week on an upbeat note Monday, with Japan's market leading the region higher as investors pushed up shares of Japan Airlines, Sony and other blue-chip issues following another new high on Wall Street. \u001d   Japanese machinery orders rose a seasonally adjusted 3.8% in November from the previous month, gaining for the second month in a row, government data showed Monday. Economists had expected a 3.3% gain. \u001d  FOREX: The dollar traded in a range of Y120.00 to Y120.65, with both ends very solid, setting up further narrow range trading, dealers said. \u001d  BONDS: Machinery orders above expectations hit Japan's government bonds, adding to speculation that the Bank of Japan will boost its interest rates at this week's meeting. \u001d  METALS: Spot gold was at $625.50/oz, down 40 cents on the New York close but finding some supportive buying off the lows on technical underpinning, dealers said. \u001d  Continuing to struggle with a combination of high prices and inventories creeping higher, LME copper is unlikely to hold above $5,000/ton support, said Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

But that hasn't stopped the Amana funds, and the Episcopalian who runs them, from joining the ranks of the industry's top performers.] \b \u001d  ON AN autumn morning in Bellingham, Wash., an eclectic audience of scholars, bankers and investors gathers in a conference room at Western Washington University. The topic is Islamic finance, and the sponsor is Saturna Capital, a Bellingham company whose Amana mutual funds have invested in accordance with Islamic law since 1989. Outside, the sun bathes the tree-lined campus, and inside, the mood among the conferees is relaxed and collegial -- at least until Mahmoud Amin El-Gamal, the first speaker, starts shaking the foundations of their financial beliefs. \u001d  Some interpretations of Islamic law, or Shariah, impose strict limits on borrowing money and earning  interest, putting America's Muslims at a disadvantage in everything from buying a house to saving for retirement. Many people in this room have designed financial products to try to ease this so-called Cost of Being Muslim. But El-Gamal, a professor of economics and statistics at Rice University, isn't satisfied with their results. By trying to apply Shariah to the complexities of the markets, he argues, these loans and funds wind up being inferior to the products they aim to replace. And when their architects present them as the only legitimate way to invest, they merely compound the problem. They imply that \"you will fry in hell if you use conventional tools,\" says El-Gamal. \"There is something very unseemly about using religion that way.\" \u001d  Such criticism isn't uncommon when mutual funds try to marry religion and investing. But the Amana funds can rebut it in a way that a lot of religious funds can't -- with a remarkable track record. Indeed, while thousands of mutual funds scramble to show even ho-hum returns, Amana Trust Income and Amana Trust Growth have become two of the top-returning funds available, period. They've done so even though they have to shun companies that profit substantially from such industries as alcohol or pork processing, and even those that carry a lot of debt. Together, the rules put almost half of the stocks in the market off-limits. Nonetheless, over the past three years, each fund is the No. 1 performer in its style category, according to fund tracker Morningstar, with the growth fund and income fund posting annualized returns of 20 and 21 percent, respectively, over that span. \u001d  Curiously, the man behind these stellar returns has no Islamic beliefs whatsoever. (One clue: his impressive wine cellar, a no-no for any devout Muslim.) A career portfolio manager, Nicholas Kaiser brings a lot of ingenuity to the table; when Amana launched its funds 18 years ago, for example, Kaiser didn't like the record-keeping software on the market, so he wrote his own. As for matters of faith, Kaiser says that after being raised Episcopalian, he is \"more of a skeptic\" now. \"It's what makes me a good investor.\" \u001d  To be sure, the funds struggle to satisfy some observers, especially Muslims who disagree with how the funds' mission incorporates the principles of the faith. Similar issues surround most religious funds, a small but growing niche these days with $16.4 billion in assets. The funds as a group have slightly underperformed their peers over the past one, three and five years; they often face higher trading and administrative costs than bigger funds, while religious screens rule out many good stocks. \"It's the challenge of having one hand tied behind your back,\" says Morning-star analyst David Kathman. But in Amana's case, he adds, at least some religious values coincide with smart investing. \b \u001d  SATURNA CAPITAL occupies a small, gray building across the street from the food co-op in the center of Bellingham. Here, only the subtlest clues signal that the company differs from its secular peers. The receptionist's desk looks like every other receptionist's desk in America, but the woman behind it is reading a guide to Islamic investing. Seemingly unfurnished spaces double as rooms where observant employees adjourn for prayers -- the paper kneeling mats are a tip-off. And in a frame above the door in Kaiser's office is a line of Arabic text. \"It says buy low, sell high,\" Kaiser explains, very seriously. Then he laughs. \"Actually, I have no idea what it says.\" Only later does a visitor learn that it's a quote from the Koran. \u001d  Yaqub Mirza, a physicist and prominent figure in the U.S. Muslim community, got the idea for the Amana funds while he was running an Islamic investing club in the 1980s. Mirza recruited Kaiser, who had proved himself as a capable value investor while running the Unified Management fund family.  Kaiser embraced the opportunity, but he insists that the Islamic angle has little impact on his thinking: \"I manage the portfolio -- this is a business.\" While Kaiser takes care of the stock picking, Monem Salam focuses on religious compatibility. Salam, whose family moved to America from Pakistan when he was nine, used to manage money for wealthy Muslim clients of Morgan Stanley. He still plays that role at Saturna, but he also consults with clerics and members of the funds' board to figure out which companies are off-limits. \u001d  Amana's recent success isn't due exclusively to religion; for example, the funds have outperformed the Dow Jones Islamic fund, which also uses Islamic screens, by at least eight percentage points a year over the past five years. Once the list of candidates is whittled down, Kaiser digs into the stock picking, and in recent years he has deftly spotted some market darlings. Once, on a ski lift at Whistler, B.C., he overheard a woman saying that her daughter had paid $3 for a head of organic lettuce. Kaiser already liked organic stores because their margins are higher than those of traditional grocers. Eventually, he bought Whole Foods for around $16; when he sold it three years later, it had soared into the $40s. Kaiser was also quick to recognize the user-friendly appeal of Apple computers, installing them in Amana's offices. He started buying Apple in 2000 at $25, and now, trading north of $90, it's his growth fund's largest holding. Kaiser is a buy-and-hold investor, and it's just as well: Under Islamic law, frequent trading is seen as a form of gambling. Not surprisingly, Amana funds give up little of their returns  to taxes and trading costs. At the growth fund portfolio, turnover, a measure of how frequently the funds buy and sell stocks, hovers at an amazingly low 5 percent. \u001d  At least one of the fund's religious principles, the Islamic aversion to debt, translates into sound investing sense. \"We buy companies that don't have a lot of debt,\" Salam says. \"Warren Buffett does that.\" The Amana screen's limit on debt -- it can equal no more than 33 percent of a company's market value -- has also saved the funds from some painful losses. After all, Kaiser is a manager who sold Enron for a profit. \"They piled on the debt before they piled on the lies,\" he says. Amana also sold AOL right after the Time Warner merger. \"We had a lot of calls from shareholders concerned about the Internet and pornography,\" says Kaiser, \"and I had to tell them: 'No, actually, the debt is the problem.'\" That transaction wasn't nearly as painful as selling Target a few years ago. The retailer's fundamentals still looked great-but the stores started selling wine. \u001d  According to the Koran, loans are charity that will be repaid in the afterlife. That's why Amana funds avoid companies for whom interest is a primary source of earnings, a principle that rules out investing in conventional financial companies. This ban has hurt Amana in the past. In the years 1996 through 1998, when financial firms rallied, the Amana funds trailed the market by double digits. Kaiser acknowledges that markets are cyclical and down years could easily happen again-that's the drawback of a system that screens out an entire sector of the economy for religious reasons. \b \u001d  ON A RECENT Friday at weekly prayers, Muzammil Siddiqi, an expert on the interpretation of Shariah for American Muslims, spoke with Saturna employees and board members about intention and action. \"If you conduct your business with the right intentions,\" Siddiqi tells the group, \"it is an act of worship.\" But later he warns the audience to avoid \"the gray.\" \"Boundaries,\" he says, \"are where you can break the rules.\" \u001d  Amana does sometimes go gray when it comes to \"sin stocks.\" For example, its screen filters out companies that derive more than 5 percent of revenue from businesses like pornography or pork processing. But if pork is haram -- forbidden -- then why is it acceptable to invest in a company that makes any money from hot dogs or ham sandwiches? Salam explains that Islam allows some minor involvement with something impermissible, as long as the greater objective -- in this case, saving for the future -- is worthy and necessary. \"It is definitely not okay to sin a little bit,\" says Salam. \"But if it can avoid a much bigger sin later, then shouldn't we allow it?\" \u001d  Not all faith-based fund managers agree. The Catholic-oriented Ave Maria funds advocate an all-or-nothing stance; for example, they can't invest in companies that derive any revenue from providing abortions. Still, even such absolute bans can lead investors into murky areas. Manager George Schwartz admits that if he were considering buying a company that makes bar-code labels, he wouldn't drill down to find out if any labels were earmarked for bottles containing  RU-486, the so-called abortion pill. \"You wouldn't be able to live your life,\" he protests. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 06:02 ET (11:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1f931861dee66a02697a2c533d7b4e65","symR":["SAP","SAP.XE","DE0007164600"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Brookshire Grocery Company Stocks Up on SAP","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SAP","SAP.XE","DE0007164600"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDAX","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSTX"],"Story":"Leading Operator of Regional Supermarkets Selects SAP(R) for Retail to Build Upon Existing SAP(R) Solutions and Continue Its Tradition of Inspired Customer Service \b \b \u001d  NEW YORK, Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Demonstrating its ongoing success in the retail industry, SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) today announced that Brookshire Grocery Company has selected SAP for Retail solutions to complement the financials and human resources applications from SAP that the company is successfully running.

These studies are part of a programme to generate data for the future expansion of the use of Sativex in Europe beyond Multiple Sclerosis (MS) into other pain conditions. \u001d  The results of the study in patients with neuropathic pain characterised by allodynia show that patients taking Sativex obtain clinically important improvements in their management of pain and quality of sleep. In comparison with placebo, statistically significant improvements were seen for key outcome measures, including a positive result in the primary analysis of patient response, the outcome measure recommended by regulatory authorities. \u001d  The results of the study in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy show that patients taking Sativex obtained substantial improvements in their pain, indeed among the highest level of response seen in the published literature. There was an abnormally large placebo response in this study, which means that the data are more difficult to interpret categorically. \u001d  These two studies form part of a programme of neuropathic pain trials conducted to date by GW and reinforce the large body of positive data already generated. These data contribute significantly to a future regulatory filing in the use of Sativex as a treatment for neuropathic pain. GW intends to continue to add to this evidence base. \u001d  This multi-centre double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel group study in 246 patients examined the effect of Sativex in patients with neuropathic pain characterised by allodynia. Allodynia is the occurrence of pain in response to a normally non-painful stimulus (e.g. clothes touching against the skin). It is often intense and can occur in patients suffering from a range of conditions that damage the peripheral nerves (e.g. nerve lesions, post-herpetic neuralgia). Patients in this study were being treated with a range of currently available analgesics, which were maintained during the course of the study. \u001d  The results of this study confirm the efficacy of Sativex. The responder analysis of the primary endpoint (the proportion of patients obtaining a clinically meaningful improvement in pain relief), was statistically significantly in favour of Sativex (p=0.03) for the full Intention to Treat (ITT) population. In addition, two of the key pain-related secondary efficacy endpoints, the Patient's Global Impression of Change (p<0.03) and the assessment of sleep quality (p<0.01), were also statistically significantly in favour of Sativex. All the other secondary efficacy endpoints were in favour of Sativex. \u001d  European and U.S. regulators recommend a responder analysis of the primary endpoint in pain studies as the key assessment of outcome. This analysis was positive and confirms that Sativex produces a clinically important benefit over and above currently available treatments in a meaningful proportion of otherwise treatment-resistant patients. An additional analysis of the mean endpoint data was strongly in favour of Sativex and approached statistical significance. \u001d  The multi-centre double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel group study in 297 patients examined the effect of Sativex in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. Patients in this study were being treated with a range of currently available analgesics, which were maintained during the course of the study. \u001d  In this study, patients taking Sativex showed a 30% mean improvement in pain scores, among the highest level of response seen in the published literature. One third of Sativex patients achieved over a 50% improvement in pain. However, the study results are difficult to interpret due to an abnormally large response in the placebo group. As such, although all outcome measures compared to placebo are in favour of Sativex, they do not reach statistical significance. \u001d  With regard to safety, the pattern of adverse events in both studies was similar to that seen in other Sativex studies. \u001d  Peripheral neuropathic pain forms part of a regulatory strategy to obtain approvals for Sativex across major markets in a range of indications, including MS symptoms, central neuropathic pain and cancer pain. Sativex is the subject of an ongoing regulatory application in four selected European countries for the symptomatic relief of spasticity in MS. \u001d  Upon initial approval, it is intended to extend the MS spasticity indication into other European countries through the mutual recognition procedure. Since the rules do not permit a parallel regulatory application in neuropathic pain, GW's regulatory strategy for this indication is to continue to build the clinical evidence base whilst the MS spasticity regulatory process is ongoing. \u001d  Hence, additional confirmatory trials have been under preparation for some months and ethics committee approvals obtained. With the benefit of Monday's results, the designs of the additional studies can be finalised prior to their commencement. These studies will further contribute to a future regulatory submission in neuropathic pain. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 02:33 ET (07:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"20b0ee4bca897de61f4926ba1daf6918","symR":["X.T","CA8730281042"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": TSX Group To Host Media Briefing To Discuss Technology Initiatives>X.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T15:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["X.T","CA8730281042"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\bTORONTO, Jan. 15 /CNW/ - Speed and capacity are key elements of an efficient trading environment.

A final report on the issue is due to be published on January 31. \u001d  Separately, the commission is pursuing a probe into MasterCard Inc.'s (MA) fee system. \u001d  When a shopper uses a payment card, the retailer's bank pays a fee to the bank that issued the shopper's card to cover the costs of the transaction. These fees are set by card companies such as Visa and MasterCard and are passed on to the retailer. \u001d  If the fees were banned, the companies say prices to use payment cards would rise and discourage the use of payment cards. \u001d  \"If you take away that rebalancing payment (interchange fees), the (card-)issuing bank is going to look somewhere else for that revenue, and guess where it's going to look? The consumer,\" said Peter Ayliffe, president and chief executive of Visa Europe, which is fully owned and controlled by more than 4,500 European banks. \"We need, once and for all, the recognition that interchange is essential to the successful management of a payment system.\" \u001d  American Express Co. (AXP) and Diners Club International set no interchange fees because they act as both the card-issuing and the retailers' bank for all of their transactions. \u001d  Without interchange fees, Visa's Ayliffe said, the only beneficiaries would be companies like American Express and Diners Club. \u001d  The Visa president warned that these systems are even less transparent than those of Visa and MasterCard since the retailers' and the card-issuing banks are one. He warned this system leads to higher charges for retailers and consumers. \u001d  In response to Ayliffe's comments, American Express spokesman James Tobin said \"our fees are absolutely transparent to the merchants who accept our card and to the consumers who carry our cards. They know exactly what they're paying and what they're paying for.\"   A London-based spokesman for Diners' Club Europe, which is a franchise of New York City-based Citigroup (C), declined immediate comment. \u001d  The commission says it may well ban the fees altogether. \u001d  \"It is legally possible for the commission to require that the system be abolished if it's in violation of E.U. competition rules,\" said E.U. antitrust spokesman spokesman Jonathan Todd. \u001d  Another potential scenario is for regulators to allow interchange fees but rule that only banks may set the fees, analysts say. MasterCard and Visa have said this is unacceptable. Only by letting payment card companies set the fees themselves can they ensure that the fees are neither too low - which discourages banks from issuing their brand of cards - nor too high, which they say discourages retailers from accepting their brand of card, Ayliffe said. \u001d  Visa reached an agreement with the E.U. in 2002 to lower its fees and to base them solely on certain costs set by the commission. Ayliffe said this system would work well if only MasterCard and others were subject to the same conditions. \u001d  Shortly after the E.U. issues its report at the end of this month, the commission is expected to rule on the separate investigation into MasterCard's interchange fees. The commission has complained that MasterCard restricts competition between banks by setting interchange fees. MasterCard couldn't be reached for comment immediately. \b \u001d  -By Anne Jolis Dow Jones Newswires; +32 2 741 1488; anne.jolis@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 14:00 ET (19:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"218a76dd47aa83e1b121edcf65670338","symR":["TMO"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Thermo Fisher Scientific Strengthens Sales Channel and Life Sciences Portfolio With the Addition of Spectronex and Flux Instruments","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TMO"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  WALTHAM, Mass., Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

The offer price of NOK 96 consists of NOK 80 cash and NOK 16 shares in ARRIS, a US NASDAQ listed company, although ARRIS can increase the cash portion of the offer at its discretion.  The aggregate purchase is expected to be $1,214 M at current exchange rates.  The transaction is expected to be completed in Q2 2007 and is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals, as well as, to ARRIS receiving valid and unconditional acceptances of the offer from shareholders representing more than 90% of the shares. \b \u001d  After diligent, thorough review, the Board of Directors of TANDBERG Television unanimously recommends the shareholders accept the ARRIS offer. \"The on-going industry consolidation amongst our key customer base creates a demand for companies that can offer an increasing scale and scope of supply on a global basis.  The combination of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television clearly creates that market leading supplier of voice, video and data solutions. Further, the NOK 96 offer price represents a substantial premium of 47% to TANDBERG Television's 90 trading day average share price,\" says Jan Christian Opsahl, Chairman of TANDBERG Television. \b \u001d  Combining the resources and experience of ARRIS and TANDBERG Television will produce a new company, unique in its ability to enable voice, video and data over any network and to any device. ARRIS is a leading global provider of VoIP, (voice over IP) data broadband network equipment and consumer premises devices; TANDBERG Television leads the digital video sector with more than 25% share of the global video processing market and award-winning solutions for advanced compression, on-demand and interactive television. \b \u001d  ARRIS and TANDBERG Television have a strong shared philosophy of innovation and track-records of profitable growth.

As this is a slow and costly process, the current close-spaced, shallow drill program is a cost effective way to analyze the variability of gold grades and to determine optimal drilling patterns for future resource calculations. The holes, which will be limited to a depth of 51 feet, will also permit Freegold to identify new veins, structures and gold mineralization both close to known sample locations, and in new areas between previous trenches and along possible strike length extensions \b \u001d  Phase 1 will consist of 5,000 feet of drilling in approximately 100 shallow holes. These holes will test an area from the northern most mineralization of the Cleary Hill structure through to the final known veins structure in the Southern Vein Swarm. Three lines of holes spaced 15 feet apart with the drill holes in each line of the fence spaced 20 feet apart should allow two intercepts to be obtained on a 65-degree south-dipping vein, such as the Cleary Hill, using 51-foot hole depths. Because the mineralization found at surface is known from mine workings and drill hole intercepts to persist to depths of at least 400 feet, Freegold management believes this shallow drilling will provide a snapshot of the mineralization that will be found deeper in the system. \b \u001d  Drilling under this multi-phase program may extend to 25,000 feet in 490 holes to test the mineralization with additional fences at various locations along its strike length. Drill hole spacing may be changed in subsequent phases following the evaluation of each phase in order to ultimately arrive at optimal drill hole spacing for future resource-oriented drilling. \b \u001d  Drilling is being conducted with an Ingersol-Rand conventional percussion drill. Cuttings are returned up the drill hole with the use of an OEM vacuum drill cuttings collector, and are dropped from a cyclone directly into a sample bag. Samples are collected every three feet, with the drill bit being pulled off the bottom and the hole cleaned at the completion of each sample interval. Down hole inspections following completion has shown holes to be straight sided with no evidence of raveling or caving to the bottom of the holes. Clean drill hole bottoms are clearly visible with the aid of a flashlight. Freegold maintains a geologist and sampler at the drill rig for all drilling to take and log all samples to insure that QA / QC is in accordance with 43-101 requirements. \b \u001d  Alaska Assay Laboratories in Fairbanks, Alaska and ALS Chemex Labs in North Vancouver, BC were used to analyse for gold via fire assay analysis plus multi element ICP-AES and ICP-MS analysis using 4 acid digestion for the 2006 sampled material. Alaska Assay Labs will be used to analyse the drill cuttings for gold via fire assay from the 2007 drill program. Only samples from the centre line of each three row drill fence will be submitted for multi-element analysis. \b \u001d  The Qualified Person for this release is Michael P. Gross, M.S., P.

Freegold holds a 100% lease interest in the Almaden gold project in Idaho. This large tonnage, disseminated, epithermal gold deposit was the subject of a feasibility study in 1997 calling for the development of a 95,000 oz/year open pit, heap leach mine. Freegold is currently in the midst of a 34,000-foot drilling program aimed at further expanding the size of the resource prior to updating the feasibility study in 2007.

The company reported 105,000 net additions in the fourth quarter, a 50% increase from the same period a year before. \u001d  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter stood at EUR127 million, up 31% from a year earlier. \u001d  Analysts expected revenue of EUR360 million in the fourth quarter, with EBITDA at EUR126 million. \u001d  Since it expanded its network to cover most of Italy, Fastweb has aggressively competed with former telecommunication monopoly Telecom Italia SpA (TI). \u001d  Fastweb aims to add mobile phone services to the Internet, phone and on-demand media content it already provides. \u001d  The company said it generated positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter for the first time since it started operating in 2000. \u001d  \"Strong capex efficiency contributed to this result,\" it said in a statement, adding that overall investments were below EUR530 million in 2006. \u001d   For the full year 2006, Fastweb said revenue stood at EUR1.26 billion, up 30% from a year before, in line with the growth target set for 2006. \u001d   Full-ear EBITDA rose 39% to EUR424 million, slightly lower than the 40% target set by Fastweb's management. \u001d  Fastweb's shares opened up more than 1% after results were released, but fell back slightly in later trading. \u001d  At 0930 GMT they were trading up EUR0.35, or 0.8%, to EUR46.25 \u001d  \"The good news is that fourth-quarter net additions were strong and slightly above forecasts. But the EBITDA growth fell short of the company's target for the year,\" said Oriana Cardani, analyst with Rasbank in Milan. \u001d  Fastweb recently signed a commercial agreement with U.K.'s Vodafone (VOD), under which Vodafone Italia clients will be able to use their mobile phones from home at fixed-line rates and use a high-speed ADSL modem to access Fastweb's broadband network. \u001d  The company also reached a content deal with News Corp.'s (NWS) Italian satellite broadcaster Sky Italia to distribute Sky's content on Fastweb's IPTV television platform. \u001d  Shares in Fastweb have been boosted in recent weeks by press reports of a possible interest by three large private equity funds for a 25% stake that Fastweb chairman and founder Silvio Scaglia is expected to sell. \u001d  Analysts note that M&A speculation and high dividend yield should continue to support the stock at current levels. \u001d  -By Giada Zampano, Dow Jones Newswires; +39-02-5821 9901; giada.zampano@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 04:39 ET (09:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"24aba78b0fbffd7fcecefa529d9dc99c","symR":["HTV"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Hearst-Argyle Television to Debut Series of Primetime Specials With Carlos Watson","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T19:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HTV"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  NEW YORK, Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Hearst-Argyle Television, Inc.

(WFT.T) to market perform and C$50, respectively, to reflect a drop in the Canadian dollar, higher forecast lumber prices and the inexpensive acquisition of 13 lumber mills from International Paper Co. (IP). \u001d  BMO had rated the Vancouver forest-products company underperform, with a C$36 target price. \u001d  West Fraser shares are trading at C$44.98 in Toronto Monday, up 0.3%. \u001d  Analyst Stephen Atkinson said in a research report that he estimates a fourth-quarter share loss of 34 Canadian cents, compared to the First Call mean estimate of a loss of 3 Canadian cents. West Fraser reported a third-quarter loss of 18 Canadian cents a share. The drop is primarily due to lower lumber prices. \u001d  Atkinson also cut his estimate for 2007 share earnings to 66 Canadian cents from 88 Canadian cents, and his 2008 estimate to 78 Canadian cents a share from C$1.46. \u001d  He noted that West Fraser stock is expensive but that the company has more than 10% higher margin in lumber than its major competitor, Canfor Corp. (CFP.T). \u001d  Atkinson said the sector has rallied on the decline of the Canadian dollar rather than on improving fundamentals. West Fraser has relatively low-cost assets, a good balance sheet and potential for growth, he added. \u001d  Atkinson doesn't own any shares in West Fraser, but BMO or an affiliate received compensation for products or services other then investment-banking services within the past 12 months. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.westfraser.com \b \u001d  -Wendy Tsau; 416-306-2100; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 13:28 ET (18:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2600bb322106be90d4d477a316fbd75b","symR":["AES","US00130H1059"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Venezuela Will Allow Minority Shareholders In EDC Pwr Co-Min","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T16:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AES","US00130H1059"],"IndustryCodes":["DRL","ELC","OIE","OIS","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 11:38 ET (16:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"26121626e34b1dcea27ce81e2b244630","symR":["MRU.A.T","CA59162N1096"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Regroupement Des Marchands Actionnaires Discontinues Proceedings Vs Pierre H.

On Aug. 2, the company was placed in a \"safeguard\" proceeding by the French commercial court in Paris, a process similar to Chapter 11 in the U.S. \u001d  Gounon came up with a plan, approved by most of the company's creditors, to nearly halve its debt and give creditors an 87% stake in the company. He told journalists he hoped to remain CEO of the emerging company. \u001d  The Paris court approved the plan, despite opposition from certain creditors. \u001d  After the accounts are published, Eurotunnel's shares, which have been suspended since May 2006, will begin trading again. \u001d  The court gave Eurotunnel 37 months to implement its plan fully. After the publication of its results, Eurotunnel plans to then issue a prospectus for an exchange offer into shares of its new company, Groupe Eurotunnel SA, and the offer is expected to be launched in early March. The offer is expected to remain open for three to four weeks, until the end of March. \u001d  The new Groupe Eurotunnel is then expected to start trading in France and the U.K. \u001d  Through this process, existing shareholders could see their holdings diluted by 87%. As part of its restructuring, Eurotunnel will issue a GBP1.275 billion convertible bond given to creditors in exchange for their debt claims, and convertible into new shares. \u001d  Eurotunnel is still considering using the proceeds of a possible rights issue post-restructuring to limit dilution to 50% during the next three years, but Gounon said it would depend on the performance of the company post-restructuring whether they would raise new capital for this purpose. \u001d  Eurotunnel needs to get at least 60% of its shareholders tendering their shares for the restructuring to be successful. It is unclear how much support he has so far but Gounon said on a conference call later Monday that he had the full and strong support of a U.K. shareholder committee. \u001d  If the 60% threshold is not met, he said the matter would have to be brought back before the courts. \u001d  In a press conference following the court's decision, Gounon appealed to shareholders to support the plan. \"The court has made its decision, the Safeguard plan has been validated, it is the best solution for Eurotunnel,\" he said, reminding shareholders, some of whom spoke out during the public session, that they would lose everything if the company went bankrupt. \u001d  Gounon said that any opposition or delay to the implementation of the plan would cost the company dearly and that shareholders contesting the plan were only shooting themselves in the foot. \u001d  \"Eurotunnel welcomes with great satisfaction this immediately enforceable decision, which lifts the shackles of its debt, preserves the integrity of the concession and allows it to look to the future with confidence,\" the company said in a statement Monday. \"This decision is good for the company, its 2,300 employees and its shareholders.\" \u001d  The president of the commercial court handing down her decision to approve the proposed restructuring, Perrette Rey, said the plan was immediately enforceable for all 17 companies, despite the ongoing and various legal opposition to the plan from certain creditors. \u001d  Rey named Valerie LeLoup Thomas and Laurent LeGuerneve as executors of the plan. She noted that the Safeguard proceeding and plan had been completed in record time despite the difficulties surrounding the case. \u001d  She rejected the 33 filings by various creditors of Eurotunnel to the Paris court's jurisdiction of all of Eurotunnel's 17 companies. \u001d  She mentioned senior lenders such as bond insurer MBIA Inc. (MBI), which has the largest debt claim against Eurotunnel and supported Eurotunnel's debt restructuring proposal; Franklin Mutual Advisers and the European Investment Bank, among others, as having filed the claims and said they would be subject to pay EUR10,000 as a penalty for each of the 33 claims lodged and rejected. \u001d  Monday's decision to approve the plan and reject opposition to the court's jurisdiction had been expected by dissenting creditors but legal challenges can remain ongoing in the U.K and creditors could appeal to higher courts in France. \u001d  However, creditors, such as Franklin Mutual Advisers and Oaktree Capital Management, who believe the plan doesn't adequately compensate them, have until Wednesday to drop any litigation against the company if they want to share up to GBP80 million in fees payable to creditors that participate in underwriting the convertible bond. If they decide to pursue various legal objections they have filed with both French and U.K courts, this could result in a potential windfall for other holders of so-called Tier Three debt who will have the opportunity of underwriting the convertible. \u001d  Creditors will have 15 days from Monday to decide whether to opt for cash or equity in the new company. \u001d  Gounon confirmed he had recently been in contact with the U.K. government about Eurotunnel's restructuring plans.  Although the emerging company will be a French company, the concession, which is governed by the Treaty of Canterbury and signed by both French and U.K. governments, will be untouched by the restructuring, remain listed in London and Paris, retaining its Anglo-French characteristic. \u001d  He also highlighted plans to create EUR450 million in value for the company by eradicating distortions in competition and said the company had won state funding for scanning equipment of freight by customs, which until now Eurotunnel had been funding. The subsidy is worth EUR1.4 million to Eurotunnel. Gounon said the company had been guilty of not being vigilant enough against distortions in competition and would put in place a group to monitor this alone. \u001d  -By Anousha Sakoui, Dow Jones Newswires; 44 20 7842 9318; anousha.sakoui@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:48 ET (12:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2637725bcdfa4581ec6d97ce75ade745","symR":["UKDAY"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"London AM Gold Fixing $628.25 (Prev.

The interim dividend for 2006 amounted to EUR 0.15 per ordinary share. \b \b   April 19, 2007: General Meeting of Shareholders \b \u001d  The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will be held on April 19, 2007 in Venlo.

For those who would rather not squint at miniaturized movies, there is the Archos 604. Part of a growing niche of portable devices designed specifically to store and play video, the 604 features a gorgeous 4.3-inch LCD screen with DVD-level resolution. With 30 gigabytes of hard disk space, the 604 can hold about 120 hours of video. You can transfer video files to the player from your PC through a USB cable or use a special docking station (sold separately for $100) to record video directly from a TV or DVD player. The 604 also plays music, stores photos and records audio.

The group, evolving at Lilly for more than seven years, will produce innovative medicines for dogs and cats under the Lilly brand name. \b \u001d  Lilly made the announcement Sunday at the North American Veterinary Conference in Orlando, Fla., just before the inaugural Lilly Lectureship address by noted anthropologist and author Elizabeth Marshall Thomas. The 130-year-old pharmaceutical company concurrently announced a $250,000 endowment to the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at the Purdue University School of Veterinary Medicine to fund an annual lecture series to support veterinarians' understanding of physiological, psychological and sociological aspects of the human-pet bond. \b \u001d  \"Veterinarians are essential allies to the millions of us who experience the human-animal bond,\" Thomas said during her lecture. \"From the very dawn of time until now and well into the future ... human-animal companionship is at the very core of our instincts not only for mutual survival, but mutually rewarding relationships.\" Thomas' 2006 book The Old Way: A Story of the First People addresses how the skills and customs of early hunter-gatherer humans share much in common with the survival tactics of animals. \b \u001d  In announcing the gift, Eric Graves, director, companion animal health, said it is no coincidence that the company's first announcement focuses on support for the veterinary profession and increasing appreciation of the human-pet bond. \b \u001d  \"Supporting the role of veterinarians and enabling them to help pets is at the heart of everything Lilly will do,\" Graves said. \"We intend to become one of companion animal veterinarians' most trusted and valued partners.\" \b \u001d  Much of that value lies in the rich library of the company's proprietary molecules, which Lilly scientists have been evaluating for pet use over the last seven years, according to Stephen Connell, D.V.M., manager of technical, academic and consumer services. Companion animal veterinarians also will value the company's emphasis on technical and case management support and its commitment to be a trustworthy and reliable business partner. Elanco Animal Health, the Lilly food animal division, has served livestock veterinary practitioners with distinction since 1954, he added. \b \b                         \"Answers That Matter\" \b \u001d  Lilly is applying the same \"Answers that Matter\" philosophy to its companion animal products as it has to delivering breakthrough medicines and medical expertise to fulfill unmet needs in human medicine. \b \u001d  \"We appreciate that the companion animal sector is a dynamic marketplace, and our value to the profession will be measured by the performance of our products and our people,\" said Graves, noting that the company's first product introductions are expected within the year, pending approval by the FDA. These medicines will address serious conditions that negatively affect both pet health and the human-pet bond. \b \u001d  \"Lilly has an outstanding legacy of success in the fields of human health and food animal care,\" Alan Beck, Sc.D., director of the Center for the Human-Animal Bond, told veterinarians in introducing the 2007 Lilly Lectureship. \"The human-pet bond and pets as a whole now will benefit from Lilly's proven innovation and support for pet health care professionals.\" \b \b            \"The bond\" extends beyond the pet and its owner \b \u001d  \"Lilly respects the relationships veterinarians have with both their clients and their patients. We join veterinarians as partners and will empower them with a family of innovative products and supportive people all focused on improving pet health and enhancing the human-pet bond,\" Graves concluded. \b \u001d  Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing portfolio of first-in-class and best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with eminent scientific organizations. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind., Lilly provides answers - through medicines and information - for some of the world's most urgent medical needs. Additional information about Lilly is available at www.lilly.com; about Lilly companion animal health at www.lillypet.com; and about Elanco at www.elanco.com. \b \b   About the Center for the Human-Animal Bond \b \u001d  Founded in 1982, the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at the Purdue University School of Veterinary Medicine explores the dynamic relationships between people, animals and their environment. The major objective of the Center is to foster interdisciplinary activities and serve as a focal point for the exchange of ideas and development of new information related to animal-human interactions and animal welfare.

Settlement of \b        the Offer is expected to begin approximately a week after the end of \b        the acceptance period. \b \b    Background and Reasons for the Offer \b \u001d  AOL has substantial experience in the e-commerce and internet advertising industry.  A key part of AOL's strategy has been to capitalize on the growth in online advertising and e-commerce.  In 2004, AOL acquired Advertising.com, the largest display advertising network in the United States, with a presence in eight European countries.  Advertising.com connects advertisers with online advertising inventory by purchasing this inventory from publishers, and using its proprietary optimization technology to determine the optimal advertising to display on each individual inventory placement.  Advertising.com provides measurable results for advertisers through its display and video networks as well as its search engine management and lead generation services. \b \u001d  Founded in 1999 and public since the completion of its IPO in 2005, TradeDoubler is a European provider of online marketing and sales solutions. AOL believes that a successful combination of Advertising.com and TradeDoubler will capitalize on their complementary positions in the online advertising marketplace.  The combination of Advertising.com and TradeDoubler will provide advertisers with a more comprehensive range of marketing solutions and offer publishers a broad selection of monetization opportunities, both in Europe and in the United States. \b \u001d  In connection with the preparation of the Offer, AOL has conducted limited confirmatory due diligence on TradeDoubler. \b \b    The Offer \b \u001d  AOLS Holdings is offering SEK 215 in cash for each TradeDoubler ordinary share and SEK 1,215 and SEK 39.50 in cash for each TradeDoubler warrant of series 2004/2007 and series 2006/2010, respectively.  Pursuant to an exemption received from the Swedish Securities Council (Ruling 2006:59), the Offer is not being made in respect of any warrants currently held by TradeDoubler or any of its subsidiaries that are not allocated as of the date hereof in respect to employee compensation programs.  Accordingly, the Offer is being extended in respect of (i) 94,391 warrants in the 2004/2007 series and (ii) 867,300 warrants in the 2006/2010 series.  The Offer Price and the prices offered for the warrants are subject to adjustment should TradeDoubler pay any dividend or make any other value transfer (vardeoverforing) prior to the settlement of the Offer. \b \u001d  No commission will be charged to holders of TradeDoubler ordinary shares and warrants in the Offer. \b \u001d  The Offer Price represents a premium of 20% relative to the average volume weighted share prices of the TradeDoubler shares on the SSE for the ninety trading-day period prior to January 15, 2007, and represents a premium of 37% to the TradeDoubler share price on the SSE of SEK 156.50 on the first trading day after TradeDoubler third-quarter earnings were released on October 27, 2006.  In addition, the Offer Price represents a premium of 9% to the closing share price of the TradeDoubler shares on the SSE of SEK 198 on January 12, 2007, the last trading day before the announcement of the Offer. \b \u001d  The total value of the Offer amounts to SEK 6,332 million (based on 28,015,287 ordinary shares outstanding and 94,391 warrants of series 2004/2007 and 867,300 warrants of series 2006/2010 that are allocated in employee compensation programs). \b \u001d  None of Time Warner, AOL or AOLS Holdings currently owns or controls any TradeDoubler ordinary shares or warrants. \b \b    Recommendation from TradeDoubler's Board of Directors \b \u001d  The Board of Directors of TradeDoubler unanimously recommends that holders of all issued and outstanding TradeDoubler ordinary shares and warrants accept the Offer. \b \b    Agreement with TradeDoubler \b \u001d  AOL and TradeDoubler entered into an Offer Agreement on January 14, 2007, pursuant to which AOL has agreed to make the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions described herein.  TradeDoubler has recommended the Offer to the holders of TradeDoubler ordinary shares and warrants.

But Essar Group, which owns the rest of Hutchison Essar, claims a right of first refusal for any sale and has threatened to use various means to block a deal. \u001d  So the potential buyers have been studying the possibility of acquiring Hutchison Whampoa's HTIL shares instead. The Hong Kong company owns 49.8% of HTIL. \u001d  Vodafone offered $16.5 billion for Hutchison Essar during an initial round of nonbinding bids, and a direct purchase remains the Newbury, England-based carrier's preferred strategy, people familiar with the situation say. Reliance, of Mumbai, also bid during the initial round. \u001d  Vodafone and Reliance are considering the option of buying Hutchison Whampoa's controlling stake in HTIL at the request of Hutchison Whampoa, according to one person familiar with the talks. \u001d  A spokesman for Vodafone, which said last month that it was considering the acquisition of a controlling interest in Hutchison Essar, declined to comment. Hutchison Whampoa declined to comment, and a Reliance representative couldn't be reached. \u001d  The interest in the acquisition of Hutchison Essar is intense because the winner will gain control of the fourth-largest cellular-service provider in the world's fastest-growing wireless market. Essar Group, the Indian conglomerate that holds the other 33%, says it has the right to match the initial bids, people familiar with the matter say. Essar Group could go to court or even use its powers as a joint-venture partner to block any buyer's attempts to make business changes, such as bringing in new management, these people say. An Essar Group spokesman declined to comment. \u001d  While buying a stake in HTIL would have the advantage of not involving the Essar Group, such a deal would pose its own complications for Vodafone and Reliance. Buying into the Hong Kong-listed company would bring along businesses they don't necessarily want, such as exposure in other cellular markets, namely Hong Kong and Israel. HTIL also owns some fixed-line assets. \u001d  Another potential hurdle is that Hutchison Whampoa has an agreement with HTIL's other major shareholder, Egypt-based Orascom Telecom Holdings SAE, not to sell its stake until December 2007. \"Then we have a right of first refusal after that,\" says Orascom Chief Financial Officer Aldo Mareuse, who also sits on HTIL's board. Mr. Mareuse said Orascom also is potentially interested in buying HTIL's Hutchison Essar stake but hasn't yet bid. \u001d  In November, before the bidding for Hutchison Essar began, Orascom said it was considering a partial sale of its stake in HTIL, in light of HTIL's rising share price.

(6758.TO) will reach only 75% of its global target for PlayStation 3 sales this fiscal year through March, according to a Nomura report released Monday. \u001d  Nomura cut its target for PS3 game units shipped during the period to 4.5 million from 6 million, citing poor sales over the holiday season in North America. \u001d  The Tokyo-based consumer electronics maker is fighting to keep its position at the top of the video game market against rivals Nintendo Co. (7974.TO) and Microsoft Corp. (MS). The company's rollout of its newest system has been beset by delays and supply shortages, but it has maintained it will sell 6 million units through March. \u001d  Sony said last week it had shipped 1 million consoles in the U.S. in 2006, but it sold only about 470,000 in Japan according to data released by computer game publisher Enterbrain Inc. This put it well below its global goal of 2 million for the year. \u001d  The unit is due to be released in Europe sometime in March. \u001d  In its report Monday, Nomura also cut its PS3 sales forecast for next fiscal year to 10 million from 16 million next fiscal year and to 11 million from 18 million for the following year. \u001d  But Nomura maintained its neutral rating on Sony shares, saying it expected strong large-screen television sales in North America and continued strong performance from the Sony Ericsson cellphone joint venture. \u001d  Sony shares finished trading Monday up 2.5% at Y5,700. \b \b   -By Jay Alabaster, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; jay.alabaster@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Mayuko Ota \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 02:02 ET (07:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"305202ec0ba0841b254c1d218f3a00eb","symR":["GSPBEX.RS","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Putin Hails Belarus Oil Pact As Reasonable Compromise","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GSPBEX.RS","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MOSCOW (AP)--President Vladimir Putin Monday hailed an agreement that ended a bitter oil dispute with neighboring Belarus, saying it meant a reduction in subsidies by Moscow for the ex-Soviet ally. \u001d  Putin said the deal would prompt the Belarussian government to carry out free-market reforms. \u001d  \"Russia will continue to provide direct or indirect support of the Belarussian economy for a long time to come, but its volume will be reduced significantly beginning this year,\" Putin told his Cabinet in televised remarks. \u001d  The spat between the two formerly close allies ended Friday when the countries' prime ministers reached agreement on export duties, transit fees and other disagreements that resulted in Russia shutting off oil to Belarus last Monday, disrupting supplies to Germany, Poland and other European countries. \u001d  The halt added to European fears about Moscow's reliability as an energy supplier - a reputation already damaged by last year's price dispute with Ukraine and temporary shortages of Russian gas to European customers. \u001d  Both disputes and energy price hikes for other ex-Soviet nations have drawn criticism of Russia from Western nations, which have accused Moscow of using its vast mineral wealth as a political weapon. \u001d  Under the agreement reached Friday, the two countries agreed to lower Russian export duty by about 70%. Also, Russia will get the lion's share of profits from refined oil products Belarus makes using Russian oil and then sells to Europe. \u001d  Belarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has long been a pariah in the West for extending his rule through flawed elections and stifling dissent. He has relied on cheap Russian energy resources and resisted free-market reforms. \u001d  Russia and Belarus have a union agreement envisaging close political, economic and military ties, but the Kremlin has shown increasing irritation with Lukashenko, who has resisted Moscow's push for control over Belarus' energy pipelines and other assets. \u001d  The oil dispute came days after Belarus grudgingly agreed to pay more than twice the previous price for gas from Russia's state natural gas monopoly, OAO Gazprom (GSPBEX.RS). \u001d  Putin Monday said that even after the gas and oil deals, Moscow's energy subsidies to Belarus next year would amount to $5.8 billion, equivalent to more than 40% of Belarussian budget revenues. \u001d  \"This is Russia's payment for a quiet, soft transfer to free-market conditions fitting allied relations and support of the brotherly Belarussian people,\" Putin said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 09:48 ET (14:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3070a3cb8306699bb57ccde9ccbbb134","symR":["IR5A.DB","IE0033336516"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Irish Continental: P&O Exercises Ferry Option","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T15:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IR5A.DB","IE0033336516"],"IndustryCodes":["TAT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 10:09 ET (15:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"30a2025fb25d44f9637d863b624ee7c0","symR":["AAL.LN","AAUK","GB0004901517"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Anglo American Appoints Carroll Exec Director","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T17:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAL.LN","AAUK","GB0004901517"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Anglo American said Monday that it has appointed Cynthia Carroll to the Board as an executive director with immediate effect. \b \u001d  Corrected Jan. 15, 2007 1243 ET (1743 GMT)\u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:06 ET (17:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"30a7c26d8c013d7309877c1e7974759c","symR":["SWED-A.SK","SE0000242455"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Citigroup Downgrades Swedbank To Hold From Buy","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T06:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SWED-A.SK","SE0000242455"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 01:25 ET (06:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"311b333112e4a0b68a3be3da4165ca30","symR":["MRTN"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Marten Transport, Ltd.

These naturally occurring enzymes become overwhelmed by free radicals as we get older. Oxidative stress (cell damage caused by free radicals) occurs as a person ages, when subjected to environmental stresses or as an associated factor in certain illnesses. TBARS are laboratory markers for oxidative stress in the body. Data from a peer-reviewed, published scientific study in men and women, sponsored by LifeVantage, show that after 30 days of taking Protandim(R), the level of circulating TBARS decreased an average of 40 percent, with this decrease shown to be maintained at 120 days. Protandim(R) strengthens a person's defenses against oxidative stress by increasing the body's natural antioxidant enzymes.

These 79 Mineral Leases contain approximately 46,363 acres in Harding County, Northwest South Dakota. A detailed geologic evaluation of the project area is underway and a drilling program is tentatively planned for later 2007. Exploration drilling for uranium in this region has been very limited. An evaluation of Ur-Energy's extensive historic database suggests potential for uranium discoveries in the region. \b \bBill Boberg, President and CEO stated: \"This previously untested project area has characteristics that suggest the potential for uranium deposit discovery of the Wyoming sandstone deposit type. This property acquisition is a conceptual exploration play based on uranium drill data in adjacent Montana and requires further geologic evaluation and drilling to determine its geological potential. If our drilling program demonstrates uranium potential in our target sands this will be an exciting project and demonstrates that the extensive data held by the Company will continue to lead us to develop new projects both within, and outside of Wyoming.\" \b \bUr-Energy is a dynamic junior mining company aggressively completing mine planning, baseline studies and permitting activities to bring two uranium deposits in Wyoming into production starting as early as late 2008 early 2009.

With loan volume cooling -- mortgage originations dropped 18 percent in the first half of last year -- banks are starting to woo borrowers with incentives. Charles Schwab now gives most of its existing customers a rate break of 0.25 percentage points on new adjustable-rate mortgages and home-equity loans at its Schwab Bank. At E*Trade Financial, some customers get $500 toward closing costs. Citibank doles out reward points for mortgages and home-equity loans, while Bank of America is going so far as to promise $250 to any customers  who get approved for a mortgage and decide to go somewhere else. LendingTree.com recently offered $500 to qualified borrowers who find a better rate elsewhere. \u001d  Of course, there's more to this than altruism. Most of the deals are good for existing customers only; shoppers shouldn't let incentives distract them from finding the best overall deal, says Greg McBride, senior analyst at Bankrate.com. And a few may be more marketing hype than anything. The total number of people who've cashed in on LendingTree.com's offer?

At the same time, the agency has affirmed Bank of Africa Niger's (\"BoAN\") ratings at  Issuer Default 'B-'(B minus) with Stable Outlook, Short term 'B', Individual 'D/E' and Support '5'. BoAB and BoAN are part of the Bank of Africa (\"BoA\") group, one of the largest financial services groups in the eight-member state West African Economic and Monetary Union (\"WAEMU\"). \u001d  The Issuer Default, Short-term and Individual ratings for BoAB and BoAN reflect some weaknesses at both banks such as poor operating environments and significant sovereign exposures respectively to Benin and Niger, high asset and liability concentrations and fragile capital adequacy. Additionally, BoAB's ratings have factored in its deteriorated profitability and higher impaired loans. However, BoAB's and BoAN's ratings also take into account their satisfactory liquidity, prudent strategy and additionally, stronger risk management for BoAB and reasonable profitability for BoAN. BoAN is much smaller than BoAB and operates in a weaker operating environment. \u001d  Given BoAB's and BoAN's domestic franchises, Fitch considers that the Benin and Niger governments would have the propensity to support BoAB and BoAN respectively. However, taking into account each of the countries' very weak financial capacity, Fitch views that support from the related governments, should it be required, cannot be relied upon. Key shareholder Luxembourg-based Africa Financial Holdings (\"AFH\") directly controls 38.6% of BoAB and 41.8% of BoAN, though majority control is indirectly assured. In Fitch's opinion, AFH would be willing to provide support to BoAB and BoAN in case of need. However, this cannot be relied upon given uncertainties regarding AFH's capacity to do so. \u001d  BoAB's profitability ratios for 2005 and H106 show an ongoing decline, heavily influenced by loan loss provisions and operating costs, at a time when competition from other banks has significantly increased. Asset quality deteriorated in 2005 and H106, reflecting tighter credit risk controls at the bank and a weaker credit environment. Delinquent loans (180 days or more overdue) accounted for 19% of total loans at end-H106, with only 54% of the delinquent loans being reserved.  The estimated impaired loan ratio at end-2006 is at a lower 16%. Fitch considers its loan loss reserve inadequate as net impaired loans represented a significant 42% of equity at end-June 2006. Concentrations in the loan portfolio and the funding base, overall high exposure to the Benin government and a weak capital adequacy ratio (12.73% at end-H106) also give rise to concerns. The bank is reinforcing its risk management systems and procedures, with greater supervision from AFH. \u001d  Conversely, BoAN has weathered the difficult operating environment with strong growth in its operating profit in 2005. This reflected stronger revenues fuelled by booming short-term lending activity and improving margins as well as lower credit costs - a trend that continued in H106. However, weaknesses on asset quality remain. Asset quality indicators are poor and volatile due to lending concentration in a weak credit environment. Overall exposure to the Niger government remains high relative to equity (176% of equity at end-H106). However, BoAN's liquidity remains acceptable with regional central bank placements and WAEMU government securities equal to some 20% of funding. BoAN's capital adequacy ratio continued to deteriorate in H106 to 10.17% (2005: 11.45%) as asset growth outpaced equity increase. Fitch views this negatively and would expect higher Tier 1 ratios, given the bank's poor risk profile and the poor operating environment. \u001d  BoAB is the largest bank of the BoA group. It is Benin's largest commercial bank, with total equity of XOF26.4 billion, and deposit shares of approximately 35%. BoAN has total equity of XOF4bn and a 20.6% market share as per country's deposits. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:02 ET (12:02 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"35167b2c6a86bde875aac2d9ea00f36c","symR":["ACTL","MENT"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Actel and Mentor Graphics Expand Partnership","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACTL","MENT"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","SOF","XDJGI","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\bWILSONVILLE, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2007-- \u001d  Mentor Graphics Corporation (NASDAQ:MENT) and Actel Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTL) today announced the signing of a new OEM agreement between the two companies, expanding the companies' existing technology and marketing partnership.

(NYSE: VTR) (\"Ventas\" or the \"Company\") announced today that it has reached a definitive agreement with Sunrise Senior Living REIT (TSE: SZR.UN) (\"Sunrise REIT\") to acquire its interest in 74 high-quality private pay assisted living communities in the U.S. and Canada and the exclusive right of first offer to acquire other newly developed assets in Canada and portions of the U.S. for Cdn $15.00 per unit, for a total value including debt of Cdn $2.1 billion (or approximately USD $1.8 billion at current exchange rates).  The 74 communities are located in demographically desirable metropolitan areas of 17 states and two Canadian provinces.  Ventas also expects to acquire for a fixed price five communities in the U.S. and Canada that are currently under development (the \"Five Development Properties\"). \b \u001d  The acquired assets are high-quality new communities, almost all of which were developed by Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) (\"Sunrise\") in its recognizable and award-winning \"Sunrise Mansion\" style.  Sunrise is the manager of all of the properties under the existing long-term management contracts, which will remain in place, and is a minority joint venture partner in 56 of the communities. \b \u001d  \"This transaction will add 74 exceptional private pay assets to our diverse high-quality portfolio and is expected to increase our revenue from private pay assets to approximately two-thirds of our total revenue.  The acquired assets are all new assisted living communities located in large metropolitan areas, with high barriers to entry, and extraordinary growth prospects.  We welcome the opportunity to establish a new, important relationship with Sunrise, the world's premier manager of senior living residences,\" Ventas Chairman, CEO and President Debra A. Cafaro said.  \"This transaction will broaden our footprint in North America with entry into the Canadian seniors housing market.  With the exclusive right of first offer on additional Sunrise-developed assets in Canada and portions of the U.S., we believe that this transaction will position Ventas for long-term growth and add a new dimension to our diversification program.\" \b \u001d  \"We are moving from one excellent capital partner in the Sunrise REIT to another in Ventas,\" said Thomas Newell, Sunrise's President.  \"We are growing rapidly because we see tremendous growth in demand for our resident-centered senior living services.  We believe the new Ventas relationship provides a great new partner to help us meet the needs of more seniors.\" \b \u001d  Of the 74 acquired communities, 63 are located in the U.S., clustered in metropolitan areas of California, Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Colorado, and 11 are located in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia.  Three of those assets are currently in lease-up. \b \u001d  Four of the Five Development Properties that Ventas expects to acquire are in the U.S. and one is in Ontario.  Two communities, located in Staten Island, New York and Sandy, Utah, opened in late 2006; two communities are expected to open in early to mid-2007; and the Ontario community, which is principally a 229-suite independent living community, is expected to open by 2008. \b \u001d  In 2007, total revenue from the 74 acquired communities should approximate USD $387 million, and net operating income (NOI) should approximate USD $132 million, using current exchange rates.  Because Sunrise is a minority joint venture partner in some of the assets, Ventas's share of the total expected revenue and NOI is approximately 85 percent. \b \u001d  The transaction is expected to be initially five to seven cents dilutive to the Company's normalized Funds from Operations (FFO) per share in 2007, and is expected to be break even to the Company's normalized FFO per share in 2008, in each case excluding development properties.  The Company expects the transaction to increase Ventas's internal growth rate due to the attractiveness of the assets coupled with the positive fundamentals in the seniors housing market. \b \b \b    BENEFITS OF TRANSACTION \b \b     -- Significant diversification by tenant and by asset class.  With the \b        close of this transaction, annualized REIT revenues from Kindred \b        Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE: KND) should represent approximately 30 percent \b        of Ventas's run rate total revenue and annualized revenue from private \b        pay assets in the Company's portfolio should represent approximately \b        67 percent of the Company's run rate total revenue. \b     -- Upon completion of the transaction, Ventas will own over 525 assets in \b        43 states and two Canadian provinces. \b     -- The 74 acquired communities include approximately 6,000 suites and \b        capacity for over 7,000 residents.  Ventas will acquire a 100 percent \b        interest in 18 communities that are wholly owned by Sunrise REIT, and \b        between a 75 to 85 percent interest in 56 communities. \b     -- The average age of the portfolio is seven years, including the 74 \b        acquired communities and Five Development Properties. \b     -- The transaction brings added geographic diversification to the Ventas \b        portfolio and international expansion into Canada. \b     -- The acquired communities enjoy (excluding lease-up properties) strong \b        occupancies of 94 percent and compelling margins, due to Sunrise's \b        brand and standardized operating model, the high quality of the assets \b        and the excellent location of the communities. \b     -- An initial NOI yield to Ventas of approximately 6.2 percent and \b        excellent prospects for growth in the existing portfolio. \b     -- An exclusive right of first offer to acquire additional assets \b        developed by Sunrise in Canada and limited right to acquire certain \b        Sunrise developed assets in the U.S. \b     -- Ventas will enjoy an important new relationship with Sunrise, one of \b        the world's premier providers of senior living services.  Through \b        minority partnership interests in 56 of the acquired communities, and \b        an incentive management fee structure at all the assets, Sunrise is \b        invested in the long-term success of the communities. \b     -- Ventas will enjoy true economic benefits from the projected growth in \b        the portfolio, through use of its taxable REIT subsidiary. \b \b \u001d  \"The Sunrise REIT communities are desired for their exceptional care and resident-centered services, as well as outstanding architectural and interior design.  We believe these communities will continue to be highly successful,\" Cafaro added. \b \u001d  Completion of the transaction will be subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by the unitholders of Sunrise REIT. Ventas expects the acquisition to be completed early in the second quarter of 2007, although there can be no assurance that the transaction will close or, if it does, when the closing will occur. \b \u001d  Merrill Lynch & Co. acted as the Company's exclusive financial advisor and delivered a fairness opinion to its Board of Directors.  Interim financing for the acquisition will be provided by Merrill Lynch.  Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt acted as legal advisors to Ventas. \b \b    CONFERENCE CALL TUESDAY AT 9:00 A.M. (E.T.) \b \u001d  Ventas will hold a conference call to discuss this press release on Tuesday, January 16, 2007, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Central Time). The conference call is being web cast by CCBN and can be accessed at the Ventas website at http://www.ventasreit.com .

Key elements of the Company's updated Varvarinskoye mine plan, scheduled and optimized by Orelogy, are as follows: production rate: 4.2 million tonnes of ore per year; Waste: ore ratio 4.5 : 1; Mine life: 17 years (first and last years are partial production years; Recovered gold: 1.8 million ounces (life of mine); Recovered copper: 200 million lbs (life of mine); Capital costs: US$145 million (includes working capital and pre-production stripping costs); Capitalised Financing and insurance charges: US$13m; Cash operating costs per ounce of gold net of copper credits: (copper at U.S. $1.30/lb). \u001d  The updated mine plan uses a Base Case gold price of US$525 per ounce and copper price of US$1.30 per pound. Hedging of 443,000 ounces of gold at approximately US$574 per ounce has been incorporated into this updated mine plan (see the Company's press release dated Dec. 6, 2005). The cashflow (Net Present Value 0%) of this case is US$328 million (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs). This compares to a cashflow (Net Present Value 0%) of US$301 million (excluding taxes, royalty and financing costs) calculated in November 2004 at metal prices of US$375 per ounce of gold and US$1.00 per pound of copper (see the Company's press release dated Nov. 10, 2004). \u001d  Bert Kennedy, EMC Chief Executive Officer commented Monday \"The geological, engineering and economic updates announced Monday confirm the integrity of the Varvarinskoye ore body, the project's feasibility and the robustness of Varvarinskoye's economics. We believe that the assumptions underlying the updated mineral resource and reserve estimates and the mine plan are conservative in Monday's metal mining industry and that additional mineral resources will be identified at Varvarinskoye.

BP named current Head of Exploration and Production Tony Hayward as Browne's successor.     Browne's widely-lauded tenure at the head of the oil company was marred by a series of safety problems in the U.S., and a report to be released Tuesday, led by former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, into an explosion at BP's Texas City refinery in March 2005 that killed 15 people and injured 170 is expected to scathing about management failings and the safety culture within BP. \u001d  Media reports have suggested the report will point the finger of blame at the very top of the company. \b \u001d  MARKET REACTION: \b \u001d  BP's shares jumped $3.09 or 5% in U.S. trading to $64.69 following the announcement of Browne's retirement Friday. In the U.K., BP's shares were trading up 0.6% or 3 pence at 549.5 pence Monday. Analysts welcomed Browne's departure as positive for BP shares, but said his successor will face many challenges in restoring the company's tarnished image. \b \u001d  NEW LEADER: \b \u001d  By choosing Hayward, BP has picked the head of oil and gas exploration, or the upstream business, which is traditionally responsible for the lion's share of Big Oil's profits. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) also opted for a senior upstream executive, Rex Tillerson, to replace former CEO Lee Raymond. \u001d  A longtime BP executive, Hayward grabbed the headlines in December when a leaked internal memo showed him blaming BP's safety problems on \"the mantra of 'more for less'...that we can get 100% of the task completed with 90% of the resources.\" \b \u001d  BROWNE'S LEGACY: \b \u001d  BP has spent millions of dollars over the past few years burnishing its environmental credentials through a campaign to define itself as the most progressive among its peers in the elite group of major oil companies. More recently however, the U.K. energy giant's green credentials have been sullied by a series of problems with its U.S. operations, including a deadly 2005 blast at its Texas City refinery and the partial shutdown of the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska after severe pipeline corrosion was discovered. BP has acknowledged that its recent woes have played a role in the acceleration of the timetable to replace Browne. \b \u001d  MORE HEADS TO ROLL? \b \u001d  If the Baker report is as scathing of management failures going right to the top of the company as expected, analysts question whether John Manzoni, head of refining and marketing for BP, will also come under pressure to step down. \u001d  THE KEY QUOTES: \u001d  \"We clearly have important issues still to deal with, which I am determined to address. I am pleased that Peter and I have been able to work together to develop a successor in Tony in whom I have every confidence.\" - Lord Browne. \u001d  \"John (Browne) decided that it would be in the company's interest to name a successor now in order to provide an orderly transition. Having made that decision, which the board fully supports, we came to the conclusion that a six-month handover would be more appropriate than 18 months.\" -BP Chairman Peter Sutherland. \u001d  \"We have a leadership style that probably is too directive and doesn't listen sufficiently well. The top of the organization doesn't listen hard enough to what the bottom of the organization is saying.\" - Tony Hayward in an internal memo in December. \u001d  \"There was a gap between the company's goals in the area of sustainability and in its implementation of such standards across the business units.\" Amy Jaffe, Wallace S. Wilson Fellow in Energy Studies and Coordinator of Research, Baker Institute. \u001d  \"The (Baker) report finds problems that go all the way to the top. To talk about what happened in Texas City, you have to talk about what happened in London. There is no level of the company that is exempt from responsibility,\" a person who had seen the Baker report, quoted in the U.K. newspaper The Sunday Telegraph. \u001d  \"They needed new management. Lord John Browne was cutting corners, cutting corners to become number two and replace Shell Oil.\" - Charles Hamel, a retired oil shipping broker and longtime critic of BP. \b \u001d  -By Grainne McCarthy and James Herron; Dow Jones Newswires; 201 938 4430; grainne.mccarthy@dowjones.com \u001d  (John Biers and Matthew Dalton contributed to this story.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:52 ET (12:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"37ca0947b93c81585d39fe0d71a5f899","symR":["SFK.UN.T","CA7841421018"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"SFK Pulp Fund Announces C$75 Million Unit Financing >SFK.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SFK.UN.T","CA7841421018"],"IndustryCodes":["PAP","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:43 ET (12:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"37e156b63bbe143ad01e32790d410909","symR":["SVM.T","CA82835P1036"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Silvercorp Acquires 60% Interest In HPG Gold-Silver-Lead Property, Henan, China>SVM.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SVM.T","CA82835P1036"],"IndustryCodes":["PCS","PPM","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 09:01 ET (14:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"37eabd0cf3d6966f9b68ebb4ab76521e","symR":["SMU.UN.T","CA8659161001"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Summit Announces Results Of Special Meetings Of Unitholders And Debentureholders - Expects To Exercise Redemption Rights On January 25, 2007>SMU.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T20:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SMU.UN.T","CA8659161001"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  TORONTO, Jan. 15 /CNW/ - Summit REIT announced today that the special meeting of unitholders and the special meeting of the holders of the 6.25% convertible debentures due March 31, 2014 (the \"Debentures\") of Summit REIT were both held today in Toronto, as previously announced.

Applied Biosystems' products also serve the needs of some markets outside of life science research, which we refer to as \"applied markets,\" such as the fields of: human identity testing (forensic and paternity testing); biosecurity, which refers to products needed in response to the threat of biological terrorism and other malicious, accidental, and natural biological dangers; and quality and safety testing, for example in food and the environment. Applied Biosystems is headquartered in Foster City, CA, and reported sales of $1.9 billion during fiscal 2006. The Celera Group is primarily a molecular diagnostics business that is using proprietary genomics and proteomics discovery platforms to identify and validate novel diagnostic markers, and is developing diagnostic products based on these markers as well as other known markers. Celera maintains a strategic alliance with Abbott for the development and commercialization of molecular, or nucleic acid-based, diagnostic products, and it is also developing new diagnostic products outside of this alliance. Through its genomics and proteomics research efforts, Celera is also discovering and validating therapeutic targets, and it is seeking strategic partnerships to develop therapeutic products based on these discovered targets.

Cisco's board of directors, it seems, wanted to put more of his compensation \"at risk.\" \u001d  We'd join the applause if it weren't for the absurd number of options he's been granted. After collapsing in the dot-com bust, Cisco shares mostly hovered in the high teens, before  rising from $18 last summer to $27 in mid-December. \u001d  Shareholders have done well, but no one benefited more than Chambers: His $29.8 million in options increased in value by $100 million. Chambers cashed in 1.35 million shares, netting $17.1 million. \u001d  Some sacrifice. Capping CEO pay has become almost trendy recently, but it's often more hype than help. Chambers, for instance, elected to take just $1 in annual salary from April 2001 to July 2004. In that period, though, he earned $38 million from options. \"It's a hostile takeover from the inside,\" says Nell Minow, of watchdog group The Corporate Library. Compare that with Microsoft: CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer have taken modest salaries and were not granted stock options. \u001d  Chambers won't discuss his pay. But we followed the money to Carol Bartz, executive chairman of San Rafael, Calif., software firm Autodesk and chairman of Cisco's compensation committee. \"Bartz is a serial offender\" when it comes to approving egregious executive pay, Minow says.

Patients with Gaucher disease are at increased risk for developing bone complications, including osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures. To evaluate the effect of long-term Cerezyme use on bone mineral density, the investigators conducted the largest-ever retrospective analysis of more than 500 patients participating in the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry. The ICGG Gaucher Registry has been sponsored by Genzyme since 1991 and is overseen by an international board of scientific advisors. \b \u001d  The study compared the outcomes of 342 patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease who received treatment with Cerezyme to 160 patients who did not receive treatment. Both the treated and untreated patients had bone mineral density values significantly below normal at baseline. The patients who received Cerezyme were dosed at a range from 15-60 units per kilogram of body weight administered every two weeks. Bone mineral density was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine. \b \u001d  The analysis found that patients receiving Cerezyme experienced a significant increase in bone mineral density over time when compared with patients who were not treated. Furthermore, the improvements in bone mineral density were found to be dose-dependent, with those patients receiving higher doses of Cerezyme achieving greater increases in bone mineral density.  On average, the patients receiving Cerezyme at 60 units per kilogram biweekly achieved scores that approached those in the general population, whereas the untreated patients experienced no improvement or declining bone mineral density over the same period. \b \u001d  The investigators found that achieving normal (age- and sex-adjusted) bone mineral density scores may require eight years or more of sustained treatment with Cerezyme, longer than is required to reach normal values for other disease parameters, such as hematological parameters or reductions in liver and spleen volume. They conclude that a normal bone mineral density score should be a therapeutic goal for patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease. \b \b    About Cerezyme \b \u001d  Cerezyme (imiglucerase for injection) is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for pediatric and adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease that results in one or more of the following conditions: anemia, thrombocytopenia, bone disease, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly. Important Safety Information: Adverse reactions related to Cerezyme administration have been reported in less than 15% of patients. Each of the following events occurred in less than 2% of the total patient population. Reported adverse events include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, fatigue, headache, fever, dizziness, chills, backache, and tachycardia. Adverse events associated with the route of administration include discomfort, pruritus, burning, swelling, and sterile abscess at the site of venipuncture. Symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity include anaphylactoid reaction, pruritus, flushing, urticaria, angioedema, chest discomfort, dyspnea, coughing, cyanosis, and hypotension. Approximately 15% of patients have developed IgG antibodies; periodic monitoring is suggested. Side effects should be reported promptly to Genzyme Medical Affairs at 800-745-4447, option 2. Cerezyme is available by prescription only. \b \b    Please see full prescribing information available on www.cerezyme.com. \b \b    About Genzyme \b \u001d  One of the world's leading biotechnology companies, Genzyme is dedicated to making a major positive impact on the lives of people with serious diseases.

But they remain divided on what such a result would mean for U.K. monetary policy. \u001d  The inflation data, which are due 0930 GMT Tuesday, were available to Monetary Policy Committee members during last week's meeting, at which they decided to hike rates to 5.25%. \u001d  Rises in consumer prices of more than one percentage point above or below the Bank's 2.0% inflation target necessitate a letter of explanation from BOE Governor Mervyn King to Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. \u001d  If CPI inflation was indeed more than 3.0%, the bank would probably release a letter at 1030 GMT Tuesday, according to procedures set out on its website. A response from the Treasury would also seem likely. \u001d  The letter would be an embarrassment for the MPC, although the Treasury is likely to go easy on the rate-setters, since the inflation rate has remained relatively low in the more than nine years since the Committee was charged with conducting monetary policy. \u001d  But economists are divided on what the first breach of the 3.0% ceiling in the MPC's history  would mean for the future path of interest rates. \u001d  \"If inflation is above 3%, it really cements the chances of a further hike,\" said Philip Shaw, U.K. economist at Investec. \"Even if we don't get a 3.1% tomorrow, the chances are that rates will still probably rise. The point is not so much that inflation will come down in the second half of the year, it's the fact that from the MPC's point of view it may not be coming down quickly enough if there are more price pressures in the pipeline now.\" \u001d  Other economists argue that more aggressive policy tightening in the near-term would increase the likelihood that those moves would be withdrawn soon. \u001d  \"The judgment we need to make is whether the bank is really concerned about near-term inflation and inflation expectations or what output has done, relative to what it was forecasting,\" said Amit Kara, U.K. economist at UBS. \"If it's inflation and inflation expectations, they will move very aggressively ... which also means that once expectations are anchored they will bring policy rates down fairly quickly.\" \u001d  Even if price rises did overshoot the BOE's target by more than one percentage point, that would still leave questions unanswered about why the MPC felt the need to raise rates in January, said Robert Barrie, chief economist at Credit Suisse. \u001d  The December CPI data should play a relatively small part in the MPC's decision since it is looking at where inflation will be in two years time, not where it was last month, he notes. \u001d  \"Whether (CPI inflation) was 3% or 3.1% or 2.9% frankly shouldn't make too much difference,\" Barrie said. \"If it is above 3%, we still need to work out why (the MPC) think it's going to persist and of course we need to know how many of them voted for the rise as well.\" \u001d  That won't be known until minutes for last week's meeting are released on Jan. 24. But speeches by MPC members later this week may provide some clarity on the reasons behind the move. Andrew Sentance is lined up for Tuesday lunchtime, while Tim Besley is due to speak Thursday. \u001d  \"In the absence of a letter, (those speeches would) be very closely watched because presumably Andrew Sentance and Tim Besley would have been at the front of the queue voting for a rate hike, given their voting history,\" said Alan Castle, U.K. economist at Lehman Brothers. \u001d  -By Natasha Brereton, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9254; natasha.brereton@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:54 ET (17:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3f2303dc9670cc0a26c94bd8520447b5","symR":["FMD.UN.T","CA36116H1073"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Futuremed Started At Mkt Perf; C$10.25 By BMO>FMD.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FMD.UN.T","CA36116H1073"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 09:28 ET (14:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3f32e2b6ca0941a43f4be139b8e12adb","symR":["SAS.T","CA7871885074"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"St Andrew Boosts Strategic Position In Apollo Gold To 10%>SAS.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T21:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SAS.T","CA7871885074"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 16:00 ET (21:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3f446e26bf8b6d5ebc7d9bf0b74a7f4c","symR":["FPL.T","HLF.T","CA30256E1079","CA4296951094"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"High Liner In Discussions With FPI To Acquire North American Value-added Food Service And Retail Frozen Seafood Businesses>HLF.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FPL.T","HLF.T","CA30256E1079","CA4296951094"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 09:58 ET (14:58 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3f7b1629d775eab44e587ea20dd05150","symR":["MN.T","CA5662191017"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"March Networks Was Market Outperform At Dundee >MN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T21:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MN.T","CA5662191017"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3f87c049d9e3e9d5a755e69807d583e3","symR":["CPG.LN","GB0005331532"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Compass Group Buys Back 0.5M Shares","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T17:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CPG.LN","GB0005331532"],"IndustryCodes":["RES","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Compass Group said Monday that on Jan. 15, 2007 it purchased for cancellation 500,000 ordinary shares at a price of 307.1154 pence per share from Morgan Stanley. \u001d  Following the purchase and upon cancellation of these shares, the number of ordinary shares of Compass Group PLC in issue with voting rights will be 2,048,614,928. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:02 ET (17:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"403d6be00e1c9d75847ae523f7ff8bcc","symR":["GMKN.RS","OPYGY","PLZL.RS","RU0007288411","RU000A0JNAA8"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Arrest Of Norilsk Exec In France a 'Misunderstanding'-Co","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T13:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GMKN.RS","OPYGY","PLZL.RS","RU0007288411","RU000A0JNAA8"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","MNG","ONF","PCS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  MOSCOW (AP)--The detention of Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov in France last week as part of a prostitution investigation was a \"regrettable misunderstanding,\" a spokesman for the metals executive said Monday. \u001d  Prokhorov was back at his desk Monday after four days of questioning by French police in connection with a probe into a high-class prostitution ring, said Sergei Chernitsyn, a spokesman for Norilsk Nickel, where Prokhorov is a senior executive. \u001d  \"His detention was the result of a regrettable misunderstanding,\" Chernitsyn said in a statement posted on the company's Web site. \u001d  \"As planned ...

(KKD) says it \"will continue to work aggressively with outside supply partners to develop a zero trans-fat doughnut.\" \u001d  Rather than worrying the shift will gobble up their market niche, some natural doughnut makers say they are happy to see the food industry abandoning ingredients that gave the industrialized doughnut a bad rap. \u001d  \"It's nice to have been ahead of the curve,\" said Ryan Kellner, owner of the all-organic Mighty-O Donuts in Seattle. \"But I think it's great for society in general that we're moving towards an alternative.\" \u001d  \"Doughnuts have kind of gone through a renaissance,\" Isreal said. \u001d  Artificial trans fats, also listed on food labels as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, are under attack from health advocates. Evidence suggests they boost \"bad\" cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. \u001d  Health regulators have taken notice. Last month, New York became the first city in the U.S. to ban all restaurants from using artificial trans fats by mid-2008; similar measures are being considered from Little Rock, Ark., to Los Angeles. \u001d  In Franklin County, Ohio, officials even suspended an annual contract to supply the county jail with doughnuts, citing concerns about trans fats. \u001d  Some food sellers stopped using trans fats voluntarily after the Food and Drug Administration required food labels to show trans-fat content. That Starbucks, which recently announced it was halfway through a plan to purge trans fats from its U.S. food menu. \u001d  Seattle's Top Pot Doughnuts, one of Starbucks' largest doughnut suppliers, switched to a trans-fat-free recipe in November. \u001d  Others are still experimenting with changes to their carefully guarded recipes. \u001d  Food industry analyst Phil Lempert, editor of SupermarketGuru.com, says food companies will likely fast-track efforts to remove trans fats as the New York deadline moves closer and similar laws crop up elsewhere. \u001d  The big question for food makers, he said, is how consumers will react. \u001d  \"I think you're going to see the heavy doughnut user, if you will, walk away from the Krispy Kreme with no trans fats and say, 'Hmm, tastes different,\"' Lempert said. \"It's not that it tastes better or worse. It just tastes different.\" \u001d  Consumers should not assume, however, that a trans-fat-free doughnut is necessarily healthy, said Marion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University. \u001d  \"My feeling is that the whole trans fat issue is a calorie distraction,\" Nestle said. \"You think that because it's trans-fat-free, it doesn't have any calories. And whatever the substitute is going to be, it's going to have just as many calories.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 16:55 ET (21:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"437a56f5817460bd401dad173880e100","symR":["PCYO"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Pure Cycle Corp 1Q Rev $63,700 Vs $65,600, -2.9%>PCYO","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T22:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PCYO"],"IndustryCodes":["WAT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 17:22 ET (22:22 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"449ddc68dccb0dbb3340944b31a93f28","symR":["SRZ"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Sunrise Sr Living Reports Restatement Delay >SRZ","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SRZ"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Sunrise Senior Living Inc.

Most analysts maintained their ratings and adopted a wait-and-see approach. \u001d  \"It is too early to announce a BP recovery story, as some commentators will,\" said Neil McMahon, analyst at London-based Bernstein Research. \"The company is unlikely now to embark on any new exciting strategic path that will excite investors.\" \u001d  Speculation was rife in weekend newspapers that former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's report Tuesday on the 2005 fatal explosion at BP's Texas City, Texas, refinery would blame senior BP executives in London, possibly leading to more high-level departures. \u001d  If the report is particularly damning, \"one has to question whether John Manzoni will stay as head of refining and marketing,\" said Jonathan Wright, analyst at Citigroup. \u001d  But analysts downplayed the Baker report's potential impact on BP's share price. \u001d  \"Although this is anticipated to be a very damning report into the way BP operated its refining operations, we believe that many of the recommendations of the report have been adopted by BP,\" said London-based analysts at Teather and Greenwood. \u001d  Analysts were still looking with concern at Russian joint venture TNK-BP and the need to safeguard those assets from Russian government encroachment. \u001d  Stephane Foucaud, analyst at Societe Generale, said it is unlikely Hayward could resolve these uncertainties over TNK-BP. \"It would be very difficult for anyone to defend the Russian operations,\" given the current political climate there, he said. \u001d  Russian government officials have alleged environmental abuses by Western companies operating Russian oil and gas projects. In one such dispute, Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSB.LN) last month agreed to hand control of the Sakhalin-2 project to state-controlled Gazprom OAO (GSPBEX.RS). \u001d  When the 50% of Russian-held shares in TNK-BP become available, perhaps at the end of this year, BP may not be able to stop the Russian government or Gazprom moving in, Foucaud said. If that happens, he questions whether \"decisions in TNK-BP will be taken in shareholders' best interests, or the interest of the Russian government.\" \u001d  What analysts really wanted to see from Hayward is a sign that the company will \"put its house in order first and focus on operational issues,\" said McMahon of Bernstein Research, who maintained a market-perform rating on the company and a target price of GBP5.75 per share. \u001d  Key to recovery is a change in the organizational structure of the company, becoming more centralized and giving less freedom to individual business units, McMahon said. \u001d  \"It is hard to see BP outperforming until Hayward defines his vision this summer and the evidence of operational improvements becomes manifest,\" said Citigroup's Wright, who maintained a low-risk buy rating and a target price of GBP5.47 per share. \u001d  Societe Generale's Foucaud maintained a sell rating on the BP shares and said the company would do well to avoid any bad surprises in the near future in order to \"clear the cloud of uncertainty.\" \u001d  BP shares closed up 0.5% Monday at 549 pence. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.bp.com \b \u001d  -By James Herron, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9317; james.herron@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 13:00 ET (18:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"44daccceebda284d863206c7e58492d5","symR":["BKR"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Baker Awarded E9-1-1 Mapping and GIS Contract for Beaver County, PA","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T20:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BKR"],"IndustryCodes":["ENR","ICS","SVC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  PITTSBURGH, Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Michael Baker Jr., Inc., an engineering unit of Michael Baker Corporation (Amex: BKR), announced today it has been awarded a contract by Beaver County, Pennsylvania, to provide E9-1-1 plan and parcel mapping and geographic information system development services. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20061214/BAKERLOGO ) \b \u001d  Under the 12 to 18 month, $1.5 million contract, Baker will develop E9-1-1 plan and parcel mapping layers, including accurate street centerline data to meet Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) and National Emergency Number Association (NENA) standards for Phase I and II wireless deployment.

But a few folks from the outskirts of Philadelphia have one to add. That day David Yost, then at the helm of AmeriSource Health, was set to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange with his colleagues from Bergen Brunswig in honor of the merger that would create one of the largest drug distributors in the country. It was a rocky start for the combined company, which has since faced controversy over counterfeit drugs, the loss of a contract with the Veterans Administration, worth $4 billion annually, and a complete overhaul of its business model. Five and a half years after the two companies decided to unite, 59-year-old Yost has declared the integration over and is looking ahead to the next phase for AmerisourceBergen. He's aiming to maintain the 15 percent compound annual growth in earnings per share that the combined company, which brought in $57 billion in revenue last year, has delivered so far. It's not an easy task in an industry where the top three players handle 90 percent of the business, and they count the margin in pennies. But Yost, who has three decades of experience in drug distribution at AmerisourceBergen and its predecessors, is up for the challenge. He sat down with staff writer Nicole Bullock at the firm's Chesterbrook, Pa., headquarters to discuss his business today as well as politics and the threat from counterfeit drugs. \b \u001d  SM: Let's start with the basics. Drug distribution is a huge business. What does it entail? \u001d  DY: The drug-distribution market equals the market for pharmaceuticals, which is about $260 billion in the U.S. We purchase drugs in bulk from hundreds of manufacturers, warehouse the inventory and deliver it to more than 10,000 individual U.S. pharmacies. \b \u001d  SM: Why does the business need a middleman? Why don't the drugmakers just distribute the drugs themselves? \u001d  DY: Distributors lower the overall cost of getting drugs from manufacturers to patients in a timely manner. The pharmacy can place one order with one invoice instead of hundreds of orders and hundreds of truck deliveries. We also hold the inventory. It's one of the reasons why if you can't get a prescription immediately, it can be filled in 24 hours. \b \u001d  SM: The market is dominated by three huge companies, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, and in recent years the big growth has come through acquisitions. How do you grow now? \u001d  DY: There aren't a lot of industries where the demographics work so strongly in your favor. Father Time is our friend. The older people get, the more drugs they take. The other driver is new drugs. The big pharmaceutical companies are working literally overtime to find the cure for Alzheimer's and every other disease you can think of. \b \u001d  SM: Your profit margins are in the low single digits. Is there anything you can do to expand them? \u001d  DY: Two key areas we are targeting are specialty pharmaceuticals and generics. \b \u001d  SM: Do tell. \u001d  DY: Specialty pharmaceuticals -- about two-thirds of which is oncology -- are administered either through injection or IV. We sell them directly to physicians rather than drugstores. The basic distribution is similar to our traditional business, but we can charge more because there are additional services involved. Generally, these drugs need special handling, like refrigeration. A lot of them are new therapies, so we also organize forums to teach physicians about the disease and the drug. Then there are consulting services. Most of these drugs are very targeted. Using our distribution  network, we can tell the manufacturers where the patients are and how much insurance companies will probably reimburse on certain drugs. \b \u001d  SM: Is specialty pharma already a big part of the business? \u001d  DY: Sales of specialty pharmaceuticals are growing in the midteens, which is about two times the overall industry, and our growth has been faster than that. Last year sales rose about 30 percent, to $10 billion. \b \u001d  SM: What about generics? \u001d  DY: Generics have higher margins because we can negotiate prices, unlike branded drugs, where there is one manufacturer and that manufacturer tells us the price. Any time a brand-name product comes off patent, it presents us with an opportunity, because people expect to have competitively priced generics the next day. We can make that happen. And a large number of drugs are coming off patent in the next few years. \b \u001d  SM: Now an easy one. Politics. What does a Democratic-controlled Congress mean for the pharmaceutical industry? \u001d  DY: They may be tempted to tinker with the free-market system. I hope they don't. \b \u001d  SM: Like allowing the Medicare system to negotiate drug prices? \u001d  DY: I mean anything that violates free-market principles. The pharmaceutical industry needs to be able to continue to invest in research and come up with new drugs. That's what ultimately reduces health care costs. You can't set up a system where the pharmaceutical industry doesn't have the incentive to innovate. That said, we spend a lot of time in Washington, and I don't see anything that scares me to death. \b \u001d  SM: What would scare you to death? \u001d  DY: Unrestricted importation. Once you open up the borders, you lose control. In this country, when you get a prescription, take it to your pharmacy, get the medicine, take it and it doesn't work, you or the physician probably wouldn't say, \"Well, gosh, maybe this is counterfeit merchandise.\" You'd never even consider that. In the rest of the world, that's a consideration. Fake drugs have been traced to AmerisourceBergen in the past. \b \u001d  SM: What has changed? \u001d  DY: The three big distributors now buy directly from the manufacturers. So we have essentially secured the channel. Counterfeit drugs really aren't an issue, except for on the Internet. Internet pharmacies are a serious issue. It's a great risk, in my opinion -- a very bad value proposition. \b \u001d  SM: What about Wal-Mart? Is its $4 generic drug plan -- which is also being adopted by Target -- squeezing your business? \u001d  DY: It hasn't affected our customers, the drugstores we sell to. We haven't had any material change in the purchase of generics. \b \u001d  SM: Do you expect it to? \u001d  DY: No. Most of the customers of the pharmacies we sell to have medical plans. The pricing difference Wal-Mart is offering isn't enough to cause them to change pharmacies. Plus, a lot of people are going to Wal-Mart looking for $4 prescriptions and can't find them. That pricing is for a limited number of drugs that have been off patent for a while. There's a good chance you can get those drugs for a competitive price at your neighborhood drugstore. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 06:00 ET (11:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"46308449022597daddae0526e45022d9","symR":["35493.AE","OCENY","NL0000354934"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Analysts Had Seen Oce 4Q 06 Net Pft EUR20.8M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T06:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["35493.AE","OCENY","NL0000354934"],"IndustryCodes":["OFF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 01:38 ET (06:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4656099b132059eed3b21a12aa0e4864","symR":["532540.BY","TTA.YY","INE467B01029"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"India TCS: Pipeline Has 10 Deals Worth $50M-$100M Each","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T13:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["532540.BY","TTA.YY","INE467B01029"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","TSX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 08:02 ET (13:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"46f0f16e09e93302b673b74f588dcb78","symR":["SRZ"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Sunrise Provides Update On Pending Restatement","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SRZ"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MCLEAN, Va., Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. (NYSE: SRZ) today provided an update on the status of its pending financial restatement.  The Company and its outside auditor, Ernst & Young, LLP, continue to work diligently toward completion of the Company's previously announced restatement.  Sunrise believes it is close -- weeks, not months -- to submitting its recast 2005 financial information to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its review, the essential first step in the process.  However, due to factors including the complexity of the issues involved, the need to clear comments with the SEC, as well as the ongoing review by the recently formed special committee of the board of directors, Sunrise will not be current with all SEC filings, including the 2006 Form 10-Qs and 2006 Form 10-K by March 1, 2007, as previously anticipated. \b \u001d  Sunrise plans to hold its quarterly conference call on February 27, 2007 to provide a further update on this review and the progress toward completion of its restatement, as well as preliminary selected financial and operating data for the fourth quarter 2006.  At such time, Sunrise also will report on progress with respect to the Company's 2006 Form 10-K, which Sunrise does not expect to be filed on time due to the need to first complete the amended 2005 Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs for the first three quarters of 2006. \b \u001d  \"We share the disappointment of our investors and other stakeholders regarding this delay,\" said Brad Rush, chief financial officer, \"Rather than continue to predict the date of the ultimate end of the process, which depends on third parties, we will continue to provide interim updates as we proceed, as fast as possible, toward completion.\" \b \u001d  Paul Klaassen, chairman and CEO added, \"Although this frustrating process has taken longer than any of us had anticipated, I am pleased to report that the underlying business of Sunrise is healthy and growing.  As reported, in the third quarter of 2006, our occupancy was over 94 percent, our average daily rate for same communities increased almost 6 percent and our development pace continues, with 46 communities under construction.  Today's announcement of the sale of the Sunrise REIT to Ventas underscores the value created by Sunrise development, operating expertise and brand.  In addition, we are excited about our recently announced joint venture with Pramerica to invest $1 billion in European development.  We will not be distracted from our core mission of championing quality of life for all seniors.\" \b \b    Update on Accounting Review \b \u001d  Sunrise reiterated that the restatement does not affect Sunrise's cash flow or the cumulative amount of profits and losses it generates from its venture partnerships or sales of real estate, but rather the timing of the income it recognizes. \b \u001d  As previously announced, Sunrise will restate its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005. The Company has undertaken a comprehensive review of its significant accounting policies, and in addition to the items described in the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 31, 2006, the Company also expects to adjust its financial statements for the periods to be restated for certain other items, including the following: 1) adjustments stemming from a review of the Company's methodology for capitalization of indirect project costs under FAS 67 Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects and 2) adjustments to a portion of the expenses incurred on behalf of owners in Sunrise's role as manager and to the corresponding community contract services reimbursement revenue.  Adjustments to the reimbursed expense and corresponding revenues are not expected to impact the Company's net income because any adjustment should reduce both revenue and expense by an equal amount. The cumulative impact of the restatement, including the two other items mentioned above, is anticipated to reduce net income for all periods impacted, including 1999 through 2005, by no more than $100 million. Approximately 50 percent of this amount relates to the periods from 1999 through 2002.  The Company expects the substantial majority of the reduction to be recaptured within the next 24 months.  Both the cumulative amount of the adjustments and the estimated timing of the recapture continue to be consistent with the Company's prior estimates. \b \b    Update on Timing of Restatement \b \u001d  As previously announced, the board of directors has appointed a special independent committee to review recent insider sales of Sunrise stock and the Company's historical practices related to stock option grants. The special committee has retained independent outside legal counsel to assist in its review. \b \u001d  The Board's decision to appoint the special committee followed receipt of a letter from a union shareholder, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), that was simultaneously sent to news outlets, which resulted in media coverage and a subsequent request by the SEC for information about matters raised in the media reports. The Company believes SEIU's actions are designed to put pressure on management as the union attempts to organize certain of our team members. \b \u001d  \"Sunrise is committed to sound corporate governance, integrity and transparency,\" said Thomas Newell, president of Sunrise.  \"We have taken appropriate action, such as the appointment of the special committee, to ensure that our shareholders, team members and residents are completely comfortable with our actions. While we are disappointed with the union's tactics, they will not distract us from our focus on building our business and providing the highest quality of service to our customers and residents.\" \b \u001d  At this time Sunrise is unable to provide an expected date for the filing of its restated 2005 Form 10-K, its 2006 Form 10-Qs and its 2006 Form 10-K. Sunrise believes it is close to submitting its recast 2005 financial information to the SEC for its review.  This recast financial information will provide the SEC a summary of the items to be restated and their resulting impact. \b \u001d  As previously reported, Sunrise has received comments from the SEC with respect to certain filings, including its Form 10-K, as originally filed for the year ended December 31, 2005.  Sunrise has responded to the comments but is unable to predict the timing or outcome of the SEC accounting staff's review of its response or of its to-be-submitted preliminary recast 2005 financial information.  Once this review is completed Sunrise will prepare full financial statements, including footnotes and disclosures, for completion of Sunrise's restated 2005 Form 10-K. The filing of this 10-K will also require completion or substantial completion by the special independent committee of its review.  Sunrise cannot currently predict the timing of these steps. \b \u001d  Sunrise expects to file the 2006 Form 10-Qs and Form 10-K as soon as possible following the filing of the restated 2005 Form 10-K.  Sunrise also is continuing to cooperate fully with the SEC's information requests and review of matters raised in the media reports prompted by the letter from SEIU. \b \b    About Sunrise Senior Living \b \u001d  Sunrise Senior Living, a McLean, Va.-based company, employs more than 40,000 people. As of September 30, 2006, Sunrise operated 436 communities in the United States, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, with a combined capacity for more than 50,000 residents. Sunrise also had 46 communities under construction in these countries with a combined capacity for more than 6,000 additional residents. Sunrise offers a full range of personalized senior living services, including independent living, assisted living, care for individuals with Alzheimer's and other forms of memory loss, as well as nursing, rehabilitative and hospice care. Sunrise's senior living services are delivered by staff trained to encourage the independence, preserve the dignity, enable freedom of choice and protect the privacy of residents.

Although Sunrise believes the expectations reflected in such forward- looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurances that its expectations will be realized. Sunrise's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward- looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to; identification of any additional matters requiring restatement, the length of time needed for Sunrise to complete the restatement, and for Ernst & Young LLP to complete their procedures for any reason, including the detection of new errors or adjustments, the time required to clear comments with the SEC and other risks that are detailed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. The Company assumes no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events. \b \bSOURCE  Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. \b \u001d    /CONTACT: Lisa Mayr, Vice President, Investor Relations and Capital Markets, +1-703-744-1787 \b    /Web site: http://www.sunriseseniorliving.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 09:00 ET (14:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"47023a0d6a9c115343fc349cf65647db","symR":["VITRO.MX","VTO","MXP9802B1093"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": S&P Raises Vitro Rtg To 'B'","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T17:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VITRO.MX","VTO","MXP9802B1093"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's: \b \u001d  MEXICO CITY (Standard & Poor's) Jan. 15, 2007--Standard & Poor' Ratings Services said today it raised its long-term corporate credit rating on Mexico-based glass manufacturer Vitro S.A.B. de C.V. (Vitro) to 'B' from 'B-', and assigned its 'B' senior unsecured debt rating to Vitro's proposed $750 million notes, due 2012 and 2017. \u001d  At the same time, Standard & Poor's raised its long-term corporate credit and senior secured debt ratings on the company's glass container manufacturing subsidiary, Vitro Envases Norteamerica, S.A. de C.V. (VENA), to 'B' from 'B-'. \u001d  The senior unsecured debt ratings on Vitro's $225 million notes, due 2013, and Servicios y Operaciones Financieras Vitro S.A. de C.V.'s $250 million notes ($152 million outstanding), due 2007, were also raised to 'CCC+' from 'CCC'. \u001d  The outlook on Vitro and VENA is stable. \u001d  The rating actions follow Vitro's announcement of the proposed bond issue, and a tender offer for VENA's senior secured guaranteed bonds, due 2011. The proceeds of the transaction will be used to refinance the bulk of debt at the holding and operating company levels. \u001d  \"The rating action reflects our expectation that the proposed issue and tender offer will be completed, and that the transactions will improve Vitro's liquidity through a manageable maturity schedule,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Jose Coballasi. \"It also reflects our expectation of continued improvement in the company's key financial ratios.\" \u001d  The rating on the proposed notes reflects the guarantee of Vitro's key subsidiaries, VENA and Vimexico S.A. de C.V., and an expected reduction in subsidiary liabilities and secured debt, which mitigates the structural subordination of holding company creditors. On issuance of the notes, the holders of Vitro's senior unsecured notes, due 2013, will be entitled to the guarantee of Vitro's key subsidiaries and, as a result, the rating on the notes will be raised to 'B' from 'CCC+'. \u001d  Standard & Poor's expects Vitro to post funds from operations to total debt of about 15% going forward, and free operating cash generation to turn positive by 2008. \u001d  \"A strong performance relative to our expectations could lead us to raise the ratings,\" said Mr. Coballasi. \"On the other hand, failure to issue the proposed bonds would lead us to lower the ratings. Any long-term trend or action that compromises Vitro's ability to deliver a financial performance in line with our expectations could also lead to a negative rating action.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:43 ET (17:43 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"471a89e27e843b9265069b6840399bde","symR":["CTCH","JCOM"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Commtouch Zero-Hour Virus Outbreak Protection to Enhance Electric Mail's Traditional Anti-Virus Solution","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T13:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CTCH","JCOM"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","SOF","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b     Managed Service Protects Nearly 1 Million Corporate Mailboxes \bMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. & BURNABY, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2007-- \u001d  Commtouch(R) (NASDAQ:CTCH), announced today that it has entered into an agreement to provide Commtouch Zero-Hour(TM) Virus Outbreak Protection to The Electric Mail Company. \b \u001d  Commtouch's Zero-Hour Virus Outbreak Protection has been integrated into VirusSMART, Electric Mail's proprietary anti-virus solution.

In some cases,\" Buehler added, \"we've even reduced inventory and had a better in-stock position on the basics.\" \b \u001d  \"We are proud to strengthen our long and successful partnership with Phillips-Van Heusen by continuing to provide them with the necessary tools to realize true demand-chain efficiencies,\" said Wayne Usie, senior vice president, retail, JDA Software. \"By utilizing robust and user-friendly functionality from JDA solutions, Philips-Van Heusen can continue to enjoy competitive advantage in today's challenging apparel industry.\" \b \b   JDA's Arthur(R) Applications Drive Improved Sales Markdowns \b \u001d  According to Buehler, Phillips-Van Heusen has leveraged the full capabilities of Arthur Allocation to improve significantly its inventory position at a very detailed level. \b \u001d  \"We had a major push to improve our position beyond item and class to the size level,\" he said. \"Now with Arthur Allocation working with our different formulas, we are doing size forecasting for basic stock merchandise and pre-pack optimization for fashion apparel. This combination has significantly contributed to our sales markdown improvements and has clearly improved our sales and margins in recent years.\" \b \b   Arthur Allocation Boosts Productivity and Efficiency \b \u001d  By implementing Advanced Allocation by Arthur(R), Phillips-Van Heusen has also experienced gains in productivity and efficiency for its employees. Buehler said the Van Heusen division's all-store allocation process routinely took between an hour and an hour-and-a-half to complete. Now with Arthur Allocation it can be done in a fraction of the time. \b \u001d  \"We can literally have it done in 10 to 15 minutes now,\" Buehler said. \"And it's a more consistent and a more accurate allocation than it used to be. That certainly is a benefit.\" \b \u001d  Another benefit the company sees is the ease of training new employees on the technology. What used to be manual training with a long learning curve is now a quick assimilation for Phillips-Van Heusen employees. \b \u001d  \"We've had quite a bit of turnover in that area of personnel, for positive reasons,\" Buehler says. \"Most of them have been able to move into higher-level positions, and the new people we bring in are up and running on the system in a matter of weeks.\" \b \b   About JDA Software Group, Inc. \b \u001d  JDA(R) Software Group, Inc. is the global leader in helping more than 5,500 retail, manufacturing and wholesale-distribution customers in 60 countries realize real demand chain results. By capitalizing on its industry position and financial strength, JDA commits significant resources to advancing the JDA Portfolio(R) suite of vertically focused supply and demand chain solutions.

(TF1) to 'A-' from 'A', and its short-term corporate credit rating on TF1 to 'A-2' from 'A-1', following TF1's acquisition of a 33.5% stake in French audiovisual company Groupe AB (not rated) for EUR230 million. \u001d  At the same time, the long-term ratings were removed from CreditWatch with negative implications, where they had been placed on Dec. 6, 2006. The outlook is stable. \u001d  \"The downgrade mainly reflects our view that TF1's post-transaction financial risk profile will not be commensurate with an 'A' rating over the next few years, and that the purchase has reduced the group's financial flexibility for additional debt-funded acquisitions,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Melvyn Cooke. \u001d  The downgrade also reflects the heightened competitive pressures that the group's core TF1 channel may be facing in the medium term. \u001d  Standard & Poor's expects that TF1 will maintain its superior positions in the French TV and advertising markets. We also expect that, in the next few years, TV viewing and advertising in France will not be materially affected by growth in Internet usage and advertising. The outlook also assumes that TF1 will maintain a conservative financial policy, including moderate acquisition activity. \u001d  To sustain an 'A-' rating TF1 will need to maintain solid credit ratios, such as FFO to net debt in excess of 40%. \u001d  \"Given the expected improvements in TF1's operating performance already factored into the ratings, there is no rating upside at this point,\" said Mr. Cooke. \"However, any marked deterioration in TV consumption or in the group's competitive position could put pressure on the ratings.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 11:43 ET (16:43 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4ae39300d349a831c277119b752e9c3c","symR":["GE","SMIN.LN","GB0008182700","US3696041033"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Smiths Group To Sell Aerospace Unit To General Electric","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T07:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GE","SMIN.LN","GB0008182700","US3696041033"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","IDD","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 02:01 ET (07:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4b3a9881a7864b6cdc3bb7f96f9fb243","symR":["WJCI"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": WJ Communications Revolutionize the UHF Gen2 RFID Reader Module Market","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T13:59:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WJCI"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b   Industry's First RFID Reader Module Based on Gen2 Reader Chipset \bSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2007-- \u001d  WJ Communications, Inc.

But savvy investors can make up for any hit to the pocketbook with some strategic moves in their portfolios. \u001d  Blame the U.S.'s monster-size current-account deficit, $800 billion as of November. To pay for everything from flat-screen televisions to oil, Americans have flooded the world with dollars, and the higher supply has naturally lowered the value of a buck. In addition, central banks around the world are raising interest rates, making cash investments denominated in foreign currencies more attractive. The dollar isn't going to recover anytime soon, says Scott Merritt, chief equity strategist for JPMorgan Asset Management. But investors can profit from the dollar's fall: For starters, buy foreign stocks. Many investors have just 20 percent in international stocks, Merritt says, and essentially that means \"they're taking a huge bet against the rest of the world.\" The iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA, $73) exchange-traded fund gives  shareholders access to the biggest publicly traded firms based outside the U.S. \u001d  A more specific bet on the yen -- through iShares MSCI Japan (EWJ, $14) -- will pay off as well, according to Merrill Lynch Foreign Exchange Strategist Steven Englander, who says the yen is particularly undervalued versus the dollar. \u001d  Not eager to go abroad? The further the dollar declines, the more hotel stocks outperform the broad market, according to research from Merrill Lynch. Hotels get fully booked with foreigners flocking to the U.S. for bargain shopping and cheap vacations.

That means investors in Korea and some international markets may see a wave of initial public offerings from a healthy, attractive sector that has previously been off limits. \u001d  After years of debate, the South Korean government is widely expected to approve in the next few weeks a plan to change the ownership structure of the nation's life-insurance companies, allowing them to raise more money through public offerings. Analysts expect about 20 companies to get listed in the next few years. \u001d  Of these, they expect five to 10 to list shares or depositary receipts overseas, such as in Hong Kong, London or New York, as well as in Korea. Investment bankers who have talked to the companies say some of them might raise about $500 million each on overseas markets, and others may aim for offerings with proceeds of $1 billion or more. \u001d  That would create a sizable amount of international fund-raising activity by Korea-based companies, following just three share listings on overseas markets during 2006. That included Lotte Shopping, which raised nearly $4 billion, a record amount for a Korean company, by getting listed in London and Seoul. \u001d  The prospect of a livelier IPO scene is one of several developments that may pull the Korean stock market out of the doldrums, where it has been since April. Korean stocks rose just 4% in 2006, coming in better than the 1.9% gain in the Topix index in Japan but well below the double-digit gains seen virtually everywhere else in the region. \u001d  For the life-insurance firms, the key to public offerings is resolution of disputes that began in 1989 when Korea's two largest life insurers, Samsung Life Insurance and Kyobo Life Insurance, increased the value of their real-estate holdings to be in line with the country's growing economy and in turn raised their equity value. This led policyholders, who were part owners of the firms by virtue of the mutual-ownership structure, to contend they were entitled to a payout from the increased equity value. \u001d  The disputes deepened over the past 10 years, particularly those involving life insurers that are just one part of a bigger conglomerate that has many types of businesses. Many of those conglomerates were chosen by the government in the 1960s to enter certain businesses and receive assistance and trade protection to grow. \u001d  In addition, the government encouraged Korean citizens over the next few decades to buy financial products, such as life insurance, from those conglomerates. Their financial units in turn helped fund the growth of their other businesses. \u001d  In the most extreme case of this relationship, Samsung Life is one of the largest shareholders in Samsung Electronics, which is now the country's largest company by revenue, profit and market value. As the value of Samsung Electronics began to soar in the 1990s, it made Samsung Life more valuable, and policyholders raised questions about whether they were seeing the fruits of that appreciation. \u001d  Civic groups, government agencies and even leading politicians jumped into the debate. Last year, the Korea Exchange appointed a committee to study whether life insurers had treated their policyholders fairly. Last week, that committee released a report saying that they had and that if life-insurance firms wanted to raise money on public stock markets, they could keep the proceeds for themselves. \u001d  Korea's stock-market regulator and finance ministry are now reviewing that recommendation. If they also give a green light as expected, the first initial public offerings from the sector may emerge as soon as the second half of the year, investment bankers say. \u001d  The size and timing of the listings are a guessing game, and some companies are likely to wait for others to go first. \"We definitely see life insurance as a big wave in Korea,\" says Barton Lee, an investment banker at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. \"We are excited that Korean life insurers will be able to undertake IPOs over the next two to three years to finance future growth.\" \u001d  Kyobo Life, South Korea's No. 2 life-insurance company by assets, is likely to list ahead of Samsung Life, the biggest. The Samsung unit's structure is bound up with Samsung Electronics and other parts of the Samsung conglomerate, which might need to undertake a broader restructuring to accommodate the life-insurance listing. \u001d  In addition to those two, other candidates for listings that could include an international component are Hungkuk Life Insurance, Dongbu Life Insurance, Mirae Asset Life and Tong Yang Life Insurance. \u001d  Moving to shareholder ownership would infuse the insurance companies with capital to compete with multinational firms, such as MetLife, that are becoming more prominent in Korea. It would also subject the companies' management to the pressure of shareholder review, likely resulting in more innovative and flexible products. \u001d  \"The big players are losing their market share,\" says Jang Hyo Sun, insurance-industry analyst at Samsung Securities in Seoul. \"They need a capital injection to compete against foreign competitors and other domestic financial companies that reformed several years ago.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4ccfa6d6fcef80b3820dc9325c4c503c","symR":["VED.LN","GB0033277061"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Vedanta Resources Sees Further Reduction In TCRCs In 4Q","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T07:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VED.LN","GB0033277061"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 02:08 ET (07:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4cd7219b0a21d39fd4e0ff4567ef857a","symR":["UKDAY","UKDAY"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EUROPEAN MORNING BRIEFING: Corporate Events","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T06:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\bCarillion (CLLN.LN): Trading Update \u001d  Note: Carillion seen reporting a positive trading statement, says Citigroup.

The Board of Trustees believes a creeping takeover would be detrimental to the best interests of the unitholders and the REIT, and the plan gives the Board an effective tool in responding to such an initiative. The plan also enables the REIT to obtain the best value for all unitholders and provides the unit ownership stability to protect the opportunity for all unitholders to participate in the existing transaction with Cominar Real Estate Investment Trust (\"Cominar\") or any other future transaction involving the REIT. \b \bThe rights plan will not prevent an offer made to all unitholders for all of their units, and will not have any impact on the takeover bid of Cominar forming part of the combination previously announced on December 4, 2006. \b \bThe rights issued under the rights plan will become exercisable when a person, together with any parties related to it, acquires or announces its intention to acquire 20% or more of the REIT's outstanding units without complying with the \"Permitted Bid\" provisions of the rights plan or without approval of the Board of the REIT. Should such an acquisition occur, rights holders (other than the acquiring person and related persons) can purchase units of the REIT at half the prevailing market price at the time the rights become exercisable. \b \bUnder the rights plan, a Permitted Bid is a bid made to all holders of the REIT's units for all of their units which provide that the offeror may take up and pay for the units only if at least 50% of the outstanding units, other than those owned by the offeror and certain related parties, have been tendered. \b \bThe rights have been issued on January 14, 2007 to holders of record at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, January 12, 2007. The issuance of the units upon exercise of the rights is subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals.

That's exactly the question a national telecommunications service provider to government facilities, based in a coastal city on the Gulf Coast, asked itself when it started evaluating an upgrade to its on-site, call distribution (ACD) and voice interaction (IVR) system.  After reviewing a number of different proposals from both on-premises and off-premises vendors, the company narrowed the field down to six competitors and eventually selected inContact(TM) from UCN, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: UCNN).  This new UCN customer supports over 50,000 daily users of its specialized telephone products. \b \b    The Challenge \b \u001d  On a fast track growth curve, the company's billing inquiry and customer service group was rapidly out growing its allotted space at headquarters.  \"We had maxed out our older phone system, which wasn't very flexible and was expensive to maintain and support,\" said M. Phillips, Director of Billing Management.  \"That old system could handle maybe six more stations before we had to go through a major, expensive upgrade.  We knew over the next six months our team was going to expand well beyond six stations.\"  Compounding the problem, the organization had to retain an external technical contractor to handle all changes that needed to be made to the call handling system. \b \u001d  With hold times hitting 15 to 20 minutes during peak periods, the company's abandonment rate would spike up as high as 26 percent.  The target was 5 percent.  Prior to inContact, said Phillips, \"our only solution was to throw people at the problem.\" \b \b \b    The Solution \b    Among Phillips' key vendor selection criteria were: \b    *  Ability to easily expand and contract the workforce as needed \b    *  Support for at-home workers \b    *  Flexible programming environment; ability to start out basic and modify \b       call flows and skill groups over time \b    *  Ease of integration with an existing database \b    *  Ability to train an internal person to handle simple adds, moves and \b       changes as needed \b    *  Reliability and availability; get key equipment and software off-site \b \b \u001d  Currently, 42 customer service and tech support reps are on inContact. Over the next two months, the company plans to expand into another location, adding 20 to 30 more agent seats. \b \u001d  The inContact Call Back feature is helping the company reduce hold times and improve its abandonment rate during peak periods.  Instead of remaining on hold, the system enables the caller to drop off the line, while holding the caller's place in queue.  When that call comes to the front of the queue, the system automatically calls back the customer and connects the call to the first available agent. \b \u001d  Prior to inContact, whenever Phillips wanted to create a new outbound campaign to support a new correctional facility, \"We had to wait for a developer to do that for us.  After seeing our new system, I feel like several of us have the expertise to handle this ourselves,\" said Phillips. \b \b    Business Benefits \b \u001d  Among the benefits of doing business with UCN, Phillips found the company's expertise in call center best practices and deep knowledge of telecom long distance services help the company put a program together that reduced overall telecom spend.  \"What we will save in telecom costs should cover the costs of our inContact agent seats,\" estimates Phillips.  Equally important, when hurricane season hits again next, \"we have removed all ACD/IVR equipment from this building, plus we've removed the need for a technical contractor to support the equipment and software,\" observed Phillips.  With the company's continued eye on growth, the need to accommodate future rep stations shows no sign of slowing down. \b \b    About UCN, Inc. \b \u001d  UCN (OTC Bulletin Board: UCNN) is the leading provider of all-in-one, off-premises contact handling services that improve the customer contact experience and the productivity of those handling the contacts.

The process will be driven by how the global banking industry evolves, especially in countries like Italy and Germany, he said. \u001d  \"Germany, France, Italy are important merger countries,\" he added. \"That process is currently still taking place. The catalyst for cross-border consolidation (would be) that the consolidation process in those countries comes to an end.\" \u001d  \"If a German bank, for instance, now had to chose between a German partner and Rabo, it will directly come to a conclusion that a German partner offers more cost synergies than Rabo.\" \u001d  He added: \"It strikes me that European banks used to be far more European (in thinking) ... Every large bank belonged in some way or another to another European bank's network. There was really an idea to create European champions.\" \u001d  Now, he said, chairmen usually have a domestic mentality and \"have no or barely any plans to merge on a European level.\" \u001d  Heemskerk recalled from the period between 1969 and 1972, when he worked for Amro - a predecessor of domestic rival ABN Amro Holding NV (ABN) - that there were serious plans of a merger with Deutsche Bank (DB), Midland Bank (now part of HSBC Group) and Societe Generale (13080.FR). \b \b                      Agricultural Roots \b \u001d  The roots of Rabobank, which boasts a Triple-A rating from the major credit rating agencies, lie in the late 19th century, when two cooperative banks offered farmers access to the capital market. \u001d  Since then, the Utrecht-based bank has evolved into an all-finance international group that offers, besides retail services, Internet banking, insurance through its participation in Eureko, investment and corporate banking, leasing and real estate investing. \u001d  Heemskerk said that in the event of a merger, preference would go to other banks that have the same agricultural origins. \u001d  Similar financial groups \"with which we see ourselves eventually doing business with\" include France's Credit Agricole SA (4507.FR) and Austria's Raiffeisen, although Heemskerk didn't exclude a partnership with other types of banks, \"as long as we can preserve our identity.\" \u001d  If 2006 was the \"year of truth\" for Rabobank, then 2007 will be the year of consolidating recently acquired businesses, Heemskerk said. The bank was the most active Dutch player in the past year, spending $851 million on California's Mid-State Bank & Trust and EUR845 million for Bouwfonds, a Dutch real estate developer. \u001d  But Rabo also bought participation in banks in Indonesia, Zambia, Tanzania and raised its stake in Swiss Bank Sarasin & Cie AG (BSAN.EB). For 2007, Rabobank expects to take some smaller steps, Heemskerk said. \u001d  \"At that time (of buying Mid-State bank), we chose between expanding on the West Coast or in the Midwest. We chose (the West Coast). We likely won't take any further step in the U.S. for now, although we keep looking for good opportunities,\" Heemskerk said. \u001d  In Internet banking, however, Rabobank plans to launch in Australia, adding a fourth market to Ireland, Belgium and New Zealand. \u001d  Rabobank thus follows in the footsteps of its domestic competitor, bank and insurance giant ING Groep NV (ING), to offer online banking services. \u001d  \"Eventually we will launch in more countries that we're already active, like the U.S. and Poland. Within five years, we expect to be active in Poland and the U.S,\" he said. \u001d  Rabobank also holds a 37% stake in insurance group Eureko, after the merger of Rabo's insurance arm Interpolis with the Dutch arm of Eureko, Achmea. \u001d  Heemskerk, who said he was pleased with the cooperation, said that eventually Rabobank will consider another step to strengthen ties with Achmea's parent Eureko, but he declined to elaborate. \u001d  \"Let's say we're engaged now and if things really go well, why not consider a marriage?\" Heemskerk said. \u001d  Rabobank will present its full-year figures in March. Heemskerk indicated that it \"would be very strange if we don't meet our group net-profit growth target of 10-12%\" and also said that Rabobank currently has a 25.9% market share of the Dutch mortgage market. \u001d  Heemskerk is equally optimistic about the Dutch economy, which economists at the Utrecht-based lender have forecast to grow by 3.25% in gross domestic product. Rabobank also expects costs related to the implementation of several regulatory directives to be lower than in 2006. \"We think we're past the worst now,\" he said. \u001d  Heemskerk, 63, and former chief executive of Dutch private bank Van Lanschot (30263.AE), took the helm of Rabobank in December 2002. Heemskerk, who earned a degree in theology under the current Pope, Joseph Ratzinger, will stay with Rabobank for at least another year-and-a-half, he said. \u001d  \"I'm still in good health, I have no plans to stop yet.\" \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.rabobank.com \u001d  -By Nicolas Parasie, Dow Jones Newswires; nicolas.parasie@dowjones.com; 31 20 6260770 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 01:45 ET (06:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4f7eefe18743f3882d2803a723a21468","symR":["DWV.LN","GB0002652740"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Lehman Had Rated Derwent Valley Equalweight","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T05:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DWV.LN","GB0002652740"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","RED","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 00:58 ET (05:58 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4f8152f5ce55588bb8ed19d794415fe4","symR":["GE","SMIN.LN","GB0008182700","US3696041033"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Smiths Grp CEO: Well Placed To Make Buys Worth GBP500M -2","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T10:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GE","SMIN.LN","GB0008182700","US3696041033"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","IDD","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Earlier on Monday, Smiths said it is selling its aerospace division to General Electric Co.

Following the acquisition of Sunrise REIT's assets, all of the issued and outstanding units of Sunrise REIT will be redeemed at a redemption price of Cdn$15.00 per unit. The consideration payable to unitholders represents a 35.7% premium over the closing price of the units on Friday, January 12, 2007.

The Special Committee and the board of trustees of Sunrise REIT recommend that unitholders vote in favour of the transaction. \b \u001d  \"We are proud of the outstanding premium that we have been able to deliver to our unitholders through this transaction.

CSR has acquired NordNav Technologies AB and Cambridge Positioning Systems Ltd that, combined, will allow the company to provide software-based low cost GPS suitable for mass-market mobile phones and PNDs (Personal Navigation Devices). CSR will apply its own experience in embedding radio technologies into the mobile platform and expects its first Autonomous and Assisted GPS product offerings that support satellite navigation and other location-based services to be available during H1 2007, with cost expected to subsequently reduce to less than $1. \b \b   CSR's GPS technology will be demonstrated at 3GSM Congress, 12-15 \bFebruary, Barcelona. \b \u001d  The two acquisitions enable CSR to offer a GPS solution to handset, PND and other portable device manufacturers, offering an important added-value technology. CSR's acquired patented GPS solution is a software-based architecture that allows an incremental price that falls to less than $1 of the overall BoM when used with CSR's Bluetooth technology. CSR's patented methods to reduce both the number of processor cycles and the time to first fix, give an extremely power efficient overall solution with less than half the processing requirements of alternative solutions, whilst remaining flexible enough to perform highly dynamic and accurate tracking. With availability during H107, the software GPS technology acquired from NordNav will also take up 80 percent less area than competing hardware solutions and is the lowest cost solution on the market, with a price that is set to fall to less than $1. This means that CSR's GPS technology is practical for mass-market mobile applications including low-medium end feature cellular handsets, Smartphones, PNDs, and other portable devices. \b \b   CSR saw that GPS solutions needed to be much smaller, lower cost, \band less power - and processor - hungry to enable a dramatic increase \bin mobile handset attach rates for personal positioning and location \bbased services. To ensure the technology is usable, it is also \bessential that it works in harmony with GSM/3G radios, that the \bsatellite signal acquisition time is reduced, and that location fixes \bcan be maintained in all environments - even indoors. CSR acquired \bNordNav Technologies AB and Cambridge Positioning Systems Ltd to bring \btogether the solutions to all these hurdles, and combined the \btechnology with its own expertise in embedding wireless technologies \binto small and power sensitive mobile applications. \b \u001d  CSR has acquired Cambridge Positioning Systems Ltd for its Extended GPS (EGPSTM) software algorithms for mobile handsets and network server software. These algorithms allow users to achieve a faster location fix (less than 3 seconds), and also provide GPS coverage in dense urban areas and even indoors where there is no access to GPS satellite signals. In addition to improved user experience, the faster fix means that in comparison to conventional Assisted GPS, power can be reduced by a factor of 10 or more. \b \b   With a combined GPS and EGPS software for handsets, CSR will be \bable to offer the most competitive, complete and technically advanced \bmobile GPS solution available to mobile handset, PND, and other \bportable device makers and operators. CSR's GPS technology will \bsupport the Galileo global standard. \b \u001d  Matthew Phillips, SVP of CSR's Mobile Handset Connectivity strategic business unit, commented, \"At $5-$10, current GPS solutions are too expensive and just not practical for mainstream cellphone applications\" Phillips continued, \"There are also performance restrictions in terms of both handset and network that have meant that the technology is not appropriate for the mobile platform. The two acquisitions mean that CSR has removed the barriers for mobile handset makers and operators to provide location based services for the mass market.\" \b \b   About CSR \b \b   CSR is the leading global provider of personal wireless technology \band its product portfolio covers Bluetooth, FM receivers and WiFi \b(IEEE802.11).

2007-- \u001d  MEDIACOM COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (NASDAQ: MCCC) announced that it again offered to submit to binding arbitration as a means of settling its ongoing retransmission consent dispute with Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SBGI). In its latest proposal to Sinclair, Mediacom would accept final binding arbitration before the FCC Media Bureau under established procedures for arbitrating retransmission consent disputes previously adopted by the FCC in the News Corp./DirecTV order published on January 14, 2004. \b \u001d  Mediacom's offer is consistent with the strong recommendation made by the Media Bureau in its recent order dated January 12, 2007, which stated: \b \u001d  Although the Commission does not have the authority to require the parties to submit to binding arbitration, we continue to strongly encourage them to submit to binding arbitration. Both parties could agree to final binding arbitration by the Media Bureau. If both parties agree to final binding arbitration by the Media Bureau, we would require Sinclair to authorize Mediacom's continued carriage of its stations' signals during the pendency of arbitration pursuant to the terms of the November 30, 2006 agreement between the parties, or, if so directed by the parties, pursuant to the per subscriber daily rate as proposed by Sinclair to Mediacom on January 11, 2007. \b \u001d  \"Despite our disagreement with all the Media Bureau decisions on the Sinclair matter, including whether the FCC already has the authority to order binding arbitration and continued carriage, we are heeding the FCC's strong recommendation so that it orders Sinclair to reinstate the stations immediately, with or without agreement on procedural matters,\" said John Pascarelli, Mediacom EVP of Operations. \"It is readily apparent to Mediacom, the Commission and federal lawmakers that binding arbitration is a realistic solution to this stalemate. We are hopeful that Sinclair will quickly accept this recommendation and not try to undermine the government's clear direction or stall this process by imposing unreasonable conditions on arbitration\" concluded Pascarelli. \b \u001d  Mediacom Communications is the nation's 8th largest cable television company and one of the leading cable operators focused on serving the smaller cities and towns in the United States.

But the loan would speed up the payment process. \u001d  Saudi Oger Group owns 60% of Oger Telecom, while Telecom Italia has a 10% stake in the company. Other investors include Arab Bank and Bank of Sharjah. \u001d  Oger Telecom canceled its initial public offering via lead managers ABN Amro and Citigroup in November 2006 as regional stock markets had plummeted in the weeks leading up to pricing. \u001d  -By Majdoline Hatoum, Dow Jones Newswires; +9714-223-1134; majdoline.hatoum@dowjones.com \u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 08:17 ET (13:17 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"56533ba4616f4be837c1b851f32f8e3c","symR":["FTM.YY"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Taiwan Bourse Launches Div Index,Non-Fincl/Non-Tech Index","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T10:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FTM.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TAIPEI (Dow Jones)--The Taiwan Stock Exchange launched two new indexes Monday, including one that tracks high dividend-paying Taiwan-listed companies and another that tracks Taiwan-listed stocks outside the electronics and financial sectors. \u001d  The exchange, the 21th largest in the world by market capitalization, and index provider FTSE Group jointly compiled the Taiwan Dividend Index and the Taiwan Eight Industries Index. \u001d  \"Of the two indexes, the Taiwan Dividend Index is expected to attract more investors, as they have increasingly focused on steady long-term dividend returns,\" said Chen Chien-hung, an assistant manager with the exchange's research and development department. \u001d  Barro Liao, who manages NT$2.5 billion worth of funds for Prudential Securities Investment Trust Co., said the dividend index will provide a benchmark for conservative investors. \u001d  \"I am positive...because steady dividend returns are important for investors in Taiwan where interest rates are low,\" he said. \u001d  The Taiwan Dividend Index comprises 30 firms the exchange expects to generate the highest cash dividend yields over the coming year, said Chen. \u001d  The exchange will review the 30 index components, selected from the Taiwan Mid-Cap 100 Index and the Taiwan 50 Index, every January and July. \u001d  Tung Ho Steel Enterprises Corp.

While E.U. countries are increasing their exports to India by 14% annually, those from the U.K. are growing by just 2% per year. \u001d  The committee also found the U.K. has already fallen behind the U.S., Germany, Japan and the Netherlands in the ranks of global investors in India. \u001d  Given the close historic and cultural ties between the two countries, dating back to the sixteenth century, many feel the U.K. should be doing better. \u001d  \"The amount of trade and investment from the U.K. into India should be much higher,\" says Andy Scott, director of international operations at the Confederation of British Industry. \"There should be a natural trading link there giving us as good a chance as any country.\" \u001d  By contrast, Indian companies are investing rapidly in the U.K., exemplified by steel giant Tata's near-GBP6 billion bid for Corus Group PLC (CS.LN) last year, potentially the largest ever overseas acquisition by an Indian company. India became the third largest investor into Britain worldwide in 2005, after the U.S. and Japan. \u001d  The U.K.'s trade balance with Indiain both goods and services have swung into deficit in 2005 from surpluses in the early 1990s, with Britain now India's fifth biggest export market. The DTI committee concluded the deficits are likely to widen further, with the bulk of U.K. exports to India now in areas it termed \"unsustainable\", such as scrap metal and precious stones. \u001d   Brown's political opponents say the government has missed an important opportunity, despite the chancellor's constant references to the Indian economic challenge in recent speeches. \u001d  \"We are behind in the game,\" says Matthew Hancock, economic adviser to Conservative party shadow chancellor George Osborne. \"While Brown has visited China three times in the last two years, this is his first visit to India.\" \u001d  The DTI committee found the lack of a co-ordinated approach between government agencies promoting British business in India was one reason for the deteriorating picture. \u001d  But it also criticized the complacentapproach of British businesses to the Indian market, which to date has focused on the cost savings available from outsourcing labor-intensive work. \u001d  \"Despite our long history of commerce with India, U.K. companies are falling behind their major competitors, perhaps because they tend to see India as a source of low-cost labor rather than an emerging market in its own right,\" the report concluded \u001d  The reportalso found evidence of frustration among Indian companies that British firms often send junior staff to discuss possible joint ventures, in an apparent sign of disrespect and ignorance of the opportunities in India. \u001d  \"There's been an arrogance in the U.K. approach, yet you underestimate the Indian business community at your peril,\" says Tim Sleep, director of retail at business services firm Ernst  Young, who visits India for one week in every two months. \u001d  Protected Indian business sectors haven't helped. \u001d   Financial and professional services companies in particular have been frustrated in their expansion plans. Nowhere is this clearer than in the insurance industry, where Indian law currently restricts foreign companies to operating via a limited 26% stake in domestic firms. \u001d  \"We believe that limit is anachronistic, and we'll be pressing the chancellor to raise that with the Indian government,\" says Jonathan French, a spokesman for the Association of British Insurers. \u001d  British retailers have also suffered from the Indian requirement for them to work with domestic companies as franchise partners, with even single-brand companies prevented from setting up their own operations. \u001d  But Gerard Lyons, economist at Standard Chartered, the U.K. bank with a major Indian operation, says that British companies have been unadventurous in their geographic focus, suffering from 'own-back-yard' syndrome. \u001d  In the five years to 2005, 80% of U.K. corporate acquisitions abroad were in Western Europe. U.K. PLC acquisitions in emerging markets such as India, Brazil, Russia and China fell to 2% from 8% of the total over the same period. By contrast, European company acquisitions in these markets rose to 10%  from 7% over 2000-5. \u001d  Lack of international perspective is not a problem shared by major Indian companies. \u001d  Vineet Nayar, president of business process outsourcing giant HCL Technologies, says U.K. firms have blamed Indian restrictions on business, while failing to position themselves for the opening up of its markets. \u001d  \"It seems people are finding reasons not to go into India, rather than just going,\" he says. \"You have to be early in the game in India, as it has no choice but to deregulate. Look at the retail sector - (U.S. giant) Walmart is there, so why no British companies?\" \u001d  By Andrew Peaple, Dow Jones Newswires;+44 207 842 9270;andrew.peaple@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:44 ET (12:44 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"57df3502c9d38962e6b5437c971f738c","symR":["MN.T","CA5662191017"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"March Networks Tgt Cut To C$11 From C$26 By Scotia>MN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T17:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MN.T","CA5662191017"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:45 ET (17:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"58d9b7d51337b88b97799eec8b0538ff","symR":["BP","BP.LN","GB0007980591"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Did Cost-Cutting Cause BP Blast?

Biers \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--As BP PLC (BP) girds for the public  release of an independent probe critical of its U.S. refining network, one open question is how the commission will address the debate on the role of cost-cutting in the fatal March 2005 Texas City refinery accident. \u001d  In an Oct. 31 news conference, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigations Board blamed the calamity on BP budget cuts, a finding that endorsed what plaintiffs' attorneys had been saying for months. But BP rejected the CSB finding, echoing outgoing Chief Executive John Browne, who said on Oct. 24 of Texas City that \"this is not do with costs.\" \u001d  Though ordered to assess the \"effectiveness\" of BP's \"corporate oversight of safety management,\" the Baker charter urges the panel to \"avoid duplicating\" the CSB's work and said the panel \"should not seek to affix blame or apportion responsibility for any past event.\" \u001d   But even if the report doesn't directly address cost-cutting in Texas City, Baker and his fellow commissioners could be queried on the broader issue of corporate policy on spending during a news conference Tuesday in Houston. The report follows a series of problems at BP's U.S. division that include major oil spills in Alaska and a federal crackdown on its energy trading practices as anti-competitive. BP has generally resisted suggestions that it suffers from systemic corporate problems. \u001d  The report focuses on \"systemic\" problems within BP's refining network, concluding that an over-emphasis on recordable safety incidents, such as fatalties, distracted from looming process safety challenges, according to a person who has received the report. While the report praises changes at BP's refinery since Texas City, it says a more substantial commitment is still needed. \u001d  The report follows the committee's charter and does not focus on cost-cutting, this person said. \u001d  BP America Chairman and President Bob Malone scheduled a a news conference in Houston Tuesday to respond to the report. Outgoing CEO Browne will appear via video link from London, according a BP advisory. \u001d  Besides the costs issue, other key issues that could be raised include the panel's views of personnel changes and safety improvements at BP since the March 2005 accident; whether BP's problems are company-specific or industry-wide; whether the flaws uncovered have significance in some of BP's other well-publicized travails in Alaska and its U.S. trading unit; and how vulnerable BP's refinery network is to further accidents. \b \b   Limited Scope In Prior Review \b \u001d  BP appointed Baker in October 2005 to lead the commission in response to an urgent CSB recommendation for a high-level assessment after the Texas City disaster, which killed 15 workers and injured over 170. Since that time, BP has been fined by federal or state occupational safety agencies in Washington, Ohio and Indiana after violations at refineries in those states. \u001d  BP's December 2005 report on Texas City cited a confluence of management and worker errors in the blast, which occurred after gases spewed from an overfilled refinery unit and ignited, killing workers who were stationed in and around a temporary trailer. The report said Texas City's budget had \"steadily increased\" for the prior 10 years. But the report faulted anemic worker training and poor commitment to process safety. \u001d  \"A workplace environment characterized by poor motivation, unclear expectations around supervisory/management behaviors, no clear system of reward and consequences, and high distrust between leadership and the workforce, had developed over a number of years within the site,\" BP said. \u001d  The report, a technical analysis of the calamity, didn' address London's responsibility for the accident. BP has undertaken a separate accountability review of senior management responsibility, but that is not expected to be made public. \u001d   The Baker report, an appraisal of BP safety culture at five U.S. refineries, comes on the heels of Friday's surprise announcement that global exploration and production chief Tony Hayward would succeed Browne this summer, more than a year ahead of schedule. \u001d  BP shares soared on news of the transition, a move that analysts attributed to the benefits of removing a lame-duck CEO during a difficult time for the company. Given that the market has been primed for weeks about the report, analysts said they don't expect shares to be dramatically affected by even a harsh Baker analysis. \u001d  \"Although this is anticipated to be a very damning report into the way BP operated its refining operations, we believe that many of the recommendations of the report have been adopted by BP,\" said London-based analysts at Teather and Greenwood. \u001d  The report could add momentum to litigation and various government probes into BP's operations. Brent Coon, a plaintiffs attorney who has led the Texas City litigation against BP, plans to meet with staff from the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency Tuesday to discuss an ongoing criminal probe into the accident, Coon said. \u001d  \"We've been talking to them on a regular basis,\" Coon said of his dealings with government investigators. Bad weather postponed a Galveston hearing on the Texas City civil litigation that had also been scheduled for Tuesday morning. BP has allotted $1.6 billion in reserves for Texas City litigation. \u001d  Coon, who still has more than 150 Texas City cases pending, said the Baker report would have a limited impact at this stage of the litigation. \b \b   'The Company Is Going To Pay Up.' \b \u001d  Harlan Platt, a business professor at Northeastern University who has written extensively on corporate turnarounds, said the transition atop the company sets the stage for BP to move quickly to resolve outstanding litigation and government probes. \"The company is going to pay up,\" he said. \"This thing simply plays out with BP making payments in the hundreds of millions, if not billions, to put the problems behind them.\" \u001d  Platt described the move to speed the Browne-Hayward transition as a \"watershed\" event for the company, given Browne's dominating hand with the company and its Board of Directors. Pointing to stock market data over the last six months, Platt said BP has underperformed peers like Chevron Corp (CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) by more than 20%. Given that discount, Platt, who owns no shares of BP, said he expects BP to be a hot stock in the coming months. \u001d  \"BP has been cleansed by the public exposure of its problems,\" Platt said. \"There are no more skeletons.\" \b \u001d  -By John M.

( TSX: \bHBP / Frankfurt: WKN 918864 ) \b\b \b   The press release most recently issued by International Penta is yet \banother reiteration of Mr. Janssen's previous complaints, but he fails to \bstate certain important information. \b\b \b   Mr. Janssen knows that as a biopharmaceutical company's product candidates \bgraduate to the advanced and pivotal clinical development levels, as Helix is \bactively pursuing, capital requirements increase significantly. \b\b \b   Biopharmaceutical companies must go through many rounds of financing as \bthey grow. It is imperative that Helix is always prepared to take on \bfinancing. Helix has obtained TSX pre-clearance for the proposed resolution to \bdo so before April 12th, 2007. Obtaining shareholder approval in advance is a \bprecondition to being so prepared. Helix's legal and financial advisors \brecommend this strategy. Leading international investment banks have also \brecommended this strategy to Helix. Management believes this advice is based \bupon sound business judgment. To proceed otherwise would be irresponsible. Mr. \bJanssen knows this. \b\b \b   Moreover, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), the world's leading \bprovider of proxy voting and corporate governance solutions to the \binternational marketplace, has observed that the private placement resolution \bis proposed in the ordinary course of business. \b\b \b   Mr. Janssen was made fully aware of Helix's expanding capital requirements \bfor 2007, and was given the opportunity to raise the stated capital. Helix did \bnot accept his financing proposals due to their high costs, onerous \bconditions, excessive complexity and, in some cases, questionable legality. \bBased on this, Mr. Janssen's finder's fee agreement with Helix was allowed to \bexpire on December 1st, 2006. \b\b \b   Helix believes, therefore, that Mr. Janssen's primary motivation stems \bfrom the Company's termination of his business relationship with Helix, and \bnot because he has the best interest of other shareholders in mind. \b\b \b\b \b\b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b\b \b\b                       VOTE YOUR YELLOW HELIX PROXY NOW \b\b \b\b                           DO NOT VOTE A BLUE PROXY \b\b \b\b     IF YOU HAVE ALREADY VOTED A BLUE PROXY, YOU CAN REVOKE IT BY SENDING IN \b\b                           A YELLOW HELIX PROXY NOW \b\b \b\b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b\b \b\b \b   Also see Helix's response to the dissident proxy circular dated January \b10, 2007, filed at www.sedar.com and at www.helixbiopharma.com. \b\b \b   Helix recommends that all shareholders vote only their YELLOW Helix proxy \bFOR the private placement and FOR the election of Jerome F.

Wright, President and Chief Executive Officer of Eldorado Gold Corporation (\"Eldorado\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") (TSX: ELD)(AMEX: EGO), is pleased to announce the results of the pre-feasibility study and preliminary economic analysis of the Vila Nova Iron Ore Project (the \"Project\") in Amapa State, Brazil. \u001d  Eldorado can earn into 50% of the Project by fully funding the first US$8 million of project capital, and then 50% of the capital requirements beyond the first US$8 million. Total capital for the Project has been estimated at US$16.3 million. \u001d  The Project has received all necessary permits required for construction, and it is anticipated that the deforestation and mining licenses will be granted during the first half of 2007. The decision whether to proceed will be made during the first half of 2007. The expected construction period will be approximately one year. \u001d  The pre-feasibility study (\"Study\") was managed and prepared by Roberto Costa Engenharia Ltda. of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The Study was based on an expanded mineral resource for the Project. The new mineral resource included the results of an additional 9 drill holes and extensive metallurgical test work (material analysis). The metallurgical testwork was done at Miguelao Technological Research Center, which is owned by Mineracoes Brasileiras Reunidas S.A. (a company controlled by CVRD, the world's largest iron ore producer). The new data allowed most of the Projects mineral resources to be classified as Measured and Indicated resources (See Figure 1 and Table 1). \u001d  The Study used a conservative case for iron ore prices. To generate the economic pit shell an average price of US$40/tonne of product was used which represents an approximate 27% discount to 2006 average prices for iron ore. The economic analysis in the Study used US$55/tonne of product, approximately equal to 2006 prices. (Recently, CVRD has negotiated a price increase of 9.5% over 2006 prices for 2007.) Sufficient mine engineering and metallurgical test work has been completed to permit declaration of Proven and Probable mineral reserves for the Project (Table 1). The Company continues to receive expressions of interest from third parties to purchase future production and is in negotiation to access the local railroad and port facilities. \u001d  Resources and Reserves for the Vila Nova Iron Ore Project are presented in Table 1. \bTable 1 \b \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                Tonnes (x1000)           Fe%    Strip Ratio \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bMeasured & Indicated Resource          10,418           61.6            n/a \bInferred Resource                       2,532           61.3            n/a \bProven & Probable Reserve ROM           5,253           62.3          4.3:1 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \u001d  87% of ROM ore is recovered and sold as lump ore and sinter fines following crushing, screening and concentration at the minesite. \bPre-Feasibility Economic Analysis (100% Basis) \b \b         Life of Mine                -      5 years \b         Initial Capex               -      US$16.3 million \b         Working Capital             -      US$1.1 million \b         Operating Cash Flow         -      US$109.1 million \b         Pre-Tax NPV (0% discount)   -      US$91.7 million \b \u001d  The maximum general corporate tax rate in Brazil is 34%.

The thickness of the ore zone in the pit bottom averages 13 meters, with a maximum of 25 meters.

Costa, an independent mining engineer and principal of Roberto Costa Engenharia Ltda., directed the mine engineering and metallurgical testwork of the Project. \u001d  Eldorado is a gold producing and exploration company actively growing businesses in Brazil, Turkey and China. We operate the Sao Bento Mine, Kisladag Mine and Tanjianshan Mine. With our international expertise in mining, finance and project development, together with highly skilled and dedicated staff, we believe that Eldorado is well positioned to grow in value as we create and pursue new opportunities. \u001d  ON BEHALF OF ELDORADO GOLD CORPORATION \u001d  Paul N. Wright, President and Chief Executive Officer \u001d  The terms \"Mineral Reserve\", \"Proven Mineral Reserve\" and \"Probable Mineral Reserve\" used in this release are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects under the guidelines set out in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council on August 20, 2000 as may be amended from time to time by the CIM. These definitions differ from the definitions in the United States Securities & Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") Guide 7. In the United States, a mineral reserve is defined as a part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time the mineral reserve determination is made. \u001d  The terms \"Mineral Resource\", \"Measured Mineral Resource\", \"Indicated Mineral Resource\", \"Inferred Mineral Resource\" used in this release are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with National Instruction 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects under the guidelines set out in the CIM Standards. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. \u001d  For a detailed discussion of resource and reserve estimates and related matters see the Company's reports, including the Annual Information Form and FORM 40-F dated March 23, 2006 and technical reports filed under the Company's name at www.sedar.com. \u001d  Note to U.S. Investors. While the terms \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource,\" \"indicated mineral resource\", and \"inferred mineral resource\" are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, they are not defined terms under standards in the United States and normally are not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. As such, information contained in this report concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources under Canadian standards may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S companies in SEC filings. With respect to \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" there is a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and a great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It can not be assumed that all or any part of an \"indicated mineral resource\" or \"inferred mineral resource\" will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. \u001d  Certain of the statements made herein may contain forward-looking statements or information within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and forward-looking statements or information within the meaning of the Securities Act (Ontario) .

(AP)--Some workers at a massive Smithfield Foods Inc.

About 100 to 150 people miss work for a typical shift, company spokesman Dennis Pittman said. \u001d  The plant in Tar Heel, about 80 miles south of Raleigh, employs about 5,000 people and is considered the largest hog processing plant in the world. \u001d  A large number of workers at the plant are black or Hispanic, union officials have said, although they did not provide numbers. \u001d  Inside the plant, union workers took credit for shutting down a production line, but company officials said the action hadn't slowed operations. \u001d  \"They just haven't been effective,\" Pittman said. \u001d  The union and the workers asked the company last week to grant Monday as a paid holiday, with thousands of workers signing a petition with the request. The company said it had already planned Monday as a work day and that the timing of the request didn't leave them enough time to change plans. \u001d  Workers who miss work will be docked a day's pay and could be disciplined, company and union officials said last week. \u001d  Plant workers were given a choice a few years ago between having Easter or Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday.

(Nasdaq: XLNX) today introduced its latest 9.1i release of the industry's most widely-used Xilinx Integrated Software Environment (ISE(TM)) design suite optimized to address today's leading design challenges:  timing closure, productivity and power. In addition to 2.5X faster runtimes, ISE 9.1i includes new SmartCompile technology which improves run times by up to an additional 6X while maintaining exact design preservation of unchanged logic. ISE 9.1i optimizes the unique ExpressFabric(TM) technology of its latest 65nm Virtex(TM)-5 platform, providing an average of 30 percent faster performance than competing solutions. For power sensitive applications, ISE 9.1i also reduces dynamic power by an average of 10 percent. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20020822/XLNXLOGO ) \b \u001d  This revolutionary technology is facilitated by the efforts of the Xilinx-Synplicity Ultra High-Capacity Timing Closure Task Force, delivering industry-leading productivity enhancing capabilities to ensure the fastest path to timing closure and optimize the power and performance of leading-edge Xilinx Virtex(TM) Series and Spartan(TM)-3 Generation FPGAs. \b \u001d  \"Fast implementation runtimes and predictable timing results for small design changes, especially towards the end of a design cycle, are extremely important,\" said Jochen Frensch, senior technical expert, Graphics Platform, at Harmon/Becker Automotive Systems GmbH, a leading provider of customized automotive systems. \"For small design changes, XST synthesis preserved names for unchanged parts of the design and SmartGuide preserved close to 99% of the components in implementation, enabling us to see faster incremental runtimes. The new SmartGuide technology in ISE 9.1i offers a tremendous advantage.\" \b \b    Increased Productivity \b \u001d  Much of the time spent on today's most advanced designs is in re-implementing the entire design with each incremental change. These re-implementations take time and introduce the risk of disrupting portions of the design not directly involved with the change. Xilinx SmartCompile technology addresses these issues with the following technologies: \b \b \b    *Partitions:  minimize effects of minor changes late in design cycles with \b     cut-and-paste functionality that automatically provides exact \b     preservation of existing synthesis, placement and routing of unchanged \b     partitions, and reduces time for reimplementation by an average of 2.5X. \b    *SmartGuide:  reduces time for re-implementation by an average of 2X for \b     small changes by leveraging prior implementation results. \b    *SmartPreview:  enables users to pause and resume the place-and-route \b     process and save intermediate results to evaluate the state of their \b     designs. By previewing implementation information such as routing status \b     and timing results, users can make important trade-off decisions without \b     waiting for complete implementation to complete. \b \b \u001d  SmartCompile technology delivers an order of magnitude increase in productivity as a result of up to a 6X run time improvement, exact preservation of partitions, and improved visibility into the implementation. These improvements are in addition to the 2.5X faster runtimes for challenging designs. \b \u001d  ISE 9.1i also addresses the increasing sophistication of FPGA designers with a number of user interface enhancements including: \b \b \b    *Tcl command console to easily transition from the ISE graphical user \b     interface to a command line environment. \b \b    *Source code control compatibility function identifies the files necessary \b     to recreate results, which can be imported and exported for source \b     control. \b \b    Faster Timing Closure \b \u001d  New features in ISE 9.1i design tools build on capabilities of ISE Fmax technology, especially designed to deliver unparalleled performance and timing closure results for high density, high performance Virtex-5 based designs. The ISE 9.1i integrated timing closure flow incorporates enhanced physical synthesis optimizations that provide higher quality of results. Optimized routing algorithms provide the most efficient utilization of the diagonally symmetric interconnect of the 65nm ExpressFabric technology to minimize delay and fully leverage the high performance features of the Virtex-5 Platform. \b \u001d  \"Timing closure is the number one issue for FPGA designers, and this release greatly simplifies and accelerates that process,\" said Bruce Talley, vice president of the Design Software Division at Xilinx. \"Our ISE SmartCompile technology addresses the top challenges facing designers today, allowing designers to reach their performance goals in much less time with fewer, more efficient design iterations. What is just as compelling to our users is that ISE 9.1i also enables them to optimize for low power design requirements without compromises in overall performance.\" \b \u001d  Underlying the entire ISE 9.1i infrastructure is an expanded timing closure environment -- a virtual \"Timing Closure Cockpit\" -- that enables intuitive cross-probing between constraint entry, timing analysis, floorplanning and report views so designers can more easily analyze timing problems. The ISE 9.1i integrated timing closure flow incorporates enhanced physical synthesis with improved timing correlation between synthesis and placement, resulting in higher quality of results. \b \b    Power Optimization \b \u001d  New power optimization in Xilinx Synthesis Technology (XST) and placement together with improvements in routing deliver an average of 10 percent lower dynamic power for Spartan-3 Series FPGAs. XST provides power-aware logic optimizations for macro processing on blocks such as multipliers, adders and BRAMs. Implementation algorithms deploy power-efficient placement strategies and lower capacitance nets within the device to minimize power without sacrificing performance. \b \b    Pricing and Availability \b \u001d  ISE Foundation(TM) 9.1i suite is immediately available with prices starting at US $2,495. A full-featured 60-day evaluation version is available at no charge. All versions of ISE 9.1i software packages support Windows(R) 2000 and Windows XP Professional and Linux(R) Red Hat(R) Enterprise 3.0 and 4.0. ISE Foundation also supports Solaris(R) 2.8 and 2.9. \b \u001d  ISE software delivers programmable logic design solutions to over 300,000 users worldwide with an intuitive, front-to-back design environment for all Xilinx product families, including Virtex-II, Virtex-II Pro, Virtex-4 and Virtex-5 Platform FPGAs, Spartan(TM)-3 Generation FPGAs, and CoolRunner(TM)-II CPLDs. For more information about the ISE 9.1i software suite, visit www.xilinx.com/ISE . \b \b    Additional Customer Feedback \b \u001d  \"Since we use the majority of silicon features offered in Virtex-4 FX, including the Power PC, MGTs, Ethernet MACs, DSP48 blocks, FIFOs, and SERDES, implementing our design is very challenging,\" said Alex Henderson, CTO, Anagran, a leading network equipment company. \"ISE 9.1i makes it very easy to meet the timing constraint and reduces the need for manual intervention such as floorplanning. Compile times are also reduced with ISE 9.1i, at times over 35 percent as compared to previous floorplanned versions of the design. With the new SmartGuide technology, we've also seen further compile time reduction for successive iterations by 30-50 percent. We're convinced that ISE 9.1i will allow us to substantially cut our engineering time.\" \b \u001d  \"Our largest Virtex-4 designs use most of the available logic resources in the device and can be very challenging for place and route. ISE 9.1i has enabled us to reduce implementation compile times by over 4X for these challenging designs,\" said Luc Burgun, CEO, EVE, a leading hardware-assisted verification company. \"Our development team and our customers will realize significant productivity gains with ISE 9.1i.\" \b \b    About Xilinx \b \u001d  Xilinx is the worldwide leader in complete programmable logic solutions.

(AP)--A fire that broke out at an oil refinery Monday morning, injuring one worker and prompting an order for residents to stay indoors, was under control, authorities said. \u001d  The fire at Chevron Corp.'s (CVX) 240,000 barrel-per-day Richmond Refinery - the largest in the San Francisco area - began at about 5:24 a.m. PST, said Contra Costa County Hazardous Materials specialist Maria Duazo. \u001d  The fire broke out in the 240,000 b/d crude unit, according to refinery spokesman Dean O'Hair. The unit was being taken off-line for a planned turnaround at the time of the fire, O'Hair said. \u001d  As soon as crews are able to access the unit, the refinery will be able to better determine the extent of damages and see whether there's additional impact, O'Hair said. \u001d  About 1,200 employees were in the refinery when the fire broke out, but they were cleared to return to their jobs after the blaze was contained to the pump where it started when a seal failed and leaked oil, a plant spokeswoman said. \u001d  The fire was under control about 90 minutes later, and the worker's injury was minor, Chevron's O'Hair said. \u001d  Residents in nearby neighborhoods received telephone calls alerting them to the emergency at about 6 a.m. and were instructed to stay inside with their doors and windows shut to avoid breathing toxic fumes, officials said. The warning was lifted at 8:45 a.m. after air samples showed no unsafe levels of harmful chemicals from the fire. \u001d  Toll booth workers on the nearby San Rafael Bridge were also evacuated, but later allowed to return. The bridge remained open to traffic, Duazo said. \u001d  The 2,900-acre refinery, located 19 miles from San Francisco, is more than 100 years old, according to Chevron's Web site. \u001d  Richmond is home to several oil refineries, and toxic releases in the area have been common enough that officials installed 26 sirens to warn of danger and tell residents to go inside. \u001d  A March 1999 explosion and fire at the Chevron refinery sent hundreds of residents to hospitals.

The result was in line with analyst estimates of CHF444 million. \u001d  The company didn't provide a specific guidance for 2007 other than saying that \"2007 continues the positive trend experienced in 2006. \u001d  But the company reiterated its 2008 target of achieving earnings per share of CHF80. In 2006, earnings per share stood at CHF57.89, up 18.5% from the year-earlier period. \u001d  The company also didn't give any update on its plan to step up acquisitions-driven growth, a strategy it flagged late last year when it replaced Chief Executive Dan Kerpelman with company insider Chris Kirk, who it saw as more suitable to capture takeover opportunities. \u001d  Sales in 2006 rose 15.5% to CHF3.82 billion from CHF3.31 billion and earnings before interest and taxes rose 24.3% to CHF624 million from CHF502 million. Analysts had expected sales to stand at CHF3.82 billion and EBIT at CHF605 million. \u001d  As expected, the company proposed a reduced dividend of CHF20, down from the exceptionally high CHF50 per share paid last year. Expectations for the dividend had ranged between CHF18 to more than CHF30 per share. \u001d  SGS has often stated it plans to play an active role in an industry consolidation, citing the high fragmentation of the market and its financial power. SGS's rivals include privately-held Germany TUEV and London-based Intertek Group Plc (ITRK.LN). \u001d  SGS shareholders include the German Von Finck family, which owns a 23.7% stake and Ifil Investments SpA (IFL.MI), the Italian Agnelli family holding. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sgs.com \b \u001d  -By Martin Gelnar, Dow Jones Newswires; +43 43 443 8042; martin.gelnar@dowjones.com \u001d  (Goran Mijuk in Zurich contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 01:21 ET (06:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"63705b3f4026e72900e53bff85baa06c","symR":["HYG.T","HYGS","CA4488821006"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Hydrogenics Signs Distribution Agreement With Heliocentris>HYGS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HYG.T","HYGS","CA4488821006"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:01 ET (12:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6386b994e3abcb70f2eb544fe6bb17f0","symR":["CWD.LN","III.LN","RMV.LN","SL.LN","GB00B00FQ060","GB00B0MFTM73","GB00B16KPT44","GB00B16PV024"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Countrywide Adjourns EGM On 3i Buyout Vote","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CWD.LN","III.LN","RMV.LN","SL.LN","GB00B00FQ060","GB00B0MFTM73","GB00B16KPT44","GB00B16PV024"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","FIS","INL","INS","MED","REA","RED","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (This updates an item published at 1049 GMT, adding comments from the companies and analysts.) \b \u001d  By Molly Dover and Marietta Cauchi \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Countrywide PLC (CWD.LN) Monday adjourned an extraordinary general meeting scheduled to vote on the company's proposed takeover by 3i Group PLC (III.LN). \u001d  Countrywide, a property agency and financial services group, said the adjournment was at the request of 3i who wanted time to hold further consultations with Countrywide's significant shareholders. No new date was given, but the company said it would be \"as soon as possible\" and in the next two to three weeks. \u001d  The scheme of arrangement to take Countrywide private needs 75% approval in a shareholder vote. \u001d  Countrywide said in a statement Monday that it had received proxies ahead of the meeting from 1,392 shareholders representing 53.55% of the independent scheme shares. Of this, 61.7% of the shares were in favor of the scheme and 38.3% against. \u001d  3i said in a press briefing following the meeting's adjournment, \"we cannot and will not change the terms of our offer. There are no tricks up our sleeve in terms of flipping to another offer.\" It noted in a later statement that \"proxies submitted against the scheme amounted to less than 20% of Countrywide's issued share capital.\" \u001d  3i's proposed takeover of Countrywide has hung in the balance for several weeks as hedge fund investors have spoken out against the deal, claiming it is too low and fails to take account of the booming property market. \u001d  The offer values Countrywide at around GBP960 million and consists of 490 pence cash and 0.16518 shares in Rightmove PLC (RMV.LN) per Countrywide share. Countrywide holds a 21.5% stake in property website operator Rightmove. \u001d  San Francisco-based Artisan Partners and Europe's Boussard & Gavaudan Asset Management have said they will vote against the deal, as has Standard Life PLC (SL.LN). Together they hold 16.2% of the company's shares. \u001d  Other hedge funds continued taking positions late into Friday. In a regulatory filing Monday, U.S.-based Seneca Capital Management disclosed a 1.39% holding which it bought Friday while Polygon Investment Partners LLP, one of Countrywide's largest shareholders, on Thursday cut its stake to 5.88% of the company's capital. \u001d  Also Friday activist U.S. hedge fund JANA Partners LLC revealed it more than doubled its holding in Countrywide on holding 9.4 million shares, or 5.5% of Countrywide's equity.  These funds have not stated how they will vote on the takeover. \u001d  Countrywide Chairman Christopher Sporborg told journalists at a press briefing Monday that the board remained convinced it was a good offer and Thursday's interest rate rise by the Bank of England had reinforced this view. He said shareholders would lose out if the bid failed. \u001d  \"There is a perception that if it fails, the board will put at least GBP200 million on the balance sheet and pay it back to shareholders. The board would vote most significantly not to go short of cash now and borrow money. If any shareholder out there thinks they will get GBP200 million return of capital, they are materially deluding themselves,\" he said. \u001d  Peter Gordon, partner at 3i, said shareholders may have wrongly interpreted the level of debt in the 3i offer. The offer includes GBP600 million debt. \"They may have assumed on the back of that, that the business had ceased to be cyclical,\" but the U.K. housing market \"will continue to be volatile, and so will the earnings of Countrywide,\" he said. \u001d  Sporborg said there was no chance of a further offer for the company if this bid fails. \"We had one formal approach but they said they couldn't make the numbers work and walked away. I know for a fact there is no-one out there who is going to step in and bid more and I would bet my life on that,\" he said. \u001d  One shareholder, who did not wish to be named, said the adjournment would give the company the opportunity to \"really drum up support\" among the shareholders who hadn't voted. \u001d  The shareholder believed there was \"a realistic possibility\" that the bid would go through at the next EGM. \u001d  Bridgewell Securities analyst Katrina Preston noted that if all remaining shareholders who had not voted by proxy were to vote at the EGM, only 10% of them would need to vote against to derail the bid. She expects the share price to fall back to 400 pence if the bid fails. \u001d  At 12.23 GMT, Countrywide shares were trading up 9 pence, or 1.7%, at 527 pence. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.countrywideplc.co.uk \b \u001d  -By Molly Dover and Marietta Cauchi, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-207-842-9358; molly.dover@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:37 ET (12:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"639ca661618283743516e2c53127879b","symR":["CLLN.LN","GB0007365546"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Carillion Wins GBP100M Contracts; Strong Outlook","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T07:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CLLN.LN","GB0007365546"],"IndustryCodes":["CON","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Molly Dover \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Support services and construction company Carillion PLC (CLLN.LN) reported strong trading Monday and said it has been awarded a further seven defense contracts totaling GBP100 million. \u001d  Carillion said the contracts comprise infrastructure, support facilities, training facilities and airfield works, and are part of a GBP500 million seven-year Regional Prime contract with the Ministry of Defence, which was awarded to a Carillion and Enterprise joint venture in November 2005. \u001d  In a trading update ahead of full-year results, Carillion reported strong cash generation, leading to average debt for the year of around GBP110 million, below the expected figure of GBP200 million, and net debt at Dec. 31 of around GBP112 million. \u001d  The company's order book at Dec. 31 will be around GBP16 billion, and since the year end the company has won further projects expected to generate revenues of about GBP325 million. \u001d  The integration of Mowlem is \"substantially complete\", the company said in the statement, and costs relating to the integration and restructure of the Carillion Rail division are expected to be GBP20 million for the year. \u001d  The company said the outlook for its main markets was \"expected to remain positive\" and the company is \"on track to deliver materially enhanced earnings in 2007.\" \u001d  Carillion will announce full-year results on Mar. 7. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.carillionplc.com \b \u001d  -By Molly Dover, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-207-842-9358; molly.dover@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 02:20 ET (07:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"63a04691c9d563a6413b2ae883c7eb19","symR":["SNPS"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Novatek Uses Synopsys NanoSim Simulator With HVMOS to Improve Design Yield","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SNPS"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS"],"Story":"Unique LCD Driver Verification Solution Cuts Design Margin by 50 Percent \b \b \u001d  MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Synopsys, Inc.

improve the odds for lost pets \b \b \u001d  KENILWORTH, N.J., Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Schering-Plough Corporation (NYSE: SGP) today announced the national launch of the new HomeAgain(TM) Proactive Pet Recovery Network, the nation's first comprehensive system to assist in the search for lost pets. \b \u001d  One in three pets will become lost during a lifetime and without proper identification, 90 percent never return home, and are at risk of being euthanized.  HomeAgain has been a leader in companion animal identification and lost pet recovery since 1995.  The new HomeAgain network, which is the first-ever proactive lost pet service that actually mobilizes volunteers to help search for a missing pet, hopes to improve the odds for lost pets by combining advanced pet-tracking methodology with a network dedicated to aiding recovery efforts. \b \u001d  The first-of-its-kind proactive approach for pet owners utilizes the same community-wide notification principles originally developed to help locate missing children.  Within minutes of a missing pet report being filed with the 24-hour, seven day-a-week emergency call center, dispatchers will notify area shelters and veterinary clinics.  Dispatchers will share key information, such as the pet's description and a photo.  Through the service, pet owners will be able to go online to create personalized \"Lost Pet\" posters for owners to distribute and post. \b \u001d  The tracking methodology begins with the HomeAgain microchip, a safe and permanent form of identification.  When a pet registered with HomeAgain is found and scanned, he or she can be traced back to his or her owner through the national database.  More than 4 million pets in the United States have been implanted with a HomeAgain microchip, resulting in more than 300,000 successful recoveries. \b \u001d  \"We are partnering with veterinarians and shelters on this new recovery network because our experience in companion animal identification and lost pet recovery has shown how important it is to be proactive,\" said Brent Saunders, senior vice president, Schering-Plough Corporation.  \"Microchip implantation and registration in the national database are vital, but the new proactive recovery network goes much further and hopefully will result in many reunions.\" \b \u001d  The company also announced that it will be working with Mars, Incorporated, a global leader in pet care.  \"Mars is proud to join with Schering-Plough in bringing practical solutions that benefit pets and their owners.  This initiative is in keeping with our long-standing commitment to offer programs and products that make life better for pets and their owners,\" said Ellis Rowe, Group President - Developing Petcare for Mars, Incorporated. \b \u001d  To bolster the recovery efforts, the HomeAgain network is also recruiting volunteers to become HomeAgain Pet Rescuers. These pet-friendly organizations and individuals will be dedicated to the swift, safe recovery of pets. Rescuers in the vicinity of a pet's last known location will receive e-mail updates with a description, a photo and recovery tips to ensure a safe return \b \u001d  to the owner.  Upon locating a missing pet, rescuers provide help and comfort, and make the appropriate connections to area veterinary clinics or shelters. \b \u001d  Pet owners can enroll in the new HomeAgain Proactive Pet Recovery Network by visiting their veterinarian who will implant the HomeAgain microchip, a small identification microchip about the size of a grain of rice.

Gazprom finally agreed three supply contracts to different Georgian off-takers, but only for the first quarter. \u001d  Azerbaijan delivered around 3 million cubic meters of gas a day to Georgia from its other gas fields while Shah Deniz was offline, one oil industry official told Dow Jones   The consortium, which in addition to BP and SOCAR includes OAO Lukoil Holdings (LKOH.RS), Statoil ASA (STO), Total SA (TOT), NICO and Turkey's TPAO, intends to produce between 5.4 and 5.6 billion cubic meters of gas from the field this year, of which around 2.4 bcm is earmarked for domestic consumption, 2.8 bcm for export to Turkey, and 270 mcm for export to Georgia. \u001d  A statement from SOCAR said the SDA-1 well is currently producing 3.4 million cubic meters of gas a day, along with 1.3 metric tons of gas condensate. \b \u001d  -By Aida Sultanova and Geoffrey T.

That's not a high premium - it's less than the 18.3X multiple Boeing is paying for Aviall Services - given Smiths' strong order book with civil and military customers. \u001d  Smiths' management has also decided to give away almost all of the GBP2.25-billion proceeds to investors rather than reinvest part of the money in its remaining business. \u001d  Keeping shareholders sweet is one thing. But this smacks of a worrying lack of ideas in the Smiths boardroom about how to invest in R&D at its medical and specialty engineering businesses or how to make acquisitions to beef these businesses up. \u001d  Left with little cash its books, some investors will question how committed Smiths is to delivering long-term growth. \u001d  For instance, its medical business, which is focused on safety devices, critical care and medication delivery is a $7 billion market of which Smiths has a roughly 19% share. And with an 18% operating profit margin, there's incentive enough to expand here. \u001d   Indeed, in a contrast to fellow conglomerate GE, even if it's one on a smaller scale, Smiths hasn't jumped on possible acquisitions quickly enough, whether to diminish the cyclicality of its aerospace unit, or build on its 2004 purchase of Medex. \u001d  That's reflected the underperformance of Smith's shares compared with many of its peers. The stock has underperformed the FTSE All-Share index by 11% in the past year. \u001d  So Monday's news leaves investors ruing the missed opportunities for creating long-term value at the British defense company. \b \u001d  (Arindam Nag has covered business and finance for 15 years in Asia, Europe and the United States.

The approximate three-year project will create a more effective and efficient working environment by eliminating temporary third-party leases, implementing improved technology, energy efficiency, standardization, and improved processes. Currently, more than 800 people in Montreal support the Company's corporate, Bauxite & Alumina, and Primary Metal Group operations at its Head Office location. \b \b\"Alcan's plan to consolidate its global headquarters, in a cost-effective manner, into a more modern, efficient campus, recognizes the Company's growth over the past five years and allows flexibility for future growth,\" said Dick Evans, President and Chief Executive Officer, Alcan Inc. at a press conference today. \"It reaffirms the long-standing partnership Alcan has historically enjoyed with Montreal, the Company's home for more than 80 years,\" he added. \b \bThe event was attended by Quebec Premier Jean Charest; Raymond Bachand, Minister of Economic Development, Innovation and Export Trade for Quebec; Michael M Fortier, Minister of Public Works and Government Services for Canada and Minister responsible for the Montreal region; Montreal \b \bMayor Gerald Tremblay; Colonel Glen Shepherd, Chief Secretary of The Salvation Army, Canada and Bermudas; Lieutenant-Colonel Gilbert St.-Onge, Divisional Commander of The Salvation Army in Quebec; retired Alcan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Culver, who commissioned the construction of Maison Alcan in 1981; and employees. \b \b\"We are extremely pleased that a major company like Alcan, which has been operating out of Montreal for many years and has an international reputation, will continue to play such a major role in ensuring the dynamism of our city. This also reinforces our desire to continue our efforts to ensure Montreal can develop to its full capacity in terms of being a world leader in innovation,\" said Mayor Tremblay. \b \bFollowing The Salvation Army's recent decision to refocus its mission in Montreal, it approached Alcan with the proposal to sell its sanctuary and administrative tower at Stanley and Drummond Streets. Alcan built the tower with The Salvation Army during the Company's construction of Maison Alcan. The Company has purchased these assets, and will continue its longstanding relationship with The Salvation Army. \b \bModernization work on the almost 300,000 square feet of the combined sites is scheduled to begin in early 2007 and expected to be completed by the end of 2009. The Company has estimated that it will invest between US$40-50 million over the next three years, to acquire, develop, and renovate the combined Maison Alcan campus. \b \b\"The decision to expand and modernize our existing home made sense logistically and financially, although other alternatives were taken into consideration, including the relocation of Alcan's Head Office to another location in the Montreal area,\" added Mr. Evans. \b \bThe Company also plans to obtain LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification for the new site, which would be one of the first of its kind in Montreal. \b \b\"Once completed, the new 'Maison Alcan' will truly stand as a sustainability benchmark through its leading energy and environmental design and the historical preservation of the site. It will promote Alcan's position as an employer of choice by reinforcing the qualities that Alcan has come to be known for all over the world: leading-edge technology; concern for the environment, our communities and our people; and a driving force of innovation,\" said Gilles Frenette, 'Maison Alcan Transformation' Project Manager. \b \bAlcan Inc. (NYSE, TSX: AL) is a leading global materials company, delivering high quality products and services worldwide. With world-class technology and operations in bauxite mining, alumina processing, primary metal smelting, power generation, aluminum fabrication, engineered solutions as well as flexible and specialty packaging, today's Alcan is well positioned to meet and exceed its customers' needs. Alcan is represented by 65,000 employees in 61 countries and regions, and posted revenues of US$20.3 billion in 2005.

some haven't shared in the Christmas cheer: Music and book retailer HMV Group PLC (HMV.LN) reported a first-half pretax loss, despite an improved Christmas performance, and said it continues to operate in a very difficult market. \u001d  Moss Bros Group PLC (MOSB.LN), the menswear retailer, issued a profits warning, hit by a combination of mild weather, warehouse disruption and the impact

That meant he often had long stretches with no work to do, and when the parts finally arrived, he had to switch between the harnesses to complete their assembly before they were installed in one of CAE Inc.'s (CGT) full-flight simulators. \u001d  Now, he says, there's a steady flow of parts coming in from other work units at the Montreal plant, allowing him to finish one harness and send it on before starting on another. \u001d  \"Your job is made simpler, yet you're doing the same job,\" says Mondoux, vice-president of Local 522 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union, which represents about 600 employees at CAE. As well, he says, the work is easier but \"you're producing more.\" \u001d  The bottleneck at Mondoux's station isn't the only one that has been cleared at CAE, the world's largest producer of flight simulators and flight training. The changes Mondoux has seen have been replicated in any number of ways throughout the company's many facilities, as CAE has battled to raise profit margins while facing growing competition. At the same time, it's had to keep its prices in line as its airline clients have also looked to cut their costs. \u001d  \"You basically have to be very cost efficient in order to serve airlines now,\" says Marc Parent, CAE's group president for simulation products and military training and services. \u001d  At least you do if you want to make any money, which wasn't the case at CAE a few years ago. Its flight simulators were still snagging a good share of the few available orders, but with rising materials prices, an appreciating Canadian dollar, low pricing power, and high overhead, at one point it was costing CAE as much to make the simulators as it could get from their sale. \u001d  Under a restructuring program launched by chief executive Bob Brown in April 2005, the situation has changed - dramatically so. In the past two years, profit margins at CAE have steadily improved, as has the bottom line. Its balance sheet is in much better shape, and after slashing about 2,000 jobs over the past five years, employment levels have stabilized at about 5,000. What's more, it's hiring: the company has openings for about 200 people in Canada alone. \u001d  Meanwhile, the aerospace cycle is booming, with EADS' (5730.FR) Airbus and Boeing Co. (BA) reporting record aircraft orders for 2005 of 2,057. While that pace dipped to about 1,800 in 2006, it's still well above the 500-800 average annual orders seen in preceding years. \u001d  The plane makers forecast demand at between 23,00 and 27,000 new aircraft over the next 20 years. And observers say those numbers could be conservative if growth in countries such as India, China and Brazil is greater than expected. \u001d  \"We are now well-equipped to ride the market going up,\" says Parent. \u001d  The swell of recent orders has also driven the backlogs at Airbus and Boeing to record levels, giving legs to an extended industry revival. Analysts say CAE will be one beneficiary.   \"We believe this cycle will be an extended cycle of 8-10 years for CAE,\" Research Capital's Jacques Kavafian wrote in a recent report. Kavafian doesn't own CAE shares nor does his firm have an investment-banking relationship with CAE. \b \b     Aerospace Industry Boom Seen Ongoing \b \u001d  Raymond James analyst Ben Cherniavsky, who raised his rating and target price on the stock earlier this month, said CAE's \"end markets are, in our view, currently imbued with exceptional good visibility into the next few years,\" noting that \"a few new factors may keep the expansion going even longer than usual.\" \u001d  Cherniavsky, who doesn't own the company's shares, also noted that CAE's earnings potential is now far higher than it had been: \"Under the watch of a relatively new management team, layoffs have occurred, floor space has been rationalized, write-downs have been taken, procurement has been consolidated, production times have been reduced, the simulator fleet has been upgraded, and a host of other productive initiatives have been implemented,\" Cherniavsky wrote. \"Taken together, these actions have effected an impressive improvement in the company's operating margins and cash flow over the past 18 months. However, we still believe that further improvements will transpire and, consequently, that valuing CAE off its current earnings profile significantly understates the company's full earnings and free cash flow potential.\" \u001d  Raymond James makes a market in CAE securities. \u001d  Much of what has driven the changes at CAE has come from customer input, and the employees themselves, along with the introduction of the Japanese philosophy of \"kaizen,\" or \"continuous improvement.\" \u001d  When CAE first went to its employees to ask for help in cutting costs, it met with much skepticism. \"We didn't get everybody on the bandwagon in one day.\" Mondoux says. \"But as time went on, people came to understand that it was to save their jobs.\" \u001d  Small employee-led forums met regularly, first to vent, notes Parent, but eventually coming up \"with all kinds of recommendations to produce a better, cheaper, more quality product.\" \u001d  And when employees saw the company immediately approve their suggestions, \"you can imagine the buy-in you get,\" Parent says. Now, CAE has employees e-mailing suggestions, and has set up a Web site \"for people who have ideas for innovations.\" \u001d  One group of employees is solely dedicated to working with worker representatives from different departments to cut costs, Parent says. The company has undergone a similar process with its customers. \u001d  \"There's more employees more open to the company's ideas, to what they tell them,\" Mondoux agrees. \u001d  He notes that one manufacturing department reduced the cycle time for a product by 20 days, with a 30% reduction in costs. CAE now produces an A320 simulator in 14 months, down from 18-20 previously. \u001d  Meanwhile, customers are lining up for CAE simulators as airlines upgrade fleets, new airlines spring up, new energy-efficient models are launched, and pilot-training demands heat up in emerging economies like India and China where air traffic is burgeoning. Additionally, conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan fuel ongoing demand from military clients. \u001d  CAE has sold 24 full-flight simulators so far this fiscal year with only three months to go, just one shy of its revised 2007 target. It had earlier set a sales goal of 21 simulators but moved it higher in November. During fiscal 2006, it revised its target to 20 from 17 and easily beat it, selling 21. \u001d  A clear sign of how things are changing for the company came in August when Continental Airlines Inc. (CAL) placed an order for a full-flight simulator, the first from a U.S. legacy carrier since before the Sept. 11, 2001 tragedy. \u001d  Investors have already begun to buy in. CAE shares touched a four-year high of C$12.08 in Toronto last week and have advanced more than 40% from a 12-month low of C$8.09 reached in June. Monday, CAE is trading at C$11.57. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.cae.com \b \u001d  -Monica Gutschi, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2017; monica.gutschi@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 15:53 ET (20:53 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6c10faa0cb0e83bf7521bdcaef8cb12d","symR":["MMXM3.BR","BRMMXMACNOR2"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Brazil Miner MMX Gets Regulatory OK To Build Amapa Port","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MMXM3.BR","BRMMXMACNOR2"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","MNG","STL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SAO PAULO (Dow Jones)--Brazilian mining and metals company MMX Mineracao e Metalicos SA (MMXM3.BR) has received approval from the country's National Water Transportation Agency, or Antaq, to build a port terminal at Santana in the northern state of Amapa, the company said in a regulatory filing Monday. \u001d  According to the filing, Antaq approved the construction and use of the port on Jan. 10.

The warning was lifted at 8:45 a.m. after air samples showed no unsafe levels of harmful chemicals from the fire. \u001d  Toll booth workers on the nearby San Rafael Bridge were also evacuated, but later allowed to return. The bridge remained open to traffic, Duazo said. \u001d  The 2,900-acre refinery, located 19 miles from San Francisco, is more than 100 years old, according to Chevron's Web site. \u001d  Richmond is home to several oil refineries, and toxic releases in the area have been common enough that officials installed 26 sirens to warn of danger and tell residents to go inside. \u001d  A March 1999 explosion and fire at the Chevron refinery sent hundreds of residents to hospitals.

As well, the software features innovative new capabilities for character animation; the new Maya Nucleus unified simulation framework enables interactive simulations while keeping artists in full control of the animation.\" \b \u001d  Maya Nucleus features technology developed by Autodesk's Academy Award-winning* Principal Research Scientist Jos Stam.  This unified simulation framework allows artists to create elements that interact, in a 3D animation, with other dynamic objects such as fluids, cloth and rigid bodies. \b \u001d  Maya 8.5 includes Maya nCloth, which is the first module of Maya Nucleus. With Maya nCloth, artists can quickly direct and control a range of simulations, including cloth, plastic, metal and other materials.  Believable cloth-on-cloth simulations with complex cloth collisions, such as a cape over a jacket, can be created more easily.  A unique air-pressure model enables artists to use any geometry -- whether a closed, sealed volume such as an inner tube, or an open volume such as a balloon -- to create an inflatable object with internal and external pressure. \b \u001d  Python scripting is also new in Maya 8.5.  This popular open-source programming language helps accelerate facility-specific custom script development and plug-in prototyping, extending and automating Maya production pipelines.  Python scripting offers a powerful alternative to Maya software's native scripting language, MEL, while featuring the same deep level of integration with the Maya command engine.  Python scripting further augments the creative control gained with Maya Nucleus, giving scriptwriters the ability to efficiently manipulate, customize and automate the software. \b \u001d  Anders Langlands, R&D lead at The Moving Picture Company (MPC) and Maya 8.5 beta tester, commented: \"Having Python support available in Autodesk Maya means we can leverage many of our existing tools directly within Maya, rather than having to write glue code to bind Maya to our pipeline.  This allows us to develop new node and command plug-ins in a fraction of the time it would normally take using other solutions.\"  London, UK-based MPC offers visual effects and post-production services for advertising, television and feature film. \b \u001d  Maya 8.5 is available as a Universal application release for Intel- and PowerPC-based Macintosh computers (announced separately), as well as on the Microsoft Windows and Linux platforms.  The software includes a number of new artist-driven features and performance optimizations.

(NYSE:WSO) today updated its 2006 earnings estimates, provided an earnings outlook for 2007, highlighted details about recent acquisition activities and announced the date for its fourth quarter earnings conference call. \b \b   Update of 2006 Earnings Estimates \b \u001d  Watsco announced today that for the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company estimates its earnings per share on a fully diluted basis will be $2.94 to $2.98, an increase of 17% to 18% over the record $2.52 reported in 2005. Revenues are expected to be approximately $1.8 billion, a 7% increase over 2005. Operating cash flow for 2006 is expected to be approximately $69 million versus $36 million in 2005. \b \u001d  Fourth quarter earnings per share is estimated to be 40 cents to 44 cents, the second highest result for the period. 2006 follows 2005's blockbuster fourth quarter of 50 cents per share, which was an increase of more than 100% over the prior year. The 2005 results included seasonably better weather for the sale of heating products than in 2006 as well as sales opportunities generated in advance of the 13 SEER product transition. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $79 million. \b \u001d  Albert H. Nahmad, Watsco's President & Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"2006 was a record year for Watsco and our balance sheet is in terrific shape as we continue to build our network. We opened 15 new locations in 2006 and recently acquired 18 more. The blow-out fourth quarter of 2005 has proven difficult to outperform in 2006. Our investment in lower-SEER equipment products a year ago in advance of the transition created unique sales opportunities and we took full advantage. The end of 2006 has proven to be more traditional market conditions for the replacement of HVAC systems and the top-line has also been somewhat influenced by unseasonably warm weather and slower residential new construction. Looking at growth rates over a longer horizon, the fourth quarter and annual results are consistent with our long-term growth rates.\" \b \b   2007 Earnings Outlook \b \u001d  Watsco's earnings outlook for 2007 is earnings per share growth of 15% to 20%. Mr. Nahmad added, \"Although some of the trends experienced during the fourth quarter of 2006 are likely to linger into the first quarter of 2007, we believe consistent sales and earnings growth should emerge in the second quarter as we pass the anniversary of the transition to the new 13 SEER products. Operating margins again expanded in 2006 and we expect continued improvement in 2007 with sales growth of new products, favorable pricing comparisons for unitary air conditioning equipment, increased profit at new locations, integration activities and overall cost leverage contributing to earnings growth. We also expect to shed the incremental operating costs incurred during the transition of products in 2006. Strong cash flow should also prove to be a significant opportunity as product availability, lead times and delivery from our OEMs have returned to more normal levels.\" \b \b   Acquisition Activities \b \u001d  Baker Distributing Company, a Watsco subsidiary, recently completed two acquisitions. A&R Supply, Inc., a distributor of refrigeration products founded in 1957 and headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, was acquired in October 2006, adding eight new locations to the western Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas markets. ASHA Distributing, Inc., a distributor of air conditioning and heating products founded in 1982 and headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, was acquired in December 2006, adding 10 locations to the Nebraska, Missouri and Kansas markets. In aggregate, the two companies had revenues of $23 million during the twelve months prior to acquisition and were slightly dilutive to 2006 fourth quarter earnings results. \b \u001d  Albert H. Nahmad, Watsco's President & Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"We continue to build Watsco's network by acquiring well-established businesses. We have the opportunity to expand product offerings and to open additional locations to better serve the existing customer base and to attract new customers. Acquisitions remain a key focus for us to meet our long-term goal of building a network of locations that provide the finest service and product availability for contractors, assisting and supporting them as they serve the nation's homeowners and businesses. Today we possess approximately 7.4% market share and have ambitious plans to grow well beyond where we are at present.\" \b \b   Schedule for Earnings Conference Call \b \u001d  Watsco, Inc. (NYSE: WSO) will host a conference call to discuss its 2006 fourth quarter earnings results on Tuesday, February 13, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. (ET). The conference call will be web-casted by CCBN's StreetEvents on our web site, http://www.watsco.com. The earnings results will be released before the market opens on February 13, 2007. A replay of the conference call will be available on the Company's web site. \b \u001d  There are an estimated 120 million single-family homes in the United States, most of which have central air conditioning and heating systems. Eventually, these systems wear out and require repair or replacement. Watsco's focused strategy provides the products, technical support and convenience that contractors require to satisfy the needs of homeowners and businesses that depend on the comfort and energy-efficiency provided by HVAC systems. \b \u001d  Watsco is the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies in the HVAC industry, currently operating 380 locations serving over 40,000 customers in 32 states. The Company's goal is to build a national network of locations that provide the finest service and product availability for HVAC contractors, assisting and supporting them as they serve the country's homeowners and businesses.

It was the first landing at the airport in the last three years, he added. \u001d  The airport, located about 185 kilometers southwest of the capital Phnom Penh, is expected to serve as the first air link between Sihanoukville and Siem Reap, home to famed Angkor temples, said Deputy Tourism Minister Thong Khon. \u001d  He said he hoped the airport's reopening would encourage tourists to extend their stay to enjoy Cambodia's sandy beaches after touring the temples. \u001d  \"This is part of our strategy in linking the two tourist destinations,\" he said, adding that 1.7 million tourists visited Cambodia last year, about a 20% increase over 2005. \u001d  Tourism has become a major source of income for the cash-strapped Southeast Asian country. \u001d  Norinda Khek said the airport will host only domestic flights because its 1.8-kilometer runway can accommodate only propeller aircraft. But he said the company plans to extend the runway to 2.2 kilometers to handle jet aircraft by the end of the year. \u001d  SCA is in talks with several airlines about using the airport, he added. \u001d  He said the company spent $8 million last year on the airport's renovation and that it would invest up to $100 million more by 2014. \u001d  \"There is big potential for this airport,\" he said. \"There will be more tourists and they will stay longer in Cambodia.

In Frankfurt, General Electric shares down 0.3% at EUR29.17. \u001d  One trader, who requested anonymity, said the sale made perfect sense since Smiths aerospace has been suffering from downward pricing pressure from Boeing Co. (BA) Airbus owner European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. (5730.FR). \u001d  In a statement, Smiths said the sale of the aerospace unit is expected to generate improved returns on capital and boost margins. The net effect of the sale and capital return would have been accretive to the company's 2006 pro-forma earnings, it added. \u001d  On a conference call, Smiths Chief Executive Keith Butler-Wheelhouse said the deal would have boosted pro-forma 2006 earnings per share by 7%, even though aerospace accounted for GBP1.3 billion of the company's GBP3.5 billion in revenues in 2006. \u001d  The company will call an extraordinary shareholders meeting during the second quarter to approve the sale, which is also subject to completion and regulatory approval. \u001d  On the conference call, GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said he looked forward to \"a constructive process\" with E.U. antitrust regulators. He didn't expect problems because the acquired business has little overlap with GE's existing operations. \u001d  GE hasn't always had success with E.U. regulators, which blocked the company's intended acquisition of Honeywell after U.S. authorities had approved the deal. \u001d  The Smiths capital return is proposed as a B share scheme combined with share consolidation. \u001d  Smiths Finance Director John Langston said the aerospace division sale would leave Smiths with a loosened dividend policy and lower credit ratings, but the company could live with that because the remaining businesses are less capital intensive. The new dividend cover would be 1.8 times, down from 2 times, while its credit ratings are expected to fall from A- to BBB+, he said. \u001d  In a separate statement, GE said the acquisition will broaden the U.S. company's offerings to its aerospace customers by adding Smiths' flight management systems, electrical power management, mechanical actuation systems and airborne platform computing systems. \u001d  \"GE Aviation is growing about 10% a year and this acquisition gives us a technology growth platform that will be accretive to our net income and will deliver immediate and future value for our investors,\" GE's Immelt said in the statement. \u001d  Smiths Aerospace has more than 11,000 employees and had $2.4 billion in revenues in 2006. It has been working on projects like Boeing's 787 aircraft, the Airbus A380 as well as the Joint Strike Fighter military project. \u001d  On the Detection JV, the companies said they view a deal as a long-term commitment and there will be no voluntary exit rights for the first five years of the JV. \u001d  The companies didn't say when the JV would be finalized, but said they have agreed an exclusivity period to reach a deal. \u001d  Butler-Wheelhouse said he had asked Immelt to sell Smiths the whole of GE's Homeland Protection unit while they were talking about aerospace, but had been turned down. Further talks had agreed on a JV. \u001d  There is a \"great deal of industrial logic\" in putting the businesses together, Immelt said on the conference call, without quantifying synergies. \u001d  The unit will have pro-forma revenues of about GBP600 million. Its board will be made up of four Smiths members and two from GE, and will be chaired by Butler-Wheelhouse. \u001d  Butler-Wheelhouse said there are currently no talks to sell off the remaining Smiths units, but said \"we reconsider these things continuously.\" Immelt said GE had no interest in Smiths' medical operations because the two companies operate in different parts of the medical engineering industry. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.smiths-group.com \b \u001d  -By Steve McGrath, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9284; steve.mcgrath@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 03:36 ET (08:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"72bcdab21be69f229eae86004e022e37","symR":["ASC.LN","GB0030927254"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"2nd UPDATE: ASOS Xmas Sales +80%, FY Pft In Line","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T08:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ASC.LN","GB0030927254"],"IndustryCodes":["RTS","SAP"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (This updates an article published at 0722 GMT, with CEO comments.) \b \u001d  By Lilly Vitorovich \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Online clothing and accessories retailer ASOS PLC (ASC.LN) Monday reported an 80% jump in Christmas sales over the four weeks to Dec. 10 and, with trading in line with internal forecasts, expects annual profit before tax to match market expectations. \u001d  Over November and December, ASOS said it sold 710,000 items via 285,000 orders. The hot selling items were  leopard print dresses and shoes as well as one-shoulder, baby doll and Prom dresses, Chief Executive Nick Robertson told Dow Jones Newswires during an interview. \u001d  Robertson said the company \"had a great Christmas.\" \u001d  \"The fact that we continue to outperform the online market in general is testament to our buyers, our proposition, and the enduring appeal of ASOS amongst our core customer base,\" he said in a statement. \u001d  ASOS kicked off its Christmas sales on Dec. 22, and will wrap up later Monday. \u001d  With the U.K. clothing market growing marginally,  Robertson attributed the company's strong performance to solid market share growth against the likes of U.K. billionaire businessman Philip Green's retail chain Top Shop and privately-owned River Island. \u001d  \"I think you've got to take a view that, overall, retail is growing marginally, so if we're to be growing at these sort of levels, ultimately those 285,000 orders have come from the High Street...Top Shop and River Island,\" he said. \u001d  Comparative figures for Dec. 11 to Jan. 15 don't exist due to the complete closure of operations following the Buncefield fuel depot explosion on Dec. 11, 2005, according to ASOS. As a result of the fuel depot explosion, ASOS' was out of business for six weeks, Robertson said. \u001d  ASOS is an internet retail and market services company, which was established in June 2000 and admitted to London's Alternative Investment Market or AIM in October 2001. Its principal business is ASOS.com, an online fashion and beauty retailer. \u001d  The company had more than 1.2 million registered users as at Jan. 12, and offers more 4,000 products across womenswear, menswear, footwear, accessories, jewelry and beauty. \u001d  Prior to the trading update, analysts were forecasting a profit before tax of GBP3.3 million for the year ending March 31, double the GBP1.65 million in fiscal 2006,  Robertson told Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  Teather & Greenwood retail analyst Rhys William said the U.K.-based retailer has reported a \"strong performance, with sales momentum continuing to pickup, and the business outperforming the high street and other online players.\" \u001d  \"We believe that profit upgrades for next year and the year after look like a strong possibility,\" said William, adding Teather & Greenwood will formally pickup coverage on ASOS on Tuesday. \u001d  At 0835 GMT, ASOS shares were down 3.50 pence, or 2.9%, at 119 pence in a higher U.K. market. \u001d  Despite the strong Christmas performance, ASOS is unlikely to declare a final dividend when it reports its annual results in early July, Robertson said. \u001d  \"We've been non-dividend paying up until this point. I think this year we won't be paying a dividend, and whether or not we'll pay a dividend the year after is still subject to several discussions,\" he said. \u001d  After being out of business following the fuel depot explosion, ASOS is \"building-up a cash reserve pot\", said Robertson, who is the company's second biggest shareholder with around a 14% stake. \u001d  ASOS' biggest shareholder is Fidelity International Ltd.  with a 14.3% stake. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.asos.com \b \u001d  -By Lilly Vitorovich, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-0-207 842 9290; lilly.vitorovich@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 03:47 ET (08:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"735ec26e081a50872b1ff007297251e0","symR":["KND","SRZ","VTR"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Ventas to Acquire Sunrise Senior -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KND","SRZ","VTR"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","REA","REI","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  The Company's actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Still led by founder Jim Bernhard, Shaw is entering a new growth phase: The energy sector's need to retrofit existing coal-fired electrical plants, for instance, has already started to drive business, according to Morningstar analyst John Kearney. And chemical companies will need to make substantial infrastructure investments to serve China's insatiable demand for petrochemical products. \u001d  With a third of its revenue tied to power generation and a $9 billion order backlog, Shaw is well positioned to benefit from the cyclical upswing, says James Schier, manager of the Security MidCap Value fund. Schier acknowledges that cost overruns on a few big projects unexpectedly ate into margins, but says that Shaw -- which is the top holding in his concentrated fund -- has tightened controls and the market overreacted when it sent Shaw's shares down 20 percent last summer. \u001d  Schier thinks the stock can hit $35 in the next 18 months, a 15 percent increase. He adds, though, that it could triple in three years once the company proves it can manage costs and bring its operating margins back up to 5 percent or 6 percent, from its current 3 percent. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 06:01 ET (11:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7420decb749eaab7934e78c4c75d89c5","symR":["DGH.YY","GMTC.YY","LAZ","TDC.KO","DK0010253335"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"TDC's Baltic Mobile Ops Draw Private Equity - Sources","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T17:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DGH.YY","GMTC.YY","LAZ","TDC.KO","DK0010253335"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XNYA","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Marietta Cauchi \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Private equity firms are circling the Lithuanian and Latvian mobile units of Danish telecommunications operator TDC A/S (TDC.KO), people familiar with the situation told Dow Jones Newswires Monday. \u001d  The businesses have been put up for sale as TDC seeks to streamline its operations, the people said. The company was bought by a private equity group in November 2005 for EUR13 billion - the largest European private equity deal at that  time. \u001d  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) is advising on the auction, which has attracted a large amount of interest especially from private-equity firms. Second and final round bids are due this week with at least five bids expected, the people said. \u001d  Bidders reported in the media include Doughty Hanson, GMT Communications Partners and Mid Europa Partners. Polish fixed-line operator Telekomunikacja Polska, or TPSA, and Scandinavian alternative telecom Tele2 are also said to be interested. \u001d  The price tag for the TDC units is around EUR400 million, which some people close to the deal said is on the high side. One person said the selling conditions were tough and the whole sale process impracticably short. \u001d  The Lithuanian market is already very competitive, with a high penetration of SIM cards, but there is still growth so far as human penetration and data revenue are concerned, the people said. \u001d  It is very expensive to make phone calls to a competing network so users tend to buy multiple SIM cards, said one person. Meanwhile, annual GDP growth in the region is running at between 5% and 6%, so increasing the subscriber base remains part of the strategy. \u001d  TDC's Lithuanian unit, Bite Lietuva, owns Latvian mobile business Bite Latvija, which is a relatively young asset, having only recently acquired the country's third license. \u001d  Just last week, TDC's Hungarian Telephone & Cable Corp., agreed to buy Hungarian fixed-line telecom firm Invitel Tavkozlesi Szolgaltata Zrt, in a deal worth EUR470 million from Mid Europa Partners and GMT Communications Partners. \u001d  The thinking behind that deal was that TDC would get better value on an eventual sale of HTTC if combined with Invitel, one person said. \u001d  A spokesperson for TDC wasn't immediately available to comment. \u001d  -By Marietta Cauchi, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 9241; marietta.cauchi@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:37 ET (17:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7427ecf14af47cd630fdeae9df1a54af","symR":["BKS"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Reflexis Announces Selection by Barnes & Noble of RetailAction Application","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BKS"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\bDEDHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2007-- \u001d  Reflexis Systems, the pioneer and leader in next-generation Retail Execution Management, announced today that Barnes & Noble (NYSE: BKS) has selected Reflexis' RetailAction application to manage tasks and execute retail strategy consistently in all 801 Barnes & Noble stores in its chain.

(NYSE:MDT) announced today the launch of a national campaign designed to raise awareness of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), its risk factors, and the role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in saving lives. SCA is the one of the nation's leading causes of death - claiming more lives than breast cancer, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS combined(1,2,3). \b \u001d  \"Today, nearly 1,000 Americans will die of sudden cardiac arrest - many of these deaths could have been prevented with ICD therapy,\" said Steve Mahle, president of Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management at Medtronic. \"We believe that more can be done to reach the hundreds of thousands of people who we know could benefit from ICD therapy, but remain unprotected. Ultimately, we believe this campaign will help save more lives.\" \b \u001d  The comprehensive campaign includes advertising; patient and caregiver information resources; physician education programs and outreach; and ongoing clinical research on SCA and the use of ICD therapy. The advertising begins this week with the launch of print, television, and online advertising in the U.S. \b \u001d  The ads, themed \"What's Inside,\" show the link between medical device technology and the benefits people can experience by living with ICD therapy. The ads encourage those who may be at greatest risk of SCA - people who have had a heart attack or been diagnosed with heart failure - to visit www.whatsinside.com or call 866-950-5550 for more information, including an SCA risk assessment that can be used to facilitate a discussion with a physician. \b \u001d  \"As the leader in implantable cardiac devices, we believe it's our responsibility to help ensure that those at greatest risk of SCA are informed about their choices so they can work together with their physicians to determine what's right for them,\" said David Steinhaus, MD, vice president and medical director of Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management at Medtronic. \"The right treatment - in many cases ICD therapy, as supported by current medical guidelines - provides peace of mind knowing that if you experience SCA, you will likely survive.\" \b \b   About Sudden Cardiac Arrest \b \u001d  Sudden cardiac arrest is a sudden, abrupt loss of heart function. Most SCA episodes are caused by the rapid and/or chaotic activity of the heart known as ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Recent estimates show that approximately 850,000 people in the U.S. are at risk of SCA and indicated for an ICD device, but remain unprotected. In fact, less than 35 percent of patients who are indicated for an ICD have one. \b \u001d  Sudden cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack. A heart attack is a malfunction caused by blockage in a vessel that supplies blood to the heart, which may permanently damage part of the heart. Unlike SCA, most people survive a first heart attack. SCA is an \"electrical\" malfunction of the heart that results in no blood flow to the body or the brain. Sudden cardiac arrest is 95 percent fatal if left untreated. \b \u001d  ICDs are highly reliable and are proven to be 98 percent effective in treating dangerous heart rhythms that can lead to SCA.(4) \b \b   About Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators \b \u001d  Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are designed to treat dangerously fast heart rhythms. The ICD was introduced in the early 1980s, and has been referred to as \"an emergency room in the chest.\" Today, an ICD is smaller than a cellphone and is implanted in the upper chest. It continuously monitors the electrical conduction system of the heart, watching for dangerous patterns and delivering electrical impulses when needed that may range from a tiny pulse like a cardiac pacemaker's to a full, life-saving shock that can return the heart to normal rhythm. \b \b   About Medtronic Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management (CRDM) \b \u001d  The Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management business at Medtronic, Inc. develops implantable pacemakers and defibrillators, monitoring and diagnostic devices, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices, including the first commercially approved implantable device for the treatment of heart failure. \b \b   About Medtronic \b \u001d  Medtronic, Inc.

Though waning U.S. demand, rising energy and raw-material costs and a glut of inexpensive Chinese exports already are pushing down prices, experts see little chance that European steel stocks will take a nose dive similar to that of 2005. Instead, they say, a greater willingness among steel companies to curb production in order to keep prices firm as well as more mergers and acquisitions in the sector should mean the cooldown will be shorter-lived and less dramatic than two years ago. \u001d  The biggest risk to that scenario, they say, is that investors will decide steel companies are overpaying for their targets and react by selling their shares. \u001d  After last year's heady gains, in which many steel stocks more than doubled, prices have fallen this month. German steel company Salzgitter AG, for example, is down 3.8%, and Mittal Steel Co., which is merging with Luxembourg-based Arcelor SA, is off 2.2%. But many analysts say they are unfazed by the declines, and some put this month's losses down to profit-taking. \u001d  \"I wouldn't advise people to sell the sector at the moment,\" said Commerzbank steel analyst Jutta Rosenbaum. \u001d  To be sure, some think the decline is tied to weaker metals prices and are more cautious. \u001d  \"The downturn in commodities has taken a firm hold of the stocks at the moment,\" said State Street Bank European strategist Michael O'Sullivan. \"The flow [out of steel stocks] tends to be quite persistent, and we don't see any signs that it's going to come to a halt in the very near future.\" \u001d  Strategists, fund managers and analysts agree the most crucial variable facing the steel industry is the so-called China factor -- the glut of inexpensive commodity steel exported from the Asian giant that could hurt demand for steel from other, more expensive producers. Moreover, if demand for steel within China cools but the country's steelmakers continue to boost production, the resulting flood of exports could deflate prices. \u001d  Credit Suisse's steel analysts cited the threat of inexpensive Asian steel, particularly from China, when they downgraded the steel sector to \"underweight\" from \"market weight\" earlier this month. \u001d  Many others argue that Chinese companies will need to restock steel inventories for their still-growing domestic market later this year after 2006's record export year, which they hope will curb the surplus of Chinese steel in the rest of the world. The Chinese government's decision to slash subsidies and tax breaks to steel exporters also should cool demand for Chinese steel, they say. \u001d  \"We think China is a temporary\" factor, said Didier Van De Veire, a steel analyst and fund manager at Petercam in Brussels. \u001d  Investors could get some indication of how companies view the China factor starting Friday, when ThyssenKrupp AG executives deliver their outlook at the annual general meeting. The German steel and technology company will report results for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31 on Feb. 13. Luxembourg-based Mittal, which calls itself Arcelor Mittal ahead of the completion of its merger, will report its full-year results Feb. 21. Salzgitter reports on March 8, and Anglo-Dutch producer Corus Group PLC, the target of rival takeover offers, reports on March 12. \u001d  This time last year, the price of hot rolled steel coil -- generally seen as a benchmark product for steel prices -- was set to embark on an eight-month, 20% climb, reaching $599 per ton in August, according to U.K.-based steel-research group MEPS International Ltd. While U.S. prices have since plummeted around 22% to about $510 per ton this month, from about $650 in mid-2006, European prices have slipped about $10 in the same period to $640 per ton, from a mid-2006 peak of about $650. The U.S. market has been hit by both the China effect and a softer housing market that has dented demand from the construction industry. European companies have benefited from accelerating growth in the region. \u001d  Analysts say another big reason why European prices have remained stable is last year's announced merger between Arcelor and Mittal and their subsequent production cuts. The ability of the world's largest steel producer by volume to withstand the short-term losses that come from curbing output is why many investment banks list it as their top steel pick for this year. \u001d  Analysts say they expect other steel companies to follow Arcelor Mittal's lead of cutting production in order to offset any drops in demand. Ms. Rosenbaum, the Commerzbank analyst, said ThyssenKrupp has already done so. Company spokesmen declined to comment. \u001d  \"Production levels need to keep dropping,\" said Rabobank steel analyst Richard Brakenhoff. Company earnings may take a short-term hit, but there is more to gain from the \"benefit from higher steel prices,\" he said. \u001d  That discipline could get an extra boost if companies continue to gain market share through acquisitions. Already, Corus is the target of competing bids from Brazil's Cia. Siderurgica Nacional and India's Tata Steel Ltd. \u001d  ThyssenKrupp has said it is looking to gain a foothold in North America through an acquisition. Salzgitter, which has a large stockpile of cash, also has said it is considering potential acquisitions. \u001d  Analysts say some of Europe's smaller steelmakers, including Austria's Voestalpine AG and Spain's Acerinox SA, are likely targets. Owners of more than 40% of Voestalpine's shares, however, are considered friendly to management, making a hostile bid unlikely. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 00:30 ET (05:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7638f406926ce56e8de615eee07c7fc0","symR":["TDG.UN.T","CA89635P1009"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Trinidad Energy Services Income Trust Announces Cash Distribution For January 2007>TDG.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T20:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TDG.UN.T","CA89635P1009"],"IndustryCodes":["DRL","OIE","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  CALGARY, Jan. 15 /CNW/ - Trinidad Energy Services Income Trust (\"TDG.UN\") announces that its monthly cash distribution to unitholders will be 11.5 cents per trust unit per month ($1.38 per annum) with the distribution to be paid February 15, 2007 to unitholders of record on January 31, 2007. \b \bThe Trust has implemented a Distribution Reinvestment Plan for the benefit of its unitholders.

(AMEX:YMI, TSX:YM, AIM:YMBA), an oncology company that identifies, develops and commercializes differentiated products for patients worldwide, today announced that the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the pivotal Phase III trial of tesmilifene in patients with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer has notified the Company that the milestone of 320 events required for the third interim analysis in its pivotal Phase III trial has occurred. \b \u001d  Since the last \"data sweep\" was completed in November 2006, the DSMB advised the Company to conduct a further data sweep to bring the survival data current prior to performing the third interim analysis. This data sweep is ongoing and the Company expects this work to be completed and to have a formal recommendation from the DSMB in February 2007. A data sweep is conducted on a periodic basis prior to each interim analysis. \b \u001d  \"Although we are eager to learn the outcome of this third interim analysis, a meticulous review by the DSMB of any new data is entirely in keeping with the rigor of this trial,\" said David Allan, Chairman and CEO of YM BioSciences. \"Because of the interest in this third analysis and expectations that it might occur this month, we decided to confirm that the threshold number of events has been reached. We have no additional information from this trial at this time.\" \b \u001d  The pivotal Phase III trial compares the survival of patients treated with tesmilifene combined with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide to epirubicin/cyclophosphamide alone in women with rapidly progressing metastatic and/or recurrent breast cancer. The trial, which completed enrollment of 723 patients in September 2005, is the subject of a Special Protocol Assessment and a Fast Track designation for advanced breast cancer by the FDA. \b \u001d  The trial is being conducted according to a sequential design that permits a number of planned interim analyses and the trial will continue until one of two specific statistical conditions is satisfied. At each analysis, the hazard ratio between the tesmilifene-containing treatment arm and the control arm is calculated and then reviewed by the DSMB. The trial may be concluded if either the tesmilifene-containing treatment arm is superior to the control by a specified margin or it is determined that such evidence is not going to be found. If the evidence is insufficient for either conclusion to be drawn, then the trial continues until the next analysis. At the first and second interim analyses, the DSMB recommended that the trial continue as planned. \b \b    About Tesmilifene \b \u001d  Tesmilifene is a novel, small molecule that selectively targets multiple-drug resistant (MDR) tumor cells, sensitizing them to chemotherapy. Tesmilifene may offer clinical benefit in a number of tumor types and is being tested with a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens. In addition to the current pivotal trial, a Phase III trial of tesmilifene with doxorubicin in metastatic or recurrent breast cancer has been completed and a Phase II study to evaluate tesmilifene plus docetaxel (Taxotere(R)) in patients with metastatic breast cancer is being conducted in collaboration with Sanofi-Aventis. In hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), two single-arm Phase II trials of tesmilifene in combination with chemotherapy (one with mitoxantrone plus prednisone; the other with cyclophosphamide) and a randomized Phase II trial comparing cyclophosphamide alone to cyclophosphamide plus tesmilifene have been conducted. Based on the clinical data generated from these three studies, the Company is currently evaluating additional clinical work in patients with HRPC. Clinical studies in other tumor types, including gastric and hepatic cancer, are also being planned. \b \b    About YM BioSciences \b \u001d  YM BioSciences Inc. is an oncology company that identifies, develops and commercializes differentiated products for patients worldwide. In addition to tesmilifene, the Company has two other late-stage products: nimotuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is approved in several countries for treatment of various types of head and neck cancer, and is in clinical trials in numerous tumor types including glioma (pediatric and adult), pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer, cervical cancer and breast cancer; and AeroLEF(TM), a unique, inhaled-delivery composition of free and liposome-encapsulated fentanyl in development for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. \b \u001d  This press release may contain forward-looking statements, which reflect the Company's current expectation regarding future events. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, events or developments to be materially different from any future results, events or developments expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing market conditions, the successful and timely completion of clinical studies, the establishment of corporate alliances, the impact of competitive products and pricing, new product development, uncertainties related to the regulatory approval process and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's ongoing quarterly and annual reporting. Certain of the assumptions made in preparing forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the following: that the pivotal tesmilifene Phase III trial will be completed on schedule and yield mature data in calendar 2007; that the DSMB's recommendations to continue the pivotal trial for tesmilifene based on three planned interim analyses implies that the trial continues to have the prospect of meeting its primary endpoint; that nimotuzumab will continue to demonstrate a competitive safety profile in ongoing and future clinical trials; that YM and its various partners will complete their respective clinical trials within the timelines communicated in this release.

The company says today will be treated as a normal work day. \u001d  Smithfield says that five years ago, employees were asked whether they wanted to take off Easter or Martin Luther King Day and overwhelmingly voted for Easter. \u001d  The effort is being supported by the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which has tried unsuccessfully to organize the plant for more than a decade. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:51 ET (12:51 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"76c61215be25421970d11a4d21d7420b","symR":["PT","PTC.LB","SNC.LB","PTPTC0AM0009","PTSNC0AE0006","PT","PTC.LB","SNC.LB","SON.LB","PTPTC0AM0009","PTSNC0AE0006","PTSON0AE0001"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"SonaeCom Reiterates EUR9.5/Shr Portugal Telecom Bid Fair","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T17:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PT","PTC.LB","SNC.LB","PTPTC0AM0009","PTSNC0AE0006"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","CTS","FIS","FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XENX","XNYA","XP20","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:21 ET (17:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"76d3dd3b10bb8d86a0b41d31c8bf4b8b","symR":["FWB.MI","IT0001423562"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Fastweb Preliminary FY EUR1.26B, Up About 30% Vs 2005","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T07:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FWB.MI","IT0001423562"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XISL","XMIB"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 02:47 ET (07:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"77a08f35295dc077987900b73cbf2945","symR":["7973.NY","JP3839800004"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Japan's Houtoku Expects This FY Group Net Y30M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T06:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["7973.NY","JP3839800004"],"IndustryCodes":["FTR","HPR"],"Story":"\b \b    Houtoku Co. also released the following forecasts: \b \b                     1st Half To             Yr Ending \bGROUP                   May 2007              Nov 2007 \bSales                  Y3.83 bln             Y6.35 bln \bPretax Profit            200 mln                50 mln \bNet Profit               180 mln                30 mln \bPer share \b  Earnings               N/A                  3.74 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 01:50 ET (06:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"77c5a5a83f3c3ce10652448c17529290","symR":["SARE.MX","MX01SA030007","SARE.MX","MX01SA030007"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Mexico's Sare Ups '07 Rev Guidance To 19%-20% Growth","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T19:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SARE.MX","MX01SA030007"],"IndustryCodes":["HOM","HPR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 14:08 ET (19:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"77cf47728ca271644014482c00a5487b","symR":["ORWE.CI","TKA.XE","DE0007500001","EGS33041C012"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ThyssenKrupp Confirms $680 Mln Petrochem Order From Egypt","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T11:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ORWE.CI","TKA.XE","DE0007500001","EGS33041C012"],"IndustryCodes":["CHC","CHM","FTR","HPR","IDD","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DUBAI (Dow Jones)--Uhde, an engineering and construction firm owned by Germany's ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE), has won a $680 million contract to build a petrochemical complex near Port Said in Egypt, the company said Monday. \u001d  Dortmund-based Uhde will engineer and build a 350,000 metric tons per year propylene plant and a facility of the same size to produce polypropylene for Egyptian Propylene & Polypropylene Co., or EPPC, Uhde said in an emailed statement, which confirms a Dow Jones Newswires story from Nov. 14. \u001d  The new complex will use Uhde-owned process technology and is due to be completed by the end of 2009, the company said. \u001d  EPPC, which is partly owned by Cairo-based Oriental Weavers Group (ORWE.CI), will use propane gas from local supplies as feedstock, according to the statement. \u001d  Gas-rich Middle East countries, including Egypt, are investing in petrochemical projects that use abundantly available and comparatively cheap natural gas to meet rising demand from export markets such as Europe and Asia. \u001d  -By Oliver Klaus, Dow Jones Newswires;

Get over it. We found that three that shot up 49 percent in five months -- and are poised for continued growth.] \b \u001d  IT HAS BEEN only five months since we closed our eyes, took a deep breath and wrote this first sentence for a story: \"Internet stocks are back.\" While the wounds may still seem fresh for investors who were burned by the sector's freefall a few years ago, those who jumped in at our recommendation in September should be feeling whole again. Our portfolio of three Internet stocks shot up 49 percent, blowing the healthy 15 percent return for the Standard & Poor's 500 right out of the water. \u001d  A lot has happened to drive those returns. Google bought 19-month-old YouTube for $1.6 billion; Microsoft released Vista, its long-awaited operating system; and Internet advertising revenues rose to a new record high of $4.2 billion in the third quarter, up 33 percent from 2005. While it's still premature to dust off our 1999 party caps, investors in Internet stocks should sleep well at night. \"Without question, we are still very early in seeing economic returns from these stocks,\" says Robert Hagstrom, portfolio manager of the Legg Mason Growth Trust fund, who holds several Internet stocks in his fund. \u001d  Our top performer was Akamai Technologies, the leading player in the content-distribution business. It does the behind-the-scenes work on your downloads by capturing content, like a digital song, on its server and delivering it to your computer. As broadband usage grows, so do digital downloads, a fact that has helped push Akamai's shares up 64 percent. But investors should hold on tight, because the ride's not over yet. \"We'd be hard-pressed to say it's cheap right now, but we think it's a great long-term holding,\" says Tara Hedlund, portfolio manager for the Turner New Enterprise fund. \u001d  To be sure, \"cheap\" is not a word many people are throwing around these days in talking about these Internet stocks. Shares of InterActiveCorp soared 48 percent since we recommended it. Investors don't seem troubled that Chief Executive Barry Diller was declared the highest-paid CEO in the country in 2005 -- estimates of his compensation run up to $295 million. \"Those who have been with Barry since day one have made a lot of money,\" Hagstrom says. Its diversified portfolio of properties, including LendingTree, Ticketmaster and the search engine Ask.com, provide stable growth, Hagstrom says. He especially likes InterActive's \"enormous cash flows.\" \u001d  Adobe Systems brought up the rear of the portfolio with its 35 percent gain. It currently trades at 29 times 2007 earnings, and Kevin Landis, manager of the Firsthand Technology Leaders fund, says it \"can reasonably go to 35\" during the next year, making it a $47 stock. \"This is a healthy, solid business,\" he says. \b \u001d  Revisiting John Lynch \b \u001d  IN OUR MAY ISSUE, we introduced you to the fast-talking, wheeling-and-dealing computer-equipment trader John Lynch in \"Rebel Rouser.\" As the head of Asset Recovery Center, Lynch buys used hardware for pennies on the dollar and resells it at a premium. At the time, Cisco equipment was in high demand, selling at a 50 to 75 percent markup. The demand and pricing Lynch sees can be a good indicator for investors: Since our May issue, Cisco stock has run up 29 percent. And now? Lynch says the story on his end is much the same today as it was back in May. Sounds like a buy to us. \b \b                         HEARTBREAKERS NO MORE \b \b                          Price      Price     Total \bCompany (Ticker)        7/14/06     12/7/06    Return \b \bAdobe Systems (ADBE)     $28.01      $37.75     34.8% \bAkamai Tech.

The oil was light (c. 30 degrees API) and sweet with a low gas-oil ratio and some associated wax. \b \u001d  Following the encouraging result in the secondary objective of the Kingfisher-1 well, the partners commenced drilling the Kingfisher-1A sidetrack, which aimed to step-out into the basin to test the primary exploration objectives of the well and penetrate as much of the deeper sedimentary section as possible to a maximum depth of 4,000 meters. Since the last report, the Kingfisher-1A well has been successfully cased to 2,502 meters and drilled to a depth of 2,962 meters. \b \u001d  New drilling in the deeper section has encountered three additional potential oil-bearing zones totalling approximately 40 meters between 2,260 and 2,370 meters, evidenced by wireline logging and formation pressure testing. Planned testing of these zones will follow completion of drilling, to a target depth of between 3,000 and 4,000 meters, which it is estimated will take up to a further 45 days. Test equipment has remained on site in readiness for the testing. \b \u001d  The Kingfisher prospect is a very large structural high that is expressed at surface on the bed of Lake Albert. Seismic data indicates the Kingfisher prospect has an areal extent of up to approximately 70 square kilometers, although the Kingfisher-1A well is only investigating a limited part of this structure. \b \u001d  As part of an accelerated work program in Uganda, the joint venture partners are planning to acquire approximately 270 square kilometers of 3D seismic over the Kingfisher structure commencing in the first half of 2007. Options for further drilling of the Kingfisher prospect and other prospects in Lake Albert are being appraised. \b \u001d  Heritage is operator of and holds a 50% interest in Block 3A, which has an area of 1991 square kilometers. Heritage is also operator of and holds a 50% interest in Block 1, which has an area of 4,285 square kilometers and is located to the north of Block 3A in the Albert Basin. Tullow holds the other 50% interests in Blocks 3A and 1. \b \b    Notes to Editors \b \u001d  Tullow is a leading independent oil & gas, exploration and production group, quoted on the London and Irish Stock Exchanges (symbol: TLW) and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. The Group has interests in over 100 exploration and production licenses across over 20 countries and focuses on three principal core areas: NW Europe, Africa and South Asia. \b \u001d  Tullow's NW Europe interests are primarily focused on gas in the UK Southern North Sea where it has significant interests in the Caister-Murdoch System and the Thames/Hewett areas and operates over 60% of its production. \b \u001d  In Africa, Tullow has exploration and production in Gabon, Cote d'Ivoire, Congo (Brazzaville), Mauritania and Equatorial Guinea and a large gas field development and appraisal program in Namibia. Tullow also has exploration programs in Mauritania, Senegal, Cameroon, Uganda, Congo (DRC), Tanzania, Madagascar, Angola and Ghana. \b \u001d  In South Asia, Tullow has exploration and production in Pakistan and Bangladesh and high impact exploration activities in India. \b \u001d  Following the recently completed acquisition of Hardman Resources Limited, Tullow also has high impact exploration interests in French Guyana, Surinam and the Falkland Islands. \b \b    For further information please refer to our website at www.tullowoil.com \b \b     Contact:  Tom Hickey \b               Chris Perry \b               Tullow Oil plc \b               + 44-20-8996-1000 \b                 - or - \b               Brian J.

The result was in line with analyst estimates of CHF444 million. \u001d  The company didn't provide a specific guidance for 2007 other than saying that \"2007 continues the positive trend experienced in 2006. \u001d  But the company reiterated its 2008 target of achieving earnings per share of CHF80. In 2006, earnings per share stood at CHF57.89, up 18.5% from the year-earlier period. \u001d  \"The figures are solid but not spectacular\", said Philipp Gamper, an analyst at Bank Sarasin. He said he would keep a neutral rating on the stock with a CHF1,450 price target. \u001d  Scott Weldon, analyst at Bank Vontobel, agreed. He noted that five out of 10 SGS units, among them key operations such as oil, gas & chemical services as well as industrial services, performed well. He said he would maintain a market perform rating, citing a relatively high valuation. \u001d  At 0850 GMT on the higher Swiss bourse, SGS shares were  down CHF0.17, or 1.2%, at CHF1378. \u001d  The company also didn't give any update on its plan to step up acquisitions-driven growth, a strategy it flagged late last year when it replaced chief executive Dan Kerpelman with company insider Chris Kirk, who it saw as more suitable to capture takeover opportunities. \u001d  Sarasin's Gamper said the company is unlikely to detail an acquisition strategy later Monday when presents results at an annual press conference. He expects the company to continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions rather than seek a transforming deal. \u001d  Sales in 2006 rose 15.5% to CHF3.82 billion from CHF3.31 billion and earnings before interest and taxes rose 24.3% to CHF624 million from CHF502 million. Analysts had expected sales to stand at CHF3.82 billion and EBIT at CHF605 million. \u001d  As expected, the company proposed a reduced dividend of CHF20, down from the exceptionally high CHF50 per share paid last year. Expectations for the dividend had ranged between CHF18 to more than CHF30 per share. \u001d  SGS has often stated it plans to play an active role in an industry consolidation, citing the high fragmentation of the market and its financial power. \u001d  SGS's rivals include Bureau Veritas of France, German TUEV and London-based Intertek Group Plc (ITRK.LN). Bureau Veritas, a company SGS is rumored to be interested in, is controlled by France-based investment company Wendel Investissement (12120.FR). \u001d  SGS shareholders include the German Von Finck family, which owns a 23.7% stake and Ifil Investments SpA (IFL.MI), the Italian Agnelli family holding, which holds 13.2%. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sgs.com \b \u001d  -By Martin Gelnar, Dow Jones Newswires; +43 79 821 5617; martin.gelnar@dowjones.com \u001d  (Goran Mijuk in Zurich contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 04:05 ET (09:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"796dd272769a2fa6f2ce62f405167654","symR":["006800.SE","8615.TO","JP3294400001","KR7006800007"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"M'bishi UFJ,Daewoo Securities To Create Partnership-Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T16:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["006800.SE","8615.TO","JP3294400001","KR7006800007"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co.

The increase is due to higher administrative expenses and increased corporate activity. \b \bDuring the period the Company expended $847,000 mainly on the Kevitsa nickel copper project in Finland, where pilot plant metallurgical testwork and diamond drilling was undertaken. During the Quarter the application for the mining permit was submitted to the Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry, which is the responsible authority for mine permitting in Finland. \b \bAt November 30th, the Company's cash position was $15,361,000 up from $6,969,000 at August 31st primarily as a result of the financing of $9.1 million completed in October. This healthy cash position will enable the Company to continue with its plan towards the production at Kevitsa. \b \bThe current work on the Kevitsa, including further metallurgical testing and permitting, will form part of the full bankable feasibility study which is expected to start in the second quarter of calendar 2007, and is expected to take up to one year to complete at a preliminary estimated cost of $3.0 million. At the same time, detailed planning is under way for the upgrading of the present forest road, which connects Kevitsa to the main north-south highway in Northern Finland, located 7 km to the west of the property. Planning is also under way for the power and water supply to the project. Power will be sourced from a 21 MW hydroelectric dam on the Kitinen River, 6 km west of Kevitsa. The water supply will also be drawn from this river. \b \bKevitsa is one of the world's largest undeveloped nickel sulphide orebodies and is the Company's flagship project. \b \bAbout Scandinavian Minerals \b \bScandinavian Minerals Limited is a Canadian public company based in Toronto, Canada and incorporated in 2003.

GE, Fairfield, Connecticut, for years has been interested in acquiring the division, these people said. \u001d  Smiths has been under pressure from shareholders to pare its activities. It operates four main businesses, including a division that is one of the world's largest makers of airport detection-and-screening equipment and another unit involved in manufacturing a wide range of medical devices. \u001d  The deal is expected to be announced as soon as this morning. A Smiths spokesman declined to comment, and a GE spokesman also declined to comment. \u001d  GE's purchase of the British business may mark a return of U.S. buyers to European industries. After two years of frenzied merger-and-acquisition activity in the U.S. and Europe, few U.S. companies have ventured to Europe. One of the reasons is the relatively weak dollar, which drives up the cost of acquisitions. \u001d  But jetliners are priced in U.S. dollars, which has put pressure on producers such as Airbus and British jet-engine maker Rolls-Royce PLC, which face higher costs because of their stronger currencies at home. As a result, aerospace firms seek components from companies in the U.S. or in places with currencies linked to the dollar. Cost and competitive pressures are also starting to force suppliers to seek economies of scale through consolidation. \u001d  Smiths's aerospace division produces a broad range of components and systems used on commercial and military aircraft produced by Boeing Co., European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.'s Airbus unit and others. Many of the parts Smiths produces -- such as propellers, control equipment and displays -- go into components made by other aerospace contractors one level up the chain, such as GE, Goodrich Corp. and United Technologies Corp. \u001d  The commercial-aviation industry is experiencing one of the biggest upswings in decades, with Boeing and Airbus just closing their second-best years for jetliner sales after 2005. Together, they have landed orders for almost 4,500 jetliners during the past three years. Now, they and their suppliers must build all those planes, which will keep them humming with business well into the next decade. \u001d  --- \u001d  Daniel Michaels and J.

This compares to a net loss of approximately $205,100 ($.01 per share) on revenues of approximately $65,600 for the quarter ended November 30, 2005. The increased loss is mainly attributable to higher depreciation charges (approximately $76,000) and water assessment fees (approximately $75,000) relating to the water rights and other assets acquired in the Arkansas River valley on August 31, 2006. \b \u001d  The Company also announced that based on discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") on January 11, 2007, the Company will be restating its 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K to correct an error in the balance sheet. The Company will remove the Contingent obligations payable upon default of HP A&M liability account and the related contra-equity receivable from HP A&M account. The Company requested concurrence from the Commission on its purchase accounting entries related to its purchase of Arkansas River water rights and related properties and based on this request the Commission determined that the promissory notes maintained by the sellers did not constitute an indirect guarantee of debt pursuant to US accounting rules. The Company and the Commission continue to review other purchase accounting issues related to the Company's acquisition of Arkansas River water rights and properties. The Company will amend its 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K as soon as practicable. Such amendments will only relate to the accounting for the asset acquisition and will not impact the Company's statements of operations or cash flows.

No only is MAN no mood to sweeten its current offer, but a friendly merger isn't likely to happen for months, if not years. \u001d  True, Swedish industrial holding company Investor appears to favor such a merger - having hailed VW's decision. It said it is open to discussing how a combination could be created in a way that is beneficial for all involved, because it thinks a friendly merger would generate bigger synergies. \u001d  But this newfound positivity is based on Scania taking a leading role in a friendly merger, instead of being offered a few seats on MAN's board as Samuelsson was offering. Whether VW would agree to that remains to be seen. \u001d  It's worth remembering that the sort of merger of equals that Scania's and MAN's seem to be thinking of look good on paper, but are notoriously hard to pull off in practice. Somebody has to be in charge. \u001d  While VW may wield influence over Scania and MAN, it's hard to see MAN's German workforce rejoicing if the Swedes took control. \u001d  And issues that riled the Swedes, such as the potential loss of jobs to Germany - because MAN's Munich employees have job guarantees - and the peculiarities of German corporate governance, remain unresolved. \u001d  Finally, VW may yet get sidetracked by more pressing questions nearer home as recently installed CEO Martin Winterkorn puts his new strategy in place. \b \u001d  (Martin Fluck joined Dow Jones Newswires in 2006.

David Joyce, a media analyst at Miller Tabak, notes that the company is creating joint ventures with foreign media companies to start new channels like La Sexta, in Spain, and coproduce shows like the comedy Amor Mio. The firm is also making strides in digital media with a new service that lets Web users download music, movies and TV shows. And in February, Televisa plans to launch a voice, Internet and TV service -- the same \"triple play\" service that has been a home run for U.S. media companies. \u001d  The cliffhanger to the story, if there is one, is Televisa's cash hoard, which should grow to about $2.5 billion, or $4.93 a share, if the company sells its stake in Univision, as predicted, later this year. Analysts expect Televisa to share some of that with shareholders, perhaps through a special dividend. \b \u001d  Republic Services (RSG, $42) \u001d  LIKE NORFOLK SOUTHERN, Republic Services has faced a chorus of naysayers who believe a slowing economy will curb the garbage hauler's gains. But thanks to a broad geographic footprint and some timely price hikes, Republic has won over analysts, who have been raising estimates for 2007 earnings. \u001d  Much of Republic's business is resilient to the economy's ups and downs, in part because of the markets it dominates, including the Sun Belt and Las Vegas. Both areas are experiencing strong population growth that should keep business expanding faster than the economy. The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based firm also generates about a third of its sales from franchise markets -- basically monopolies granted by the government that produce high-margin, long-term contracts. And in a competitive industry, Republic has targeted second-tier markets, such as Harrisburg, Pa., and Charleston, S.C., where it doesn't have to butt heads as frequently with larger rivals. \u001d  Wall Street has chastised Republic in the past for paying attention to cash flow and return on investment instead of following the path of its larger rivals and bulking up growth with acquisitions. Those companies are now following Republic's lead. After years of focusing on getting bigger, even if it meant lowering prices to attract new business, other waste haulers are now concentrating on profits. That helps Republic because it can more easily raise prices now that its competitors are also boosting their rates, says T. Rowe's Bates. \u001d  Republic's stock has climbed 160 percent since 2001. But Bates still sees further upside, with the company's stable business and ability to generate cash-which set it up to pay higher dividends and boost buybacks-enticing more investors. He expects 10 to 12 percent earnings growth for the next three years plus a 2 percent dividend yield, which produces a 12 to 14 percent annual return -- not bad for a low-tech business like trash. \b \u001d  Manpower (MAN, $71) \u001d  THE WORLD'S SECOND-LARGEST staffing firm has a not-so-secret weapon that is helping it repeatedly surprise Wall Street with strong profit growth. While Manpower is based in Milwaukee, it generates the bulk of its business abroad -- with almost 70 percent coming from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. While those regions are behind Manpower's recent profit surprises, investors still seem focused on the U.S. portion of the business, which makes up just 12 percent of sales, expected to total $19 billion in 2006. \u001d  For some time Manpower's investment in Europe was held against it, even weighing on the company's valuation. But now that Europe is strong, some investors are fixating on a slowdown in hiring in the U.S., says Jeff Silber, education and staffing analyst at BMO Capital Markets. \u001d  With economies across the Atlantic perking up, conditions are perfect for a staffing company like Manpower. Its French operations, which make up about a third of sales, are improving now that a major competitor has become less aggressive on pricing. All signs suggest that Manpower's business in Europe (not including France), the Middle East and Africa -- which makes up 35 percent of sales -- should continue to drive profit growth as Europeans embrace the idea of using highly skilled temps as part of their corporate fabric. \u001d  It's concrete factors like these that value investors like to see to validate those shorter-term momentum indicators. Analysts have increased their 2007 earnings estimates for Manpower by 8 percent in the past three months, to $4.31 a share, and the stock has rallied 23 percent. But Frank James, head of the James Advantage funds, expects further upside, precisely because of that momentum. \"The company is under-valued relative to the market,\" he adds. \"This is not a glamour name but a solid earnings performer, and the market is not expecting much from it.\" In other words, a value investor's dream. \u001d  --- \b                          Wake-Up Calls \b \b  Rising earnings estimates and price momentum signal more gains ahead for these five value picks. \b \bCompany (Ticker) \bPrice ($)      Mkt.

The number outstripped an average expectation of $698.4 million expected by seven analysts surveyed by the company. \u001d  FTSE 100-listed Vedanta produces a range of metals, with key products including aluminum, copper, zinc and lead. Its main operations are in India. \u001d  The production and earnings update got a mixed reception from analysts. \u001d  One analyst, who asked to remain nameless, said the results looked \"pretty solid to us,\" adding that the numbers were \"pretty much in line with our expectations.\" \u001d  Vedanta's shares \"should trade pretty positively\" Monday, the analyst added. \u001d  At 0841 GMT Vedanta's shares were trading up 3.6% or 42 pence at 1152 pence, outperforming a mixed mining sector. \u001d  But another analyst, while saying the company had posted a \"reasonably good\" set of numbers, with a strong performance from its Indian assets, highlighted the problems in Zambia. \u001d  Costs at Konkola Copper Mines - Vedanta's Zambian business - are \"astronomically high,\" the analyst said, calculating that they are running at $1.71 per pound of copper. \"I think you need to see a bit of progress there to get radically positive on the stock.\"   The second analyst pointed to the stock of copper miner Kazakhmys PLC (KAZ.LN) as providing better exposure to base metals - pointing out that it is cheaper on the basis of price to earnings ratio. \u001d  In terms of production, the biggest increase on the same quarter last year came for the company's aluminum division, which produced 98,000 metric tons, up from 60,000 tons in the third quarter of last year. The first analyst said this performance offset the disappointing showing in Zambia. \u001d  Copper cathode production in Zambia was 35,000 tons, down from 46,000 tons in the third quarter of the previous year. A mine effluent spillage late last year caused the company's copper leach plant to be closed and 50,000 residents in a local town to be left without water. The company said the environmental issues had been resolved and \"steady and cautious steps are now being taken to bring the leaching plant back to its normal levels of production,\" Vedanta said in its press release. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.vedantaresources.com \b \u001d  -By Jackie Range, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 9257; jackie.range@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 04:03 ET (09:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7fa46bd40c861842a6136da19072116b","symR":["CSH.UN.T","MDA.T","MN.T","SZR.UN.T","TUI.UN.T","CA16140U1003","CA5542821031","CA5662191017","CA86770Q1090","CA8978391065"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Canada Hot Stocks: MDA.T MN.T SZR.UN.T CSH.UN.T TUI.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T16:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CSH.UN.T","MDA.T","MN.T","SZR.UN.T","TUI.UN.T","CA16140U1003","CA5542821031","CA5662191017","CA86770Q1090","CA8978391065"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","OIS","REA","REI","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":""},{"md5ID":"7fb8297241b1caed1dc87747bca3b698","symR":["12533.FR","FR0000125338"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Capgemini, Kemira Sign Major Outsourcing Agreement","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T07:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12533.FR","FR0000125338"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 02:31 ET (07:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7ff406b806540d71325b169c524f8a58","symR":["6301.TO","8015.TO","G.T","GG","KMTUY","CA3809564097","JP3304200003","JP3635000007"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Komatsu Wins Big Orders From Mexico,China Mining Cos-Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T21:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6301.TO","8015.TO","G.T","GG","KMTUY","CA3809564097","JP3304200003","JP3635000007"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS","STL","TRQ","X225","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Komatsu Ltd.

(TWX), in a move that will force AOL to raise its offer if it wants to gain control of the Swedish online advertising firm. \u001d  Alecta earlier Monday became TradeDoubler's largest shareholder after raising its stake to 10.01%. This gives the company the power to block AOL's bid which is conditional on receiving approval from more than 90% of TradeDoubler's shareholders. \u001d  At 1455 GMT, shares in TradeDoubler were trading SEK29.50 higher, or 14.9%, at SEK227.50 - well above AOL's offer price of SEK215 per share. \u001d  \"We don't believe the bid of SEK215 per share reflects the value and growth potential that we expect,\" Peter van Berlekom, head of Alecta's stock unit, said in a statement. \u001d  The offer price of SEK215 represents a 9% premium to TradeDoubler's SEK198 Friday closing price and a 20% premium to the average price in the last 90 days. \u001d  So far AOL's bid has only been officially accepted by owners holding 20% of TradeDoubler's stocks, including the company's two founders, some senior executives and Arctic Ventures, which holds 9.5% of the company. TradeDoubler's board of directors has also recommended shareholders approve the bid. \u001d  According to Mats Bergstroem at Nordea, the acquisition makes strategic sense to Time Warner since its online advertising network, advertising.com, has a limited presence in Europe. But Bergstroem said the price is on the low side. He has a buy rating on TradeDoubler. \u001d  \"With AOL and Advertising.com, we have built a robust online advertising business in Europe, and TradeDoubler will help us accelerate the growth of this business,\" said Jeff Bewkes, chief operating officer at Time Warner. \u001d  TradeDoubler is Europe's largest provider of so-called performance-based online marketing services, matching advertisers with online sites, which are then rewarded based on the response to a specific ad. \u001d  According to analysts, the Swedish company, which was founded in 1999 and listed in 2005, is number one in 17 of the 18 of the European markets where it operates. \u001d  Rivals include German firms AdLINK Internet Media AG and Zanox, as well as Commission Junction Inc. of the U.S., controlled by ValueClick Inc.

Indicated thereon viewers and readers will see the location of Highway 63 between Edmonton and Fort McMurray, which runs to the east of our plant site; the pre-existing utility right-of way for power and pipelines; trucks traveling to and from the main borrow pit; the construction camp; the tank construction area and office; the main facility site including tank pads and the treater pad area; drilling pad 102 with TriCity rig No.37 which is drilling five horizontal well pairs; and the road towards Pad 101 on which two rigs will shortly be drilling an additional ten well pairs in anticipation of the summer 2007 startup of steaming followed by oil production from Pod One. \b \bAlso attached to this release is a recent (January 9, 2007) picture of progress at our main tank building and also a picture of oil removal filters (\"orf's\") on site at Great Divide. It should be noted that most of the equipment, skids and modules for the Pod One plant are completed and are being stored off-site awaiting installation in accordance with the established timetable. \b \bSee http://files.newswire.ca/574/connacher.jpg for photos. \b \bPOD ONE DEVELOPMENT \b \bConnacher is very pleased with the overall progress of its drilling and plant construction program at its Great Divide Pod One development project. As is evident from the attached aerial photograph, considerable civil and construction work has been completed. The company expects to install the two evaporators utilized in its water handling and processing system during the latter part of January 2007. Tank and Treater building construction will also proceed once framing and piping installation is further advanced. Civil work at Pad 101 west of Pad 102 is complete so drilling can proceed on schedule once the five well pairs on Pad 102 are completed. These wells are being drilled in a westerly direction and will interact with the ten well pairs to be drilled in a northeasterly and a southwesterly direction from Pad 101 to drain the initial area of influence and produce 10,000 bbl/d of bitumen for the next six to eight years, before new well pairs will be required to maintain production levels by accessing other undrained portions of the Pod One accumulation. \b \bAt this juncture Connacher is comfortable with respect to its timetable and budget, reflecting the merits of sound pre-construction engineering and design work and development of reliable cost estimates from established suppliers of equipment and services. \b \bGREAT DIVIDE CORE HOLE AND SEISMIC PROGRAM \b \bConnacher was able to complete six core holes on its main lease block near Pod One, Pod Two and Pod Five during the month of December 2006. This marks the first time since acquiring the leases in early 2004 that Connacher was able to conduct field operations prior to year end. The results of these additional core holes will be available for inclusion in year end reserve and resource estimates to be conducted by GLJ Petroleum Consultants (\"GLJ\"), independent consultant for the company, as part of Connacher's normal compilation of year end operating and financial results. These are anticipated to be reported to shareholders on March 23, 2007 after the close of trading on Canadian stock markets. \b \bSince year end 2006 Connacher has accelerated its core hole drilling program and is now operating with four rigs and one additional rig is being utilized solely to drill surface hole and set surface pipe in advance of the arrival of the core hole rigs. A total of 70 core holes are scheduled for drilling on the company's main lease block prior to breakup in the spring of 2007. Initial results from drilling are most encouraging with numerous wells encountering thick oil-bearing zones. The results of the total core hole program and seismic program scheduled to commence imminently will be provided to GLJ on a continuous basis and updated reserve estimates reflecting the Winter 2007 program will likely be provided to shareholders and investors around mid-year. \b \bThe outcome of drilling, particularly from wells near or associated with Pod Two northeast of Pod One, will determine if Connacher will be able to proceed on a timely basis this spring with a formal application to develop this accumulation, after due consultation with relevant stakeholders and authorities. \b \bOTHER \b \bIn early January 2007 Connacher received approximately $10 million from the December 2006 sale of scattered minor properties to a private foreign-owned company. Proceeds were utilized to pay down short-term bank debt. In Connacher's opinion, the transaction metrics were favorable for the approximate 240 boe/d disposition of this non-core, high-cost stripper production. \b \bThe company has commenced its conventional drilling program in northern Alberta. A total of approximately 25 wells are anticipated for 2007 in winter-only access areas if warranted by initial results and if permitted by weather conditions. \b \bConnacher acquired an additional 11.5 sections (7,360 acres) of oil sands rights at the January 10, 2007 Crown Sale in Alberta. This brings the company's total oil sands lease holdings in the region to approximately 90,000 acres or 140 sections, exclusive of P&NG rights held in the area for their natural gas prospectivity. \b \bIn addition to its extensive oil sands project and its conventional exploration and production operations at Marten Creek and Three Hills, Alberta and at Battrum, Saskatchewan, Connacher owns a 10,000 bbl/d refinery at Great Falls, Montana, where it is in the midst of constructing a new 150,000 barrel asphalt storage tank which will enable continued year-round high throughput rates at the refinery. Also, construction of a NaHs unit to extract impurities from the fuel gas supply was recently completed, which will enhance environmental performance. \b \bConnacher also owns a 26 percent (fully-diluted) interest in Petrolifera Petroleum Limited (PDP - TSX), which demonstrated significant production growth from approximately 1,000 bbl/d or light gravity crude oil in January 2006 to over 13,400 bbl/d in December 2006 as a result of new drilling. This organic growth should continue during 2007 as Petrolifera has announced it plans to drill over 50 wells at Puesto Morales this year and also is anticipating commencement of drilling on its high-potential blocks in Peru. Connacher's net current cash investment in Petrolifera is only $2 million and its holdings have a current market value in excess of $210 million. \b \bConnacher Oil and Gas Limited is a public Calgary-based oil and natural gas exploration and production company. Its principal asset is extensive holdings in Alberta's oil sands at Great Divide, situated approximately 50 miles southwest of Fort McMurray. Significant conventional oil and natural gas production and reserves are also held in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Connacher owns and operates a 10,000 bbl/d refinery at Great Falls, Montana and owns a significant equity stake in Petrolifera Petroleum Limited, a public Canadian oil company active in South America. \b \bForward-Looking Statements: This press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities law.

(\"ProspEx\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide an operational update. \b \bThe Company exited 2006 with production of approximately 3,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\"), which was in line with previously announced guidance of 3,400 to 3,600 boe/d. Fourth quarter 2006 average production was approximately 3,140 boe/d. Annual average production for 2006 is estimated at 3,180 boe/d, within the Company's guidance range of 3,150 to 3,250 boe/d. \b \bIn the fourth quarter, the Company operated an active drilling program in West Central Alberta and the Deep Basin, in addition to non-operated activity in Southern Alberta. In total, ProspEx participated in 12 (6.3 net) wells this quarter. \b \bIn West Central Alberta, ProspEx continued to follow up on previous successes at Harmattan and Ricinus. In Harmattan, the Company drilled and completed two (1.3 net) wells in the Cardium W Pool. Construction of facilities at Harmattan is continuing, with major river crossings completed and work on the remainder of the gathering system underway. ProspEx estimates that the total stabilized production at Harmattan awaiting construction of facilities and regulatory good production practice approval is approximately 600 boe/d (net) from four (2.2 net) wells. The Company expects that this production will be onstream late in the first quarter of 2007. At Ricinus, the Company drilled and completed one Cardium well (100% working interest) that is now onstream at an initial rate of over 300 boe/d. \b \bAt Kakwa in the Deep Basin, ProspEx drilled two (2.0 net) wells. The first of these wells, a development well in the Company's Kakwa Cardium pool, is currently being tied in. The second Kakwa well is being completed and tested. In addition, ProspEx participated in six (1.7 net) partner operated wells at Medallion in Southern Alberta, all of which were cased. \b \bProspEx expects to operate two drilling rigs for the remainder of the current winter drilling season. In West Central Alberta, four additional wells are planned, following up on fourth quarter success in Harmattan and Ricinus and on deeper Cretaceous targets in Willesden Green. In the Deep Basin, one (0.75 net) well has been cased to date in 2007, with two additional wells planned prior to spring breakup. \b \bProspEx has continued with its hedging program.

Taking advantage of Cisco's leading voice and data network through an Internet Protocol (IP) phone, the companies have developed the industry's first integrated voice and data solution that allows real-time, two-way communication between employees, supervisors and workforce management systems. The solution allows employees to complete workforce management transactions through IP telephones and interact in real time with supervisors at the employees' work department, thereby eliminating the labor time lost walking back and forth between the time clock to the work department. The technology is being showcased at the National Retail Federation's (NRF) 96th Annual Convention & Expo being held in New York from January 15-17. Workbrain is exhibiting in booth 1901 and Cisco is exhibiting in booth 129. \b \u001d  Cisco Unified IP Phones provide a dramatic improvement in accessibility, affordability, manageability, performance and security over traditional time clocks. Employees can use Cisco Unified IP Phones to perform tasks such as punching in or out of work and logging hours to cost centers in real time. Cisco's unified voice and data backbone allows employees to also connect in real time with their supervisors, at the point of work, to immediately close the loop on operational workforce tasks. Combined with Workbrain's leading proactive alerts and notifications, Workbrain's total workforce management solution provides the most seamless interchange between organizations and their workforces in the industry. \b \u001d  \"This is the most significant change to the time clock in one hundred years, a true milestone,\" said Howard Tarnoff, Vice President of Channels at Workbrain. \"Until now, time clocks have been single-use, uni-directional devices that are often too expensive to locate conveniently throughout the work environment. Conversely, the phone is the most ubiquitous device in the workplace. This new, unified voice and data solution uses Cisco Unified IP Phones to bring real-time interactivity right to the point of work, without requiring any additional hardware investment.\" \b \b    About Workbrain \b \u001d  Workbrain provides the most widely deployed web-based workforce management solution for large enterprises.

The Oracle Retail application helps NEXCOM increase sales by providing efficiency around price change management, improving localized assortments and simplifying seasonal transitions. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20020718/ORCLLOGO ) \b \u001d  NEXCOM's Oracle Retail Store Inventory Management implementation is part of a more than $75 million project to vastly upgrade the retailer's supply chain operation. The project centers on the rollout of Oracle Retail applications for which NEXCOM anticipates full payback in fiscal year 2009. NEXCOM already attributes a 5.2 percent improvement in retail sales last fiscal year to better product availability from its Oracle Retail system. The $2.3 billion global retailer has also achieved increased in-stock positions while reducing overall inventory by upwards of 5.5 percent. \b \u001d  \"Oracle Retail is a key component in making our business customer-centric by providing store personnel with easier access to information that enables them to immediately respond to the needs of our customers,\" said Richard Garza, CIO for NEXCOM. \"We look to Oracle Retail Store Inventory Management to help ensure that the merchandise our customers want is in stock so we can increase customer conversions and boost sales.\" \b \u001d  NEXCOM is unique in that it offers a wide range of merchandise in the four major quadrants of the retail industry -- discount mass retailer, department store and specialty, focused discounter and convenience stores. As a result, the retailer has a significant challenge in terms of having the right inventory in stock in the right stores. Oracle Retail Store Inventory Management is helping NEXCOM take its management of physical inventory to the next level by allowing larger merchandising selections to be carried in specific locations based on demographics and customer demand. \b \u001d  \"Since the deployment of Oracle Retail Store Inventory Management to all worldwide Navy Exchanges, we are seeing improvement in our stock positions,\" said Richard Dow, NEXCOM's Senior Vice President, Chief Store Operations. \"Associates appreciate being provided new, reliable tools to make their jobs easier.  These tools provide us accountability and visibility to the transactional item, an improved audit trail and insight to productivity. Customer service is also enhanced given the information we can now provide to our associates on the sales floor, along with the improvement to the overall in stock and inventory management.\" \b \u001d  \"NEXCOM has an extremely complex retail environment and we have partnered closely with them to help ensure that the Oracle Retail applications they use are closely aligned with their goals and support their unique business needs,\" said Dan Stoks, Senior Vice President Global Sales and Consulting, Oracle Retail.  \"Our work with NEXCOM is a great example of how a modular suite of applications can deliver significant business value and help transform a leading retail business.\" \b \b    About NEXCOM \b \u001d  NEXCOM is headquarters for the worldwide Navy Exchange System.

Lancope, Mazu Networks, and PatchLink now work directly with TippingPoint(TM) products to quarantine endpoints in violation of network policies as well as automate endpoint remediation. \b \u001d  TippingPoint's quarantine feature was launched in February 2006 as an innovative IPS capability that leverages network infrastructure to isolate and resolve any internal sources of malicious activity. By ensuring any device can be contained for remediation, businesses maintain a healthy network and block the internal spread of attacks, significantly reducing technical support calls and costs. \b \u001d  The TippingPoint Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) quarantine capability works with TippingPoint's Security Management System (SMS) and existing network switches or management systems to block malicious traffic, contain infected endpoints, and provide support for remediation of infected devices. Now, quarantine is interoperable with third party patch and vulnerability management solutions for automated remediation, and with network behavior analysis (NBA) tools to move from policy violation alerting to in-line policy enforcement. TippingPoint's quarantine feature offers a broad set of enforcement capabilities including displaying a remediation Web page, blocking a port, or redirecting the infected endpoint to a secure VLAN based on administrator policy. \b \u001d  \"This is an important step in the evolution of enterprise security,\" said Neal Hartsell, vice president of marketing for TippingPoint. \"Security is getting more complex to administer and manage. One way to alleviate complexity is to extend the power of our IPS's traffic classification and policy enforcement strength to patch management and network behavior analysis tools, enabling customers to maximize their existing security investments, automate endpoint security, and reduce the cost and complexity of overall security policy enforcement.\" \b \u001d  With the integration of PatchLink, the global leader in security patch and vulnerability management, infected users who request network access can now be automatically directed to a personalized PatchLink Web site that guides users to download specific patches that eliminate infections and remediate vulnerabilities. \b \u001d  \"The integration between PatchLink and TippingPoint truly enables customers to automate security incident response,\" said Rich Hlavka, PatchLink's senior vice president of business development. \"By combining our industry leading remediation engine with enterprise class intrusion prevention, we're enabling users to automatically enforce security policies and remediate vulnerabilities while greatly reducing the risks and costs associated with IT security incidents.\" \b \u001d  Additionally, TippingPoint now integrates with two leading NBA systems, Lancope and Mazu Networks. These systems compile data from multiple network devices and provide visibility into network activity to improve internal security and IT operations. Through the integration, the NBA system can send commands to the TippingPoint system for quarantine and policy enforcement. \b \u001d  \"This integration brings together best of breed NBA and IPS technologies to enhance security postures and improve overall network health, while reducing the total cost of securing the enterprise,\" said Harland LaVigne, president and CEO of Lancope. \"TippingPoint's flexible quarantine capabilities complement StealthWatch's end-to-end network visibility to ensure network security, performance, and availability. Together, we are furthering our commitment to provide our customers with the most expedient and effective means of mitigating risks to the network and eliminating threats.\" \b \u001d  \"The combination of Mazu with TippingPoint IPS provides customers with a powerful solution for addressing a multitude of network operations and internal security challenges,\" said Paul Brady, CEO of Mazu Networks. \"While Mazu provides enterprises with a global view of how users, applications, hosts, and devices behave on a network, TippingPoint enables a more granular enforcement option.

The company said its overall reserves, which include domestic and overseas reserves, would last 14.5 years at current output levels. \u001d  The reduction in overall reserves was due to a 26% plunge in overseas oil and gas reserves to 885 million BOE at the end of 2006, from 1.197 billion BOE a year earlier. \u001d  The massive reduction came mostly as Petrobras had to cede part of its production in Venezuela to state-oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela (PVZ.YY) in a 2006 revision of production contracts with the Venezuelan government. \u001d  The fall in overseas reserves due to the contract revision in Venezuela was \"known,\" the Rio de Janeiro-based brokerage Brascan said in a research report Monday. \u001d  Despite the weak 2006 reserves based on the SEC criteria, Petrobras' reserves historically have been rising faster than that world oil reserves, Brascan said. \u001d  \"That characteristic is certainly what makes the company stick out in comparison to its international peers,\" the brokerage said. \u001d  Both Brascan and Merrill maintain their \"buy\" rating for Petrobras. \u001d  International reserves will increase in the future once new reserves in Nigeria and Bolivia enter more advanced stages of development, Petrobras said. \u001d  Also, according to the less strict criteria of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, or SPE, Petrobras' 2006 Brazilian reserves actually rose by 3.9% to 13.753 billion BOE at the end of 2006, from 13.232 billion BOE a year earlier. \u001d  The SPE also accepts as reserves areas in earlier stages of development. \u001d  The increase came as the company incorporated new discoveries into its reserves, among them the Maromba field in the Campos Basin and the Catua field in the Espirito Santo Basin. \u001d  Petrobras also incorporated discoveries into nearby producing fields, among them the Mexilhao gas field in the Santos Basin. \u001d  According to the SPE criteria, Petrobras' overseas reserves fell 24% to 1.27 billion BOE at the end of 2006 from a year earlier. \u001d  The firm's combined domestic and overseas reserves according to SPE criteria rose to 15.023 billion BOE at the end of 2006, from 14.913 billion BOE at the end of 2005. \b \u001d  -By Bernd Radowitz, Dow Jones Newswires; +5521-3288-5004; bernd.radowitz@dowjones.com; \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 13:34 ET (18:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"899c32f0e1eb3245df4ef19588ea211b","symR":["AMR","US0017651060"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": American And American Eagle Carried A Record 19.7 Million Passengers To And From Miami In 2006>AMR","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T15:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMR","US0017651060"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  MIAMI, Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Airlines, the world's largest airline, announced today that together with its regional airline affiliate, American Eagle, it set yet another yearly traffic record at Miami International Airport (MIA) in 2006, carrying a total of 19.7 million passengers to and from Miami.

The programme, guaranteed by JSFC Sistema (\"Sistema\", rated 'B+'/Positive Outlook), has a maturity of 30 years and may issue up to USD3 billion. This rating action follows a review of the final terms and conditions, confirming information already received when Fitch assigned an expected rating of 'B+' on 12 December 2006. \u001d  The programme is structured on par with Sistema's senior unsecured obligations. The documentation contains a number of covenants including negative pledge, limitation on leverage of up to 4x total debt to operating income before depreciation and amortisation (excluding debt of MBRD, Sistema's banking subsidiary), limitation on shareholder distributions (up to 50% of cumulative net income since 2003) and certain limitations on assets sale. Sistema has to ensure that its subsidiaries are not restricted in paying dividends and providing loans to the parent. Certain caveats apply to the covenants above. \u001d  Sistema is a diversified Russian holding company with interests in mobile and fixed-line telecoms, real estate, insurance, technology, banking and other industries. Sistema's ratings reflect the credit quality of its operating subsidiaries, its ability to move cash around the group and the structural subordination to creditors at the operating company level. In 2006 Sistema's key operating subsidiaries moved towards the cash generative stage of their business cycles, leading to a Positive Outlook. \u001d  Telecoms are expected to dominate Sistema's operating and financial profiles although the holding company has gradually diversified into other segments, e.g. real estate. The holding company's strategic ambitions are narrowed to seven key industries; however, Sistema is contemplating diversification into other industries where it may lack experience. Sistema has expressed interest to participate in a number of large mergers/acquisitions, which may change its credit profile. Fitch sees this as an event risk. The holding company has valuable non-consolidated assets on its balance sheet, providing considerable financial flexibility. \u001d  Group total leverage, while consistent with Sistema's ratings, has been rising in 2006. This has been mitigated by a number of IPOs in its operating subsidiaries, which helped to ease the leverage metrics on a net debt basis. More IPOs may follow in 2007. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:31 ET (12:31 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"8b75ccd92aee23b5dcf047b55a990989","symR":["36194.AE","500470.BY","5786.FR","ACX.MC","CGA","CS.LN","CSNA3.BR","MT","SID","SZG.XE","TKA.XE","VOE.VI","AT0000937503","BRCSNAACNOR6","DE0006202005","DE0007500001","ES0132105018","GB00B127GF29","INE081A01012","LU0140205948","NL0000361947"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"FOCUS: Steel Mkt To Cool, But Stocks To Stay In Favor","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T05:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["36194.AE","500470.BY","5786.FR","ACX.MC","CGA","CS.LN","CSNA3.BR","MT","SID","SZG.XE","TKA.XE","VOE.VI","AT0000937503","BRCSNAACNOR6","DE0006202005","DE0007500001","ES0132105018","GB00B127GF29","INE081A01012","LU0140205948","NL0000361947"],"IndustryCodes":["IDD","STL","XATX","XCA4","XDAX","XDJGI","XENX","XFT1","XIBEX","XISL","XMDAX","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Anne Jolis \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European steel market will cool in 2007, but the stocks are likely to remain among investors' favorites. \u001d  Expectations of more takeovers will likely outweigh the specter of softer steel prices, analysts and fund managers say. \u001d  Although waning U.S. demand, rising energy and raw material costs and a glut in cheap Chinese exports are already pushing down prices, experts see little chance that European steel stocks will take a nose-dive similar to that of 2005. Instead, they say, a greater willingness among steel companies to curb production in order to keep prices firm as well as more mergers and acquisitions in the sector should mean the cool-down will be shorter-lived and more dramatic than two years ago. \u001d  The biggest risk to that scenario, they say, is that investors will decide steel companies are overpaying for their targets and react by selling their shares. \u001d  After last year's heady gains, in which many steel stocks more than doubled, prices have fallen this month. German steel group Salzgitter AG (SZG.XE), for example, is down 3.8%, and Mittal Steel Co. (MT), which is merging with Luxembourg-based Arcelor SA (5786.FR), is off 2.2%. But many analysts say they're unfazed by the declines, and some put this month's losses down to profit-taking. \u001d  \"I wouldn't advise people to sell the sector at the moment,\" said Commerzbank steel analyst Jutta Rosenbaum. \u001d  To be sure, some think the decline is tied to weaker metals prices and are more cautious. \u001d  \"The downturn in commodities has taken a firm hold of the stocks at the moment,\" said State Street Bank European strategist Michael O'Sullivan. \"The flow (out of steel stocks) tends to be quite persistent and we don't see any signs that it's going to come to a halt in the very near future.\" \u001d  Strategists, fund managers and analysts agree the most crucial variable facing the steel industry is the so-called \"China factor\" - the glut of cheap commodity steel exported from the Asian giant that could hurt demand for steel from other, more expensive producers. Moreover, if demand for steel within China cools but the country's steelmakers continue to boost production, the resulting flood of exports could deflate prices. \u001d  Credit Suisse's steel analysts cited the threat of cheap Asian steel, particularly from China, when they downgraded the steel sector to \"underweight,\" from \"market weight\", earlier this month. \u001d  Many others argue that Chinese companies will need to restock steel inventories for their still-growing  domestic market later this year after 2006's record export year, which they hope will curb the surplus of Chinese steel in the rest of the world. The Chinese government's decision to slash subsidies and tax breaks to steel exporters should also cool demand for Chinese steel, they say. \u001d  \"We think China is a temporary\" factor, said Didier Van De Veire, a steel analyst and fund manager at Petercam in Brussels. \u001d  Investors could get some indication of how companies view the China factor starting Friday Jan 19, when ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) executives deliver their outlook at the annual general meeting. The German steel and technology group also will report results for its fiscal first quarter ending Dec. 31 on Feb. 13. \u001d  Luxembourg-based Mittal, which calls itself Arcelor Mittal ahead of the completion of its merger, will report its full-year results Feb. 21. Salzgitter reports on March 8 and Anglo-Dutch producer Corus Group PLC (CGA), the target of rival takeover offers, reports on March 12. \u001d  This time last year, the price of hot rolled steel coil - generally seen as a benchmark product for steel prices - was set to embark on an eight-month, 20% climb, reaching $599 per ton in August, according to U.K.-based steel research group MEPS International Ltd. While U.S. prices have since plummeted around 22% to about $510 per ton this month, from about $650 in mid-2006, European prices have slipped about $10 in the same period to $640 per ton, from a mid-2006 peak of about $650. The U.S. market has been hit by both the China effect and a softer housing market that has dented demand from the construction industry. European companies have benefited from accelerating growth in the region. \u001d  Analysts say another big reason why European prices have remained stable is last year's announced merger between Arcelor and Mittal and their subsequent production cuts. The ability of the world's largest steel producer by volume to withstand the short-term losses that come with from curbing output is why many investment banks list it as their top steel pick for this year. \u001d  Analysts say they expect other steel companies to follow Arcelor Mittal's lead of cutting production in order to offset any drops in demand. \u001d  Rosenbaum, the Commerzbank analyst, said ThyssenKrupp has already done so. Company spokesmen declined to comment. \u001d  \"Production levels need to keep dropping,\" said Rabobank steel analyst Richard Brakenhoff. Company earnings may take a short-term hit, but there is more to gain from the \"benefit from higher steel prices,\" he said. \u001d  That discipline could get an extra boost if companies continue to gain market share through acquisitions. Already, Corus is the target of competing bids from Brazil's Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (SID) and India's Tata Steel Ltd. (500470.BY). \u001d  ThyssenKrupp has already said it is looking to gain a foothold in North America through an acquisition. Salzgitter, which has a large stockpile of cash, has also said it is eying potential acquisitions. \u001d  Analysts say some of Europe's smaller steelmakers, including Voestalpine AG (VOE.VI) and Acerinox SA (ACX.MC), are likely targets.  More than 40% of Voestalpine's shares, however, are owned by shareholders considered friendly to management, making a hostile bid unlikely. \b \u001d  -By Anne Jolis, Dow Jones Newswires; +32 2741 1488; anne.jolis@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 00:00 ET (05:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8b99abff01f08c2aa04e8b9d527d8ce1","symR":["CADAY"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Toronto Stks End Higher; Rough Day For March Networks","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T21:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CADAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b \b     By Stuart Weinberg \b     OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Toronto stocks closed higher Monday on a slow trading day, as U.S. markets were closed for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

The company said it continues to develop the export market, mainly in South East Asia and the Middle East, supported by additional volumes from the new smelter. \u001d  Q3 EBITDA was $128.8 million, an increase of 301.2% over the corresponding prior quarter. \u001d  Unit cash costs in both plants of BALCO have improved over the immediately preceding quarter mainly due to higher production volumes and reduced power costs, which offset increases in other input costs. The decline in global alumina prices has started having a positive impact on costs. \u001d  Vedanta has obtained the LME registration for the aluminium ingots of the new Korba smelter under the brand \"BHARATAL\". \u001d  Copper cathode production in India and Australia during the quarter was the highest ever at 86,000 tonnes an increase of 6,000 tonnes from the immediately preceding quarter mainly due to the debottlenecking initiatives at the Tuticorin smelter, which has increased capacity to 400,000 tpa. \u001d  Production is being steadily ramped up and the company expects to realise rated capacity volumes in the fourth quarter. Mined metal production at its Australian mines of about 7,000 tonnes is almost at the same level as the corresponding prior period. \u001d  Q3 revenues were $717.5 million as compared with $448.0 million in the corresponding prior period, primarily due to higher volumes and higher metal prices. \u001d  Q3 EBITDA was $92.4 million as compared with $56.9 million in the corresponding prior quarter, an increase of 62.4% due to higher volumes, improved TCRC realisation and higher LME prices. \u001d  As reported earlier, the reduction in TCRC realisations has started having a negative impact on EBITDA due to global softening and the company expects further reduction in TCRCs in the fourth quarter \u001d  The Indian copper operations have been awarded the \"Best performance award in non-ferrous metals\" by the Indian Institute of Metals. It has also won the Corporate Silver Award for Manufacturing Excellence in the Metals Category (Large Facilities) at the India Manufacturing Excellence Awards 2006 awarded by Frost & Sullivan. \u001d  In Zambia, KCM produced 35,000 tonnes of copper cathode in the quarter as compared with 31,000 tonnes in the immediately preceding quarter but lower than our expectations. \u001d  Cathode production at the leaching plant and mining production from Nchanga were affected by unforeseen environmental issues. \u001d  While these issues have now been satisfactorily resolved, steady and cautious steps are now being taken to bring the leaching plant back to its normal levels of production. \u001d  Several debottlenecking measures at the Nkana smelter have enabled us to achieve a record anode production of about 12,000 tonnes in December last year, the company said. \u001d  Q3 revenues were $211.4 million as compared with $188.1 million in the corresponding prior quarter primarily due to higher prices. Q3 EBITDA was $79.4 million as compared with $56.8 million, an increase of 39.8%. \u001d  Operating costs are still high primarily due to lower mine output and its consequent impact on production volumes, together with higher maintenance costs incurred due to the unforeseen shutdown. \u001d  The production of mined metal of 128,000 tonnes in Q3 was maintained at the levels achieved in the corresponding prior period and higher than that of the immediately preceding quarter by 4,000 tonnes. \u001d  Production of refined zinc at 93,000 tonnes was up from 79,000 tonnes in the preceding quarter an increase of 17.7% and was significantly higher than the corresponding prior quarter by 24,000 tonnes an increase of 34.8%. \u001d  Volumes have increased mainly from the ramping up of the new hydro smelter and going forward in the fourth quarter, Vedanta expects to produce close to its rated capacity of 400,000 tpa. \u001d  While production levels have improved significantly over the immediately preceding quarter, sales of refined zinc have remained at similar levels compared with Q2, primarily due to a liquidation of Q1 inventories in Q2, the company said. \u001d  In view of better metal production during the current quarter, sale of zinc concentrate was restricted to 38,000 dry metric tonnes. Vedanta sold 29,000 dry metric tonnes of lead concentrate. \u001d  Revenue was $549.6 million as compared with $202.5 million in the corresponding quarter last year, primarily due to higher volumes from the new plant and higher metal prices. \u001d  EBITDA was $425.2 million as compared with $117.7 million, an increase of 261.3% over the corresponding quarter last year primarily due to higher volumes and higher prices. \u001d  The National Energy Conservation Award, awarded by the Ministry of Power, Government of India, in the mineral sector has been awarded to one of the zinc mines. \u001d  The alumina refinery at Lanjigarh is in the final commissioning stage and is expected to be commissioned by March 2007. \u001d  The Central Ministry of Environment and Forests have received reports from its various sub-committees and is expected to give its recommendations shortly to the Supreme Court on the issue of environmental clearances for developing the Lanjigarh bauxite deposits. \u001d  The company is hopeful of a positive resolution of this matter in the near future. \u001d  The debottlenecking project of the Tuticorin smelter to increase its capacity from 300,000 tpa to 400,000 tpa has been completed and the smelter is steadily ramping up. The company expects to realise full volumes from the smelter in the fourth quarter. \u001d  Progress on both the Konkola Deep Mining Project and the 250,000 tpa Nchanga smelter project is satisfactory and are on course for completion as scheduled. All major orders have been placed, basic engineering has been completed and site work is progressing in full swing. \u001d  Work on the new 170,000 tpa zinc smelter at Chanderiya is progressing well with orders for all major lead items placed and construction activity is in full swing. \u001d  The project is on track and is expected to be completed by early 2008. \u001d  Vedanta has also initiated a debottlenecking project at the Chanderiya and Debari zinc smelters to enhance their capacity by an additional 88,000 tpa. This project is estimated to cost $169 million and is scheduled for completion by mid 2008. \u001d  The greenfield 500,000 tpa smelter at Jharsuguda is progressing well with all major orders placed and is on schedule for completion as announced. \u001d  Preliminary work on the new $1.9bn greenfield 2400 MW integrated power project at Jharsuguda has recently commenced. The progress on the project is satisfactory and a major EPC order for the construction of the power plant has been placed.  Hindustan Zinc Limited is investing in a Wind Power project with a capacity of 75 MW at a cost of $87 million. Orders have been placed for major equipment. The project will be progressively commissioned towards end of this calendar year. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 02:20 ET (07:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8cd08e4a992824bddf05361c30f7a5c4","symR":["BCB.T","CCE","COT","KO","PAS","PBG","CA22163N1069","US1912161007"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"SmartMoney(2/1) Street Smart: Beverage Bottlers Lose Fizz","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T11:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BCB.T","CCE","COT","KO","PAS","PBG","CA22163N1069","US1912161007"],"IndustryCodes":["BVG","SFT","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XTSE"],"Story":"\b   (From SMARTMONEY) \b   By Evelyn Ellison Twitchell \u001d  THERE'S A saying on Wall Street: \"Buy the rumor; sell the news.\" But not all rumors are worth paying for. Shares of beverage bottlers have gotten support from talk that Coca-Cola Co. might acquire its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE, $21). Yet takeover speculation might not be enough to sustain a group that is facing strong headwinds this year. \u001d  High commodity prices are likely to be a double whammy for bottlers in 2007. Aluminum prices have been rising as demand has increased globally. Bottlers, which use the metal in soda cans, hedge against price swings but still could face double-digit cost increases as hedging  contracts expire. At the same time, the cost of high-fructose corn syrup, which is used to sweeten beverages, could be up 15 percent or more as corn is increasingly used to make ethanol. \u001d  Bottlers buy the high-fructose corn syrup and add it to the concentrate they purchase from the soda makers. \"There's a risk of commodity inflation hurting the bottom line,\" says Christine Farkas, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. \u001d  What's more, U.S. consumers just aren't bubbling over for soda anymore, as bottled water and sports drinks have gained popularity. The number of carbonated beverages sold in North America will likely fall 1 to 2 percent in the next year, estimates Goldman Sachs. \u001d  All this could take a bite out of earnings at Coca-Cola Enterprises, Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG, $32), PepsiAmericas (PAS, $21) and private-label bottler Cott Corp. (COT, $14). Most bottlers' shares trade at about 15 times expected 2007 earnings -- in line with the Standard & Poor's 500 index. But the stocks have traded at a 10 to 15 percent discount to the S&P during uncertain times in the past. \u001d  True, Coca-Cola Enterprises would fetch a premium if Coca-Cola Co. decided to buy it. But a deal is iffy at best; historically, both Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo have avoided the capital-intensive bottling business because it's much less profitable than simply making the concentrate syrup used in soft drinks. \"It would be a burden on a company that's trying to accelerate growth,\" says Mark Swartzberg, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. Short of a merger, bottling stocks could leave investors, well, flat. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 06:00 ET (11:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8d4d4ab7ade5ce55e56aedb1e05e4deb","symR":["SZ.T","CA80621M2013"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Sceptre Investment Boosts Div On Strong 4Q Results >SZ.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T20:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SZ.T","CA80621M2013"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Toronto-based Sceptre Investment Counsel Ltd.

As a result, the company's baseline credit assessment (BCA) -- which measures a government-related issuer's fundamental credit strength excluding any government support -- has improved to a 11-13 range (corresponding to a \"Ba\" range) from a 14-16 range (which equates to a \"B\" range). Sustained efforts to improve transparency and investor relations have also supported strengthening of the group's credit profile. \u001d  \"We believe that Rosneft has successfully addressed many of its recent financial uncertainties, particularly its high leverage and constrained liquidity, from its recent IPO and strong cash flow generation, which translates into a strengthening of its credit profile\", says Philipp Lotter, Senior Credit Officer at Moody's and lead analyst for Rosneft. \"Furthermore, we believe that the company will aim to re-balance the level of integration of its up- and downstream operations, which could support a rating upgrade over the medium term\", adds Lotter. \u001d  Most importantly Moody's highlights (1) Rosneft's ongoing strong financial and operational performance on the back of above-average production growth, (2) a sharp reduction in adjusted debt with Rosneftegaz's debt being repaid from IPO proceeds, (3) the extension of the group's debt maturity profile thus easing liquidity pressure, (4) improvements in financial transparency and corporate governance and (5) its solid project pipeline which should support production growth targets going forward, as driving factors of Rosneft's improving credit profile. \u001d  At the same time, Moody's notes that Rosneft's acquisitive strategy combined with an ambitious upstream investment programme are likely to fuel further borrowings going forward, which Moody's would expect to be managed within certain parameters in order to support any rating upgrades. \u001d  The positive outlook reflects Moody's expectation that Rosneft will focus on strengthening its business profile by addressing the current imbalance between its substantial upstream business and its comparatively minor refining operations. Whilst this will entail investments and acquisitions, Moody's could envisage that the benefits gained from strengthening integration could outweigh the higher leverage attained from such transactions. Accordingly, ratings could be upgraded over the medium term, if Rosneft succeeds in acquiring refining capacity while maintaining retained cash flow to net adjusted debt above 30% and leverage no higher than 50%. \u001d  Moody's regards Rosneft as a government-related issuer (GRI) and thus ratings incorporate significant uplift for high implied state support from its baseline credit assessment, which is currently in the 11-13 range. Moody's thus factors in high government support and medium dependence assumptions into Rosneft's ratings. \u001d  OJSC Oil Company Rosneft, headquartered in Moscow, Russia, is the country's second largest vertically integrated oil & gas company in terms of reserves and production, and one of the largest oil & gas companies in the world.

This corporate structure is well-suited to True's assets. Specifically, True has a significantly large inventory of high quality development and exploration opportunities along with a significant undeveloped land base. Management and the board of directors believe the best opportunity and strategic direction to create securityholder value is to reinvest a substantial portion of True's cash flow and focus on increasing per share cash flow, production, reserves, and net asset value. \b \bBackground and Mechanics of the Reorganization \b \bTrue has been investigating a number of restructuring alternatives subsequent to the Federal Government's October 31, 2006 announcement on tax policy on Canadian oil and gas royalty trusts, the clarification update that was provided on December 15, 2006 and December 21, 2006 draft legislation. The Government's announcements have resulted in management and the board of directors revisiting the long-term strategic direction of the Trust. Based on this review of the alternatives, conversion back to a corporation before 2011 has been determined by management and the board of directors as the best opportunity to enhance unit and asset value over time. By converting to a growth-oriented E&P company True can pursue ample development opportunities and, combined with an attractive balance of high-quality tax pools, should not be cash taxable in the near term. \b \bPursuant to the Reorganization, it is currently contemplated that holders of True trust units (\"Trust Units\") will receive an equal number of shares of a newly formed corporation that will hold the assets previously held directly or indirectly by the Trust. The exchangeable shares will also be exchanged for common shares based on the conversion ratio thereof. This will result in approximately 70 million shares being issued and outstanding. True's outstanding convertible debentures will be assumed by the new corporation. In the course of finalization of the structure of the Reorganization, the board of directors of True will continue to take into account any further clarification that is released under the proposals outlined by the government on October 31, 2006. \b \bThe board of directors of True has unanimously determined the Reorganization is in the best interest of the Trust and all securityholders and recommend to securityholders approval of the Reorganization at a special meeting. It is anticipated that an information circular and proxy statement in connection with the Special Meeting will be mailed to Unitholders in the first quarter of 2007. Tristone Capital Inc. and National Bank Financial Inc. have been engaged as financial advisors to the board of directors in connection with the Reorganization. FirstEnergy Capital Corp., Orion Securities Inc. and Peters & Co. Limited are acting as strategic advisors to True. The Reorganization will be subject to all required regulatory approvals and securityholder approval by at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by unitholders of the Trust and holders of the exchangeable shares. In connection with the Reorganization, securityholders will also be asked to approve a standard stock option plan as part of the long term compensation structure of the new public corporation. All True securityholders are encouraged to vote in person or by proxy at the Meeting. True has engaged Kingsdale Shareholders Services Inc. to act as True's information agent and to provide assistance to True securityholders in completing forms of proxy and related documents. True securityholders may contact Kingsdale Shareholder Services Inc. at 1-866-639-8089 for assistance. \b \bPro forma Intermediate Producer \b \bPrior to converting to an energy trust structure in November 2005, True was a successful growing junior E&P company. True currently owns in excess of 1.1 million gross acres (730,000 net acres) of undeveloped land and has identified a current drilling inventory in excess of 600 locations. Current tax pools are estimated at approximately $460 million. \b \bAs an intermediate producing company, True's exploration and development capital program will initially be increased to $120 million for 2007. This level of capital expenditure program would enable True to grow production and reserves as an E&P company while maintaining a prudent balance sheet. The majority of this capital will be spent in Kerrobert, Willesden Green and Ferrier areas. Based on various commodity price assumptions ranging from WTI US$50 - US$65 per bbl and AECO CDN$6.00 - CDN$7.75 per mcf and production of between 20,000 and 21,000 boe/d 2007 cash flow is forecast to range from $110 million to $175 million. \b \bAs at November 30, 2006, True has a net working capital deficit of $38 million and $150 million in bank indebtedness. This leaves approximately $75 million available on a $225 million credit facility. \b \bTrue's leadership team has the experience and expertise to lead the growth of the newly formed intermediate E&P company through an active drilling program and acquisition strategy. Over the past six years the technical team and Board of Directors at True has been successful in increasing production from 160 boe/d to its current level of 19,700 boe/d through a combination of drilling and acquisitions. The team will continue to apply this aggressive approach along with focusing on controllable costs associated with the production base. True will continue to further enhance personnel of the organization to reflect the requirements of an intermediate producing company and an expanded capital program. It will be proposed that True's existing management and board of directors will remain in place following the effective date of the Reorganization. \b \bDividend Policy & Notice of Distribution \b \bCombined with a capital efficient growth strategy, True intends to establish a dividend policy to take effect following completion of the Reorganization which will further differentiate True from existing intermediate producing companies. The initial dividend is proposed to be set at $0.02 per month to be paid quarterly. \b \bTrue also announces that the cash distribution for the month of January will be $0.12 per unit, to be paid on February 15, 2007 to all unitholders of record as of January 31, 2007. The ex-distribution date for this payment is January 29, 2007. \b \bInterested parties are encouraged to review the latest corporate presentation for further details available on True's website at http://www.trueenergytrust.com/Investors/Presentation.asp. True will also hold a conference call on Monday, January 15, 2007 at 2:00 PM MST/4:00 PM EST.

The conference call will also be recorded and available by calling 1-877-289-8525 or 416-640-1917 and entering passcode 21216204 followed by the number sign. \b \bMembers of the senior management team will be hosting investor information sessions in Montreal on Tuesday, January 16, 2007, in Toronto on Wednesday, January 17, 2007, in Vancouver on Friday, January 19, 2007 and in Calgary on Tuesday, January 23, 2007.

The hardware and software enhancements are the latest efforts by IBM to simplify and automate retail environments -- helping retailers to lower costs, streamline operations, and protect existing investments. \u001d  The new technologies include upgrades to IBM's flagship 4690 point of sale (POS) operating system, new advanced systems management software, and serviceability enhancements to the SurePOS 500 series of POS systems. \u001d  \"Retailers continue to seek out new technologies that can improve the customer experience, while streamlining and simplifying operations,\" said Steve Ladwig, general manager of IBM's Retail Store Solutions. \"We've takensome of our most innovative data center advancements and applied those to the retail environment. This has resulted in solutions that help retailers improve end-to-end systems management, tighten security and ease serviceability -- allowing them to leverage the investments they've already made.\" \u001d  Enhancements to the 4690 operating system deliver store-level management capabilities and new features designed to help retailers protect store dataand maintain robust network security. Enhanced systems management capabilities with remote management agent (RMA) and its new retail extensions for IBM Director include the ability to manage multiple stores remotely from a central location -- managing traditional IT, today's retail devices and next generation technology offerings with one easy-to-use tool. The newest SurePOS 500 offers easier serviceability, with a virtually tool-less design that enables fast, easy service to help reduce the total cost of ownership. \u001d  In addition to its new offerings, IBM's Retail Store Solutions Division also recognized the 25th anniversary of its Retail Solutions Business Partner program. Since it launched in 1982, the program has grown to over 1,000 members today that sell more than half of IBM POS and Kiosk solutions. \u001d  ScanSource, an international distributor of specialty technology products providing distribution sales to resellers in the specialty technology markets, was an early RSS business partner. \u001d  \"We have been distributing IBM's POS products and retail solutions for morethan 12 years and truly value their partnership,\" said Jeff Yelton, vice president of merchandising for ScanSource. \"We continue to strengthen our relationship with IBM, and the new products IBM is announcing today will help the solution providers we work with better serve the needs of their retail customers.\" \u001d  New solutions from IBM \u001d  IBM's enhanced 4690 Operating System offers a strong platform for retail, with enhanced security and a single, convenient access point for POS, back-office and web-based applications. This latest version helps retailers establish a safe, secure and easy-to-manage platform for advanced software in all kinds of environments, and works equally well in stores of different sizes and segments. IBM's continued investment in 4690 also underscores its commitment to address the needs and protect the investments of its customers in order to better support their growth. \u001d  IBM's Remote Management Agent, a component of the IBM Store Integration Framework, empowers retailers to manage their store environments competitively by enabling them to achieve end-to-end stores system management of the retail devices and applications.  This software can help retailers lower the total cost of ownership by improving the efficiency and consistency of new systems and application deployments in stores and across the enterprise. When implemented in conjunction with IBM Director software, Remote Management Agent software interoperates with best-of-breed, retail-specific software point products and enterprise systems management solutions across IBM's entire Retail Store portfolio. Consequently,retailers make use of existing management tools, which can help lower totalcost of ownership, and have the flexibility to add solutions that are best suited to their business goals. \u001d  For example, leading cellular telephone provider T-Mobile Direct has started to implement IBM Director together with IBM Remote Management Agent for complete management, monitoring and reporting across all 2,000 of its point-of-sale solutions in the T-Mobile retail stores. IBM Remote Management Agent software enables T-Mobile to achieve end-to-end store system management of retail devices and applications. \u001d  Enhancements to IBM's SurePOS 500 systems offer next generation store capabilities that support a broad range of applications and include models that meet specialized retail requirements, particularly in the food service, hospitality, specialty and gas and convenience segments. They include a new tool-free design that allows customers or field repair technicians to quickly and economically remove and replace modules helping reduce outages and simplify recovery when needed. This can help reduce total cost of ownership. \u001d  These products and more can be seen at this year's National Retail Federation show January 14-17, 2007 at the Jacob Javits Center in New York, NY -- IBM booth #1319.

Even Playboy and Penthouse have announced an interest in coming to India, although they are still working to devise tamer layouts to suit India's more conservative society. \u001d  With advertising and profit growth slowing in their home countries in the developed world, big-name publications need new markets. \u001d  \"Compared to developed markets like the U.S. and U.K. that are showing single-digit [annual revenue] growth in the entertainment and media sector, India has close to a 19% growth rate and a large, untapped market,\" says Smita Jha, a consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers Pvt. Ltd. in New Delhi. \"Moving to emerging markets like India becomes a natural progression for publishers wanting to expand.\" \u001d  Advertisers overall spent more than 130 billion rupees ($2.93 billion) in India in 2005, according to estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers, compared with 118 billion rupees the year before. Although magazine advertising accounted for less than 20% of the 63 billion rupees spent on print advertising in India in 2005 (much of the rest went to newspapers), analysts still expect magazine advertising to grow at a double-digit-percentage annual pace for the next five years at least, says PricewaterhouseCoopers's Ms. Jha. \u001d  As in other countries, not all the trends are positive. Overall magazine readership in India is declining as television and the Internet establish themselves in Indian living rooms, and the circulation of some of the newest magazines remains relatively small. With TV, radio and the Internet competing for advertisers, magazines could face more pressure in the future. \u001d  Still, most analysts believe the newest slate of high-end magazines will continue to attract lots of advertisers for the next several years, making India a relatively bright spot on the global publishing map. This is largely because analysts believe international brands operating in India will prefer to advertise their products in magazines, due to their cachet and popularity among middle-class and affluent Indians. It is also much more cost effective to advertise in magazines than on television. \u001d  India's economy is growing more than 8% a year, meaning its consumers have more money to spend. Indians spend about $14.4 billion a year on luxury goods, according to Technopak, an Indian research consultancy. With more Indians becoming fashion- and design-conscious, they represent a crucial new target audience for luxury brands around the world. \u001d  A host of global brands with hefty advertising budgets are already showing up in India to sell their expensive perfumes, cosmetics and clothing. A recent issue of the Indian edition of France-based luxury and lifestyle magazine L'Officiel -- one of the first foreign fashion and lifestyle titles to come to India five years ago -- included ads from foreign brands like Chanel, Versace, Piaget, Ebel, Chopard, Breguet, Dior, Harry Winston, Canali and Burberry, among others. To complete the circle, there are also advertisements from many high-end Indian fashion designers. \u001d  A monthly print run of just about 45,000 copies of L'Officiel hasn't lessened the interest from advertisers. Half of the 300-odd pages of the magazine are advertisements. \u001d  \"We are doing exceedingly well with almost all luxury brands advertising with us,\" says Superna Motwane, editor in chief of L'Officiel India. \"For Indians, luxury is money and wealth is indulgence and they are willing to spend. And this is reason enough for the advertisers to flock to us.\" \u001d  L'Officiel isn't the only magazine flourishing amid growing advertiser interest. Maxim, a London-based men's lifestyle magazine that recently completed its first year in India, said it was able to sell all its advertising for the first year before it even launched there. \u001d  \"Name the industry, and they are our advertisers,\" says Piyush Sharma, chief executive officer and associate publisher of New Delhi-based Maxim India. \u001d  Unlike in the U.S., where there are more than 2,000 magazine publishers, in India only about 15 magazines now dominate the ad market, attracting some 80% of the money spent on magazine advertising. According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, revenue in India's print-media industry will grow at a rate of 12% a year over the next five years. \u001d  For Media Transasia India Ltd., a magazine-publishing house that licenses Maxim in India, the success of Maxim has encouraged it to bring other titles to the country. The company has already launched Travel and Leisure and will soon be bringing Better Homes and Gardens. \u001d  While most international publications are printed under license agreements with Indian publishers -- partly to take advantage of the local companies' existing distribution networks -- Conde Nast Publications has recently decided to launch Vogue in India on its own. \u001d  \"It shows our seriousness toward the Indian market that is showing double-digit growth,\" says Alex Kuruvilla, managing director of Conde Nast Publications India. The magazine is slated to hit stands this autumn. \u001d  Publishers believe the market will only get better. In addition to the luxury brands that already have a presence in India, a number of other brands, including Gucci and Giorgio Armani, are slated to open their first stores by 2008. \u001d  \"All these brands will look out for a cost-effective medium to reach their niche set of target audience and we will be here to provide that,\" says Mr. Sharma of Maxim India. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 16:31 ET (21:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"955d34f91fda48240ea1595a3b23f405","symR":["CZZ.T","CA1365511080"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Cdn Royalties Target Was C$3.25 At Raymond James >CZZ.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CZZ.T","CA1365511080"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 09:41 ET (14:41 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"95cd759fa9de6e783bdadc61b30b06dd","symR":["BAB","BAY.LN","GB0001290575"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: BA Faces Strike Action Over Cabin Crew Sick Pay","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BAB","BAY.LN","GB0001290575"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Steve McGrath \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--British Airways PLC (BAB) Monday faced the threat of strike action by cabin crew after Transport and General Workers Union members voted overwhelmingly for action over what the union descibes as unfair working practices. \u001d  The T&G said 96% of cabin crews voting on the action opted for a strike. \u001d  The news hit British Airways shares and at 1158 GMT, the stock was down 6.5 pence, or 1.2%, at 544.50 pence in a higher FTSE 100. \u001d  British Airways said it was \"very disappointed by the T&G's threat of what would be completely unnecessary industrial action.\" \u001d  The airline said it has arranged to meet T&G officals this week and it hopes the union will enter \"meaningful discussions\" on the issues unions have raised. \u001d  The union said the cabin crew's concerns, which include issues over the implementation of sickness absence policies as well as pay grading and on-board staffing and responsibility levels, had built up over the last two years but had failed to be addressed properly by the company's senior management. \u001d  BA is separately struggling to get unions to agree to plans designed to close a whopping GBP2.1 billion deficit in its main pension scheme. To help cut the deficit in the New Airways Pension Scheme, BA has proposed measures such as raising retirement ages and capping future pension pay rises in return for injecting a GBP800 million lumpsum into the scheme. \u001d  Friday, the powerful pilots union, The British Airline Pilots' Association, said it will recommend that its 3,000 members at BA accept the airline's pension proposals. However, the GMB union, which represents ground staff, said it will hold a preliminary ballot on Jan. 17 in which it will recommend that members back strike action and reject the pension offer. \u001d  The T&G had deferred a decision on the pensions issue while the ongoing strike ballot over working practices was continuing. \u001d  However, in its response statement to the T&G's strike decision Monday, BA said: \"The union says that one of its key concerns is pensions - yet we have just concluded 16 months of talks by accepting a proposal put forward by the T&G and our other unions. On that basis alone, we believe the T&G should pause to reflect before threatening the travel plans of our customers and their families.\" \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.tgwu.org.uk \u001d                   www.britishairways.com \b \u001d  -By Steve McGrath, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9284; steve.mcgrath@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:13 ET (12:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9611aec54c66754d8b778464c6d48e5b","symR":["0013.HK","2332.HK","532712.BY","ESG.YY","HTX","HUWHY","VOD","VOD.LN","GB00B16GWD56","HK0013000119","INE330H01018","KYG467141043"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"*WSJA:Vodafone,Reliance Eye Hutchison Whampoa's HTIL Shrs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T21:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0013.HK","2332.HK","532712.BY","ESG.YY","HTX","HUWHY","VOD","VOD.LN","GB00B16GWD56","HK0013000119","INE330H01018","KYG467141043"],"IndustryCodes":["CTS","FIS","FTS","IDD","TLS","XATI","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XHSG","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"96d6e7d82f3e55182996f2b575b91033","symR":["CCMP"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Cabot Microelectronics to Release Financial Results for First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2007 on January 25","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T20:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CCMP"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\bAURORA, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2007-- \u001d  Cabot Microelectronics Corporation (Nasdaq:CCMP), the world's leading supplier of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) slurries to the semiconductor industry, announced today that it will release financial results for its first quarter of Fiscal Year 2007, which ended December 31, 2006, on Thursday, January 25. \b \u001d  The press release, which will be issued prior to market open and available in the Investor Relations section of the company's website, www.cabotcmp.com, will be followed by a conference call at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. \b \u001d  The conference call will be available via webcast from www.cabotcmp.com, or by phone at (800)291-5365.

But while buybacks are often seen as a sign a company believes its own stock is cheap and lauded as a way to increase shareholder value, investors should think twice before joining the party. \u001d  For companies that trade at bargain prices and also generate a lot of cash, buybacks can be a boon for shareholders. But the intended consequences of a buyback -- reducing shares outstanding, thereby increasing earnings per share and boosting the stock -- often fail to materialize. Take semiconductor company Broadcom. From 2005 to early 2006, the firm repurchased 7.6 million shares, or just over 1 percent of its stock. During the same period, however, Broadcom's share count actually grew by 10 percent because the company issued new shares for its employees in the form of options. In effect, the money spent to repurchase was nothing more than a compensation expense. \"The buyback plan existed purely for the benefit of insiders,\" says Albert Meyer, president  of financial advisory firm Bastiat Capital. Broadcom declined to comment. \u001d  Insiders are, in fact, a good group to watch when a company joins the buyback bonanza. Meyer says \"a giant red flag\" goes up when a company's executives sell their own shares at the same time as it publicizes its buyback plan. Audit Integrity, a research firm specializing in accounting analysis, examined this phenomenon recently and found home builder NVR among the worst offenders.  While the company was buying back $1.7 billion in stock over two years, its executives were unloading $630 million worth of their own. Since then both buybacks and insider selling have slowed. \u001d  Some buyback plans do have a beneficial effect on earnings per share. But the watchdogs at the Center for Financial Research and The Corporate Library say  investors still need to be cautious. Companies sometimes pay bonuses to executives based on the growth of earnings per share. But a conflict may exist if a company incentivizes executives this way and has a negative cash flow after buying back shares. Eli Lilly was among those that turned up at the top of their list for this offense. \u001d  That being said, the right kind of buybacks can be quite good for shareholders. Standard & Poor's estimates that buyback activity has had a positive effect on EPS at more than 20 percent of S&P 500 companies. As we've done in selecting the three buyback champs in our table, investors should make sure companies have historically followed up on announced buyback plans and that shares outstanding have actually fallen. If no other warning signs surface, chances are good that a buyback announcement is a signal of better news to come. \u001d  --- \b                             BUYBACK BONANZA \b \u001d  Corporate share repurchases are generally good news -- unless they're done for the wrong reasons. \b \b   GOOD BUYBACKS \b \b   Company                 Market               Chg. in Share \b   (Ticker) Price          Value ($bil)         Count 2005-06* \b \b   Int'l Flavors & Fragrance \b   (IFF) $48               $4.4                 -5% \b   McGraw Hill \b   (MHP) $67               23.6                 -8 \b   Microsoft \b  (MSFT) $29              284.4                 -9 \b \b   BAD BUYBACKS \b \b   Company                 Market               Chg. in Share \b   (Ticker) Price          Value ($bil)         Count 2005-06* \b \b   Broadcom \b   (BRCM) $34             $17.8                 10%** \b   Eli Lilly \b   (LLY)  $54              60.9                  0 \b   NVR \b   (NVR) $655               3.6                -12 \b \b   *As of 9/30/06.  **As of 3/31/06. \b   DATA: BLOOMBERG; SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 06:01 ET (11:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9754bbe5aa15911d393eabf47fe7b660","symR":["SAP","SAP.XE","DE0007164600"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Vodafone Extends the Scope of Its Framework Agreement With SAP as a Global Strategic Supplier","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SAP","SAP.XE","DE0007164600"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDAX","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON, Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) today announces it has extended the scope of its 2005 Global Framework Agreement with Vodafone, the world's leading international mobile telecommunications company to provide business applications and services, based on the SAP NetWeaver(R) platform and mySAP(TM) ERP (enterprise resource planning) to Vodafone operating companies worldwide. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20050310/SFTH009LOGO-a ) \b \u001d  SAP, the world's leading provider of business applications software, offers solutions that help organizations continually innovate and evolve their business operations, streamline processes and increase efficiency. \b \u001d  SAP solutions will help Vodafone and its operating companies to achieve its strategic goals to reduce costs and improve business performance. \b \u001d  Detlef Schultz, Global Supply Chain Director of Vodafone, commented:  \"It is important to put in place global agreements so that our operating companies can quickly and easily adopt technology solutions that meet their operational needs.

(GE) for $4.8 billion in cash and return GBP2.1 billion of the GBP2.25 billion proceeds to its shareholders. \u001d  It also said the two companies have signed a letter of intent to form a new joint venture company, Smiths GE Detection, combining Smiths' Detection operations with GE Homeland Protection. Smiths will own 64% of the new JV and GE the remaining 36%. \u001d  After selling its aerospace division, Smiths will be left with detection, medical and specialty engineering operations. The company has been under pressure from shareholders to break itself up, but has long resisted. \u001d  The announcements were welcomed by the markets and at 0928 GMT, Smiths' shares were up 129.50 pence, or 13.1%, at 1,114 pence, the biggest gainer on the FTSE 100. In Frankfurt, General Electric shares were up 0.1% at EUR29.29. \u001d  One trader, who requested anonymity, said the sale made perfect sense since Smiths aerospace has been suffering from downward pricing pressure from Boeing Co. (BA) and Airbus owner European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. (5730.FR).   In a research note, Panmure Gordon said there's clearly scope for other bidders to step in although counter offers might have to involve a bid for the whole of Smiths. It said it's concerned that the merger of the two market leaders in detection may struggle to get antitrust clearance. The brokerage has a buy rating. \u001d  In a statement, Smiths said the sale of the aerospace unit is expected to generate improved returns on capital and boost margins. The net effect of the sale and capital return would have been accretive to the company's 2006 pro-forma earnings, it added. \u001d  On a conference call, Smiths Chief Executive Keith Butler-Wheelhouse said the deal would have boosted pro-forma 2006 earnings per share by 7%, even though aerospace accounted for GBP1.3 billion of the company's GBP3.5 billion in revenues in 2006. \u001d  The company will call an extraordinary shareholders meeting during the second quarter to approve the sale, which is also subject to completion and regulatory approval. \u001d  On the conference call, GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said he looked forward to \"a constructive process\" with E.U. antitrust regulators. He noted that the acquisition would be complimentary rather than consolidating. \u001d  GE hasn't always had success with E.U. regulators, which blocked the company's intended acquisition of Honeywell after U.S. authorities had approved the deal. \u001d  The Smiths capital return is proposed as a B share scheme combined with share consolidation. \u001d  Smiths Finance Director John Langston said the aerospace division sale would leave Smiths with a loosened dividend policy and lower credit ratings, but the company could live with that because the remaining businesses are less capital intensive. The new dividend cover would be 1.8 times, down from 2 times, while its credit ratings are expected to fall from A- to BBB+, he said. \u001d  In a separate statement, GE said the acquisition will broaden the U.S. company's offerings to its aerospace customers by adding Smiths' flight management systems, electrical power management, mechanical actuation systems and airborne platform computing systems. \u001d  \"GE Aviation is growing about 10% a year and this acquisition gives us a technology growth platform that will be accretive to our net income and will deliver immediate and future value for our investors,\" GE's Immelt said in the statement. \u001d  Smiths Aerospace has more than 11,000 employees and had $2.4 billion in revenues in 2006. It has been working on projects like Boeing's 787 aircraft, the Airbus A380 as well as the Joint Strike Fighter military project. \u001d  On the Detection JV, the companies said they view a deal as a long-term commitment and there will be no voluntary exit rights for the first five years of the JV. \u001d  The companies didn't say when the JV would be finalized, but said they have agreed an exclusivity period to reach a deal. \u001d  Butler-Wheelhouse said he had asked Immelt to sell Smiths the whole of GE's Homeland Protection unit while they were talking about aerospace, but had been turned down. Further talks had agreed on a JV. \u001d  There is a \"great deal of industrial logic\" in putting the businesses together, Immelt said on the conference call, without quantifying synergies. \u001d  The unit will have pro-forma revenues of about GBP600 million. Its board will be made up of four Smiths members and two from GE, and will be chaired by Butler-Wheelhouse. \u001d  Butler-Wheelhouse said there are currently no talks to sell off the remaining Smiths units, but said \"we reconsider these things continuously.\" Immelt said GE had no interest in Smiths' medical operations because the two companies operate in different parts of the medical engineering industry. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.smiths-group.com \b \u001d  -By Steve McGrath and Rod Stone, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9284; steve.mcgrath@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 04:31 ET (09:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9839ceec5a2d1646116bffca5f349ba5","symR":["LLOY.LN","LYG","GB0008706128"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Fitch Upgrades Lloyds TSB Group To 'AA+'","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T11:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LLOY.LN","LYG","GB0008706128"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings: \b \u001d  Fitch Ratings-London-15 January 2007: Fitch Ratings has today upgraded Lloyds TSB Group plc's (\"Lloyds TSB Group\") Issuer Default rating (\"IDR\") to 'AA+' from 'AA'. At the same time the agency has affirmed the IDR of Lloyds TSB Bank plc (\"Lloyds TSB\") at 'AA+' and the Individual ratings of Lloyds TSB Group and Lloyds TSB at 'A'. The Short-term ratings for both entities are affirmed at 'F1+' and the Support ratings for Lloyds TSB and Lloyds TSB Group are affirmed at '1' at '5' respectively. The Outlooks for both entities' IDRs remain Stable. Lloyds TSB Group's preference shares, hybrid securities and subordinated debt have been upgraded to 'AA' from 'AA-' (AA minus). \u001d  The upgrade of Lloyds TSB Group's IDR reflects a review of the holding company's financial flexibility in line with Fitch's updated criteria relating to the analysis of bank holding companies (see Criteria Report 'Holding Company Analysis: Banks and Similar Financial Institutions' dated 13 March 2006 on www.fitchratings.com). \u001d  In Fitch's opinion, there is typically a high degree of correlation between the default risk of highly rated operating banks and their bank holding companies.  Lloyds TSB Group has a simple group structure, with all of the operations (including Scottish Widows) being owned by its 100% owned subsidiary - Lloyds TSB. The result is that there is very little difference between the group financials and the consolidated bank financials. The group has a prudent management framework and a conservative liquidity policy that ensure its ability to service the small obligations outstanding at holding company level. Tier 1 instruments (preference shares and capital securities) issued by Lloyds TSB Group are typically passed through to the operating companies on identical terms and conditions to ensure servicing and repayment capacity. Double leverage is a key consideration in the holding company analysis and Lloyds TSB Group maintains this within acceptable parameters. An obligation, as a listed company, to comply with supervisory and regulatory requirements in the UK and the US provides additional comfort. \u001d  Lloyds TSB Group's ratings reflect its robust and consistent performance, strong domestic franchise and very good asset quality. The group's prospects are heavily dependent on the UK economy where the outlook for the consumer remains uncertain and, at the very least, is likely to keep pressure on volume growth and margins. Revenues are benefitting from a revitalised insurance operation and a refocused wholesale bank as well as volume growth and improved sales in its core businesses. \u001d  Lloyds TSB Group's strategic goals are aimed at improving productivity and efficiency, deepening client relations and improving business line performance through improved cross-selling. New management has provided fresh impetus to the core businesses and the fruits of these endeavours are now being seen. Despite marked deterioration in domestic personal lending portfolios, asset quality remains very good, with losses on residential mortgages at particularly low levels. Whilst strong profitability provides a cushion against asset quality deterioration, additional provisions may be required if the economy, or the consumer sector, were to weaken significantly. \u001d  The group's capital base includes a sizeable element of embedded value in its Tier 1 ratio. Fitch considers the group to be adequately rather than strongly capitalised and continues to take comfort from the group's relatively low risk profile and strong earnings capacity that should continue to provide protection against unwanted surprises. \u001d  Contact: Gordon Scott, James Longsdon, London, Tel: +44 (0) 20 7417 4307/4309. \u001d  Media Relations: Mayra Cunningham, London, Tel: +44 20 7417 3557. \u001d  Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.

The FDA \bwill review the application to determine whether the test can be marketed for \bdiagnostic use in the United States. The test, called the COBAS(R) \bAmpliPrep/COBAS(R) TaqMan(R) HCV Test, is designed to provide highly accurate \binformation about the quantity of Hepatitis C virus in a patient's blood, from \bvery high to very low levels.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, an estimated \b4.1 million Americans have been infected with Hepatitis C virus, 3.2 million \bof whom are chronically infected.  Combination therapy with pegylated \binterferon and ribavirin drugs (currently the treatment of choice) can get rid \bof the virus in up to 5 out of 10 persons infected with genotype 1 of the \bHepatitis C virus, and up to 8 out of 10 persons infected with genotypes 2 \band 3. \b\b \b\b    About the Roche Molecular Diagnostics Virology Portfolio \b\b \b   Roche Molecular Diagnostics (RMD), the global leader in molecular \bdiagnostics, develops a broad range of tests based on the company's Nobel \bPrize-winning PCR technology.

The \bCOBAS(R) AmpliPrep/Cobas(R) TaqMan(R) HIV-1 and Hepatitis C tests are \bcurrently under review by the FDA. The tests are designed for improved \bworkflow efficiency and test results integrity, including configuration \boptions that enable fully automated \"sample in, results out\" processing. \b\b \b   The FDA is also currently reviewing the Roche Diagnostics COBAS(R) \bTaqMan(R) HBV Test, which is designed for use with High Pure sample \bpreparation reagents and the COBAS(R) TaqMan(R) 48 analyzer for automated \bamplification and quantitation of Hepatitis B virus in human blood. \b\b \b   Not all tests are available in all countries.

Additional DaVinci software and development tools for the DM6441 make it possible to deliver high-quality video combined with power saving modes for portable audio and video applications, including portable media players (PMPs), consumer video security devices, medical devices, data terminals, IP netcams, automotive/in-flight entertainment systems and other digital audio and video applications.  For more information, see http://www.ti.com/dm6441pr . \b \u001d  \"TI has brought together the optimal blend of performance, flexibility, and power efficiency for portable media players,\" said Henri Crohas, founder and chief executive officer, ARCHOS.  \"The DM644x device easily supports multiple video formats, which has given ARCHOS the base technology to develop and launch three devices of our latest Generation 4: the ARCHOS 404, the ARCHOS 504 and the ARCHOS 604.\" \b \u001d  The DM6441 is a dual-core SoC that consists of an ARM9(R) and TMS320C64x+(TM) digital signal processor (DSP) core plus video/imaging co- processors.  By offering this device, TI expands the possibilities of DaVinci technology for those seeking video performance of H.264, MPEG 2, MPEG 4 or VC-1, among others, at 30 frames per second combined with power efficient optimizations for a whole new realm of consumer applications.  The DM6441 provides the key peripherals required for today's portable media applications, including Ethernet, MMC and SD card interfaces, ATA hard disk drive interface, USB 2.0 and multiple UARTs, while offering developers the programmable flexibility and customization they need to design cost-effective portable entertainment products.  Furthermore, the power optimization of the device makes it possible for developers to implement power over Ethernet, which is suitable for many video security systems. \b \u001d  \"By releasing an SoC with specific power management capabilities to the broad market, TI is further driving the adoption of digital video technology into an increasingly wide array of consumer portable audio and video applications,\" said Greg Mar, SoC platform marketing manager, TI.  \"Building on DaVinci technology, we are able to provide the optimized application software developers need to design cost-effective, power-efficient digital video products and bring them to market quickly.\" \b \b    Optimized Power Savings \b \u001d  The advanced power saving capabilities of the DM6441 make it ideal for portable audio and video applications.  With dual power modes the DM6441 can run at full speed (513 MHz DSP and 256 MHz ARM) at 1.2 V or in power-reduced mode (405 MHz DSP and 202 MHz ARM) at 1.05 V.  The dual power modes allow the reduction of power consumption during operations, such as audio-only playback, when the full capabilities of the DSP are not required.  Additional clock gating capabilities provide a mechanism for turning off peripherals that are not in use.  Isolating the power domains of the DSP and ARM cores has made it possible to power down the DSP core individually during non-video operations. The combination of dual power mode, clock gating and isolated power domains can yield overall power savings up to 35 percent over the previously released TMS320DM6443 and TMS320DM6446 devices. \b \u001d  Developers can begin product design with the Digital Video Evaluation Module (DVEVM, TMDXEVM6446), which is available today.  The DVEVM includes proven design modules for additional power savings with TI's analog devices and microcontrollers.  The DM6441 can also be paired with TI's ultra low-power microcontroller, the MSP430, which offers an exceptional standby current under one microamp and power-manages the DM6441 in its most efficient sleep/halt mode to further reduce average current consumption. \b \b    Exceptional Efficiency through Enhanced Software \b \u001d  Software plays a major role in enabling developers to achieve the best performance, quality and power efficiency from SoC silicon.  The DM6441 device's software application programming interface and multimedia framework manages control of power to maximize battery life for portable devices with minimal effort from developers.  The increased power efficiency of the DM6441 has also made it possible for TI to expand the variety of codecs available off-the-shelf for portable devices, including VC-1 and H.264.  TI has also introduced availability of the industry-standard uClibc library, making the DM6441 TI's first device to bring uClibc to the broad market.  uClibc reduces product development costs by shrinking application footprints, leading to faster boot times, the need for less external memory and improved reliability through reduced system complexity. \b \u001d  The DM6441 is pin-for-pin and software compatible with the DM6443 and DM6446 devices, enabling engineers to leverage the extensive infrastructure of development tools available through the DaVinci ecosystem and TI's third-party partners.  These tools include the aforementioned DVEVM and the Digital Video Software Development Kit (DVSDK, TMDSSDK6446-L), the latter of which allows system developers to integrate discrete software modules and combine them into a single executable file while avoiding tedious manual integration.  Together, these tools save months of development time, enabling developers to quickly design and bring to market compact, quality and competitively priced portable media applications. \b \b    Software and Development Tools Spur Development \b \u001d  To deliver the most advanced solutions for PMP manufacturers, TI is working with third party developers including ATEME, Ingenient and Ittiam, to offer the market reference designs for PMPs.  The reference designs leverage TI's complete suite of production-ready digital media software, including MPEG-2 MP, H.264 MP and AC3.  Information on the codec combinations available from TI is at http://www.ti.com/digitalmediasoftware . \b \b    Pricing and Availability \b \u001d  The DM6441 for portable audio and video applications is sampling now and it is $24.95 each in quantities of 10,000.

Results from the 2006 work programs suggest that Golden Summit may have the potential to host bulk tonnage gold mineralization in addition to high-grade gold mineralization in individual veins. \b \u001d  The current Phase 1 drill program will consist of 5,000 feet of shallow drilling in 3 closely spaced parallel lines to test for gold mineralization through the Cleary Hill vein system and the 1,000 foot wide swarm of veins and shear zones that run sub-parallel and immediately south of the Cleary Hill Vein. Subsequent drilling phases to test for gold mineralization in the vein systems at other locations along its 3,500 foot known strike length may increase the total drilling footage up to 25,000 feet. \b \b    Cleary Hill Vein System \b \u001d  The Cleary Hill vein, which was mined down to the water table depth of 400 feet in the early 1900's, was the source of approximately 280,000 ounces of gold production at an average grade of 44.6 g/tonne (1.3 oz/ton). Freegold's 2006 program was not only successful in discovering a new 1,300 foot eastern extension of the Cleary Hill vein, but more importantly the program discovered that extensive bleeding of gold mineralization, via smaller quartz vein splays and horsetails into both the hanging and foot wall rocks, resulted in the formation of mineralised zones up to 100 feet wide surrounding the vein. \b \u001d  This discovery was made at the old Beistline shaft area, 1,300 feet east of the Cleary Hill mine working, where vein stripping and sampling adjacent to Beistline shaft in June uncovered the principal Cleary Hill vein. Channel samples along the 185-foot strike length of the 4\" to 18\" wide vein averaged 39.5 g/tonne (1.15 oz/ton). Mineralization was noted to extend to the south and five-foot long channel samples, extending 5-10 feet into the hanging wall returned assays of 25.3, 34.3, 31.1, 26.1 and 46.3 g/tonne (0.74 to 1.35 oz/ton). Overburden stripping subsequently continued to the south, exposing mineralization over an area approximately 140 feet long and 100 wide. This area was sampled with five-foot chip channel samples on five-foot spacings. Mineralization was found to grade from less than 0.1 g/tonne to 53.9 g/tonne. \b \u001d  Following the completion of the first five-foot wide bulk sample pit and collection of the Cleary Hill vein material, additional gold mineralization remained visible in the pit walls, and a number of vertical chip channel samples were taken periodically throughout the initial 110 foot length of the pit. These assays have now been received, and confirm the presence of high-grade mineralization in the mineralized zone surrounding the main Cleary Hill vein. \b \b \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    Location                              Location \b     along                                 along \b    Beistline    Gold                     Beistline    Gold \b    pit wall    Grade                     pit wall    Grade \b     (feet)   (g/tonne)    Sample Type     (feet)   (g/tonne)    Sample Type \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b        0        0.24      2' vertical       74        1.57      2' vertical \b                               chip                                  chip \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b       10        3.67          grab          80      616.72      3' vertical \b                                                                    chip \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b       14        0.41          grab          92        4.63      3' vertical \b                                                                     chip \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b       20        0.52      3' vertical      101       65.25      3' vertical \b                               chip                                  chip \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b       42        1.24      5' vertical      105        0.78    3.5' vertical \b                               chip                                  chip \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b       56        0.68      2' vertical \b                               chip \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b \u001d  This material was subsequently mined as part of the bulk-sampling program. Approximately 6,000 tons of material was collected from the pit which measures 300 feet long, 30 feet deep and 30 feet wide. Mineralization continues into the hanging wall of the current pit, and surface trenching chip channel samples 80 feet south of the pit wall and perpendicular to strike of the vein system returned 15 feet averaging 22.3 g/tonne (0.65 oz/ton). \b \u001d  Construction of the haul road, and subsequent stripping/cross-trenching also exposed the Cleary Hill structure approximately 1,200 feet west of the Beistline shaft area, directly above the old underground workings. As was seen in the eastern extension, gold mineralization extends over an area more than 100 feet wide, with mineralization and alteration along the main structure comparable to that seen in the Beistline shaft area. One channel sample taken on the bulk-sampled structure in this area assayed 31.0 g/tonne (0.90 oz/ton) over 9 feet perpendicular to the strike of the vein. The veins in this structure are confirmed to be on strike with the higher-grade intercepts previously reported in Freegold's June cross trenches between this and the Beistline shaft area. \b \u001d  In light of these new discoveries, management re-examined the limited previous drilling by Freegold along strike on this structure. Three drill holes from 1997 and 1998, located 3,000 feet west of the Beistline shaft, went through and under the Cleary Hill Mine workings, and encountered significant widths of mineralization that did not fit the geological model for the Cleary Hill vein system at that time. Intercepts from these core holes included: 162 feet @ 0.86 g/tonne (0.025 oz/ton) from hole CHD9703, 150 feet @ 1.27 g/tonne (0.037 oz/ton) from hole CHD9704, and 101 feet @ 1.3 g/tonne (0.038 oz/ton) and 40 feet @ 2.2 g/tonne (0.064 oz/ton) in the hanging wall, plus an additional 51 feet @ 0.86 g/tonne (0.025 oz/ton) in the footwall of hole CHD9801. Management now believes these significant widths of mineralization may be similar to that found in the Beistline shaft area and the Cleary Hill area 1,200 feet west of the Beistline shaft. \b \u001d  The Cleary Hill structure continues to remain open along strike in both directions. \b \b    Cleary Hill South Vein Swarm \b \u001d  The Cleary Hill South Vein Swarm is comprised of a series of east-northeast trending veins and shear zones in an area that extends up to 1,000 feet south of the Cleary Hill mine, and that have been traced to date over a total strike length of approximately 1,100 feet. The haul road constructed last fall switched back and forth down the hill through the known vein swarm in the areas of the previously reported Wackwitz and Colorado veins and Currey shear zone.

(\"USEY\") and its subsidiary, US Energy Biogas Corp. (\"USEB\"), resolving all outstanding issues between the parties.  The agreement is subject to the approval of the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York overseeing USEB's Chapter 11 reorganization case, which is expected to consider the matter later this month, and the Fund's lending syndicate as well as each party's respective boards. \b \bThe agreement in principle provides for Countryside Canada Power Inc, a subsidiary of the Fund (\"Lender\"), to have an allowed secured claim of US$99,000,000 (or approximately CAD$116,000,000 at the current exchange rate) in the chapter 11 cases of USEB and its subsidiaries.  The secured claim includes full outstanding principal and accrued interest of the USEB loan and an agreed amount on account of all other claims of the Lender against USEB, including the USEB royalty interest.  The agreement provides for installment cash payments of US$3,000,000 on or before January 31, 2007, US$30,000,000 on or before March 31, 2007, and the remaining balance on or before  maturity at May 31, 2007. Outstanding principal amounts shall be deemed over secured for purposes of adequate protection and the use of cash collateral in the USEB bankruptcy cases and shall bear cash interest at a rate of 10% per annum from February 1, 2007, payable monthly in U.S. dollars to the Fund.  The parties will work together to pursue a \"take-out\" financing before the final installment date of May 31, 2007.  Mutual general releases will be exchanged among the parties involved and will cover individuals affiliated with the Fund who have been threatened with lawsuits arising out of their prior employment by USEY. \b \bIn light of the agreement in principle, the Fund intends to meet with its senior lenders as soon as possible to clarify, among other things, whether the Fund will be able to make its December 2006 distribution on January 31, 2007, and to determine what impact the agreement will have on the terms of its credit facility with its lending syndicate. The Fund also intends to carefully assess the most appropriate use of the cash that will be received pursuant to the agreement, with a view to the best interests of the unitholders of the Fund. \b \bThe settlement resulted from a mediation that took place in New York City on January 12 and 13, 2007.  Ronald Barliant of the law firm of Goldberg Kohn of Chicago, a former United States bankruptcy judge, presided over the mediation. The Lender's legal advisor in the mediation and the USEB Chapter 11 proceedings is Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. \b \bForward-Looking Statements \b \bThis press release may contain forward-looking statements relating to expected future events and financial and operating results of the Fund that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from management expectations as projected in such forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including market and general economic conditions and the risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the Fund's annual information form dated March 31, 2006, and available on SEDAR.

We do not look at these cycles. You'll never be able to do anything if you look closely to that,\" Yousef Omair bin Yousef told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. \u001d  State-owned Adnoc has launched several oil field developments aimed at raising crude production capacity by two thirds in the largest of the U.A.E.'s seven emirates and is also looking to build a new refinery, boost its natural gas production and increase capacity at its petrochemical plants. \u001d  Adnoc, founded in 1971, accounts for almost all the 2.5 million b/d of crude presently produced in the U.A.E., the third largest producer among the 10 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. \u001d  Persian Gulf oil producers are spending income generated from three years of high oil prices on expanding and upgrading their crude oil production capacity to meet rising global demand and to diversify their economies by investing in gas-based industries such as petrochemicals to create jobs for their fast growing populations. \u001d  However, some projects have been thrown into doubt after a steep decline in oil prices over the past seven months, with benchmark crude futures in New York dropping by almost a third since a record $78.40 a barrel last July and by 13% since the beginning of the year. \u001d  The drop in oil prices has been accompanied by a falling U.S. dollar, making non-U.S. imports into dollar-pegged Arab Gulf economies more expensive, as well as a rise in construction costs due to high project activity in the Middle East and in Asian countries, leading to shortages of equipment, raw materials and qualified labor. \u001d  None of this will change Adnoc's plans though, according to Yousef. \u001d  \"We're proceeding with our plans, not only upstream but also on the refining side, on the gas processing side and on the petrochemicals side. We're proceeding with these plans because they all complement each other,\" he said. \u001d  Regarding oil production, \"the ultimate target is 4 million b/d, but we're moving gradually. We're talking about 10-12 years,\" Yousef said. \u001d  To meet the target, Adnoc will develop onshore and offshore fields including Umm al-Lulu, Nasr, Qusahwira and Bida al-Qemzan. \u001d  \"These are only some (of the fields). Eventually we'll go into all of them, developing them and raising capacity,\" Yousef said, without providing details on the estimated investment cost. \u001d  Among the largest ongoing developments is the offshore Upper Zakum oil field, one of the world's largest, in which ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) has a 28% equity stake. It is set to produce 750,000 b/d by 2016, from around half a million b/d currently. \u001d  Adnoc decided to bring ExxonMobil on board the Zakum project to help raise output by applying so-called enhanced oil recovery technology, which injects gas, water or steam into an oil-field to increase reservoir pressure and boost production. \u001d  The timeframe for Upper Zakum is \"around 10 years or so, that's the target but this is flexible,\" Yousef said. \u001d  \"The approach is going to be defined by what will give you most of the oil. You need to find the right approach to improve the recovery ratio. This is under study.\" \u001d  Yousef said that cooperation with international oil companies such as ExxonMobil, BP PLC (BP) and Total SA (TOT), which are already involved in Abu Dhabi, as well as with other firms, could be a model applied in future projects. \u001d  \"The main criterion in this is the technical capability of the company to support us in that regard and [the company] that can add something will be given a chance to compete,\" he said. \u001d  International oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA), are already vying to become Adnoc's joint-venture partner on the development of Abu Dhabi gas fields containing sour gas, highly sulfuric natural gas that is more costly and difficult to process because its corrosive nature requires special handling and infrastructure. \u001d  The project, the U.A.E.'s largest-ever non-associated gas development, could cost as much as $10 billion, according to some industry estimates, and is crucial to meet fast-rising gas requirements in the country. \u001d  \"Gas is another area where we're expanding,\" Yousef said. \"We will be using all of the gas we'll be producing because our (oil) fields require gas for injection to maintain pressure (and) our petrochemicals require gas as fuel and as feed.\" \u001d  Adnoc will select, within the next six months, one of 13 companies prequalified to bid for the project, Yousef said. Companies will submit their bids in mid-April. \u001d  Demand for natural gas is rising fast in the U.A.E. as the country's population is growing rapidly and the government is moving ahead with the addition of new, gas-fired power and desalination plants, and the development of new industries with high gas requirements, such as aluminum and petrochemicals. \u001d  Adnoc is also advancing plans to build a new refinery in Ruwais, about 250 kilometers west of Abu Dhabi city, that will produce for the export market and also supply feedstock for new domestic petrochemical industries. \u001d  \"We're studying a new refinery with capacity of  300,000-400,000 b/d in Ruwais,\" Yousef said. \"We expect the study to be completed in a couple of month, probably in the first half of the year. It will be integrated with petrochemicals.\" \u001d  Petrochemical capacity may also be expanded further at Abu Dhabi Polymers Co., or Borouge, a joint venture between Adnoc and Vienna-based Borealis. \u001d  The ongoing Borouge 2 project will triple total polyolefins production to about 2 million tons a year of polyolefins once on stream in 2010 but there may be more in the pipeline, according to Yousef. \u001d  \"We could have Borouge 3 eventually because we have the means, we have the technology now with our partner Borealis and we have the resources. That's eventually going to come once we have Borouge 2 implemented and tested,\" he said. \u001d  -By Oliver Klaus, Dow Jones Newswires, +9714 229 2806, oliver.klaus@dowjones.com \u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 03:11 ET (08:11 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9f6cd6c501b74fd9ce9ab9496ff58f19","symR":["UKDAY","UKDAY"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EUROPEAN MORNING BRIEFING: Div Payments & Ex Div Dates","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T06:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\bAcciona (ANA.MC): 1H 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bActividades de Construccion (ACS.MC): 1H 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bBarloworld (BAW.JO): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bBellway (BWY.LN): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bBusiness Post Group (BPG.LN): 1H 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bEOG Resources (EOG): 4Q 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bFenner (FENR.LN): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bInvestment Company (INV.LN): 1H 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bNorthgate Information (NIS.LN): 1H 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bRemgro (REM.JO): 1H 2007 Dividend Payment Date \b \bReunert (RLO.JO): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bTiger Brands (TBS.JO): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bUnibail Holding (12471.FR): 2Q 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 01:00 ET (06:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9fd482a672cbe5d8a3e4336880a23135","symR":["532540.BY","TTA.YY","INE467B01029"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"India TCS Dividend At INR3/Share","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["532540.BY","TTA.YY","INE467B01029"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","TSX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:27 ET (12:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a0618bc1e72f6d30f53b5d64e0432f50","symR":["DEO","DGE.LN","GB0002374006"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Diageo Buys Back 0.4M Shares","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T18:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DEO","DGE.LN","GB0002374006"],"IndustryCodes":["BVG","VIN","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Diageo said Monday that it purchased for cancellation through Goldman Sachs International 400,000 ordinary shares at a price of 1000.93 pence per share. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 13:21 ET (18:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a0c8b1d136e3a2d4b01932331593f719","symR":["35493.AE","OCENY","NL0000354934"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Oce CEO: Doesn't Rule Out Job Cuts Due To SPINE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T07:59:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["35493.AE","OCENY","NL0000354934"],"IndustryCodes":["OFF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 02:59 ET (07:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a0f27c02e151e899de0ad177ca2005fa","symR":["VME.OS","NO0003074601"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": VMETRO Announces 720 MB/s VXS Data Recorder","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VME.OS","NO0003074601"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR"],"Story":"\bHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2007-- \u001d  VMETRO today expanded it's Vortex range of high-speed data recording solutions with the introduction of the Vortex M6000 VME/VXS recorder.

The Strategic Business Unit Digital Document Systems booked a slightly better result in the fourth quarter, but its performance for the full year was lower than expected.

The integration of Imagistics was successfully completed ahead of schedule and the anticipated synergies have been achieved. \b \u001d  \"Our three strategic thrusts continue to be: increasing our distributive strength, ongoing innovation of our product range and optimizing our business processes.

Excluding exchange rate effects the increase amounted to 11.4%. \b \u001d  Non-recurring revenues increased by 9.9% (excluding exchange rate effects the increase was 11.7%). Recurring revenues were 8.3% higher (up 11.2% excluding exchange rate effects). In the table on page 9 we give an indication of the development of total revenues after adjustment for the effects of the Imagistics acquisition and exchange rates. \b \u001d  As can be seen from that table, total indicative revenues were 1.4% higher, with non-recurring revenues gaining 2.5% and recurring revenues up by 0.8%. \b \u001d  The gross margin increased by 1.8% from 40.7% to 42.5%. The increase is the result of volume mix effects (0.8%). Hedge results contributed 1.0% to the increase in the gross margin. \b \u001d  Operating expenses were lower as a result of the restructuring operation initiated in 2005. Additionally, exchange rate effects had a positive impact on the development of expenses. \b \b   During the quarter EUR 13 million was capitalized on R&D costs. \b \u001d  This is EUR 5 million higher than in the third quarter, specifically because of the introduction of the Oce VarioPrint 6250. As a result, relatively higher than normal development costs were incurred in the fourth quarter. \b \u001d  Operating income decreased from EUR  70.6 million to EUR 43.8 million. \b \u001d  The normalized operating income, as shown above, provides a better insight into how the business developed. \b \u001d  Normalized operating income increased from EUR 35.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 to EUR 48.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. \b \u001d  Financing expenses in the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 12.9 million. \b \b   Taxes were EUR 4.2 million. \b \b   Net income amounted to EUR 26.7 million (2005: EUR 52.1 million). \b \b   Net income per ordinary share outstanding amounted to EUR 0.28. \b \bNormalized operating income higher \b                                       Fourth quarter   Financial year \bIn million Euro                          2006   2005      2006   2005 \b \bOperating income                         43.8   70.6     102.2  112.5 \bRelease from pensions                    -2.7  -68.3     -16.5  -68.3 \bRestructuring and integration costs       6.1   33.1      18.0   33.1 \b                                            .                       . \b                                       ------------------------------- \b                                         47.2   35.4     103.7   77.3 \b \bCosts of share-based schemes \b(difference compared to 2005)            -0.3      -       1.1      - \bLease revenues \b(difference compared to 2005)             1.8      -       8.4      - \b                                            .                       . \b                                       ------------------------------- \bNormalised operating income              48.7   35.4     113.2   77.3 \b \u001d  Strategic Business Unit Digital Document Systems: financial results slightly improved \b \u001d  Revenues in the Strategic Business Unit Digital Document Systems (DDS) grew by 12.0% to EUR  598.5 million. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Imagistics (approx. 14%). Exchange rate effects were 2.5% negative. \b \b   Non-recurring revenues increased by 13.3%. \b \u001d  After adjustment for exchange rate effects (-1.7%) and acquisition effects non-recurring revenues increased by approx. 1.5%. This increase has to be compared with what was also a very strong fourth quarter in 2005. \b \u001d  Recurring revenues increased by 11.4%. After taking into account the revenues that resulted from the acquisition of Imagistics and the effects of exchange rates (-2.9%) recurring revenues remained stable compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. The trend in recurring revenues excluding currency effects shows an improvement on a year-on-year basis (2006: - 0.5%; 2005: -3.8%). \b \u001d  The operating income (EBIT) of DDS amounted to EUR 20.1 million (2005: EUR 40.5 million). Normalized EBIT was EUR 25.2 million (2005: EUR 19.0 million). \b \u001d  The integration of Oce Imagistics within Oce North America has been completed. Imagistics delivered a solid financial performance. The business synergies of EUR 5 million planned for 2006 have been realized. The cost savings achieved during 2006 amounted to EUR 12 million, which was higher than anticipated. \b \u001d  Strategic Business Unit Wide Format Printing Systems: another strong quarter \b \u001d  In the Strategic Business Unit Wide Format Printing Systems (WFPS) revenues grew by 1.5% to EUR 233.6 million. Excluding exchange rate effects, revenues were 4.0% higher. \b \u001d  Non-recurring revenues increased by 2.4% (excluding exchange rate effects, by 4.4%). This increase in revenues was due in particular to our success in selling color machines and the ongoing updating of our innovative black and white printers. Recurring revenues also developed well and increased by 1.0% (excluding exchange rate effects, by 3.4%). Revenues from service contracts, toner and ink as well as total revenues in the Imaging Supplies business group showed healthy growth. \b \u001d  Operating income amounted to EUR 23.7 million (2005: EUR 30.1 million). The normalized operating income increased from EUR 16.4 million to EUR 23.5 million. \b \u001d  Thanks to successful black and white and color products Oce has succeeded in gaining market share in Technical Document Systems. Particularly in the color market the Oce TCS300 and Oce TCS500 have been very successful. \b \b   Provisional results 2006 financial year \b \u001d  Total revenues in 2006 increased by 16.2%. Excluding acquisition and exchange rate effects the increase was 0.3%. \b \u001d  Non-recurring revenues were up by 14.9%. This growth in revenues was due entirely to the acquisition of Imagistics. \b \u001d  Recurring revenues increased by 16.7%. Excluding acquisition effects (15.6%) and exchange rate effects the increase amounted to 0.8%. \b \u001d  The gross margin amounted to 42.1% (2005: 41.5%). This margin increase resulted from the acquisition of Imagistics. \b \u001d  Operating expense as a percentage of total revenues amounted to 38.8%. During 2006 a total amount of EUR 25 million net was capitalized on R&D costs. \b \u001d  With effect from December 1, 2005 the gross margin and operating expenses of Oce Imagistics have been reported in line with those of the Oce Group. \b \u001d  The operating income for the year 2006 was EUR 102.2 million (2005: EUR 112.5 million). \b \u001d  EBITDA amounted to EUR 306.1 million, an increase of 19.1% compared to 2005 (EUR  257.0 million). \b \b   Net income went down from EUR 82.2 million to EUR 57.1 million. \b \u001d  Net income per ordinary share amounted to EUR 0.63 (2005: EUR 0.93). \b \b   Strategy 2007-2010 \b \u001d  Oce offers customers a complete spectrum of innovative products and services consisting of a well balanced mix of products it has developed itself and high quality products sourced from third parties. \b \u001d  Our direct sales and service organization, together with carefully selected distributors, ensure that service to each customer is optimal. \b \u001d  The strategy is focused on value creation through growth.

(\"Galleon\") announces completion of the fourth horizontal well at Puskwa, Alberta. The well, a re-entry of a vertical well, is located at 11-10-72-26W5M (100% interest) and was rig released on December 25, 2006. This well was drilled to a total measured depth of 11,270 feet and encountered 731 feet of horizontal oil pay in the Beaverhill Lake formation. The well flowed, during an initial test period of 60 hours, at an average rate of 650 boepd (88% oil and 12% gas) with no water. After completion of testing, the well will commence production at a restricted allowable rate yet to be determined. The quality of the light sweet oil is 38degrees API. \b \bThis horizontal well is significant because it is a re-entry of a marginal vertical well and it has the potential for establishing highly economic production at what appears to be the western pool edge. The northern and eastern pool edges have not yet been delineated. \b \bTested capacity of all wells drilled to date at Puskwa exceeds 11,150 boepd net of light sweet oil. The wells are currently under EUB imposed restricted production rates pending regulatory approval. It is expected that production from the 11-10 well will also be initially restricted by the EUB. \b \bDue to successful 2006 drilling program at Puskwa, Galleon continues to expand the delineation of the large oil pool. One vertical well (100% interest) is currently drilling within 5 miles of the first major well located at 16-32-71-26W5M. One well (100% interest) is expected to commence drilling within two weeks. It is located within 6 miles of the 16-32 well. In February 2007, one well (100% interest) is planned to commence drilling within 9 miles of the 16-32 well. Depending upon the success of the drilling program, up to 25 wells are planned in the remainder of 2007 and 2008. \b \bGalleon is a technically oriented high growth junior oil and gas company with focused operations in the Peace River area of Alberta. Galleon has access to over 1 million gross acres of land. \b \bGalleon has approximately 57.7 million Class A shares and 922,500 Class B shares issued and outstanding which trade on the TSX under the symbols \"GO.A\" and \"GO.B\". \b \bADVISORY: Certain information regarding Galleon Energy Inc. in this news release including management's assessment of future plans and operations, number, type and timing of wells to be drilled, the plan and development of certain prospects, production estimates, productive capacity and allowable production rates for the wells, may constitute forward-looking statements under applicable securities laws and necessarily involve risks including, without limitation, risk that regulatory approval to allow increased production at Puskwa will not be obtained or be delayed for an extended period of time, risks associated with oil and gas exploration, development, exploitation, production, marketing and transportation, loss of markets, volatility of commodity prices, currency fluctuations, imprecision of reserve estimates, environmental risks, competition from other producers, inability to retain drilling rigs and other services, capital expenditure costs, including drilling, completion and facilities costs, unexpected decline rates in wells, wells not performing as expected, incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions, failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, delays resulting from or inability to obtain required regulatory approvals and ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources.

(IAG.T) to hold from buy on its Canadian focus and on expectations that its 2007 earnings will lag behind those of insurers rated at buy by Genuity. \u001d  In a research report Monday, analyst Mario Mendonca said the stock outperformed its larger peers substantially in 2006, which has narrowed the valuation gap to 10% from 18-20% at the end of 2005. He noted that currency fluctuations should augment rather than hurt the earnings growth of Industrial Alliance's larger peers in 2007, while low long-term interest rates remain a greater issue for Industrial Alliance. He added that the rocky start to 2007 for domestic equity markets highlights Industrial Alliance's Canada-only exposure. \u001d  Mendonca anticipates slower growth in 2007, noting that the positive impact of the Clarington and National Life integrations will be offset by currency fluctuations and the Canadian Institute of Actuaries' institution of more onerous standards for interest rate scenario assumption testing. He said his 2007 share earnings guidance is C$2.93 and reflects 11.7% growth over 2006, below expected earnings growth from Genuity's buy-rated stocks. \u001d  However, Mendonca raised his target for Industrial Alliance to C$40.00 from C$38.00, reflecting his expectation of 2008 earnings of C$3.29 a share. \u001d  The Quebec City-based insurance and financial services company is trading at C$36.47 in Toronto Monday, up 0.8%. \u001d  Genuity doesn't have an investment-banking relationship with Industrial Alliance and Mendonca doesn't own shares of the company. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.inalco.com \b \u001d  -Tara Zachariah, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2100 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:09 ET (17:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a5e1f543dd339236ffe47682d0e580fd","symR":["LSG.T","SUP.V","CA5107281084","CA8681522089"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Superior Diamonds And Lake Shore Gold Sign Joint Venture","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LSG.T","SUP.V","CA5107281084","CA8681522089"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","MNG","PCS"],"Story":"\b   VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(CCNMatthews - Jan. 15, 2007) - Superior Diamonds Inc. (TSX VENTURE:SUP) (\"Superior\" or \"the Company\") has entered into a 50/50 joint venture agreement with Lake Shore Gold Corp. (\"Lake Shore\") for gold exploration on the Canopener Property in northwestern Ontario. \b \bUnder the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement (\"the Agreement\"), Superior will contribute claims, issue 75,000 Superior shares to Lake Shore, and spend $500,000 on exploration on the property within the next three years, including a firm commitment of $50,000 during the first year. The Agreement is subject to the approval of each party's Board of Directors and the TSX Venture Exchange. Superior will be the operator of the project. After Superior has spent $500,000 on exploration of the property and issued shares to Lake Shore, each party will fund programs and budgets in accordance with its then current interest. \b \bThe Canopener Property consists of 39 claims totaling 6,560 hectares: five Lake Shore claims comprising 896 hectares and 34 Superior claims comprising 5,920 hectares. Nine claims are subject to an underlying 1.5% NSR payable to a third party, to a maximum of $2.5 million. Superior acquired its claims on the basis of an evaluation of airborne geophysics and positive gold grain results from overburden sampling. \b \bThe claims are located in the Traditional Territory of the Neskantaga First Nation. Superior engages in consultation with Neskantaga First Nation on all exploration activities, and this joint venture will move forward with their full cooperation and involvement. \b \bThe Canopener Property overlies the Peeagwon metavolcanic assemblage of the Wunnummin Greenstone Belt in northwestern Ontario. The Wunnummin Greenstone Belt is part of the Sachigo Subprovince of the Archean-aged Superior Province, which is under-explored for gold. Gold mineralization in this region is related to mesothermal processes often associated with post-batholitic events when dynamic metamorphism has virtually ceased and sulphidic fluids are focused along secondary and tertiary brittle-ductile structures adjacent to shear zones. \b \bAdjacent and down-ice from several shear structures, significant numbers of both pristine and modified gold grains were recovered from overburden samples collected by Superior. Mr. John Paterson, President of Superior Diamonds comments, \"Most gold grain dispersal trains related to significant gold mineralization are primarily of the pristine and modified classes. Two gold dispersal trains extend 1.5 kilometres from shear zones clearly evident on Superior's airborne geophysical data. Other overburden sample sites sampled in close proximity to a shear zone also have anomalous numbers of pristine and modified gold grain.\" \b \bBased on the proximity of these pristine gold grains to brittle-ductile shear structures occurring on the Canopener Property, Superior is planning a preliminary diamond drill program to test several possible gold targets. \b \bAbout Superior Diamonds \b \bSuperior Diamonds is a junior Canadian exploration company, primarily searching for diamonds in the under-explored and highly prospective regions of the Canadian Shield within the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Over a period of just three years, Superior's highly skilled team has defined four promising target areas through grass roots exploration, and is now focused on prioritizing these targets for drilling. To diversify risk and balance its portfolio, the Company has adopted a strategy to explore for other commodities where it has a proven track record of expertise, including uranium. The Company is a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, and trades on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol SUP. \b \bSuperior Diamonds is owned 14.8% by Southwestern Resources Corp. and 14.84% by FNX Mining Company Inc. \b \bAbout Lake Shore \b \bLake Shore is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties with prospects for hosting gold and base metal deposits. The Company is currently active in Canada and holds a number of mineral resource properties, either directly or through option agreements, in Ontario and Quebec. Lake Shore is a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, and trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol LSG. \b \bForward-looking Statements \b \bStatements in this release that are forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning the specific factors disclosed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in the Corporation's periodic filings with Canadian securities regulators.

She noted that the Safeguard proceeding and plan had been completed in record time despite the difficulties surrounding the case. \u001d  She rejected the 33 filings by various creditors of Eurotunnel to the Paris court's jurisdiction of all of Eurotunnel's 17 companies. \u001d  She mentioned senior lenders such as bond insurer MBIA Inc. (MBI), which has the largest debt claim against Eurotunnel and supported Eurotunnel's debt restructuring proposal; Franklin Mutual Advisers and the European Investment Bank, among others, as having filed the claims and said they would be subject to pay EUR10,000 as a penalty for each of the 33 claims lodged and rejected. \u001d  Monday's decision to approve the plan and reject opposition to the court's jurisdiction had been expected by dissenting creditors but legal challenges can remain ongoing in the U.K and creditors could appeal to higher courts in France. \u001d  However, creditors, such as Franklin Mutual Advisers and Oaktree Capital Management, who believe the plan doesn't adequately compensate them, have until Wednesday to drop any litigation against the company if they want to share up to GBP80 million in fees payable to creditors that participate in underwriting the convertible bond. If they decide to pursue various legal objections they have filed with both French and U.K courts, this could result in a potential windfall for other holders of so-called Tier Three debt who will have the opportunity of underwriting the convertible. \u001d  Gounon confirmed he had recently been in contact with the U.K. government about Eurotunnel's restructuring plans.  Although the emerging company will be a French company, the concession, which is governed by the Treaty of Canterbury and signed by both French and U.K. governments, will be untouched by the restructuring and retain its Anglo-French characteristic. \u001d  He also highlighted plans to create EUR450 million in value for the company by eradicating distortions in competition and said the company had won state funding for scanning equipment of freight by customs, which until now Eurotunnel had been funding. The subsidy is worth EUR1.4 million to Eurotunnel. Gounon said the company had been guilty of not being vigilant enough against distortions in competition and would put in place a group to monitor this alone. \u001d  -By Anousha Sakoui, Dow Jones Newswires; 44 20 7842 9318; anousha.sakoui@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:24 ET (12:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ac53c46e935a9382234b6716aadadad9","symR":["005380.SE","7267.TO","7269.TO","HMC","JP3397200001","JP3854600008","KR7005380001"],"date":"2007-01-14","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Honda To Invest Up To $200M On 2nd Indian Plant - Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-14T17:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["005380.SE","7267.TO","7269.TO","HMC","JP3397200001","JP3854600008","KR7005380001"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  NEW DELHI (Nikkei)--Honda Motor Co.

(7269.TO) and South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. (005380.SE) in the local market. \u001d  The new plant, to be located in northern Rajasthan, near the capital city of New Delhi, will be the firm's main manufacturing base in India, with room to expand output to more than 200,000 units a year. It will occupy a plot of 2 million to 2.8 million square meters, more than three times the size of the existing facility. \u001d  Honda intends to raise the annual production capacity at it current plant from about 50,000 units now to 100,000 vehicles before the end of the year. Once the automaker takes the new factory to its maximum capacity, its total output in India will expand fivefold to 300,000 units annually. \u001d  The new facility is likely to assemble a hatchback equipped with a 1.2-liter engine to compete with the popular Swift, which Suzuki developed for Indian motorists. During his visit to India in July 2006, President Takeo Fukui suggested that Honda was developing a car for the local market. \u001d  The Indian market is projected to grow 20% on the year to 1.3 million units in the year ending March 2007. Analysts expect it to expand to more than 2 million by 2010. Currently, Honda only sells cars equipped with 1.5-liter or bigger engines.

The oil was light (c. 30 degrees API) and sweet with a low gas-oil ratio and some associated wax. \b\b \b\bFollowing the encouraging result in the secondary objective of the Kingfisher-1 well, the partners commenced drilling the Kingfisher-1A sidetrack, which aimed to step-out into the basin to test the primary exploration objectives of the well and penetrate as much of the deeper sedimentary section as possible to a maximum depth of 4,000 metres. Since the last report, the Kingfisher-1A well has been successfully cased to 2,502 metres and drilled to a depth of 2,962 metres. \b\b \b\bNew drilling in the deeper section has encountered three additional potential oil-bearing zones totalling approximately 40 metres between 2,260 and 2,370 metres, evidenced by wireline logging and formation pressure testing. Planned testing of these zones will follow completion of drilling, to a target depth of between 3,000 and 4,000 metres, which it is estimated will take up to a further 45 days. Test equipment has remained on site in readiness for the testing. \b\b \b\bThe Kingfisher prospect is a very large structural high that is expressed at surface on the bed of Lake Albert. Seismic data indicates the Kingfisher prospect has an areal extent of up to approximately 70 square kilometres, although the Kingfisher-1A well is only investigating a limited part of this structure. \b\b \b\bAs part of an accelerated work program in Uganda, the joint venture partners are planning to acquire approximately 270 square kilometres of 3D seismic over the Kingfisher structure commencing in the first half of 2007. Options for further drilling of the Kingfisher prospect and other prospects in Lake Albert are being appraised. \b\b \b\bHeritage is operator of and holds a 50% interest in Block 3A, which has an area of 1,991 square kilometres.

Acrobat Connect enables knowledge workers to instantly meet and conduct business online through real-time, interactive web conferencing that is simple to access and easy to use. \b \u001d  \"The feedback from users during our Acrobat Connect trial the past few months has been overwhelmingly positive. It has reinforced our belief that the product stands apart from traditional web conferencing solutions in terms of ease-of-use, elegance, and the instant access it provides anyone with an Adobe Flash enabled browser,\" said Tom Hale, senior vice president, Knowledge Worker Business Unit at Adobe. \"Now that we're delivering the hosted service at an extremely approachable price, we expect knowledge workers to begin making Acrobat Connect personal meeting rooms as much a part of their daily work as email and the phone.\" \b \u001d  Unlike other web conferencing solutions, Acrobat Connect enables users to choose an easy-to-remember web address for their online personal meeting room that is unique to them, much like a phone number or e-mail address. Accessing a personal meeting room is easy and instant, requiring little more than a web browser and the ubiquitous Adobe Flash(R) Player software, installed on more than 97 percent of Internet-connected computers worldwide. Because there is no cumbersome software to download, knowledge workers can easily hold spontaneous, ad-hoc meetings that are virtually hassle-free to join. \b \u001d  \"Working with manufacturers to ensure homes meet federal and state code requirements is a process heavily dependent on efficient and accurate communication and collaboration,\" said Dennis Newman, general manager, Information Technology Services, PFS Corporation, an independent quality control, testing, certification, and evaluation agency serving the architecture, engineering and construction industry. \"Acrobat Connect helps eliminate many of the common communication problems we've encountered in the past.

Available as of Dec. 2006, Acrobat Connect Professional offers a highly scalable solution for wide organizational deployment that offers extensive meeting management capabilities, as well as a powerful reporting system. For online meetings and events, including large meetings of up to 2,500 participants, companies can reach target audiences virtually any time with interactive multimedia, integrated telephony, and Voice over Internet Protocol. Organizations can deploy Acrobat Connect Professional in either an on-premise, behind the firewall configuration, or through Adobe's hosted service. \b \u001d  The entire Acrobat family consists of Acrobat 8 Professional, Acrobat 8 Standard, Acrobat 8 Elements, Acrobat 3D Version 8, Acrobat Connect, and Acrobat Connect Professional. \b \b   Pricing and Availability \b \u001d  Acrobat Connect is immediately available in English in North America for a subscription price of US$39 per month, or US$395 per year per personal meeting room.

(GE) for $4.8 billion in cash and return GBP2.1 billion of the GBP2.25 billion proceeds to its shareholders. \u001d  It also said the two companies have signed a letter of intent to form a new joint venture company, Smiths GE Detection, combining Smiths' Detection operations with GE Homeland Protection. Smiths will own 64% of the new JV and GE the remaining 36%. \u001d  After selling its aerospace division, Smiths will be left with detection, medical and specialty engineering operations. The company has been under pressure from shareholders to break itself up, but has long resisted. \u001d  The announcements were welcomed by the markets and at 1236 GMT, Smiths' shares were up 138.5 pence, or 14%, at 1,123.5 pence, the biggest gainer on the FTSE 100. In Frankfurt, General Electric shares were down 0.3% at EUR29.18. \u001d  One trader, who requested anonymity, said the sale made perfect sense since Smiths aerospace has been suffering from downward pricing pressure from Boeing Co. (BA) and Airbus owner European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. (5730.FR). \u001d  In a research note, Panmure Gordon said there's clearly scope for other bidders to step in although counter offers might have to involve a bid for the whole of Smiths. It said it's concerned that the merger of the two market leaders in detection may struggle to get antitrust clearance. The brokerage has a buy rating on Smiths. \u001d  In a statement, Smiths said the sale of the aerospace unit is expected to generate improved returns on capital and boost margins. The net effect of the sale and capital return would have been accretive to the company's 2006 pro-forma earnings, it added. \u001d  On a conference call, Smiths Chief Executive Keith Butler-Wheelhouse said the deal would have boosted pro-forma 2006 earnings per share by 7%, even though aerospace accounted for GBP1.3 billion of the company's GBP3.5 billion in revenues in 2006. \u001d  The company will call an extraordinary shareholders meeting during the second quarter to approve the sale, which is also subject to completion and regulatory approval. \u001d  On the conference call, GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said he looked forward to \"a constructive process\" with E.U. antitrust regulators. \u001d  He noted that the acquisition would be complimentary rather than consolidating and told analysts separately he doesn't anticipate serious regulatory issues. Regarding the detection joint venture, Immelt said there are a \"multitude of competitors\" in the industry. \u001d  GE hasn't always had success with E.U. regulators, which blocked the company's intended acquisition of Honeywell after U.S. authorities had approved the deal. \u001d  The Smiths capital return is proposed as a B share scheme combined with share consolidation. \u001d  Smiths Finance Director John Langston said the aerospace division sale would leave Smiths with a loosened dividend policy and lower credit ratings, but the company could live with that because the remaining businesses are less capital intensive. The new dividend cover would be 1.8 times, down from 2 times, while its credit ratings at Standard & Poor's are expected to fall from A- to BBB+, he said. \u001d  In a separate statement, GE said the acquisition will broaden the U.S. company's offerings to its aerospace customers by adding Smiths' flight management systems, electrical power management, mechanical actuation systems and airborne platform computing systems. \u001d  A Smiths official said he doesn't expect the sale to impact the acquired unit's business with Rolls-Royce PLC (RR.LN), the U.K. company that competes head-to-head with GE on aircraft engines. \u001d  \"GE Aviation is growing about 10% a year and this acquisition gives us a technology growth platform that will be accretive to our net income and will deliver immediate and future value for our investors,\" GE's Immelt said in the statement. \u001d  Smiths Aerospace has more than 11,000 employees and had $2.4 billion in revenues in 2006. It has been working on projects like Boeing's 787 aircraft, the Airbus A380 as well as the Joint Strike Fighter military project. \u001d  On the Detection JV, the companies said they view a deal as a long-term commitment and there will be no voluntary exit rights for the first five years of the JV. \u001d  The companies didn't say when the JV would be finalized, but said they have agreed an exclusivity period to reach a deal. Immelt said there are no plans \u001d  Butler-Wheelhouse said he had asked Immelt to sell Smiths the whole of GE's Homeland Protection unit while they were talking about aerospace, but had been turned down. Further talks had agreed on a JV. Speaking at a press conference in London, Butler-Wheelhouse said the involvement of GE might help the JV to secure additional security contracts in the huge U.S. market.   The CEO added that he now plans to stay at Smiths beyond his planned March 2008 retirement to oversee the full financial year ending July 31, 2008. \u001d  There is a \"great deal of industrial logic\" in putting the businesses together, Immelt said on the conference call, without quantifying synergies. \u001d  The JV will have pro-forma revenues of about GBP600 million. Its board will be made up of four Smiths members and two from GE, and will be chaired by Butler-Wheelhouse. \u001d  Butler-Wheelhouse said there are currently no talks to sell off the remaining Smiths units, but said \"we reconsider these things continuously.\" Immelt said GE had no interest in Smiths' medical operations because the two companies operate in different parts of the medical engineering industry. \u001d  The Smiths CEO said his company remains well placed to make acquisitions worth up to GBP500 million despite plans to return much of the proceeds from the planned sale of its aerospace business to shareholders. \u001d  Smiths' lead financial adviser was Evercore Partners with Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Cazenove acting as joint financial advisers and brokers. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.smiths-group.com \b \u001d  -By Steve McGrath and Rod Stone, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9284; steve.mcgrath@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:46 ET (12:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b3db9bcd2a40557cb48c6dbf9a3569f3","symR":["DWV.LN","GB0002652740"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Lehman Downgrades Derwent Valley To Underweight","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T05:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DWV.LN","GB0002652740"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","RED","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 00:58 ET (05:58 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b41d34548ac97dc21ea14b4b3b93047a","symR":["CNI","CNR.T","CA1363751027"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Canadian National, Union Reach Tentative Agreement >CNI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T15:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CNI","CNR.T","CA1363751027"],"IndustryCodes":["RAI","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  After weeks of \"tough\" bargaining, Canadian Auto Workers union Local 100 and National Council 4000 reached a tentative collective agreement Sunday with Canadian National Railway Co.

Mr. O'Donnell expanded MFC into the United States, setting up Mackenzie Investment Management Inc., which was subsequently taken public. Mr. O'Donnell also moved MFC into the Canadian trust industry with Mackenzie Trust Company. Todd J.

(HVN.AU) Monday said first half sales roses 17%, citing continued demand for flat-panel televisions. \u001d  Chief operating officer John Slack-Smith said despite strong growth in the last few years, market penetration of large-screen televisions in Australian households remains relatively low. \u001d  \"We expect plasma and LCDs to continue to be the lead growth category for the group for the discernible future,\" Slack-Smith told Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  \"We don't think we're anywhere near saturation,\" he said, predicting penetration will exceed 50% compared with the mid-teens nowadays. \u001d  The Sydney-based company has been one of main beneficiaries of consumer demand for new technology, with sales of large-screen televisions, laptops and iPods seemingly unaffected by rises in fuel prices and interest rates. \u001d  Harvey Norman said sales for the six months to Dec. 31 rose 17% to A$2.71 billion from a year ago. Like-for-like store sales increased 7.1%, with growth slowing toward the end of the period after a gain of 8.2% in the first quarter. \u001d  Slack-Smith said the slowing growth was mainly due to timing of its major finance promotion in the first quarter this year, compared with running a similar promotion in the second quarter of the previous fiscal year. \u001d  Shoppers also held out from spending until late in the Christmas period, he said, and a cooler start to summer in the states of New South Wales and Queensland also slowed sales in outdoor furniture and air-conditioners. \u001d  Citigroup said in a recent report that a pickup in demand for furniture, which has been suffering from softer housing activity, should benefit Harvey Norman. \u001d  But Slack-Smith said while there are \"signs of improvement,\" the furniture sector \"still has a way to go\". \u001d  The company has outlets in Australia, New Zealand Slovenia and Ireland. It also operates stores in Singapore and Malaysia through a separate joint venture. \u001d  In November, Harvey Norman agreed to sell its 53% stake in sporting goods retailer Rebel Sport Ltd. (REB.AU) to private equity group Archer Capital. Chairman Gerry Harvey has said some of the A$196 million raised by the sale will be returned to shareholders through an increased dividend. \u001d  Chief financial officer Chris Mentis told Dow Jones Newswires the board is still determining how much will be returned, but it won't be until the second half. \u001d  Slack-Smith wouldn't comment on trading in the third quarter. Analysts expect Harvey Norman to report a net profit of A$239.6 million this financial year, up 20% on fiscal 2006, according to a survey of 11 analysts by Thomson Financial. \b   -By Susan Murdoch, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9671-4393; susan.murdoch@dowjones.com \b   -Edited by Ian Pemberton \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 01:42 ET (06:42 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b85fe65ac74ec90956ede8e48973ddbb","symR":["SGSN.VX","CH0002497458"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"SGS Will Speed Up Identifying Takeover Targets - CEO -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T10:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SGSN.VX","CH0002497458"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC","XDJGI","XISL","XSMI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Kirk said that most of the company's 10 divisions have at least one takeover possibility. \u001d  SGS's recent attempt to buy Germany-based Germanischer Lloyd has failed not because of the price but because Germanischer Loyd has preferred a German solution, Kirk said. \u001d  SGS, which earlier Monday reported a 19.4% rise in 2006 net profit to CHF443 million Swiss francs, ($355.3 million), from CHF371 million,  a year earlier parted ways with former CEO Dan Kerpelman because that executive was considered too wary of acquisitions. \u001d  Kirk reiterated SGS's 2008 targets of CHF5 billion in sales, an operating profit margin of 17%. \u001d  In the past few years, SGS has been rumored to be interested in acquiring Paris-based Bureau Veritas. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sgs.com \b \u001d  -By Martin Gelnar, Dow Jones Newswires; +43 79 821 5617; martin.gelnar@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 05:35 ET (10:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b8df69a6044f638c1545acc88660363e","symR":["12120.FR","IFL.MI","ITRK.LN","SGSN.VX","CH0002497458","FR0000121204","GB0031638363","IT0001353173"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"2nd UPDATE: SGS 06 Net Pft +19%; Remains Vague On Buys","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12120.FR","IFL.MI","ITRK.LN","SGSN.VX","CH0002497458","FR0000121204","GB0031638363","IT0001353173"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","ICS","SVC","XDJGI","XISL","XSMI"],"Story":"\b \u001d   (This updates an article published at 0905 GMT, adding executive comments and fresh share price.) \u001d  By Martin Gelnar \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  GENEVA (Dow Jones)--SGS SA (SGSN.VX), the world's largest goods inspection and quality control company by market capitalization, Monday reported a 19.4% rise in 2006 net profit on continued strong business and the effect of past restructuring moves. \u001d  Geneva-based SGS, which has operations ranging from of goods shipments on behalf of governments to quality checks of China-made consumer goods, said net profit rose to CHF443 million Swiss francs, or around $355.3 million, from CHF371 million in the year-ago period. The result was in line with analyst estimates of CHF444 million. \u001d  Sales in 2006 rose 15.5% to CHF3.82 billion from CHF3.31 billion and earnings before interest and taxes rose 24.3% to CHF624 million from CHF502 million. \u001d  The company didn't provide a specific guidance for 2007 other than saying that \"2007 continues the positive trend experienced in 2006. \u001d  But SGS reiterated its 2008 target of achieving 2008 targets of CHF5 billion in sales, an operating profit margin of 17% and earnings per share of CHF80. In 2006, the operating margin was 16.3% and earnings per share stood at CHF57.89, up 18.5% from the year-earlier period. \u001d  \"The figures are solid but not spectacular\", said Philipp Gamper, an analyst at Bank Sarasin. He said he would keep a neutral rating on the stock with a CHF1,450 price target. \u001d  Scott Weldon, analyst at Bank Vontobel, agreed. He noted that five out of 10 SGS units, among them key operations such as oil, gas & chemical services as well as industrial services, performed well. He said he would maintain a market perform rating, citing a relatively high valuation. \u001d  At 1204 GMT SGS shares were down 0.7%, or CHF9 lower, at CHF1386, in a higher Swiss market. \u001d  At a media conference in Geneva, recently-installed Chief Executive Officer Chris Kirk remained vague on the subject of acquisitions-driven growth, a strategy SGS flagged late last year when it parted ways with former chief executive Dan Kerpelman. \u001d  \"The pipeline is full, but we can also be very successful growing organically.\" said Kirk, who is expected to quicken the pace of acquisitions after former CEO Kerpelman was criticized for slipping up growth growth opportunities. \u001d  Kirk said that most of the company's 10 divisions have at least one takeover possibility. \u001d  In the past few years, SGS has been rumored to be interested in acquiring Paris-based Bureau Veritas, controlled by France-based investment company Wendel Investissement (12120.FR). \u001d  As expected, the company proposed a reduced dividend of CHF20, down from the exceptionally high CHF50 per share paid last year. Expectations for the dividend had ranged between CHF18 to more than CHF30 per share. \u001d  SGS has often stated it plans to play an active role in an industry consolidation, citing the high fragmentation of the market and its financial power. \u001d  SGS's rivals include Bureau Veritas of France, German TUEV and London-based Intertek Group Plc (ITRK.LN). \u001d  SGS shareholders include the German Von Finck family, which owns a 23.7% stake and Ifil Investments SpA (IFL.MI), the Italian Agnelli family holding, which holds 13.2%. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sgs.com \b \u001d  -By Martin Gelnar, Dow Jones Newswires; +43 79 821 5617; martin.gelnar@dowjones.com \u001d  (Goran Mijuk in Zurich contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:06 ET (12:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b8eec5147263c2018abc5a4e50fb6ac6","symR":["TRAD.SK","TWX","SE0001552357","US8873171057","TRAD.SK","TWX","SE0001552357","US8873171057"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Alecta Rejects AOL's SEK215/Shr Offer For TradeDoubler","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T13:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TRAD.SK","TWX","SE0001552357","US8873171057"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","BRD","MED","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 08:36 ET (13:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b925e6a4d74e4278f5e79f6f87db15bc","symR":["ICE","NMX"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ICE-Nybot Merger Closes; Nybot Now ICE Subsidiary","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ICE","NMX"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (This article was originally published Friday) \b \b \b   By Susan Buchanan \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--IntercontinentalExchange and the New York Board of Trade on Friday completed their more-than $1 billion merger, making Nybot a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICE and a for-profit, publicly traded corporation, the exchanges said. \u001d  Fred W. Schoenhut and Terrence F. Martell, two directors of the Nybot board, have joined the ICE board of directors, effective Friday. ICE will operate under the regulatory regimes of the home countries of each exchange. Combined businesses includes Nybot, operating as a U.S. futures exchange under the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and London-based ICE Futures - regulated by the U.K. Financial Services Authority. \u001d  ICE bought Nybot for 10.297 million shares of ICE common stock and $400 million in cash. Proceeds will be distributed to Nybot members by Jan. 29. The acquisition provides ICE with a wholly-owned clearing house. Meanwhile, ICE's global OTC electronic platform will continue to operate as an exempt commercial market under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act. \u001d  Last week, ICE announced that Nybot soft-commodity futures will be listed for trading on ICE's electronic trading platform on Jan. 19. \u001d   \"We are already beginning to leverage our strengths for the benefit of customers and shareholders, setting a new standard within the industry with our diverse product line of futures and over-the-counter offerings. Our commitment to growth, innovation and customer service will play out in continued product offerings and the enhancement of our world-class electronic trading and clearing platforms,\" ICE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey C. Sprecher said. \u001d  Nybot Chairman Frederick W. Schoenhut said: \"As a part of the ICE team, we believe we can make a strong contribution to the group, as well as benefit from ICE's innovations in technology and products to serve a diverse global customer base.\" \u001d  In connection with the acquisition, ICE entered into senior, unsecured credit facilities worth $500 million on Jan. Credit includes a $250 million, five-year floating-rate term loan and a $250 million revolving credit line.  Credit facilities were arranged by Wachovia Bank, National Association and Bank of America, N.A. \u001d   ICE used the proceeds of a $250 million term loan, along with $150 million of cash on hand, to finance the $400 million cash component of the merger. A remaining $250 million capacity available under a revolving credit line can be used by ICE for general purposes. \u001d  Meanwhile, Nybot traders and New York softs-desk managers expressed some trepidation about the upcoming era under ICE management. \u001d  \"The merger's done, and a week from now ICE trading in electronic softs futures starts - which should mean more work for us,\" a coffee-desk manager in New York said. \"ICE's electronic futures will be fungible against open-outcry markets and will allow physical delivery, which our customers need. I expect open-outcry to remain strong, and ICE's electronic open interest to pick up gradually.\" \u001d  \"ICE electronic softs will trade 22 hours a day, and Nymex (New York Mercantile Exchange) electronic-softs futures - which just started - are around the clock,\" he said. \"But I don't expect the electronic softs to be very liquid at night, especially at the beginning. And I doubt our customers are interested in Nymex cash-settled futures.\" \u001d  Other traders expressed concern about the 22-hour market and said softs brokers are expected to lobby ICE soon to shorten electronic trading to about 10 hours a day. \u001d  Meanwhile, New York traders said they heard that Nymex has offered cash incentives to Nymex brokers to encourage them to start trading Nymex softs futures. A Nymex spokeswoman late Friday was unable to confirm that talk. \u001d  -By Susan Buchanan, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5950; susan.buchanan@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b931e3c50518dd8948b6f5c4c5897c53","symR":["MN.T","CA5662191017"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"March Networks Tgt Cut To C$13 From C$28 At Dundee >MN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T21:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MN.T","CA5662191017"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b9820eb2e919a1b52d442559b10347fc","symR":["TSN"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Webcast Alert: Tyson Foods, Inc.

This follows the group's announcement of a significant business disposal, distribution of capital to shareholders, and letter of intent to enter into a joint venture with General Electric Co. (AAA/Stable/A-1+). At the same time, the short-term corporate credit rating was affirmed at 'A-2'. The outlook is stable. \u001d  \"The downgrade principally reflects our view that the sale of the aerospace operations weakens Smiths' business profile,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Leigh Bailey. \"The main negative factors are the group's increased reliance on cyclical industrial businesses and the loss of contribution from a division with a strong competitive position and well-balanced portfolio across civil and defense applications.\" \u001d  Smiths' financial profile is not materially disadvantaged by the transaction and remains an important support to the ratings. The announcement of the Smiths Detection joint venture is rating neutral, although it is positive for growth prospects. Smiths will own 64% of the joint venture and retain management control. \u001d  The sale of the aerospace business is expected to be concluded no later than July 2007 and should realize net proceeds after costs of approximately GBP2.25 billion, including a shareholder return of GBP2.10 billion and retention of the remaining proceeds. After the closing of the transaction, the group's reported net debt levels should reduce by GBP200 million to approximately GBP750 million. The retention of GBP200 million moderates the transaction's negative impact on the capital structure and gives sufficient support to the credit profile to support a satisfactory business profile at the 'BBB+' level. \u001d  Pro forma for the disposal, group sales would decrease by 38% to about GBP2.2 billion in 2006, but the operating margin would improve to 14.7% from 11.7%. Exposure to more cyclical industrial businesses within the specialty engineering division would increase to 47% of revenues from 30%. We consider specialty engineering to have the weakest business risk within the group, reflecting the highly cyclical nature of its end markets. The sale of the aerospace division weakens the business profile, as the group's strong competitive position in the segment was an important positive rating factor was, as was its established presence on a broad range of civil and military aircraft platforms. \u001d  Standard & Poor's considers that Smiths' cash-generative and diverse businesses should continue to perform steadily over the medium term. \u001d  \"The ratings assume that the sale of the aerospace division is concluded in line with the agreed terms outlined in today's announcement,\" Mr. Bailey added. \"Standard & Poor's expects that funds from operations to adjusted debt and adjusted debt to EBITDA will remain at about 40% and below 2x, respectively.\" \u001d  The group has limited flexibility within its current financial profile. The ratings would be pressured if business conditions deteriorated or further shareholder-focused actions caused financial ratios to weaken beyond our expectations. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:02 ET (17:02 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"baf80755e9962d6f018ee52f0e92a893","symR":["12040.FR","FR0000120404"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Accor Buys Company Formed From Dorint Split","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T08:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12040.FR","FR0000120404"],"IndustryCodes":["LOD","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Geraldine Amiel and Digby Larner \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--French hotel and leisure group Accor SA (12040.FR) said over the weekend it will pay EUR127 million to acquire control of a hotel business being created from the split-up of Germany's Dorint AG. \u001d  Accor currently owns a 34% stake in Dorint, which has decided to split the company in two as part of a restructuring plan. \u001d  In an initial step, Accor subscribed to a EUR52 million capital hike, which gave it a controlling stake in the new company which operates 52 upscale and midscale hotels.

The integration enables enterprises to resolve network and security issues quickly and accurately. \b \u001d  \"The combination of Mazu with TippingPoint provides customers with a powerful solution for addressing a multitude of network operations and network security challenges,\" said Paul Brady, CEO, Mazu Networks.  \"While Mazu provides enterprises with a global view of how users, applications, hosts and devices behave on a network, TippingPoint enables a granular enforcement option. Now the market's leading NBA system can work in conjunction with TippingPoint's solutions to greatly improve network and security operations for enterprise customers.\" \b \u001d  Mazu provides continuous global visibility into how users, applications, hosts and devices behave on a network, delivering information on how current activity differs from typical behavior. Users immediately understand who is talking to whom, what applications and services are running, where the traffic is flowing and if there are any meaningful changes that indicate a network issue, security threat or application problem. After identifying an issue, Mazu can now send commands, such as containing infected devices for remediation, to the TippingPoint Security Management System (SMS) for enforcement. Further, with Mazu, TippingPoint's quarantine can move from policy violation alerting to inline policy enforcement. \b \u001d  \"SEM and NMS are limited in the depth of what they provide into event views. NBA systems provide a layer of intelligence of what applications, systems and users are doing inside the network,\" said Chris Liebert, senior analyst, Security Solutions and Services, Yankee Group. \"Their ability to integrate with management and monitoring tools is critical to providing valuable context to alerts in those views.(2)\" \b \u001d  As network environments become more complex and as the number of issues that can jeopardize security and IT operations grow in frequency, sophistication and variation, the need for more intelligent and granular remediation is critical. The intelligence that Mazu provides when it discovers a security or network operations issue combined with TippingPoint's enforcement capabilities enables enterprises to effectively respond to atypical network behavior. \b \u001d  A recent Gartner research report states, \"Network behavior analysis (NBA) can fill the gap left by policy- and signature-based point solutions, such as firewalls, intrusion detection system/intrusion prevention system (IDS/IPS), and security information and event management (SIEM), which may miss threats for which they are not specifically configured to detect. NBA technologies are decision support systems that give visibility to a knowledgeable operator who can interpret, investigate and appropriately respond to a variety of suspicious activities on the network.(3)\" \b \u001d  \"This is an important step in the evolution of enterprise security,\" said Neal Hartsell, vice president of marketing for TippingPoint.  \"Security is getting more complex to administer and manage.  One way to alleviate complexity is to extend the power of our IPS's traffic classification and policy enforcement strength to Network Behavior Analysis systems -- enabling customers to maximize their existing security investments, automate end point security, and reduce the cost and complexity of overall security policy enforcement.\" \b \b    Pricing and Availability \b \u001d  Mazu with the TippingPoint Quarantine functionality is available at no charge to Mazu Networks customers.

(XOM), which operates Cerro Negro, said the Irving, Texas-based firm has no comment yet on the force majeure. \u001d  Ramirez said it reduced Cerro Negro's output by 1.1 million barrels a month, or around 37,000 b/d. \u001d  The remaining three projects - Hamaca, Sincor and Petrozuata - have each been ordered to cut production by 700,000 to 800,000 barrels a month for January, he said. \u001d  Other oil majors involved in the Orinoco include Chevron Corp. (CVX), BP Plc (BP), Total SA (TOT), Statoil ASA (STO) and ConocoPhillips (COP). \b \b      PdVSA To Run Its Crude Through Upgraders \b \u001d  Ramirez said that because the Orinoco projects have cut production, the upgrading refineries that process the tar oil into lighter grades of crude that can be sold abroad, are currently operating at minimum levels. \u001d  To fill the spare processing capacity at the upgraders, Ramirez said PdVSA will begin running its own crude through the facilities, which have never been tested before. \u001d  \"We're doing technical evaluations to see if they run well with this or that (grade of) crude,\" Ramirez said. \u001d  Venezuela last year announced it was going to take majority stakes in all the Orinoco projects, but failed to reach an agreement with its partners. For this reason, Ramirez said negotiations have ended and the government will approve a new business structure for the four joint ventures by decree. \b \u001d  -By Peter Millard, Dow Jones Newswires; +58-212-564-1339; peter.millard@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 17:27 ET (22:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bd7dc942bc82692769190ee4d0325922","symR":["NOVO-B.KO","NVO","DK0010280817"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Novo Nordisk: Small Molecule Projects To Be Out-Licensed","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T09:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NOVO-B.KO","NVO","DK0010280817"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XISL","XKFX","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 04:08 ET (09:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bdcfb8dea2836bfa2b347266e6242355","symR":["CS.T","CA14068G1046"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Capstone Mining 1Q EPS C$0.15 Vs Loss C$0.01 >CS.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T22:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CS.T","CA14068G1046"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 17:05 ET (22:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bddf23d0996a68558e6ef2ba4a93167f","symR":["7327.FR","FR0000073272"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Safran: Irregular Accounting Could Cut 06 Rev By EUR40M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T20:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["7327.FR","FR0000073272"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XENX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 15:02 ET (20:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"be022a016003807a67b4448150809758","symR":["GE","SMIN.LN","GB0008182700","US3696041033"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"S&PBulletin: General Electric Rtg Unchanged By Smiths Purchase>GE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T17:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GE","SMIN.LN","GB0008182700","US3696041033"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","IDD","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:01 ET (17:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"be34cc21cd2f58089c1e476765cee2aa","symR":["SVM.T","CA82835P1036"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Silvercorp Acquires Sixty Percent Interest In The HPG Gold-Silver-Lead Property, Henan, China>SVM.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SVM.T","CA82835P1036"],"IndustryCodes":["PCS","PPM","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\b   VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(CCNMatthews - Jan. 15, 2007) - Silvercorp Metals Inc. (\"Silvercorp\") (TSX:SVM) is pleased to announce that it has received all necessary government approvals, including approval from the Ministry of Commerce of China, to form a joint venture company to explore and develop the HPG gold-silver-lead property. The HPG property consists of two adjacent mining licenses surrounded by one exploration permit of approximately 6.4 square kilometres in total within the Ying Silver Project area in Henan, and a 200 tonne per day flotation mill and associated facilities. The business license for the joint venture company, Henan Huawei Mining Co. Ltd. (Huawei) has been issued. Silvercorp has made all required payments to the vendor and has contributed the required investment to Huawei, to earn a 60% interest in Huawei, which is the operator and 100% interest holder of HPG properties. Transfer of the mining licenses and exploration permit from the vender to the Huawei is currently in process. The acquisition of the HPG property is an important step in consolidating and adding to the mining cash flow and mineral resources of the Ying silver project area. \b \bThe HPG permit areas are considered to be the extension of the Silvercorp's Ying property and show similar geology to the Ying property. About twenty mineralized gold-silver-lead veins were identified in the HPG properties, however only two veins, H15 and H17, which have lengths of approximately of 1400 metres and 2700 metre respectively, were targets of exploration and mining activities. The mining activities were carried out on 720-metre, 570-metre, 540-metre, 420-metre and 380-metre levels, and exploration was on 698-metre, 630-metre, 500-metre, 460-metre, 380-metre, 360-metre and 340-metre levels for H15 and H17 veins, focusing only on 700 metre long sections for both veins. The underground workings above the 420-metre level are used to explore and mine H15 vein, and tunnels below the 500-metre level are used to explore and mine the H17 vein, which has not been explored above the 500-metre level. \b \bSilvercorp is reviewing the current operating situation and has planned an extensive exploration and mining program. The mining production will first be revived by early March 2007. Meanwhile, several levels of drift tunnels will be developed along the H15 and H17 vein and a series of cross-cut tunnels will be developed to explore other known veins. In order to increase the hoisting capacity and improve ventilation for mining on the H15 and H17 veins, a 120 metre deep vertical shaft is also planned from the 340-metre level to 460-metre level where the main decline can access the surface at 600-metre elevation. Currently, the existing 200 tonnes per day flotation mill recovers silver, gold and lead. Additional flotation cells will be added to recover zinc and copper which have been assayed as high as 7.84% zinc and 1.044% copper in the H17 vein on the 380-metre level. \b \bMyles Gao, P.Geo, is Silvercorp's Qualified Person on the project under NI 43-101. \b \bSILVERCORP METALS INC. \b \bStatements in this press release other than purely historical information, including statements relating to the Company's future plans and objectives or expected results, constitute forward-looking statements.

The scandal ended up costing HP Chairman Patricia Dunn her job. \u001d  The new law establishes fines and sentences of up to 10 years for those who attempt to gain access to individual phone records from telephone service providers. It also establishes harsh penalties for employees at telephone companies who share this confidential information. \u001d  The fact the bill was signed into law by the President was welcomed by privacy rights groups, but they pledged to continue campaigning to protect individuals' privacy. \u001d  \"The bill is a good first step, but it only applies to telephone records,\" said Edmund Mierzwinski of the consumer advocacy group U.S. Public Interest Groups. \"This closes one window where pretexting was used, but it doesn't close the door to all forms of the practice.\" \u001d  Telephone records could be used by private detectives to track people, by telephone marketers to find information about individuals' calling patterns, or by those seeking to commit fraud by obtaining information about people's spending habits. \u001d  The bill was initially backed by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who was the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in the last Congress. \u001d  It was the narrower of two similar bills. Another effort, which emerged from the House Commerce Committee, would have imposed stiff penalties on other forms of pretexting as well. \u001d  The Federal Communications Commission, the regulator for the telecommunications industry, is currently attempting to strengthen its rules in the area of pretexting as well. \u001d  FCC Chairman Kevin Martin is known to view the need to reform current regulations as a priority and has put a series of proposals to the other four Commissioners. \u001d  The proposals are expected to receive the backing of a majority of those commissioners. \u001d  -By Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires; (202) 862 6637; corey.boles@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:31 ET (12:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf4772c114bf3f209c4eda026fab4ad5","symR":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"RBC Capital Markets Appoints David Watt As Senior FX Strategist>RY","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 09:04 ET (14:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf629ab51083953df3226f5f60be924a","symR":["12537.FR","ETL.LN","FR0000125379","GB0003168936"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"French Court Approves Eurotunnel Safeguard Plan","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T08:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12537.FR","ETL.LN","FR0000125379","GB0003168936"],"IndustryCodes":["RAI"],"Story":"\b \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 03:40 ET (08:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf89170aa66b6fb28c93e3b32c99467e","symR":["35493.AE","OCENY","NL0000354934"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Oce 4Q 06 Net Pft Drops But Pleases Investors","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T09:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["35493.AE","OCENY","NL0000354934"],"IndustryCodes":["OFF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Updates an item published at 0704 GMT, adding background, CEO comments and from analysts, and share price activity) \u001d  By Mathijs Schiffers \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--Oce NV (OCENY), the Dutch producer of copying and printing machines, Monday reported a 48.7% fall in fourth quarter net profit from the previous year but the company met its full year guidance for operating income. \u001d  The previous year's figure was boosted by a pension gain, while Oce suffered in the fiscal year 2006, that ended at Nov. 30, from fierce price pressure and disappointing sales development due to a shortage of components in the third quarter of the year. \u001d  Part of this setback during the third quarter was compensated by a strong performance in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Rokus van Iperen told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. \"In the fourth quarter we also benefitted from a better product mix and lower cost price due to transportation of production to Asia.\" \u001d  At 0915 GMT, Oce shares are up 2.9%, or EUR0.37, at EUR13.01 in higher market. \u001d  Oce's net profit in the three months to Nov. 30 was EUR26.7 million from EUR52.1 million. Sales were up 8.8% to EUR832.1 million from EUR764.4 million, boosted by the contribution of U.S.-based peer Imagistics, which Oce acquired in Nov. 2005. \u001d  Oce's full year sales came in at EUR3.11 billion, a rise of 16.2% from sales of EUR2.68 billion in the fiscal year 2006. However, excluding acquisition and exchange rate effects, the sales increase was only 0.3% year on year. \u001d  The figures are provisional and unaudited, Oce said. \u001d  CEO Van Iperen admits that organic sales growth disappointed in 2006, mainly due to a weak performance in the third quarter of the year. Van Iperen said that the company is targeting a pickup in sales growth in 2007. \u001d  \"Sales growth is oxygen in this very competitive market,\" Van Ipereren said, adding that he expects \"the market to remain competitive in 2007\" \u001d  To sustain profitability in this competitive environment, Oce is launching a cost-savings program which \"should lead to cost savings of EUR75 million to EUR100 million over a period of four years,\" he said. \u001d  Van Iperen didn't rule out that the program could bring job cuts: \"It's too early to get into details, but I can't exclude job cuts,\" he said. \u001d  Analysts had expected net profit to come in at EUR20.8 million on sales of EUR838 million and they call the figures in general better than expected, although sales came in below their estimates. However, they remain skeptical on the long-termn prospects for Oce. \u001d  \"The long term picture remains difficult, Van Lanschot's Marc Kennis said. Kennis rates shares at hold. \u001d  Oce's fourth-quarter operating income before interest and taxes, or EBIT, came in at EUR43.8 million, from EUR70.6 million a year ago. That brings Oce's full year EBIT at EUR102.2 million, while the company guided for a full year EBIT of around EUR90 million. \u001d  The Venlo, Netherlands-based company, whose main competitors are U.S.-based Xerox Corp.

(F) plant in western Germany. \u001d  \"There will be many more major protests to follow, especially in the period between Jan. 21-22, and Jan. 30,\" an IG Metall spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  The spokesman confirmed information obtained earlier by Dow Jones that a series of major plants in the auto, metal and electric industry will be affected by one-day protests. \u001d  IG Metall said the demonstrations are a protest against a higher statutory retirement age, which will be gradually raised to 67 from 65. \u001d  \"We are mainly concerned about metal workers, such as steel workers, who do a hard physical job and can't go on working till 67,\" an IG Metall delegate told Dow Jones Newswires, adding \"this seems unfair in a country where young people can't find a job.\" \u001d  Shortly ahead of collective bargaining in the metal and electronics sector, the demonstrations are also signal to employers. \u001d  IG Metall's regional branch in Voelklingen announced it will hold a demonstration affecting Ford's German plants as well as 16 other plants near Saarlouis. \u001d  The union ruled out that demonstrations would hit any of ThyssenKrupp AG's (TKA.XE) steel plants tomorrow. \u001d  In a reaction, employers' association Gesamtmetall, the union's social partner in the wage bargaining process, said the plants aren't the right place for political protest. \u001d  Politically motivated strikes are illegal in Germany. \u001d  \"We don't expect the demonstrations to turn into a strike.

(NASDAQ: PLXT), the leading global supplier of PCI Express(R) (PCIe(R)) I/O interconnect solutions, expanded its industry-dominant portfolio by delivering three new switches to market, now bringing to 13 the number of PLX PCIe products available today, the majority of which are in full production. Raising the bar on the standards it set last round, these latest devices push PCI Express technology forward with PLX's third-generation PCIe switching architecture featuring 110ns latency, the lowest power consumption, flexible port configurations up to x16, true peer-to-peer support and superior performance -- all aspects coveted by makers of server, storage, communications, embedded and graphics systems. \b \u001d  Shipping today in pre-production, the PLX(R) ExpressLane(TM) PEX 8525 (24 lanes, 5 ports), PEX 8533 (32 lanes, 6 ports), and PEX 8547 (48 lanes, 3 ports) join the recently introduced PEX 8548 (48 lanes, 9 ports) as next-generation PCI Express switches based on PLX's established architecture allowing designers immediate access to proven PCIe technology. Dynamic memory allocation, large packet memory, and non-blocking internal switch architecture allow a full line-rate on all ports for performance-hungry applications. These switches have all successfully completed the rigorous PCI Express Base Specification, Revision 1.1 testing procedures and are on the PCI-SIG integrators list. \b \u001d  The switches feature PLX's latest Cut-Thru architecture, which attributes to dropping latency down to an unrivaled 110ns in both host centric and peer-to-peer modes, thereby dramatically increasing the throughput in bandwidth-demanding applications. These switches consume the lowest power in the industry at 100mW per lane. This power can be further reduced through the on-chip programmable SerDes which can also be turned off when unused. Dual-Host designs are implemented via a standard PCI Express \"crosslink\" feature and PLX's moveable upstream port. Highly flexible ports from x1 to x16 allow numerous configurations as either upstream or downstream, while some ports feature a Hot-Plug controller allowing field upgrades without burdening the design with costly external components. White papers discussing these key parameters are available on the PLX Website. \b \u001d  \"PCI Express technology provides the industry standard attach point to Intel chipsets within our server platforms,\" said Hement Dhulla, General Manager of Intel's Enterprise Chipset Strategy. \"PLX's switch products offer the industry more flexibility in solution design. We look forward to working with PLX on continued delivery of PCI Express enabled enterprise solutions.\" \b \u001d  \"This new launch is another example of how PLX has been at the forefront in the development of PCI Express switch solutions,\" said David Raun, PLX vice president of marketing. \"We have distinguished our products with proven third-generation architectures and the industry's broadest line of devices and features. In parallel, our team has already begun development toward the PCI Express 2.0 specification, which doubles the line-rate of each lane to five gigabits per second.\" \b \u001d  PLX's 13 PCI Express switches and bridges provide board and system designers with the most extensive and proven lineup of products to address their variety of requirements. The company's PCIe switches range in density from four to nine ports and from eight to 48 lanes, while the PCIe bridges provide PCI, PCI-X and local-bus support. \b \b   Pricing, Availability \b \u001d  The three new switches are all available today and will be production-released in February 2007. Volume quantity pricing are $35 for the PEX 8525, $45 for the PEX 8533 and $55 for the PEX 8547. All PLX PCI Express products are fully supported with a Rapid Development Kit (RDK) family of hardware and Microsoft(R) Vista(TM)-ready software tools to accelerate design cycles.

The program will include questions from listeners on the role of the Functional Anaesthetic Discography(TM) Procedure in diagnosing the source of low back pain. \b \u001d  During the show, Dr. Sandhu will discuss the importance of correct diagnosis of the source of back pain prior to recommending a patient's treatment plan. Despite advances in treatment of back pain ranging from physical therapy and rehabilitation to spine surgery, the ability to simply understand the underlying source of low back pain remains of critical importance. With a minimally invasive test known as Functional Anaesthetic Discography(TM) (F.A.D.(TM)), additional diagnostic information may complement the physical exam, history and the patient characteristics, enabling physicians to better assess which treatment options may be appropriate for a patient. \b \u001d  The program will air live at 6:00 p.m. Central Time on Monday, January 15, 2007 and can be accessed at www.wrmn1410.com. A replay of the program will be available on Wednesday, January 17 at 8:00 p.m. Central Time and on Friday, January 19 at 6:00 p.m. Central Time. Repeat broadcasts will also available at www.healthradionetwork.com. \b \b    About the Functional Anaesthetic Discography(TM) Procedure \b \u001d  The F.A.D. procedure is a minimally invasive test for diagnosing the source of low back pain. The test is performed in the spinal discs that are suspected of causing pain. Under X-ray guidance and light sedation, a small device called the Discyphor(TM) Catheter is inserted into each of the suspected discs and anchored in place with a tiny balloon. Upon recovering from the sedation, the patient recreates his or her back pain by performing the activities that usually cause back pain. A small amount of local anaesthetic is then injected through the Discyphor(TM) Catheter into the patient's discs, one disc at a time and the patient again performs the activities that usually cause back pain. If the injection into a specific disc relieves the patient's back pain, the disc can be further evaluated for potential treatment. If the test does not relieve the patient's pain, the clinician is able to determine that the pain might be caused by a different disc or other condition altogether. \b \b    About Kyphon Inc. \b \u001d  Kyphon develops and markets medical devices designed to restore spinal function and diagnose low back pain using minimally invasive technologies.

Thus far, a total of 98 drillholes have been completed in the Patricia deposit with a further 21 drill holes in other deposits. Assay values for 17 of these drill holes have been received and assay results from 49 drill holes are pending and are expected by the end of January 2007 with samples for the balance of the holes drilled to date undergoing sample preparation on site. \u001d  The Bakouma Uranium Project consists of ten documented uranium deposits in close proximity to one another. A review of the studies conducted by Compagnie des Mines d'Uranium de Bakouma and Societe de l'Uranium Centrafricain between 1969 and 1977 reveals an exploration target in excess of 18,000 tonnes (41 million lbs) of U3O8 at an average grade in excess of 0.27% U3O8 containing an estimated 18,000 tonnes (41 million lbs) of U3O8. \u001d  The aforementioned historic estimates do not comply with NI 43-101 standards and should not be relied on as they do not use mineral category definitions used in codes recognized by NI 43-101. Current drilling is focused primarily on delineating the uranium mineralisation that was previously identified by these studies for the Patricia Uranium Deposit, which has a historically reported target of 8,000 tonnes U3O8. \u001d  Assay results for the first 17 of the Patricia drill holes have indicated U3O8 values ranging between 0.14% (over 33 meter composite width) to 0.41% (over 6 meter composite width). Within these composited intervals individual samples, representing vertical intersection widths of 1 meter, range in grade from 0.01% to as high as 2.1% U3O8. These results confirm the occurrence of uranium mineralisation at grades and widths similar to that documented by the previous studies. \u001d  In the current drilling program uranium mineralisation has been intersected from depths below surface ranging from 8 meters to 50 meters extending down to 105 meters (the maximum depth for the results of the drilling thus far) where the mineralisation is open ended in 8 of the 24 holes reported. UraMin intends to test this depth extension by deepening certain of the drill holes. \u001d  Historical information indicates that the maximum drill depth achieved on the Patricia deposit was 107 meters. UraMin has improved this and is consistently reaching depths below 100 meters and extending as deep as 130 meters below surface where indications of the presence of mineralisation, as determined by hand held total gamma scintillation counters, exists in these deeper intersections. These are to be confirmed by XRF assay shortly. \u001d  The current 15,000 meter drill programme on Patricia is designed to drill the deposit on 50 meter centers. Modeling of this deposit is underway and it is planned to complete a NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource inventory by the end of March 2007. \u001d  Drilling will continue to focus on the Bakouma area to delineate a further target of 8,000 tonnes U3O8 at the Pato and Pama deposits by mid 2007. In addition, delineation of uranium mineralisation on a further seven historically reported deposits will continue in 2007. \u001d  Ian Stalker, Chief Executive of UraMin, said: \u001d  \"Initial exploration results for the Patricia deposit at Bakouma have exceeded expectations. This work confirms the potential for resources to be delineated close to the surface making them amenable to extraction using open pit mining methods. Furthermore the open ended mineralisation and high grade intervals identified thus far could result in the historical resource target of 18,000 tonnes U3O8 being exceeded. \u001d  We believe that the previous work done on the project in the late 1970's, will allow the Company to fast track the preparation of its own feasibility study, including confirmation drilling and possible strike extensions. The partnership formed with the Government of the CAR and its interest in the project will greatly facilitate its development and benefit the Bakouma region.\" \u001d  Mr. G M Greenway, Pr.Sci.Nat. (SACNASP), MSAIMM, Divisional Manager of Snowden Mining Industry Consultants, is the qualified person responsible for the Bakouma drilling program and has verified the data reported above. Mr Greenway is a consultant to UraMin, with no interest in the company and has consented to the inclusion in this announcement of his name in the form and context in which it appears.

strengthen \u001d  national grocery retailer's compliance efforts, customer service \bST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2007-- \u001d  The latest Lawson Software (Nasdaq:LWSN) applications and technology platform are helping Unified Western Grocers, Inc. optimize business processes and enhance security. A Lawson customer since 1996, Unified completed its migration from Lawson 7.1 to Lawson System Foundation 9.0 in mid 2006. Since that time, the company has completed implementation of the Lawson Human Capital Management and Enterprise Financial Management suites to meet government compliance requirements and improve service for its growing base of independent retail grocery stores. \b \u001d  Based in Commerce, Calif., Unified is a retailer-owned wholesale grocery cooperative that supplies 2,500 independent retailer grocery stores throughout the Western United States. Unified and its subsidiaries offer independent retailers all the resources they need to compete in today's supermarket industry. Unified has approximately 3,300 employees. \b \u001d  In November 2005, Unified realized it needed to update its existing business processes to comply with government regulations. After evaluating several options, Unified decided to upgrade its existing Lawson business system to accommodate the organization's evolving business needs. Lawson's flexible architecture enabled Unified to complete the entire upgrade process in nine months. \b \u001d  \"The Lawson Professional Services team proved to be a dedicated partner throughout the entire process, enabling us to successfully complete the implementation with minimal downtime,\" said Rick Lockwood, director, system support services, Unified Western Grocers. \"And the new Lawson applications and technology platform are helping us streamline our administrative and compliance processes while retaining the simplicity of an integrated business system.\" \b \u001d  The Unified project team established processes and procedures to guide the system implementation and end-user training. First, the Lawson Professional Services team met with the project team leaders to provide an initial system overview. The leaders of the Unified project team then met with key employees for a formal training session. In addition to coordinated communication between the Unified project team and the Lawson Professional Services team, Unified employed both a test and developer environment during the system rollout. This approach enabled power users to experiment with the system as it was being implemented, helping to improve end-user acceptance of the new functionality once the system was live. \b \u001d  The Lawson Enterprise Financial Management suite will help Unified streamline and track key financial data. In addition, this upgrade establishes the foundation for future implementations of Lawson Accounts Payable and Lawson Procurement, which are expected to generate significant process improvements and staff savings. And, the Lawson Human Capital Management suite has enabled the grocery chain to reinvent the way it administers core Human Resource functions. For example, Unified is in the process of integrating a third-party, Web-based, document management application, ImageNow, into its Lawson system. This system integration and consolidation was a key goal for Unified's Human Resources team. \b \u001d  Lawson System Foundation 9.0 (LSF 9) features the latest technology from Lawson combined with other world-class technologies, for a high-performance, standards-based technology solution. The highly secure and solid foundation provides a platform for Lawson's next-generation applications designed for use within a service-oriented architecture (SOA). In addition, by separating the technical foundation from the application layer, Lawson enables Unified to upgrade its enterprise applications and technology independently. \b \u001d  \"Faced with increasingly thin margins, grocery retailers need comprehensive business solutions that help them reduce operational costs so they can focus on improving the customer shopping experience,\" said Michelle Schooff, industry marketing director, Retail, Lawson Software. \"Our simple, proven software and deep industry expertise help Unified and its member retailers enhance business performance and reduce costs faster and with less risk than other ERP vendors.\" \b \u001d  Lawson's industry-focused software solutions help retailers integrate the systems they use to run and grow their businesses. Lawson has more than 350 retail customers worldwide. Specifically, customers include 10 of the top 25 specialty retailers, seven of the top 25 grocery chains, eight of the top 25 global retailers, six of the top 25 food service chains and eight of the top 30 U.S. convenience store companies. \b \b   About Lawson Software \b \u001d  Lawson Software provides software and service solutions to 4,000 customers in manufacturing, distribution, maintenance and service sector industries across 40 countries. Lawson's solutions include Enterprise Performance Management, Supply Chain Management, Enterprise Resource Planning, Customer Relationship Management, Manufacturing Resource Planning, Enterprise Asset Management and industry-tailored applications.

But the government, he said, will take a closer look at them later on. \u001d  The electricity sector nationalization will mean the government will take over AES's entire stake but will let workers keep their shares. \u001d  \"We will take 100% of that stake\" that AES controls, Ramirez said. \u001d  Venezuela's Chavez has said the latest nationalization move is another step needed to move the country towards a socialist system. \u001d  -By Peter Millard; Dow Jones Newswires; +58-212-564-1339; peter.millard@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:16 ET (17:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c9e299126ebdee6ba74b87ea1d45f228","symR":["RS.T","RSSYF","CA76111T1021"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Resin Systems Completes C$5.0 Million Financing>RS.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RS.T","RSSYF","CA76111T1021"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS"],"Story":"\bCALGARY, Jan. 15 /CNW/ - Resin Systems Inc.

(Nasdaq: PLCM), the world's leading provider of unified collaborative communications solutions, today announced new high definition telepresence solutions that enable people working at a distance to communicate as if they were all in the same room. The Polycom RealPresence(TM) Experience High Definition (RPX(TM) HD) telepresence solutions provide an immersive collaboration experience unlike any other with unique features, including full eight or 16-foot HD cinematic views, Siren(TM) 22 kHz StereoSurround high definition sound, and EyeConnect(TM) technology that puts the camera at eye level for more natural face-to-face interaction. Polycom's standards-based HDX(TM) 9000 high definition video systems are at the core of the RPX HD, making it the only telepresence solution able to call the million-plus video systems already deployed on desktops and in conference rooms worldwide. The Polycom RPX HD solutions also deliver the finest detail and nuance of expression in voice, video and content -- all over lower bandwidths. \b \b    (Photo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20070115/SFM017 ) \b \u001d  RPX HD solutions provide intimate and effective communication and collaboration with enhanced clarity. RPX HD telepresence solutions are ideal for business applications where the details are important, including merger and acquisition negotiations, executive management of internal teams and outsourced vendors, hiring and training, customer and partner negotiations, research and development activities, etc. High definition telepresence is valuable to a wide range of industries, including education, healthcare/medicine, judicial, financial services and government. \b \u001d  \"Walking into an RPX HD telepresence room is like being instantly transported to another location -- the experience and collaboration capabilities are second to none,\" said Robert Hagerty, chairman and CEO at Polycom. \"Polycom RPX HD systems erase the distances between teams, making them highly efficient and productive. Polycom RPX HD provides video conferencing customers with an interoperable telepresence solution that uses bandwidth efficiently, adds value to their existing investments, and a solution that can call the million other video conferencing systems in use today.\" \b \u001d  \"Business relationships are increasingly global, but a workforce trapped on a plane is neither cost effective nor productive. The goal of telepresence is to create a sensory experience that communicates the full range of human interactions in a live meeting, which can address some of these challenges,\" said Nora Freedman, senior research analyst of enterprise networking at IDC. \"Vendors can influence the value of telepresence solutions with HD technology and by enabling interoperability with traditional conference room and desktop video conferencing solutions.\" \b \b    The Most Life-Like Remote Meeting Experience Available \b \u001d  Polycom RPX HD telepresence solutions provide a \"same room\" meeting experience just like being there where remote participants are lifelike in size and audio and visual clarity. The RPX HD family of solutions comes in six variations accommodating four to 28 people. Each room is symmetrically designed and offers immersive collaboration where everyone can be seen and heard. \b \b    * Unrivaled cinematic views \b \u001d  While other telepresence solutions feature multiple 16:9 displays that appear as letterbox \"windows\" into another room, Polycom solutions feature large, integrated, and contoured video walls (eight feet or 16 feet wide) with seamless transitions. These walls deliver full cinematic views of the other room with up to a 48:9 continuous image which span the screens in true 720p HD resolution (up to 3840 x 720 at 30fps). This unique video experience is enhanced by a holistic room design in which Polycom technology blends the images from multiple HD cameras to create a single view. The miniature HD cameras (3 CCD) are strategically embedded in the screens using EyeConnect technology, a unique feature that allows people to look directly at the person they are speaking to for more natural interaction. \b \b    * High definition surround sound quality \b \u001d  Polycom RPX HD telepresence solutions also feature immersive sound enabled through integrated ceiling microphones, acoustic wall paneling, high- fidelity stereo equipment and Polycom Siren22 (22kHz) StereoSurround sound technology, which delivers Polycom patented high definition sound quality in stereo for people speaking as well as for shared content that includes audio. With StereoSurround sound, when people on one side of an RPX speak, the sound replicates their position in the room, just as it would in real life, to the receiving suite. \b \b    * High resolution content sharing through personal monitors \b \u001d  Also unique to the Polycom RPX HD solutions is the ability to send and receive all types of multimedia content in high resolution, as well as simultaneously sending both that content and video of the people in the room. Content is shared through personal content monitors integrated into the tables in the room, which allow each participant to view and share computer content with other participants in the meeting. \b \b    * Unmatched flexibility through Polycom UltimateHD(TM) \b \u001d  Polycom RPX HD solutions are based on the Polycom UltimateHD architecture which is the standards-based foundation for the industry's only integrated and complete HD video collaboration offering, including video systems, video multipoint control units (MCU), HD recording, streaming and playback systems (for both video and content), integrated Polycom HD Voice endpoints, and related HD services. The Polycom UltimateHD architecture gives customers the quality, scalability, backwards compatibility and end-to-end integration they require. \b \b    * 24/7 hosted services \b \u001d  Polycom also offers RPX HD services in conjunction with its certified channel partners. Those services include RPX HD Video Network Operations Centers (VNOC), installation and maintenance services. The RPX HD VNOC provides a complete hosted management of a customer's RPX HD solution via a staff of telepresence experts. This concierge-level service includes complete call scheduling and suite reservation services, call management (including unlimited customer RPX to RPX multipoint calls), remote monitoring, and monthly reporting. The service ensures that a customer's telepresence meetings are always connected on time and the technology is transparent to participants. \b \b    Pricing and Availability \b \u001d  Polycom RPX HD rooms come fully equipped with technology, equipment and furniture. They are available for order today in North America, Europe, CALA and select Asia Pacific countries through qualified Polycom channel partners worldwide. Complete room solution pricing starts at US$299,000 for a Polycom RPX HD 204. \b \b    About Polycom \b \u001d  Polycom, Inc. is the worldwide leader in unified collaborative communications (UCC) that maximize the efficiency and productivity of people and organizations by integrating the broadest array of video, voice, data and Web solutions to deliver the ultimate communications experience.

But the loan would speed up the payment process. \u001d  Saudi Oger Group owns 60% of Oger Telecom, while Telecom Italia has a 10% stake in the company. Other investors include Arab Bank and Bank of Sharjah. \u001d  Oger Telecom canceled its initial public offering via lead managers ABN Amro and Citigroup in November 2006 as regional stock markets had plummeted in the weeks leading up to pricing. \u001d  -By Majdoline Hatoum, Dow Jones Newswires; +9714-223-1134; majdoline.hatoum@dowjones.com \u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 04:11 ET (09:11 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d0fea71f46f43f3caa2e04142905b611","symR":["WGOV"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Woodward Schedules First Fiscal Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T16:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WGOV"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\bFORT COLLINS, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2007-- \u001d  Woodward Governor Company (Nasdaq: WGOV) announced today it expects to report its first fiscal quarter earnings at approximately 8:00 p.m. MT on Monday, January 22, 2007.

A strong Euro translates to higher prices on land, but on board a Windstar ship, guests visit charming European ports daily with rates paid in U.S. dollars. \b \u001d  \"By booking a European cruise with Windstar, guests are locking in today's prices at a time when the Euro is gaining strength against the dollar,\" says Diane Moore, Windstar's vice president of marketing and sales.  \"Also, if comparing the cost of a land-based vacation with expensive hotels, meals and transportation between cities -- a cruise provides significant savings by offering one package with one price paid in U.S. dollars.\" \b \u001d  Windstar's fleet of three sailing ships are in Europe from April through November. The 312-guest Wind Surf sails seven-day cruises in the Western Mediterranean from Lisbon, along the coast of Spain, France and Italy to its easternmost port of Venice.  The 148-guest Wind Star and Wind Spirit spend most of the season sailing in the Greek Isles with a few Mediterranean cruises in April and November. \b \u001d  Homeports for the Wind Surf include Lisbon, Barcelona, Rome, Nice, Venice and Monte Carlo.  A new seven-day itinerary from Rome to Venice visits picturesque harbors of Amalfi, Italy; Taormina, Sicily; Corfu, Greece; and Dubrovnik and Hvar, Croatia.  On the reverse, from Venice to Rome, the Wind Surf visits Dubrovnik and Korcula, Croatia; Corfu, Greece; and Messina and Sorrento, Italy. \b \u001d  Guests seeking longer vacations in Europe may opt for a cruise from Windstar's \"Connoisseur Collection,\" a selection of seven-day cruises ideal for booking back-to-back for a longer voyage.  Wind Surf's itineraries have been coordinated for a seamless 14-day voyage without repeating ports. \b \u001d  Guests booking back-to-back receive 5-10% off the total cost of the cruise depending on date and itinerary. Prices for a fourteen-day European cruise aboard the Wind Surf begin at $4,309 per person, based on double occupancy. On May 28, a 13-day cruise roundtrip from Nice starts at $3,499 per person, based on double occupancy. \b \u001d  On board the ship, guests enjoy many complimentary amenities found only at high-priced luxury hotels.  Gourmet cuisine created by acclaimed Chef Joachim Splichal is served in The Restaurant and in Wind Surf's alternative restaurant Degrees.  Luxury bedding and mattresses ensure a premium resting spot after the day's excitement.  Shea butter bath amenities by L'Occitane and Egyptian cotton towels are in all bathrooms.  Also found in suites and staterooms are flatscreen televisions, DVD/CD players, Bose SoundDock speakers for docking mp3 players, waffle terry spa robes and slippers.  Complimentary activities include water sports -- water-skiing, snorkeling, sailing, kayaking, ski-tubing, wind surfing -- fitness center, nightly port talks by the ship's host, Captain's reception, tea time at 4pm, relaxing in the hot tub, lazing in hammocks on deck and lounging by the pool. \b \u001d  Windstar recently announced a multi-million dollar investment in all three ships to add even more luxury amenities on board and update public spaces and staterooms.  The Wind Surf was the first ship to be completed in December 2006.  Highlights include two new luxury Bridge Suites, remodeled bathrooms in all suites and staterooms, and The Yacht Club-the new social hub of the ship with an espresso bar, comfortable seating, computers and Internet.  The Wind Spirit renovations will be completed prior to the European season in spring 2007, with the Wind Star following in fall 2007. \b \b    About Windstar Cruises \b \u001d  Seattle-based Windstar Cruises operates three sailing yachts known for their pampering without pretense and their ability to visit the hidden harbors and secluded coves of the world's most treasured destinations.

Based on the same hardware architecture as its fault tolerant server predecessor, the single-socket 320Ma's affordable starting price of $11,999 provides the operational simplicity and functionality that many small- or medium-sized businesses desire without sacrificing the high quality standard NEC is known to offer. \b \u001d  \"The introduction of the single-socket 320Ma ft server proves our commitment to providing a wide range of solutions that meet the demanding needs of various computing environments,\" said Matthew Wolken, vice president, Fault Tolerant Server and Enterprise Storage of NEC Corporation of America. \"Our latest offering is easy to operate and maintain without the cluster system training requirement, and it provides high-performance and reliability at an affordable price point.\" \b \u001d  \"Small- and medium-sized businesses have limited IT resources and IT skill-sets, compared with large enterprises,\" said Jean S. Bozman, vice president in IDC's Global Enterprise Server Solutions group. \"NEC is addressing this skill-set shortage by reducing the time and cost associated with deploying a high-availability solution for mission-critical applications and data. The price-point of this entry-level server will bring a fully fault tolerant solution, with uninterrupted data service, to SMB sites that could not have afforded it before.\" \b \u001d  The single-socket 320Ma's simplicity reduces the set-up, operation and recovery process complexities that many cluster systems possess. Easy administration and configuration only add to the value this latest edition has to offer by using a single-system-view. With full hardware redundancy, its continuous availability is automatic and transparent to the user without the loss of transactions; reducing the management time required by a full IT staff and lowering the total cost of ownership. Furthermore, unlike clustering systems, its single operating system (OS) and application license provide yet another cost saving benefit for enterprise customers. The competitive price is ideal for remote offices requiring unwavering accessibility such as manufacturing, access control, distribution hubs, financial institutions, and retail stores. The entry-level NEC fault tolerant server supports Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 2003 Enterprise Edition R2, Red Hat(R) Enterprise Linux(R) AS4, and up to 8 GB of memory. \b \u001d  The award-winning, third-generation NEC fault tolerant series of servers is renowned for its unparalleled enterprise-class system integrity and equipped with fully redundant components to deliver up to 99.999% continuous uptime. This innovative solution is ideal for small- or medium-sized businesses and distributed environments of large enterprise that have demanding, mission critical applications where even small amounts of downtime can seriously impact the company. By avoiding costly downtime, the overall total cost of ownership is substantially reduced by minimizing the time and expense required for a full IT staff to achieve high availability. Introduced in 2001, these servers are enabled with dual hyper-threading Intel(R) Xeon(R) processors, where data instructions are handled in parallel instead of sequentially, accommodating heavy workloads and delivering greater overall performance. \b \b   About NEC Corporation of America \b \u001d  NEC Corporation of America is a leading technology provider of network, IT and visual display solutions.

The National ratings are affirmed at Long-term 'BB+(pol) and Short-term 'B(pol)'. \u001d  The Outlook change reflects PGF's improved profitability and cash flow generation as well as interest coverage ratio. PGF's EBITDA margin strengthened to 2.4% in the first nine months of 2006 from 2.1% in the same period of 2005, while EBITDA-to-interest ratio improved to 5.4x from 3.4x. The rating takes into account PGF's aggressive financial policy as evidenced by its high financial leverage and considerable dividend payments. This is mitigated by the company's leading position in the growing Polish pharmaceuticals distribution market, modern nationwide distribution network and expanding retail operations. Fitch notes that PGF reports one of the highest EBITDA margins among Polish drug distributors, mostly because of its scale. \u001d  The ratings reflect PGF's strategy, which is based on organic growth and further development of its chain of pharmacies, including those owned by PGF and private pharmacies cooperating with PGF under the loyalty programme. Fitch understands that PGF is interested in selected acquisitions in Poland, but is not willing to increase leverage. \u001d  The government is discussing amendments to the Pharmaceutical Law, which may affect PGF's business. It plans to reduce wholesale margins on refunded drugs by one percentage point. This is in line with the existing Pharmaceutical Law, which calls for a reduction in distributors' margins if the Monetary Policy Council reduces the base interest rate by 30%. While the decline in regulated margin would be negative for PGF, most of the wholesale margins charged by the company are below the regulated level, chiefly due to its economies of scale. Smaller distributors are likely to be much more affected. In addition, the draft law aims to take stricter measures to prevent wholesalers from expanding into the retail business. \u001d  In December 2006, PGF completed a sale-and-lease-back transaction of its eight warehouses. The properties are leased back to the company for 20 years. Fitch factors this transaction into PGF's credit ratios by calculating lease-adjusted leverage ratios. \u001d  PGF is Poland's largest distributor of pharmaceuticals and healthcare products to pharmacies and hospitals.

On Tuesday, Sens. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Trent Lott, R-Miss., are expected to announce the introduction of legislation that would, among other things, encourage more state investment in Amtrak by making federal matching funds available. \u001d  The sweeping bill - similar to one that passed in the Senate 93 to 6 last year but was never voted on in the House - calls for $12 billion in federal funding for the next six years. Many Amtrak supporters believe it has a better chance this year with Democrats in control of Congress. \u001d  But one aspect of the bill is relatively uncontroversial. The idea of matching funds for state investment in Amtrak is one that both supporters and critics of the railroad have embraced - and something states like California believe is long overdue. \u001d  As for Amtrak itself, \"states are our future,\" President Alex Kummant told The Associated Press last week. He said a matching program for capital investments, along with making Amtrak \"more user-friendly\" for states, is essential if Amtrak is to capitalize on growing demand for intercity rail. \u001d  Even without such matching funds, states have been stepping up. The biggest player, California, currently contributes $73 million for the Pacific Surfliner and two other trains it runs jointly with Amtrak. \u001d  Illinois last year doubled its annual subsidy to Amtrak to $24 million. The increase followed several years of double-digit growth in the number of riders on routes connecting Chicago with St. Louis, Carbondale, Ill., and Quincy, Ill., and allowed Amtrak to offer much more frequent service. \u001d  Other states that subsidize Amtrak service are Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. \u001d  Outside of Amtrak's busiest route - the northeast corridor from Boston to Washington - the state corridors are the biggest success stories. They provide a stark-contrast to the railroad's long-distance trains, which many critics believe should be eliminated because they are costly and attract comparatively few riders. \u001d  State involvement is healthy, \"as opposed to having our trains totally planned by a centralized, monopolistic, Washington, D.C., organization,\" said Joseph Vranich, a former Amtrak spokesman who is now one of its most vocal critics. \u001d  But states can only do so much without the availability of matching funds for capital improvements, said Jason Tai, director of public and intermodal transportation for the Illinois Department of Transportation. \u001d  \"Unlike other modes of transportation, be it highways, transit or even waterways, there is no dedicated substantial funding for rail. There is an unlevel playing field,\" Tai said. \u001d  The Lautenberg-Lott legislation would allow states to fund capital rail projects with up to 80% federal funds. States would continue to pay operating costs, but their arrangements with Amtrak would become more standardized. Currently, each state operates under separately negotiated agreements. \u001d  \"If the federal government wants to get out of the operating business, this seems to me a reasonable way to do it,\" said Will Kempton, director of the California Department of Transportation. \u001d  Kempton and Tai said any legislation that is passed should take into account past investments by states, so that those that did step up to fund Amtrak in the past are not penalized. They said one way to do that would be to provide them with a more generous match in the beginning. \u001d  Kempton said California would be eager to take advantage of any available capital funds. \u001d  \"We're not just sitting on our laurels,\" he said. \"We're looking at expanding service.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:57 ET (17:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d9b39eb1d02dceef12027fe38bce8d90","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","NL0000235190"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"French Union Cautious On Report A320 To Shift Assembly","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T15:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","NL0000235190"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XMDAX"],"Story":"\u001d  PARIS (AP)--Xavier Petrachi, an official of one of France's largest labor unions the CGT said Monday that a report in the daily La Tribune that Airbus wants to locate production of its future single-aisle aircraft solelyin Hamburg would be \"brutal\" news, but said it has to be taken cautiously. \u001d  According to the newspaper report citing union sources, Louis Gallois, chief executive of both Airbus and the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Co. NV (5730.FR), has told union representatives that it is unlikely there will be more than one assembly line for the successor to Airbus's successful A320 family of short-to-medium haul jets. Such a decision would fit in with the company's plan to cut costs by EUR2 billion a year by 2010. \u001d  Noting that an official decision to build a new jet hasn't been taken, Petrachi, a representative of the CGT labor union at Airbus, observed that since it was created the company has had two assembly sites for its commercial aircraft -Toulouse in southwest France, and Hamburg in northern Germany. \u001d  Airbus is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Franco-German aerospace company EADS, and there has been an unwritten rule from the outset that the workloads of both facilities should be balanced. \u001d  \"It would be hard to imagine that the future A320 will be built at Hamburg without some sort of compensation for Toulouse,\" Petrachi said. The future A320 is unlikely to enter service before 2013. At present, the A320 and its offshoots, the A318, A319 and A321, are built in both Hamburg and Toulouse. \u001d  An Airbus spokeswoman said Monday that details of the Power8 cost-cutting and rationalization plan are still being worked out, and that they won't be made public for some weeks. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 10:46 ET (15:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d9b46a0d4fcbfc1006daf489ca52ee59","symR":["AUN.AU","AU000000AUN4"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Credit Suisse Downgrades Australia's Austar To Neutral","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T21:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AUN.AU","AU000000AUN4"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 16:21 ET (21:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d9cb3ff147a9da3c8f999d03d2f402db","symR":["INVX"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Innovex Announces Fiscal 2007 First Quarter Results","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T21:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["INVX"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bMAPLE PLAIN, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2007-- \u001d  Innovex (Nasdaq:INVX) today reported revenue of $26.0 million and revenue excluding pass through material of $13.9 million for the fiscal 2007 first quarter ending December 31, 2006. In the fiscal 2006 first quarter the Company reported revenue of $50.5 million and revenue excluding pass through material of $27.6 million. \b \u001d  The Company's net loss was $6.3 million or $0.33 per share in the fiscal 2007 first quarter as compared to a net loss of $9.8 million or $0.51 per share in the prior year first quarter. The fiscal 2007 first quarter includes restructuring charges of $1.8 million or $0.10 per share. The Company's fiscal 2007 first quarter net loss excluding the restructuring charge was $4.5 million or $0.23 per share. The Company's fiscal 2006 first quarter net income was $160,000 or $0.01 per share excluding restructuring charges of $9.9 million. \b \u001d  The restructuring charges are primarily related to the Company's plan to accelerate end of life production for Flex Suspension Assembly (FSA) flexible circuits in Litchfield and discontinue use of that facility by the end of March 2007. Concurrent with FSA flexible circuit production end-of-life, the Company will also accelerate production end-of-life at its Eastlake, Ohio laminate material manufacturing facility, where it manufactures FSA flexible circuit laminate materials. Post restructuring, all of the Company's manufacturing operations will be located in Thailand. The closure of the Litchfield and Eastlake facilities will mark the end of a three year effort to lower the Company's cost structure and move all manufacturing operations offshore. Offshore manufacturing became a critical component of the cost leadership strategy the Company adopted three years ago when it learned its FSA product would become obsolete. \b \u001d  The fiscal 2007 first quarter operating results continue to be impacted by low revenue levels primarily related to the FSA product end-of-life and delays in the ramp up of new Flat Panel Display (FPD) programs. Revenue and revenue excluding pass-through for the March 2007 quarter is expected to be similar to the fiscal 2007 first quarter. \b \u001d  FSA products constituted 54% of the Company's net sales for the fiscal 2007 first quarter, AFC revenue was 37%, FPD product revenue was 3%, integrated circuit packaging application revenue was 4% and network system and other application revenue was 2%. \b \u001d  \"Our new FPD product ramps continue to experience delays,\" commented William P. Murnane, Innovex's President and CEO. \"Although we are frustrated by the delays, we remain confident that our FPD business will return to historical levels in 2007. We are currently designed in and qualified on more than ten new FPD programs that are scheduled to ramp to volume in 2007. \b \u001d  \"Our restructuring remains on schedule. When the restructuring is complete in the June 2007 quarter we will have lowered our annual breakeven point to approximately $70 million of revenue excluding pass through material, which represents a reduction over the past 3 years of almost 40% from a breakeven of $115 million of revenue excluding pass through material in 2004.\" \b \u001d  Cash used in operating activities in the fiscal 2007 first quarter was $4.9 million. The Company had a cash balance of $15.8 million at December 31, 2006, an increase of $5.9 million from September 30, 2006. Total long and short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 was $41.9 million, an increase of $13.0 million from September 30, 2006. Capital expenditures for the fiscal 2007 first quarter were $2.2 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $8 million in fiscal 2007 and will primarily support cost reduction projects. \b \u001d  The Company entered into a new credit facility on December 19, 2006 with Bank of Ayhudya Public Company Limited and TMB Bank Public Company Limited for 600 million Thai baht (approximately $17 million USD). The increase in cash and long-term debt for the fiscal 2007 first quarter was primarily driven by the Company drawing down approximately $7.6 million of the new facility prior to the end of the quarter. Cash availability under the Company's existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $37.4 million. \b \u001d  \"We are pleased that our Thailand banks continue to support and show confidence in our restructuring and business development efforts,\" stated Murnane. \"The expanded credit facility in Thailand will provide more than adequate cash resources to complete our restructuring and support the revenue growth expected in the second half of fiscal 2007.\" \b \b   Conference Call & Live Webcast \b \u001d  Innovex will conduct a conference call and webcast for investors beginning at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on Monday, January 15, 2007.

This monthly distribution is comprised of the regular base distribution of $0.28 per trust unit, plus a supplementary distribution of $0.02 per trust unit due to the expectation that average realized commodity prices will be in excess of budget prices. The base distribution rate assumes commodity prices of CDN $8.00 per gj at AECO for natural gas and CDN $58.00 per barrel at Edmonton for light crude (this equates to approximately US $8.40 per mmbtu for NYMEX natural gas and US $50.00 per barrel for WTI crude oil). Although natural gas prices have recently weakened from these levels, oil prices offset the majority of the shortfall in natural gas prices. In addition, average commodity prices in the futures markets currently remain above pricing thresholds for Bonavista's base distribution rate. Consequently, Bonavista has declared a distribution of $0.30 per trust unit in respect of January production, to be paid on February 15, 2007 for unitholders of record on January 31, 2007. The ex-distribution date is January 29, 2007. The combined base and supplementary distribution incorporate the withholding of sufficient funds to finance capital expenditures required to maintain or modestly grow the current production base and provide sustainable distributions into the future. Our long-term objective is to distribute between 50% and 60% of our cash flow. Our distribution policy is reviewed monthly and is based upon the current and future commodity price environment, our commodity hedging program, our current operations and available investment opportunities. \b \b                                                             Distribution \bRecord Date       Ex-Distribution Date   Distribution Date       per Unit \b=---------------- --------------------   -----------------   ------------- \bJanuary 31, 2007      January 29, 2007   February 15, 2007       $0.30 \bFebruary 28, 2007    February 26, 2007      March 15, 2007       $0.30 (1) \bMarch 31, 2007          March 28, 2007      April 16, 2007       $0.30 (1) \b \b \b (1) The above reflects an anticipated combined regular base and \b     supplementary distributions based on the Bonavista's current projected \b     commodity prices, commodity hedge positions and production volumes. \b     Distributions are subject to change should there be a material change \b     in expected cash flow for the respective periods. \b \b \bCurrently, Bonavista has 84.8 million trust units and 12.3 million exchangeable shares outstanding. The exchangeable shares are convertible into 18.9 million trust units based on the current exchange ratio, which is adjusted monthly to reflect the distributions paid on the trust units. Cash distributions are not paid on the exchangeable shares, nor are the exchangeable shares publicly traded. \b \bBonavista Energy Trust is focused on a balanced commodity approach and is committed to maintaining its emphasis on operating high quality oil and natural gas properties, delivering consistent distributions to unitholders and ensuring financial strength and sustainability. \b \bForward Looking Statements \b \bCorporate information provided herein contains forward-looking information.

Rank shares are trading at a 12X EV/EBITDA for 2007, compared with 9X historically. \u001d  Rank does have licenses to open new casinos, but unlike LCI, which has 5 new licenses to add to its existing 5 U.K. casinos, Rank's 9 spare licenses offer relatively less growth from a bigger casino base given it has 33 casinos in operation already. \u001d  Rank might be cautious about expanding its casinos too rapidly because the number of casinos in the U.K. is set to rise sharply from 140 in 2006. Around 40 licenses were granted under the old 1968 Gaming Act, and 17 new ones were granted under the 2005 Act, which will more than double the supply of tables and slot machines. \u001d  Margins are therefore likely to fall, if there isn't a doubling in the number of British gamblers. \u001d  The fact that Rank's casino attendance only grew 4% in 2006, following the scrapping of the 24-hr cooling off period that was previously needed before one could become a member of a casino, doesn't make that look likely, though. \u001d  And to top it all Rank may have run out of luck in its bingo division if the upcoming ban on smoking in public places that will come into effect in England in July this year has the same impact on bingo revenue as a ban in Scotland did in 2006. \u001d  Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort forecast fall in operating profit of as much as 30% to 50% which looks possible if you take at face value the warning from Rank and Gala that 200 out of 800 bingo clubs might close if punters can't smoke and play at the same time. \u001d  Though Rank has improved its financial position through the sale of Hard Rock Cafe -  its market gearing is now 45% instead of 60% - the company doesn't have much in the way of resources to fall back on. It has only GBP50 million in freehold property, while operating cash flow fell to GBP24.4m from 44.3m in 2005 in the first half. \u001d  There's also the chance the likely future prime minister of the U.K., Gordon Brown, the son of a Church of Scotland clergyman, may see some political capital in distancing himself from the pro-gambling policy of current PM Tony Blair. \b \u001d  (Martin Fluck joined Dow Jones Newswires in 2006.

Dr. Gunnerman will continue to serve as a director of the Company.  Larry Ryan, PhD, has been named the new Chief Executive Officer and Robert H.

Dr. Ryan has a PhD from the University of Delaware, a Six-Sigma Blackbelt certification, and a long history of working with chemical process-dependent technologies.

The majority of the Board then proceeded with the dismissal of Dr. Gunnerman and will be asserting its control.  The Board will also be seeking judicial relief in support of its actions. \b \u001d  Mr. van Maasdijk said, \"The manner in which the Board was forced to change management was unfortunate but it represents the next stage of development for the Company and the Board believes Dr. Ryan is well suited to drive the Company to future success.\"  Mr. van Maasdijk stressed the importance of proving the validity of the mechanical and chemical aspects of the SonoCracking process, before launching a major marketing effort.  Further, the majority of the Board believes Dr. Ryan is admirably well suited to this task. Dr. Ryan explained, \"I am very excited to join the Company during this transition period and look forward to the challenges ahead.\"  The new management team stated that SulphCo will immediately focus on commercial validation and enhancement of its SonoCracking technology. \b \u001d  The SulphCo Board is committed to transparent communication internally and with the investor community.

At the same time, Standard & Poor's removed the ratings from CreditWatch with negative implications, where they had been placed on Dec. 21, 2006. The outlook is negative. \u001d  \"The affirmation reflects Publicis' solid ongoing operating performance in terms of organic growth and strong discretionary cash flow generation,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Melvyn Cooke. It also reflects the group's position as the world's fourth-largest advertising agency holding company, and its good geographic diversity and profitability. These factors are partially offset by exposure to cyclical customer advertising spending, particularly in the automotive sector; the competitive nature of the advertising and marketing services industry; and Publicis' more limited diversification in marketing services than its main peers. \u001d  Publicis had total debt outstanding of EUR2.1 billion, at Sept. 30, 2006. \u001d  Although the Digitas transaction will enhance business diversification and revenue growth, the material increase in leverage will weaken Publicis' financial risk profile. This stretches somewhat the group's stated financial policy in 2006 in terms of leverage and acquisitions. \u001d  \"The negative outlook reflects our view that a restoration of Publicis' credit measures to levels more commensurate with the current ratings will depend on the strength of the group's operating performance and on cyclical worldwide advertising markets over the next few years,\" said Mr. Cooke. The outlook also reflects management's greater-than-expected appetite for debt-funded acquisitions and leverage. \u001d  A revision of the outlook to stable would hinge on the group's return to a more moderate financial policy, especially regarding debt-funded acquisitions, as well as continued solid operating performance over the next few years. In particular, a stable outlook would imply that the group would be able to sustain debt to EBITDA--adjusted for operating leases and pensions, and netted off for excess cash--of comfortably under 3x in the medium term. \u001d  Conversely, a significant operating underperformance and/or the pursuit of a more aggressive financial policy, leading to an absence of deleveraging in the medium term, would put downward pressure on the ratings. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:23 ET (17:23 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"e1d47fc80ae3fc03a8b22fa4720b3e61","symR":["IAG.T","CA4558711038"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Indus Alliance Cut To Hold From Buy: Genuity >IAG.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T13:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IAG.T","CA4558711038"],"IndustryCodes":["INL","INS","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 08:47 ET (13:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e1d9ca48d28366139d4c9b7110cac2cb","symR":["532540.BY","TTA.YY","INE467B01029"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"India TCS Staff Strength 83,500 As Of Dec 31","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T12:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["532540.BY","TTA.YY","INE467B01029"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","TSX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 07:32 ET (12:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e1df3723e9aee19be8225501f04a2bd4","symR":["3112.FR","AKH","FR0000031122"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Air France-KLM 1H FY 2007 GAAP Net At EUR640 Mln -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:53:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["3112.FR","AKH","FR0000031122"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XENX","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  Air France-KLM's fiscal first half ended on Sept. 30. \u001d  For the same six months a year earlier, Air France-KLM's GAAP net profit was EUR849 million. \u001d  Air France-KLM reported its first-half results last November.

During the float out, the valves will be opened and the dry-dock flooded for the ship to meet the sea for the first time marking the initial introduction of the new Cunard Queen to the water.  This significant occasion marks the beginning of the final construction stages for the $522 million sister ship to the lines flagship Queen Mary 2 and grande dame of the seas QE2. \b \u001d  Cunard's Managing Director, Carol Marlow, will be joined by Maureen Ryan, who will be guest of honour at the event.  Maureen joined Cunard in 1963 and is the only known person to have served on all Cunard Queens: Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, QE2 and Queen Mary 2.  In recognition of this, Cunard has bestowed on Maureen the honour of acting as the yard's Madrina to Queen Victoria. \b \u001d  The first ceremony will involve the welding of significant coins beneath the mast of Queen Victoria for good luck.  Two coins have been chosen -- a Euro (symbolising the fact that the ship is being built in Italy) and a gold Queen Victoria sovereign with St George slaying the dragon on the reverse side. \b \bCarol Marlow will confirm the reasoning behind the sovereign by saying: \b \u001d  \"Cunard came into being at the very beginning of the Victorian era -- Queen Victoria had been on the throne for only three years when Samuel Cunard's first ship set sail.  And there followed, throughout her reign, a huge expansion in the Cunard fleet until by the end of it the company was the pre-eminent force in British shipping.  Today the company is probably the most famous name in shipping and the birth of this great liner confirms for all to see the continuing renaissance of the great name of Cunard.  The Cunard lion roars again!\" \b \u001d  After the coin ceremony, a further ceremony will take place on the dockside at which the ship will be blessed, and a bottle of Italian prosecco will be smashed against the hull.  The valves of the dry dock will then be opened so the ship meets the water for the first time.  Corrado Antonini, Chairman of Fincantieri, will say: \b \u001d  \"Our Company is the heir to the Italian shipbuilding industry and the world leader in cruise ship construction and believes, as Cunard does, in the possibility and the need of actively matching tradition and innovation. Building a liner for Cunard is a special achievement for Fincantieri and takes us right to our roots, fostering both our determination to build once again a passenger ship of high technological content and unmistakable style, reflecting the best of the industry and tailored to the needs and requirements of the owner.\" \b \u001d  The 90,000-ton Queen Victoria will not only be a classic ocean liner, offering the very best of Cunard's heritage and traditions, along with all modern day luxuries, but will also feature some exciting innovations.  These will include the first traditional West End-style private viewing boxes at sea in the Royal Court Theatre; the first floating Cunardia museum display, housing Cunard artifacts and memorabilia and the first two-story, 'spiral staircased' library at sea.  The ship will also feature the line's celebrated luxury Grills accommodation and dining, further enhanced on Queen Victoria with exclusive deck terraces and an al fresco dining option. \b \u001d  From the outside, her distinctive black and red livery will hint at what differentiates a Cunard liner from a standard cruise ship.  This will be most evident in the ship's adherence to liner traditions of the past, with elegant public rooms, many on a grand scale, featuring rich wood panelling, intricate mosaics and gleaming chandeliers.  There will also be a grand, colonial-style conservatory complete with a retractable glass roof. \b \u001d  And, of course, the ship has been constructed with impressive sea keeping qualities that will enable her to travel easily and efficiently through the world's oceans. \b \u001d  As well as being the second largest Cunarder ever built, Queen Victoria's arrival is particularly noteworthy as it will mark the first time that three Cunard Queens (she joins the world's largest liner Queen Mary 2 and the world's most famous and best-loved liner QE2) have been in service together in the company's 167-year history. \b \u001d  Queen Victoria will depart on her Maiden Voyage on Tuesday December 11, 2007.  This 10-night Christmas Markets Voyage will leave from the company's home port, Southampton, and will call at Amsterdam, Copenhagen (overnight call), Oslo, Hamburg and Bruges, enjoying the pre-Christmas decorations and traditional gift markets.  After spending her first Christmas in the Canaries, Queen Victoria will embark on her 106-night Maiden World Cruise which will call at 37 cities in 23 countries.  Every call, with the exception of Lisbon, will be a maiden call for Cunard's new Queen.  Queen Victoria will circumnavigate the globe in a westbound direction and, after calling at New York, will transit the Panama Canal before making maiden calls at some of the world's most famous cities including Los Angeles, Auckland, Sydney, Bangkok, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, Dubai, Athens and Barcelona.  Queen Victoria will also transit the other of the great canals, the Suez, before returning to her homeport of Southampton on April 22.  Early Booking Fares for the complete voyage range from $20,304 per person, based on double occupancy, to $203,404 per person, based on double occupancy. \b \b    About Cunard Line \b \u001d  Cunard Line, operator of the luxury ocean liners Queen Mary 2 and QE2, has long been synonymous with the quest for new discoveries and the epitome of British finesse since the company's first paddle-wheeled steamer, Britannia, crossed the Atlantic in 1840.

(MN.T) is down sharply after the security surveillance equipment supplier announced a significant slowdown in orders from its largest customer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), and gave no indication of when its business with the giant U.S.-based retailer might rebound. \u001d  March of Ottawa, Ont. now expects revenue of C$80-C$85 million for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2007, down from C$97-C$107 million previously. In addition, the company cut its earnings forecast to 26-34 Canadian cents a share from 66-77 Canadian cents a share. In its release, March blamed the lower expectations on \"an unanticipated decline in order intake and expected order intake\" from Wal-Mart. \u001d  If that wasn't enough of a disappointment for investors, the company couldn't give a specific reason for Wal-Mart's decision, or when demand from Wal-Mart for March's equipment might pick up. Currently, March's surveillance equipment is deployed in 1,400 of Wal-Mart's stores in the U.S. out of a total of about 4,000 in that country, and the retailer generated more than 50% of March's digital surveillance recorder sales. \u001d  In Toronto, March is down C$9.10 or 43% at C$12.03 on volume of 1 million shares. \u001d  On a subsequent conference call, Ken Taylor, March's chief financial officer, said Wal-Mart indicated on Friday that March shouldn't expect any \"significant orders from them in the upcoming months.\" At the same time, Taylor said March still believes it has \"good potential\" to secure future business from Wal-Mart, as the company continues to talk with Wal-Mart about its equipment and services. \u001d  That said, Wal-Mart has never provided much guidance to March about potential future business and \"we're not really in a position to estimate what the future business with them might be at this stage for fiscal\" 2008, Taylor said. \u001d  March's earnings warning comes after its competitor Verint Systems Inc. (VRNT) last week announced winning US$12 million worth of orders of its video surveillance software in the fourth-quarter from a a big-box retailer that analysts believe is Wal-Mart. Investors had already been concerned about March losing Wal-Mart business to Verient after March announced in November that Wal-Mart planned to use a second supplier for its video surveillance equipment. March's stock fell almost 11% to C$23.02 the day it made that announcement.   Asked if the Verient contract could represent a sign that Wal-Mart won't be buying any more of March's video hardware equipment, Talyor said \"we don't have the visibility to address that question.\" \u001d  To offset the loss of Wal-Mart business, March will continue to focus on its sales and marketing to attract new business and consider some cost-cutting measures, Taylor said. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.marchnetworks.com \b \u001d  -Ben Dummett, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2024; ben.dummett@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:48 ET (17:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e4c5ede5142713c4260b0f5e10956e2a","symR":["CTCH","JCOM"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Commtouch Zero-Hour Virus Outbreak Protection To Enhance Electric Mail's Traditional Anti-Virus Solution>CTCH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T13:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CTCH","JCOM"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","SOF","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\bMOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIF. & BURNABY, BRITISH COLUMBIA, January 15 /CNW/ - Commtouch(R) (NASDAQ:CTCH), announced today that it has entered into an agreement to provide Commtouch Zero-Hour(TM) Virus Outbreak Protection to The Electric Mail Company. \b \bCommtouch's Zero-Hour Virus Outbreak Protection has been integrated into VirusSMART, Electric Mail's proprietary anti-virus solution.

In absolute terms, this represents annual growth of 40.4% and 11.1% sequentially.

This volume growth underscores total third quarter wafer sales of 96.7 million Euros equal to annual growth of 43.0% or 51.8% in performance and 12.7% sequentially. \b \u001d  Cumulatively and with a weight of 68%, 300mm recorded annual growth of 75.9% or 81.4% in performance.  Total wafer sales annual growth is 49.3% or 53.6% in performance. \b \u001d  Licensing revenues of 0.8 million Euros were recorded in the quarter giving 2.5 million Euros for the 9 months year to date period and the recently acquired Tracit contributed 0.4 million Euros.  Picogiga's traditional RF markets were soft with sales of 1.7 million Euros in the quarter resulting in 9-month cumulative growth of 17.5%. \b \b    Group cautious for Q4 in the light of short term market considerations \b \u001d  Recent uncertainties related to the customer inventory chain in the game consoles market and anticipated weaker demand in the traditional Picogiga markets are behind the cautious stance adopted by the group for the fourth quarter, which the group now expects to be in line with the third quarter. \b \u001d  The group therefore anticipates that the second half operating margin is likely to be similar to the first half.  A good manufacturing performance for SOI despite the volume adjustment in Q4 is likely to be offset by the unfavourable exchange climate and weaker traditional Picogiga activity. Picogiga continues its significant involvement in strategic R&D initiatives to develop new III-V products as well as advanced materials for solid-state lightning.  The group's strategic R&D programmes including official grant approval negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily as planned. \b \u001d  Almost all remaining holders of the 2001-2006 convertible bonds took advantage of the favourable conditions immediately prior to redemption with the result that 35 million Euros worth of bonds were converted into equity. This provides an important reduction in interest costs that will have a favourable impact on net income. \b \b    Recent development \b \u001d  Soitec recently renewed an ongoing SOI wafer supply contract for almost 40 million Euros for the calendar year 2007. This order comes under the terms of the agreement for supply of 200 mm & 125 mm UNIBOND(TM) SOI wafers manufactured using Soitec's proprietary Smart Cut(TM) process. \b \b    Reporting Calendar \b \u001d  Full year sales for 2006-2007 will be published on Tuesday 16 April 2007 after the close of the Paris Stock Exchange. \b \b    About The Soitec Group: \b \u001d  The Soitec Group is the world's leading innovator and provider of the engineered substrates that serve as the foundation for today's most advanced electronic products and nanotechnologies.

But, she admits, the risks remain on the upside in the near term. \u001d  By mid-year, these risks should have disappeared as inflation falls back to its 2% target. \u001d  \"We believe that a strong first half will give way to a weaker second half,\" said James Knightley, a U.K. economist with ING Financial Markets, forecasting that interest rates will then be able to come down at that stage. \u001d  Until then, however, it looks like there will be little to deter investors from driving the pound higher even though it may back down later in the year. \u001d  \"In the short-run the surprise hike is a strong positive signal for rates and sterling,\" said Lena Komileva, G7 economist with international brokers Tullet Prebon in London. \u001d  Early Monday, the pound was still pushing ahead - rising to $1.9613 by 0800 GMT from $1.9567 late on Friday in New York, according to EBS. \u001d  The euro was a little lower at GBP0.6597 compared with GBP0.6600. \u001d  The market was being driven largely be expectation that the Bank of Japan will hike its interest rates 0.25 basis points to 0.50 at its policy meeting Thursday. This helped the dollar down to Y120.34 from Y120.35. The euro rose to $1.2942 from $1.2914 and to Y155.73 from Y155.42. \b \u001d  Bloomberg TNI FRX POV \b   Reuters   USD/DJ \u001d  Telerate  1066 or 1074 \b   Thomson   P/1066 or P/1074 \u001d  (Nick Hastings has covered the foreign exchange markets and industry for over 15 years.

(AP)--A storm blamed for at least 36 deaths across the eastern half of the country spread into the Northeast on Monday, coating trees, power lines and roads with a shell of ice up to a half-inch thick and knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses. \u001d  Ice-covered roads cut into Martin Luther King Jr. holiday observances from Albany, N.Y., to Fort Worth and Austin, Texas, where officials also canceled Gov. Rick Perry's inauguration parade on Tuesday because another round of ice was expected during the night. \u001d  The weight of the ice snapped tree limbs and took down power lines, knocking out electricity to nearly 70,000 customers in New York state and New Hampshire. \u001d  Even in Maine, a state well-accustomed to winter weather, a layer of sleet and snow on roads forced the shutdown of numerous businesses, day care centers and schools. \u001d  In hard-hit Missouri, the utility company Ameren (AEE) said it would probably not have everyone's lights back on until Wednesday night. Overnight temperatures were expected to drop into the single digits. As of Sunday night, about 330,000 households had no electricity. \u001d  Missouri National Guardsmen went door to door, checking on residents, and helped clear slick roads. \u001d  About 112,000 homes and businesses blacked out in Oklahoma, some of them since the storm's first wave struck on Friday, also were still waiting for power Monday. About 136,000 customers were without electricity Monday in Michigan. \u001d  More than 160 flights were canceled at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. \u001d  Before dawn Monday, a car slid into the path of a dump truck on an icy New York highway in Sennett, 20 miles west of Syracuse, killing the car's driver and two passengers. \u001d  \"It was very icy, rainy, a snow-sleet mix, so definitely the road conditions had a lot to do with this,\" Sheriff David Gould said. \u001d  Waves of freezing rain, sleet and snow since Friday had been blamed for at least 15 deaths in Oklahoma, eight in Missouri, five in Iowa, four in New York, three in Texas and one in Maine. Seven of the Oklahoma deaths occurred in one accident, in which a minivan carrying 12 people slid off an icy highway Sunday and hit an oncoming truck. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 15:43 ET (20:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ea3a006e8e513ea49737e7b1ca5deda0","symR":["13110.FR","BNPQY","RBS.LN","FR0000131104","GB0007547838"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"FIH Mandates Banks For 5-Yr, Sterling, Benchmark Bond","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T11:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["13110.FR","BNPQY","RBS.LN","FR0000131104","GB0007547838"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XFT1","XGTI","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Finance for Danish Industry, or FIH, has mandated BNP Paribas and Royal Bank of Scotland as joint lead managers for its forthcoming five-year, benchmark-sized, sterling-denominated bond issue, one of the syndicated banks said Monday. \u001d  The fixed-rate bond issue has price guidance at 80 basis points over gilts.

(GE) for $4.8 billion in cash and return GBP2.1 billion of the GBP2.25 billion proceeds to its shareholders. \u001d  It also said the two companies have signed a letter of intent to form a new joint venture company, Smiths GE Detection, combining Smiths' Detection operations with GE Homeland Protection. Smiths will own 64% of the new JV and GE the remaining 36%. \u001d  After selling its aerospace division, Smiths will be left with detection, medical and specialty engineering operations. The company has been under pressure from shareholders to break itself up, but has long resisted. \u001d  The announcements were welcomed by the markets and at 1034 GMT, Smiths' shares were up 108 pence, or 11%, at 1,093 pence, the biggest gainer on the FTSE 100. In Frankfurt, General Electric shares were up 0.1% at EUR29.30. \u001d  One trader, who requested anonymity, said the sale made perfect sense since Smiths aerospace has been suffering from downward pricing pressure from Boeing Co. (BA) and Airbus owner European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. (5730.FR). \u001d  In a research note, Panmure Gordon said there's clearly scope for other bidders to step in although counter offers might have to involve a bid for the whole of Smiths. It said it's concerned that the merger of the two market leaders in detection may struggle to get antitrust clearance. The brokerage has a buy rating on Smiths. \u001d  In a statement, Smiths said the sale of the aerospace unit is expected to generate improved returns on capital and boost margins. The net effect of the sale and capital return would have been accretive to the company's 2006 pro-forma earnings, it added. \u001d  On a conference call, Smiths Chief Executive Keith Butler-Wheelhouse said the deal would have boosted pro-forma 2006 earnings per share by 7%, even though aerospace accounted for GBP1.3 billion of the company's GBP3.5 billion in revenues in 2006. \u001d  The company will call an extraordinary shareholders meeting during the second quarter to approve the sale, which is also subject to completion and regulatory approval. \u001d  On the conference call, GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said he looked forward to \"a constructive process\" with E.U. antitrust regulators. \u001d  He noted that the acquisition would be complimentary rather than consolidating and told analysts separately he doesn't anticipate serious regulatory issues. Regarding the detection joint venture, Immelt said there are a \"multitude of competitors\" in the industry. \u001d  GE hasn't always had success with E.U. regulators, which blocked the company's intended acquisition of Honeywell after U.S. authorities had approved the deal. \u001d  The Smiths capital return is proposed as a B share scheme combined with share consolidation. \u001d  Smiths Finance Director John Langston said the aerospace division sale would leave Smiths with a loosened dividend policy and lower credit ratings, but the company could live with that because the remaining businesses are less capital intensive. The new dividend cover would be 1.8 times, down from 2 times, while its credit ratings at Standard & Poor's are expected to fall from A- to BBB+, he said. \u001d  In a separate statement, GE said the acquisition will broaden the U.S. company's offerings to its aerospace customers by adding Smiths' flight management systems, electrical power management, mechanical actuation systems and airborne platform computing systems. \u001d  \"GE Aviation is growing about 10% a year and this acquisition gives us a technology growth platform that will be accretive to our net income and will deliver immediate and future value for our investors,\" GE's Immelt said in the statement. \u001d  Smiths Aerospace has more than 11,000 employees and had $2.4 billion in revenues in 2006. It has been working on projects like Boeing's 787 aircraft, the Airbus A380 as well as the Joint Strike Fighter military project. \u001d  On the Detection JV, the companies said they view a deal as a long-term commitment and there will be no voluntary exit rights for the first five years of the JV. \u001d  The companies didn't say when the JV would be finalized, but said they have agreed an exclusivity period to reach a deal. \u001d  Butler-Wheelhouse said he had asked Immelt to sell Smiths the whole of GE's Homeland Protection unit while they were talking about aerospace, but had been turned down. Further talks had agreed on a JV. \u001d  There is a \"great deal of industrial logic\" in putting the businesses together, Immelt said on the conference call, without quantifying synergies. \u001d  The JV will have pro-forma revenues of about GBP600 million. Its board will be made up of four Smiths members and two from GE, and will be chaired by Butler-Wheelhouse. \u001d  Butler-Wheelhouse said there are currently no talks to sell off the remaining Smiths units, but said \"we reconsider these things continuously.\" Immelt said GE had no interest in Smiths' medical operations because the two companies operate in different parts of the medical engineering industry. \u001d  The Smiths CEO said his company remains well placed to make acquisitions worth up to GBP500 million despite plans to return much of the proceeds from the planned sale of its aerospace business to shareholders. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.smiths-group.com \b \u001d  -By Steve McGrath and Rod Stone, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9284; steve.mcgrath@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 05:47 ET (10:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ec477be919d8a4af29453de9f3eb11af","symR":["FPL.T","HLF.T","CA30256E1079","CA4296951094"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": FPI Receives Offer For Marketing And Manufacturing Assets>FPL.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T14:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FPL.T","HLF.T","CA30256E1079","CA4296951094"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP"],"Story":"\bTSX: FPL \b \bwww.fpil.com \b \bST.

IP Office is a secure, easy-to-use converged voice and data system designed especially for small businesses and multi-site deployment by mid to large companies. Avaya has sold more than 85,000 IP Office systems to companies worldwide. Many of these businesses have IP Office at their headquarters and branch and store locations and now have a way to configure and manage them from a central location. \b \u001d  Avaya, a global leader in business communications applications, systems and services, announced the management tool at the National Retail Federation 96th Annual Conference and Expo, where the company is demonstrating the many ways retailers can use Intelligent Communications to improve customer service and boost productivity. \b \u001d  Avaya Integrated Management for IP Office can significantly reduce the total cost of operations by enabling businesses to centrally create commonly- used IP Office functions and apply them to groups of IP Office locations. A simple GUI interface enables IT managers to create standard configurations, or 'templates,' to centrally provision, administer and monitor the system for many locations, rather than one at a time, which is time-consuming and expensive. For example, it lets retailers with multiple sites make broad changes to communications parameters, such as holiday greetings or store hours, map sets of extensions to the pharmacy section in a store, or change dialing plans -- which describe the number and pattern of digits, such as area codes or access codes, that a user dials to reach a particular telephone number -- at selected stores. \b \u001d  Later this month, CCI Telecom Inc., a certified Avaya reseller based in Statesville, North Carolina, plans to implement the tool at its headquarters location. \"We expect that the Avaya Integrated Management for IP Office will enable us to provide our retail and other business clients with proactive, value-added customer care,\" said Bobby Stewart, president, enterprise networks, CCI Telecom Inc. \"For example, instead of keeping spreadsheets of systems and software installed, and scheduling upgrades manually, we'll be able to establish and deploy automatic software upgrades, and make sure our clients have the latest features and capabilities on their IP Office system, without anyone slipping through the cracks. Plus, we can enable our clients to extend common network configurations across numerous IP Office sites. As a result, not only will we be more productive and efficient in our own operation, but we can further differentiate CCI as a provider of excellent customer support.\" \b \u001d  According to John Vincent, director, retail marketing, Avaya, retail chains, in particular, normally segment their stores by size, type, brand and market, which requires customization to meet local market needs. \"With the Avaya Integrated Management for IP Office, any type of business with IP Office at its branches can create a variety of different templates, each one supporting ten, hundreds or thousands of stores,\" he said. \b \u001d  \"Total cost of ownership is a critical aspect of deploying large scale networks,\" Vincent said. \"With Avaya Integrated Management for IP Office, businesses can deploy the same configurations and policies across all relevant locations without having to configure each location individually, which saves labor time, reduces the possibility for configuration errors -- and frees the IT staff to handle other aspects of running the systems.\" \b \u001d  The tool also contains a management console that displays a topology view of all IP Office systems in the network.  The IT staff can use the tool to track and optimize network performance, view voice traffic, automatically upgrade software, and reboot locations remotely, which can reduce on-site maintenance visits. \b \u001d  \"It's important for large businesses to master a single set of management tools to manage their entire network, including their smaller retail locations and their regional and national centers, such as contact centers,\" said Vincent. \"With Avaya Integrated Management, large retailers can avoid the need for separate management tools, which, in turn, eliminates other costs, such as additional servers in the network needed to run disparate management tools, and the staff training time required to learn how to use the tools and maintain them.\" \b \u001d  Avaya Integrated Management for IP Office can be used to administer and manage the IP Office portfolio. The portfolio, which includes several models to fit any size store location, includes: \b \b \b    -- Avaya IP Office Small Office Edition, for up to 28 users. This system \b       provides smaller locations with the types of business features -- such \b       as built-in firewall for network security, Internet access, wireless \b       connectivity, advanced messaging capabilities, and six way calling -- \b       that are usually available only with larger, more complex systems. \b \b    -- IP Office 406, designed for up to 190 extensions. \b \b    -- IP Office 412, which supports up to 360 users. \b \b \u001d  The Avaya Integrated Management for IP Office is projected to be available in the first quarter of 2007 from certified Avaya resellers. Pricing starts at $3,950 and will vary depending upon the number of branch stores or locations for a business. \b \b    About Avaya \b \u001d  Avaya Inc. designs, builds and manages communications networks for more than one million businesses worldwide, including over 90 percent of the FORTUNE 500(R). Focused on businesses large to small, Avaya is a world leader in secure and reliable Internet protocol telephony systems and communications software applications and services. \b \u001d  Driving the convergence of voice and data communications with business applications -- and distinguished by comprehensive worldwide services -- Avaya helps customers leverage existing and new networks to achieve superior business results.

But by combining fundamental analysis with techniques borrowed from the day traders, we've found five stocks that will give your portfolio a caffeine jolt.] \b \u001d  CARL MARKER HAS BEEN A VALUE INVESTOR for more than two decades, searching for beat-up companies with rising earnings. And a glance at the stocks in the portfolio of his IMS Capital Value fund, which is dotted with insurers, grocers and home builders, offers no hint that he has ever strayed from a strict Warren Buffett approach. \u001d  Dig a little deeper, however, and you'll find that Marker shares some strategies with the hyperkinetic Jim Cramer. No, he's not throwing chairs or mugging for the camera. But he is using some stock-picking strategies that his peers in the value-investing world may find alarming: Marker closely monitors  Wall Street analysts' earnings forecasts, for instance, and tracks the momentum of share prices. Traders use such data to capitalize on a stock's short-term movements, which is a far cry from the fundamental analysis that value investors perform to find stocks at bargain prices. \u001d  These days it's not easy for a value investor to find a bargain. In recent years the line between value stocks and growth stocks has become increasingly blurred, with value investors scooping up traditional growth stocks such as Cisco Systems and Oracle, while growth investors are buying value stalwarts such as Caterpillar and Boeing. Meanwhile, investors like Marker are digging through the sleepy discount bins for stocks that are ready to rise and shine. \u001d  And therein lies the challenge: You can be right in your analysis that a stock is deeply undervalued, but without a catalyst it can take years for the investment to wake up. That's where the day-trading strategies come in. While value managers seldom pay attention to Wall Street's buy and sell ratings, they do take notice when analysts raise or lower their earnings forecasts -- and with good reason. A change in expectations often indicates tangible changes are under way that will affect the stock price. According to Emory University finance professor Narasimhan Jegadeesh, stocks of companies whose earnings estimates have been raised outperform  those of companies whose estimates have been cut-by six percentage points over the following six months. \u001d  The research is even more compelling when applied to value stocks alone. Josef Lakonishok, a professor at the University of Illinois, pioneered this investment strategy in the 1980s and later made it and other behavioral-finance principles the basis of LSV Asset Management, a firm he cofounded in 1994. Since little is expected of battered stocks, Lakonishok found, it doesn't take much good news to boost them. Investors, meanwhile, expect growth stocks to be perfect, leaving them vulnerable to even the slightest disappointment. \u001d  Another technique borrowed from short-term investors: seeking out stocks that have been marching higher. While it might seem that value managers would avoid stocks that have already begun to move up, research has shown that stocks in the early stages of a rebound tend to keep rising. \u001d  This sounds like a beautiful combination to us, so we started our search for stocks that were under-valued according to one or more traditional metrics, such as price/earnings, price/sales or price/cash flow. We then narrowed the list by looking for companies for which analysts have been raising their 2007 earnings estimates and whose stocks have been climbing in the past three months. All signs suggest these companies are awakening from their slumber. \b \u001d  Limited Brands (LTD, $31) \u001d  RETAILER LIMITED BRANDS' crown jewels, Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, generate significant cash and boast mega-brand recognition. Now that this former growth darling has conquered just about every mall in the U.S., however, investors have stepped aside, worried that new growth may be hard to come by. But the Columbus, Ohio-based firm has begun to make believers out of retailing analysts. And the stock, which has spent the past several years bouncing around in the teens and low $20s, has begun climbing higher. That's just the type of price momentum that investors like Neil Hennessy of the Hennessy Funds want to see over a three- or six-month period because it suggests a company has hit an inflection point, which he says is like starting a baseball game with a two-run lead. \u001d  After spending two decades spinning off divisions like Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Too, the company agreed in November to buy Canadian intimate-apparel retailer La Senza for $628 million -- its first major acquisition since the mid-1980s. The purchase sets the stage for a push abroad. While Victoria's Secret enjoys international recognition, thanks to its scantily clad models, it does not yet have a retail presence abroad. The La Senza purchase brings in a management team with global experience that will help with an international push, says James Benson, who covers the company for Harris Associates. \u001d  Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret make up about 70 percent of Limited's $11 billion in expected 2006 sales, and recently, the two chains have been posting eye-popping gains in sales at stores that have been open at least a year -- 13 percent and 18 percent, respectively -- levels not seen in years. Even the company's more staid chains, like Express and The Limited, are improving as new management tries to reconnect with customers who were alienated when the brands moved too far upscale. \u001d  Perhaps the most exciting news for investors is the company's plan to expand existing Victoria's Secret stores, signaling that it's not just a mega-brand but also one with growth still ahead of it. Benson expects the retailer to create more stores within stores, focusing on its youth brand, Pink, for example, and on beauty products. \"Its opportunities are probably bigger than people think,\" he says, noting that these changes should continue to drive growth for the next three to five years. If analysts' estimates are any guide, Wall Street has begun to share Benson's optimism. Earnings estimates for 2007 have risen 7 percent in recent months, to $1.94 a share. That's 12 percent over what the company is expected to report for 2006. \b \u001d  Norfolk Southern (NSC, $51) \u001d  REMEMBER THE little engine that could? Norfolk Southern, which operates up and down the Eastern Seaboard, shares some traits with that classic \"I think I can, I know I can\" story. For example, concerns about an economic slowdown and slowing freight volumes weighed on the company's stock in the third quarter of last year, in part because of the company's exposure to autos and building materials. While some investors backed away, others were convinced that the company still had a head of steam. \"It's in a growth industry that has to pull out of its cyclical image,\" says Don Hodges of the Hodges Fund, noting that there is plenty of demand for some of the other goods Norfolk hauls, including ethanol, coal and container shipments from Asia. \u001d  Norfolk pulled through to deliver a third-quarter earnings surprise even as freight volume growth decelerated, with profit climbing 38 percent, to $416 million, or $1.02 a share -- 20 cents higher than analysts' expectations. Its ability to raise prices and its operating prowess helped offset slowing volume. Andrew Meister, transport and industrials analyst at Thrivent Financial, says that even if volume softens, Norfolk could perform well because it can continue to find better ways to run the railroad. \u001d  Norfolk's long-term focus has set it apart from peers in the past couple years. During the last downturn, the company invested in its network, positioning it to benefit from a surge in global trade and an economic rebound in the U.S. With that investment behind it, Norfolk now has the flexibility to reduce capital spending if volume slows further. \"They have enough levers to pull in a down cycle so that it won't get ugly,\" says T. Rowe Price industrials and rail analyst Peter Bates. \u001d  The Norfolk, Va.-based firm has also been buying back stock and is generating plenty of cash for additional purchases, which should serve as another catalyst for the next 12 to 18 months, Bates says. In the past three months, analysts' consensus earnings estimates for 2007 have risen 9 percent, to $4 a share, suggesting 12 percent growth. The stock has come off near-term lows, but Bates thinks Norfolk can keep chugging ahead. \"I don't think all the good news is in the stock,\" he adds. \"I think it can earn more than $4 in 2007 and in 2008 and can still grow beyond that.\" \b \u001d  Grupo Televisa (TV, $28) \u001d  IN A DRAMA worthy of one of its popular telenovelas, Televisa, the world's largest producer of Spanish-language programming, has been sparring with its partner Univision, the U.S. media company, which put itself up for sale last year. First, Televisa, which owns 11 percent of Univision, joined in the bidding, worrying investors that it might overpay for the company. That chapter ended with Televisa's losing out to a group of private-equity investors. \u001d  Then, in a surprising twist, Wall Street took a closer look at Televisa's core business prospects. In the past three months, analysts have raised their 2007 earnings estimates more than 9 percent, to $1.36 a share, and the stock has climbed 46 percent. But it's too soon to change the channel, according to Credit Suisse Latin American media analyst Andrew Campbell. He sees several catalysts that can drive Televisa's shares even higher. \u001d  The company's core broadcasting business continues to generate an impressive profit margin of 50 percent and could benefit from losing Univision to other suitors. Because of its close ties, Univision enjoyed sweetheart rates for Televisa's wildly popular programming. But now that their relationship has changed, Univision may have to pay up, says Guzman & Co. media analyst Philip Remek. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 06:03 ET (11:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ef07d855c7827688201fa82dde2ae960","symR":["UNS.T","CA90457D1006"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Uni-Select Names Richard Roy As Oper Chief >UNS.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T21:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UNS.T","CA90457D1006"],"IndustryCodes":["DIB","SVC","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  BOUCHERVILLE, QUEBEC--(CCNMatthews - Jan. 15, 2007) - Uni-Select Inc.

(WJA.T) launched multi-flight passes for frequent flyers last year and have found them to be enormously popular. \u001d  \"They've surpassed our wildest expectations,\" said Deborah Knight, WestJet's spokeswoman. The airline was so pleased by the response to last year's flight-pass program for the Golden Triangle of Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa that it currently has one on offer. \u001d  And Charlie McKee, Air Canada's vice-president of marketing, said the airline has been \"so encouraged by the consumer uptake\" on its latest pass promotion that it's likely to do something similar soon. In the meantime, it has 14 other pass products available. \u001d  Travel passes aren't new nor are they novel. Anyone who uses a commuter train or subway has seen them. VIA Rail offers a series of passes - 10 round trips between two cities for a set price, as well as time-limited passes for unlimited travel in a specific region. \u001d  Even flight passes have been around for a while. Air Canada launched its Rapidair pass in the Golden Triangle in 2004 aimed at business travellers. \u001d  But the idea has really taken off in the past year, as heated competition, low ticket prices, and the battle for customer loyalty spurred Canada's two main airlines to increase what McKee calls the \"value proposition.\" \u001d  \"There are some fabulous deals to be had out there,\" says Rick Erickson, an independent airline consultant. \"These passes might work wonderfully for you if you know how to take advantage of them.\" \u001d  The Welcome Aboard pass that was available late last year is a prime example. For as little as C$222 a month for two months, a passenger could fly between two western Canadian cities - say Vancouver and Calgary - up to eight times each month. That compares to a typical round-trip price of C$273. \u001d  The catch was that travel was only allowed on Tuesdays and Saturdays, which could limit their attraction to people on a traditional business schedule. \u001d  But the offer was sufficiently hot that Web sites such as redflagdeals.com and travelzoo.ca were raving about the deal. \"We could barely believe this deal,\" Travelzoo Canada said. \u001d  The deal was \"pretty extraordinary,\" McKee admits, but then adds that it was such a hit, Air Canada is likely to replicate it in some way. \u001d  Even at such a significant discount, the flight passes are a good thing for the airline, he says, as they're a great tool to drive customer loyalty. \u001d  \"What we have done is create a product which is compelling enough that consumers are willing to commit their business to us,\" he says. \"The incremental share of their travel they're giving us more than compensates for any discounting that we do.\" \u001d  Besides, the Welcome Aboard deal built up traffic on the two weakest travel days of the week, McKee says. As Erickson notes, there's nothing more perishable than an airline seat: once the plane takes off, there's no way it can be filled. \u001d  For customers, McKee says, the passes offer convenience as they eliminate the need to search for the best flight. There's also \"price predictability\" in that the cost of flying is pre-determined, which could be a definite advantage for a business. They also simplify the booking process. \u001d  Most flight passes offer about a 30% savings on regular ticket prices, more if used extensively. But not always, and there's the rub. \u001d  WestJet's Travel Pass, for example, costs C$1,700 for 10 one-way flights in the Golden Triangle. The pass is transferable, so can be used by more than one person. \u001d  But given the intense fare wars in that region these days with the launch of commuter airline Porter, one-way tickets between Toronto and Ottawa on WestJet currently range from C$102 to C$152. Air Canada's Rapidair pass, which offers 10 one-way flights involving a wider range of cities, is C$2,290. However, the cheapest Tango flight between Toronto and Ottawa right now can be had for C$112 including all taxes and fees. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.aircanada.com and http://www.westjet.com \b \u001d  -Monica Gutschi, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2017; monica.gutschi@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 12:00 ET (17:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ef9aa4c2ce21931798ddb29920316d33","symR":["SNCI"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Sonic Innovations and Audigy Group Announce New Support Agreement","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T21:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SNCI"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Sonic Innovations, Inc.

(OTEX) confirmed it missed the deadline to file an 8-K report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but it downplayed the missed deadline, saying the filing involves the disclosure of historical financial results of recently acquired Hummingbird Ltd. \u001d  \"The delayed filing relates to Hummingbird's financial results prior to its acquisition by Open Text on Oct. 2, so it's historical, and it in no way impacts the progress of integrating the operations of the combined company,\" Open Text's head of investor relations, Greg Secord, told Dow Jones. \u001d  Secord added that the integration is on track. He declined to say why the 8-K is late or when the filing will be made. \u001d  In a research note last week, Canaccord Adams' Peter Misek said Open Text closed its acquisition of Hummingbird Oct. 2 and the 8-K was due Dec. 18. While the delay may simply mean that Open Text is taking longer than expected to perform the necessary accounting work to integrate both companies' financial statements, it's also possible that Open Text discovered accounting issues at Hummingbird, he said. \u001d  \"These issues could potentially include a requirement to write off certain goodwill or deferred revenue from the balance sheet,\" he said. \u001d  Secord declined to comment on the issues raised by Misek. \u001d  Before being acquired by Open Text, Hummingbird had about US$200 million worth of goodwill on its balance sheet, Misek said. \"We await management to provide an update to the 8-K status or provide additional information regarding the current integration of Hummingbird,\" Misek said. \"Considering that this filing deadline has passed by a number of weeks, this could potentially cause a ripple effect and delay other filings.\" \u001d  Open Text said last week it plans to report its fiscal second-quarter financial results Feb. 8, suggesting that its ability to make future regulatory filings isn't in jeopardy, analysts said. The fact that Open Text is set to release its second-quarter results also suggests that the contents of the pending 8-K won't affect the quarter or subsequent quarters, analysts said. \u001d  And it's the future of the combined entity that interests the Street, analysts said. While a substantial goodwill writedown may raise questions about the price Open Text paid for Hummingbird, it shouldn't affect the firm's ability to generate cash flow in the future, analysts said. \u001d  Still, the Street is wary of Open Text, which has had several earnings disappointments in recent years and difficulty integrating its only other major acquisition, Ixos Software AG. Open Text acquired 88% of Ixos, a German software firm, in 2004. \u001d  As well, Open Text disclosed in September that the SEC is reviewing the firm's method of accounting for acquisition-related costs. Open Text said the review relates to the \"timing and process of obtaining the l00% of shares of Ixos and Gauss (Interprise AG) in light of the rules around acquiring minority shares in Germany.\" Open Text acquired 75% of Gauss, also a German software firm, in 2003. \b   Company Web Site: http://www.opentext.com \b \b   -Stuart Weinberg, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2026; \b   stuart.weinberg@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 16:13 ET (21:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f058883267cbb72219e181f3d14bfcda","symR":["TBIO"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Transgenomic Inc.

(NASDAQ: MRCY), the market share leader in COTS modules for aerospace and defense applications, announced its new Echotek(TM) Series ECV4- 2 family of mixed-signal PMC and XMC (the next-generation PMC) modules at the Bus & Board Conference in Long Beach, CA. The ECV4-2, with input clock capability up to 1.5 GHz, is the highest performing digital receiver in an XMC form factor in the industry. \b \u001d  Echotek Series products lead the mixed-signal industry in extracting clear signals from electronic clutter, forming a bridge between the realms of analog signals and digital processing. After an analog signal is received by an antennae or other sensor, it must be digitized and manipulated into a form amenable to signal processing. The challenge, and the key to successful applications, is to manage this transformation in real time while maintaining the integrity of the original signal. \b \u001d  \"The ECV4-2 is unique in delivering powerful and flexible Virtex(TM)-4 based digital receiver capability in a space-efficient PMC/XMC form factor,\" said Gary J. Turchetta, General Manager of the Echotek Product Group at Mercury. \"It also continues the Echotek tradition of delivering the finest signal integrity available anywhere, as measured by SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) or SFDR (spur-free dynamic range).\" \b \u001d  Multi-module configurations can be created supporting synchronized receiver functions, optimized for beamforming and direction-finding as required by radar, SIGINT, ELINT, medical imaging and communications. There are more than a dozen members of the Echotek Series ECV4-2 family, each providing unique I/O connectivity and functionality. Every model is configured with a specific set of A/D or D/A converters addressing a defined bandwidth and frequency for data conversion. Both PMC and XMC modules are available in two- and four-channel versions, with A/D, D/A, and transceiver configurations. \b \u001d  Processing power is delivered by a Xilinx(R) Virtex(TM)-4 FPGA (field- programmable gate array). This FPGA allows users to run customized algorithms such as digital down/up conversion (wideband or narrowband), Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), and filtering directly on the ECV4-2. Modules are available in air-cooled or conduction-cooled versions. \b \u001d  \"The Mercury ECV4-2 well illustrates how Virtex-4 compresses the power budget and footprint of a wideband digital receiver into the space of an XMC mezzanine card,\" said Per Holmberg, Director of Programmable Digital Solutions Marketing at Xilinx, Inc. \"Reconfigurable devices are revolutionizing signal processing applications by providing significant performance density and lower power than alternatives.\" \b \u001d  The Echotek ECV4-2 is a member of the ECV4 product series, which includes the ECV4-RFT selected for EDN magazine's Hot 100 Products of 2006 (http://www.edn.com/article/CA6399100.html).

The Lancaster, New York-based company employs approximately 130 and had revenues of $18 million in 2006. Earnings are expected to be accretive to Parker in the first full year.  Terms of the deal were not disclosed. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/19990816/PHLOGO ) \b \u001d  Airtek will operate as part of Parker's global filtration business with results reported within the company's Industrial North America segment.  John Oelslager, President of Parker's Filtration Group, said, \"Airtek significantly adds to our ability to provide customers with a complete compressed air treatment package from the compressor to the point of use.  The acquisition also creates additional demand for filters, replacement elements and accessories in the aftermarket segment of our business.  We welcome our colleagues from Airtek and look forward to their future performance as part of Parker.\" \b \u001d  Airtek Chief Operating Officer Mike Arno added, \"Parker is the ideal partner to help take Airtek's business to the next level.  We believe Parker's proven track record of successfully integrating acquisitions bodes well for both our employees and customers.  We look forward to continued profitable growth.\" \b \u001d  The treatment of compressed air is vital, as contaminants and water vapor within the air become concentrated during the compression process.  Failure to clean and dry the air prior to entering a process distribution system can result in damage to air operated equipment, decreased production, corroded pipes, spoiled product, ruined processes, and higher energy costs. \b \u001d  With annual sales exceeding $9 billion, Parker Hannifin is the world's leading diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision-engineered solutions for a wide variety of commercial, mobile, industrial and aerospace markets.  The company employs more than 57,000 people in 43 countries around the world.  Parker has increased its annual dividends paid to shareholders for 50 consecutive years, among the top five longest-running dividend-increase records in the S&P 500 index.

Among other factors which may affect future performance are: changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers or suppliers, including delays or cancellations in shipments, or significant changes in financial condition, uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions, threats associated with and efforts to combat terrorism, competitive market conditions and resulting effects on sales and pricing, increases in raw material costs that cannot be recovered in product pricing, the Company's ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits, and global economic factors, including manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as interest rates.

This acceptance signifies the start of the review process of the NDA with a \"prescription drug user fee act\" goal date set for 30 August 2007. Subject to the approval of the drug by the FDA, Ipsen's partner Tercica will market Somatuline(R) Autogel(R) in the United States. \b \u001d  Somatuline(R) Autogel(R) has already received a marketing approval in Canada on 17 July 2006, and is currently being launched by Tercica under its distribution licence agreement with Ipsen, holder of the product's rights. \b \b   About Somatuline(R) Autogel(R) \b \u001d  Somatuline(R) Autogel(R) is an injectable sustained-release formulation containing lanreotide, a somatostatin analogue. Somatuline(R) was initially developed and continues to be used in the treatment of acromegaly (a disorder caused by the over-production of growth hormone secondary to a benign tumour of the anterior pituitary gland) and is also approved, outside of North America, for the treatment of symptoms associated with neuroendocrine tumours (particularly of carcinoid type). Somatuline(R) Autogel(R) formulation does not contain any excipient other than water and releases lanreotide over a period of at least 28 days. The product is conditioned in a pre-filled syringe for convenient administration. In acromegaly, Somatuline(R) is used primarily when circulating levels of growth hormone remain elevated following surgery or radiotherapy, and lowers growth hormone and IGF-1 levels, thus controlling disease progression and relieving the symptoms associated with active acromegaly. \b \u001d  At 31 December 2005, Somatuline(R) and Somatuline(R) Autogel(R) had marketing authorisations in over 50 countries (including 26 in Europe) for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors and in six countries (including 2 in Europe) for the treatment of acromegaly alone. \b \u001d  According to epidemiology data (source: Alexander L, Clin Endocrinol 12:71-79, 1980 & Bengtsson BA, Acta Med Scan 223:327-335, 1988), acromegaly affects approximately 15,000 people in the United States and Canada and is most commonly found in middle-aged adults. Studies estimate an all-cause mortality rate associated with acromegaly of at least twice the normal population, and a reduction in life expectancy of 5 to 10 years. \b \b   About Ipsen \b \u001d  Ipsen is a European pharmaceutical group with over 20 products on the market and a total worldwide staff of nearly 4,000.

Standard & Poor's views the fund's distribution profile assessment (DPA) as moderately aggressive based on our expectations for adjusted funds from operations in 2007 of about 100% of targeted distributions, as well as for very low overall variability of cash flows. The outlook is stable. \u001d  \"The stability rating reflects the sustainable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams from the fund's conventional pipelines and oil sands pipelines, which are partially offset by higher variability in about two-thirds of its midstream business,\" said Standard & Poor's stability analyst Joe Morin. \u001d  The strong sustainability of Pembina's distributable cash flows reflects the relatively predictable revenue and margin characteristics of the conventional pipelines business and the oil sands pipelines, as well as the ethylene storage contract within the midstream business. Sustainability is further supported by average financial risk, given a moderate level of debt; total adjusted debt to capital was about 44% at Sept. 30, 2006. We expect the capital structure to remain stable as the C$338 million Horizon Pipeline is expected to be financed with about 50% debt. \u001d  Variability of cash flows is expected to be very low, with the greatest source of variability expected from a portion of the midstream business. This portion of Pembina's midstream business excludes the long-term ethylene storage contract, accounts for about two-thirds of cash flows for the midstream segment, and is expected to be highly variable. Nevertheless, on a consolidated basis, the midstream segment accounts for only 22% of operating income currently and, therefore, consolidated variability should remain very low. \u001d  The stable outlook reflects Standard & Poor's view that Pembina's business mix will remain relatively unchanged, with the vast majority of revenues and cash flows generated by the stable conventional pipelines business and contractual obligations in the oil sands pipelines. Although the rating factors in the potential for growth in the midstream segment, an increase in cash flows from noncontracted and, hence, more volatile cash flows in that segment of more than 30% of consolidated cash flows could be a catalyst for a negative outlook. The stable outlook also factors in expectations that the Horizon Pipeline and any other future material expansions or acquisitions are financed such that leverage remains stable. A positive stability rating action is unlikely in the near or medium term, given expectations for exposure to variable cash flows in the midstream segment. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 10:45 ET (15:45 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"fa10ac5b9e4f9d5c2f17e21d8f85cabf","symR":["SZR.UN.T","VTR","CA86770Q1090"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Sunrise REIT Spcl Committee Recommends Hldrs Accept Ventas Bid","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T13:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SZR.UN.T","VTR","CA86770Q1090"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 08:47 ET (13:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fa1fd03931206cd0608cd748869ccac8","symR":["FGOVF","ITF.T","CA3564551057"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Freegold Sampling Returns 617 g/t -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T15:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FGOVF","ITF.T","CA3564551057"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS"],"Story":"\u001d  This news release contains certain \"Forward-Looking Statements\" within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Sales were up 8.8% to EUR832.1 million from EUR764.4 million, boosted by the contribution of U.S.-based peer Imagistics, which Oce acquired in Nov. 2005. \u001d  Oce's full year sales came in at EUR3.11 billion, a rise of 16.2% from sales of EUR2.68 billion in the fiscal year 2005. However, excluding acquisition and exchange rate effects, the sales increase was only 0.3% year on year. \u001d  The figures are provisional and unaudited, Oce said. \u001d  CEO Van Iperen admits that organic sales growth disappointed in 2006, mainly due to a weak performance in the third quarter of the year. Van Iperen said that the company is targeting a pickup in sales growth in 2007. \u001d  \"Sales growth is oxygen in this very competitive market,\" Van Ipereren said, adding that he expects \"the market to remain competitive in 2007.\" \u001d  During a press conference, Van Iperen said that Oce is sticking to its long-term goals of organic sales growth of at least 5%, with an operating margin before interest and taxes, or EBIT-margin, of 6% in 2010. In 2006, the company's EBIT-margin was about 3.3%. \u001d  To meet its margin target in this competitive environment, Oce relies on the introduction of innovative products with higher margins but also on better cost control. \u001d  The company is launching a cost-savings program which \"should lead to cost savings of EUR75 million to EUR100 million over a period of four years,\" Van Iperen said. \u001d  Van Iperen didn't rule out that the program could bring job cuts: \"It's too early to get into details, but I can't exclude job cuts,\" he said. \u001d  Analysts had expected net profit to come in at EUR20.8 million on sales of EUR838 million and they call the figures in general better than expected, although sales came in below their estimates. However, they remain skeptical on the long-term prospects for Oce. \u001d  \"The long term picture remains difficult, Van Lanschot's Marc Kennis said. Kennis rates shares at hold. \u001d  Oce's fourth-quarter operating income before interest and taxes, or EBIT, came in at EUR43.8 million, from EUR70.6 million a year ago. That brings Oce's full year EBIT at EUR102.2 million, while the company guided for a full year EBIT of around EUR90 million. \u001d  The Venlo, Netherlands-based company, whose main competitors are U.S.-based Xerox Corp.

(MSFT) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) at bay. So while the jury is still out, some analysts say investors would be well advised to be cautious with SAP. \u001d  \"We believe in the near term, shares could trade down...releasing some of its premium valuation in comparison to global peers Microsoft and Oracle,\" said John Segrich, a London-based analyst at JP Morgan. \"We are increasingly coming to the view that license growth may settle at a lower level than previously anticipated.\" \u001d  At 1100 GMT, SAP shares were up EUR0.46, or 1.2%, at EUR39.31. The stock took a nosedive Friday of 8% to EUR39, following Thursday's warning after the close of the Frankfurt stock exchange that a weak fourth quarter will cause the company to miss its full-year software license sales target. SAP American Depositary Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange closed Friday at $50.02, having fallen $5.63, or 10%, in Thursday's trading to $48.50. \u001d  Part of the skepticism expressed by some industry experts is based on SAP's dependence for growth on the success of an upcoming software product especially tailored for mid-size companies, which is slated to be launched around mid-2007. SAP's core customer base, which consists of the world's largest corporations, is saturated, so the mid-market segment is key to SAP's future growth. \u001d  But while SAP dominates the top segment of the market together with Oracle and Microsoft, competition is more fierce in the mid-market, where a host of smaller firms such as Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM), i2 Technologies Inc. (ITW), NetSuite Inc. and RightNow Technologies Inc. (RNOW) enjoy success with more nimble and less-expensive software. SAP has said its upcoming product should rival the offerings of these smaller firms. \u001d  The mid-market software is also one of the final releases of its new product lineup, which it has been developing since the beginning of this decade. SAP, founded in 1972, has already released its NetWeaver platform and MySAP ERP 2005, designed to replace its first two generations of enterprise resource planning software, R/2 and R/3. \u001d  \"We are skeptical about SAP's prospect in the mid-market,\" said analyst Patrick Walraven of U.S. investment bank JMP Securities, noting that SAP is late with the introduction of an on-demand product, with which rivals like Salesforce.com and i2 Technologies have booked notable successes. \u001d  SAP has said its upcoming mid-market product will also include an on-demand option, which offers business-software that can be accessed via the Internet rather than being installed on corporations' computers on the premise. \"Hopefully, this offering will make SAP more competitive, but it remains to be seen,\" added Walraven. \u001d  JMP had cut its rating for SAP following Thursday's warning to market underperform from market perform, with a price target for SAP ADRs of $42. \u001d  SAP's warning Thursday resulted from a weak fourth-quarter performance in the U.S. and the Asia-Pacific region, in part because of the weakening U.S. dollar against the euro. Fourth-quarter software sales rose 7% to EUR1.26 billion from EUR1.18 billion, short of analysts' forecast of EUR1.35 billion. \u001d  Also, SAP had already suffered from lackluster single-digit sales growth in the second quarter, which all in all resulted in a full-year rise of 13.5% at constant currencies, falling short of the at least 15% that SAP had promised at the beginning of 2006. \u001d  SAP has yet to give an in-depth explanation for the fourth-quarter miss, and is expected to do this on Jan. 24, alongside its fourth-quarter and full-year 2006 report and a new financial outlook for 2007. \u001d  Meanwhile, some analysts advise investors to stay cautious. \u001d  \"We believe stepping to the sidelines is prudent pending better visibility on the effectiveness of (the new products),\" an analyst with CIBC World Markets wrote Friday in a research note in which he downgraded the stock to sector performer from sector outperformer. \u001d  Following Thursday's warning, more and more analysts are forecasting slowing growth of SAP's software sales in 2007, despite Chief Executive Henning Kagermann's insistence in recent quarters that the company expects  growth to accelerate in the coming years. \u001d  CIBC forecasts growth in 2007 to come in at 11%, JMP projects a 10% increase and JP Morgan, also factoring in its expectation for \"a slowing environment for (global) IT spending in the coming six to 12 months,\" expects SAP's sales to grow at around 12%. \u001d  This will likely eat into the valuation premium SAP has enjoyed in recent years compared with Oracle and Microsoft, due to its higher growth profile. SAP stock was trading on a multiple of 28 times average 2006 earnings forecasts before Thursday's warning. This compares with a multiple of 18 for Oracle and 21 for Microsoft. \u001d  But further out, some of today's harshest critics expect SAP to overcome the current slump. \u001d  JP Morgan's Segrich, who for now has an underweight rating on SAP stock with a EUR35 price target, said: \"Longer term, we remain confident in SAP's growth model and management's ability to execute.\" \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sap.com \b \u001d  -By Joon Knapen, Dow Jones Newswires; +49-30-28884127; joon.knapen@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 06:44 ET (11:44 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fada2d6e767b1538c6324c596934c61a","symR":["SZR.UN.T","VTR","CA86770Q1090"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Sunrise REIT Agrees To Be Acquired By Ventas For A Price Equivalent To C$15.00/Unit>SZR.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T13:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SZR.UN.T","VTR","CA86770Q1090"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  TORONTO, Jan. 15, 2007 /CNW/ - Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust (\"Sunrise REIT\") (TSX:SZR.UN) announced today that Ventas, Inc.

The Special Committee and the board of trustees of Sunrise REIT recommend that unitholders vote in favour of the transaction. \b \b\"We are proud of the outstanding premium that we have been able to deliver to our unitholders through this transaction.

MacLatchy, President and CEO of Sunrise REIT. \b \b\"Over the past year, the Board, together with its financial advisors, reached the conclusion that our units were undervalued in the market and that there was an opportunity to unlock significant value for unitholders.

We have clearly achieved that,\" said Michael Warren, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Sunrise REIT and its Special Committee. \b \b\"We are delighted that we were able to complete this agreement with the Sunrise REIT management team and board, who have done a great job assembling one of the premier private pay senior housing portfolios in North America.

Pursuant to Sunrise REIT's Declaration of Trust, the transaction is subject to the approval of unitholders holding more than 66 2/3% of the units represented at the Special Meeting. \b \bSunrise REIT and Ventas have entered into a mutually beneficial Purchase Agreement which provides that the board of trustees of Sunrise REIT will recommend that its unitholders vote in favour of the transaction at the Special Meeting.

(Nasdaq:QSFT) today announced that a special committee of its board of directors (the \"Special Committee\") has substantially completed its investigation into the company's stock option grant practices and related accounting and reported its principle findings to the company's Board of Directors. \b \u001d  The Special Committee was comprised of two independent disinterested members of the Board and retained independent outside legal counsel, Duane Morris LLP, and forensic consultants, Navigant LLC, to assist in the investigation. In the course of its seven-month investigation, the investigation team reviewed and analyzed more than one million pages of electronic and other documents and conducted interviews of twenty-three current and former officers, directors, employees of and advisors to Quest Software. \b \u001d  The primary focus of the Special Committee's investigation was the company's stock option grant practices and related accounting during the period from the Company's initial public offering in August 1999 to June 30, 2003, with selected testing and sampling before and after that period. The Special Committee's findings included a determination that accounting measurement dates for most of the stock option grants to employees from July 1998 to May 2002 differed from the recorded grant dates. \b \u001d  The results of the investigation confirm the company's determination, as previously announced, that it will restate certain of its historical financial statements to reflect the additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense that should have been recorded with respect to stock option grants whose accounting measurement dates are being revised, or \"misdated stock options.\" The Special Committee's preliminary estimate of the aggregate pre-tax, non-cash stock-based compensation expense arising from its findings is approximately $150 million through the period ended March 31, 2006. The company has not yet determined the tax consequences or monetary tax obligations that will arise from these matters. Management is continuing to analyze the accounting impact of the Special Committee's findings and working to complete the necessary restatements to the company's prior financial reports as soon as practicable. \b \u001d  The Special Committee indicated that both current and former senior management of the company bear varying degrees of responsibility for the deficiencies in the stock option administration practices and related accounting internal controls. The Special Committee made no finding of fraud or intentional misconduct by any current or former employees, officers or directors, and concluded that no further changes in the company's executive officers will be recommended. In addition to certain financial matters described below, the Special Committee also made recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to adoption of \"best practices\" in stock option administrative practices, which will be reviewed and considered by the Compensation Committee. \b \u001d  At the direction of the Special Committee, the company is taking certain additional remedial steps to require that its current and former executive officers eliminate actual and potential benefits received from their receipt of misdated stock options. The Special Committee has directed the company to reprice these stock options to an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the company's common stock as of the corrected accounting measurement dates determined by the Special Committee, and to attempt to recover all or substantial portions of the amount of the after-tax gains these executive officers realized from exercises of these stock options. As of December 31, 2006, outstanding stock options covering approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock have been repriced to levels significantly greater than the current market value of the company's common stock. \b \u001d  The Special Committee and the company continue to cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in response to the SEC's informal inquiry into the company's stock option grant practices. As announced by the company on January 9, 2007, it has requested an extension of its conditional listing status on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. \b \b   About Quest Software, Inc. \b \u001d  Quest Software, Inc. delivers innovative products that help organizations get more performance and productivity from their applications, databases and Windows infrastructure.

rangebound trading early Monday, with the close of U.S. financial markets for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day public holiday expected to keep activity very subdued prior to the Bank of Canada interest rate announcement early Tuesday. \u001d  The U.S. dollar was trading at C$1.1677 at 10:07 a.m. EST (1507 GMT), from C$1.1679 at 8:00 a.m. EST (1300 GMT), and from C$1.1690 late Friday. \u001d  The Canadian dollar's movements thus far Monday have been very narrowly constricted within a C$1.1663 to C$1.1700 trading band, as the absence of U.S. currency players and the approach of the Bank of Canada announcement favors limited and cautious trading. \u001d  A moderately softer global tone for the U.S. dollar coupled with the lingering effects of a technically-driven rebound for the Canadian currency from late last week is seen leaving the Canadian unit with the potential for some follow-through gains, though these are likely to be very modest. \u001d  Matthew Strauss, senior foreign exchange strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto, said in a note to clients that the Canadian dollar could test the C$1.1627 area in line with general U.S. dollar weakness, though the currency remains hampered by an uncertain outlook for commodity prices, especially oil. \u001d  \"With net short Canadian dollar positions at a new historical extreme as of January 9, a relief rally in the Canadian dollar will be well supported,\" Strauss said. \"However, oil's inability to remain well above $53 per barrel could cap any significant Canadian dollar rally.\" \u001d  The Canadian dollar for the balance of Monday's session is seen remaining within a C$1.1635 to C$1.1685 range, according to RBC Capital Markets. \u001d  Canadian bonds are are slightly lower in quiet trading early Monday, with the yield on the benchmark Canadian 10-year bond at 4.13%, unchanged from late Friday's level. \u001d  These are the exchange rates at 10:07 a.m. EST (1507 GMT), 8:00 a.m. EST (1300 GMT),

The announcement was made at the Hawaiian Eye 2007 Meeting held on Kauai, Hawaii and attended by several hundred ophthalmic surgeons. \b \u001d  The AcuFocus ACI 7000(TM) is designed to treat presbyopia, a condition which affects more than 50 million people in the United States. Presbyopia, a part of the normal aging process, reduces the ability of the eye to focus on near objects. Traditionally, most people with presbyopia have had to use reading glasses to improve their near vision. The AcuFocus corneal inlay is designed to treat presbyopia in all patients, including those who have had cataract surgery, and reduce their dependence on reading glasses. \b \u001d  The ACI 7000 corneal inlay is implanted in the cornea under a LASIK flap in a simple outpatient procedure. The device incorporates technology that increases the patient's depth of field, thereby improving near vision. The ACI 7000 has been designed to maintain normal corneal physiology and corneal health. The procedure does not involve tissue removal nor does it permanently alter the cornea, so pre-implant vision can be restored if the inlay is removed. \b \u001d  Recent studies have demonstrated that the ACI 7000 improves near vision in patients who previously didn't require vision correction (emmetropes) as well as those who have had LASIK surgery. Trials are being conducted to study the ACI 7000 in patients with intraocular lenses. \b \u001d  \"Current surgical presbyopic solutions involve compromises that can negatively affect the quality of vision for many patients. The ACI 7000 corneal inlay is designed to remove those compromises through a safe and simple procedure,\" said Daniel S. Durrie, MD., Principal Investigator. \"Moreover, pre-clinical studies performed outside of the United States show excellent early results and high patient satisfaction.\" \b \u001d  \"We're truly excited to collaborate with AcuFocus on the development and delivery of their leading-edge corneal inlay technology,\" said Henry Tung, MD, corporate vice president and head of global surgical strategy for Bausch & Lomb. \"We believe this pioneering technology has the potential to significantly enhance the alternatives available to the large population of presbyopic patients.\" \b \u001d  \"We believe Bausch & Lomb's deep experience in the Eyecare field will enhance our technology significantly,\" said Ed Peterson, president and CEO of AcuFocus, Inc. \"With Bausch & Lomb's investment, we can accelerate and broaden our efforts to bring this exciting technology to refractive surgeons and their patients.\" \b \b   Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. \b \u001d  This news release contains, among other things, certain statements of a forward-looking nature relating to future events or the future business performance of Bausch & Lomb. Such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those concerning the ability of the Company and the parties with which it contracts to develop and introduce products successfully as well as the risk factors listed from time to time in the Company's SEC filings, including but not limited to filings on Form 8-K and on Form 12b-25, each dated November 9, 2006. \b \b   About Bausch & Lomb \b \u001d  Bausch & Lomb is the eye health company, dedicated to perfecting vision and enhancing life for consumers around the world.

(GM) for $4.8 billion. But he indicated that Thales wouldn't balk at trying to take over a business this big. \u001d  Like most of its big competitors, such as U.S.-based Honeywell International Inc. (HON) and Rockwell Collins Corp. (COL), Thales has been a net acquirer in recent years. \u001d  \"These days, everyone is going shopping so as to be able to offer as broad a range of products and services as possible,\" Ranque noted. \u001d  Thales' most recent expansion was a EUR1.7 billion deal to buy Alcatel-Lucent's (ALA) space and transport activities, giving it strong footholds in the markets for satellite and infrastructure systems. \u001d  Thales also plans to buy a 25% stake in French naval shipbuilder DCN for between EUR100 million and EUR150 million. \u001d  Ranque said that if a big acquisition target presents itself - even one as large as GE's purchase of Smiths' operations - Thales would be able to finance such an operation. \u001d  \"If we were faced with an acquisition of several billion dollars, we'd finance it with a mix of debt and equity, by issuing stock on the market,\" Ranque said. \u001d  Ranque also noted that the company's pending acquisitions haven't negatively affected Thales' credit rating. \u001d  He noted that Thales' outstanding debt, which stood at EUR398 million at the end of 2005, had ebbed further over the course of last year. He declined to give a figure for the Dec. 31, 2006, debt level, but observed that \"Thales' debt is practically zero.\" \u001d  Thales won't be giving out audited 2006 earnings figures until March 9. \u001d  Ranque said 2007 is shaping up to be a year of renewed top-line growth for Thales after several years of flat-line revenue. The Alcatel-Lucent acquisition, which still has to be approved by the European Union Commission, will boost Thales' revenue by EUR1.9 billion this year. \u001d  Thales shares closed up 1.4% on Monday at EUR39.90. \b \u001d  -By David Pearson, Dow Jones Newswires; +331 4017 1740, david.pearson@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 15, 2007 14:02 ET (19:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fe4203c60ef881456e774b24bd5b79c3","symR":["402625.FR","BOBJ","FR0004026250"],"date":"2007-01-15","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Business Objects and Savvion Partner to Take Performance-Driven Organizations to the Next Level","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-15T07:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["402625.FR","BOBJ","FR0004026250"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b      Companies to Host Webinar Showcasing How Organizations That \u001d  Combine Business Intelligence and Business Process Management Can \u001d                Achieve Significant Performance Gains \bSAN JOSE, Calif. & SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 15, 2007-- \u001d  Business Objects (Nasdaq:BOBJ)(Euronext Paris ISIN code: FR0004026250 - BOB), the world's leading provider of business intelligence (BI) solutions, and Savvion(R), the industry's leading business process management (BPM) company, today announced a strategic technology partnership.
