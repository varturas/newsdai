Others will be even more surprised if it doesn't. \u001d  Over the past few weeks, Barron's has learned, iMergent's CEO, Donald L. Danks, has told select individual and institutional investors that the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings will beat the estimate of 39-to-41 cents a share set by the one analyst who follows the company by better than 50%. That translates into about 60 cents a share, versus 29 cents in the comparable 2006 period. \u001d  Some people apparently have gotten the good word already. On a tape recording of a conversation heard by Barron's, a voice that sounds like Danks' is heard telling an investor about the earnings, adding that \"net dollar contracts written,\" which is the way the company reports its revenue, will be around $50 million, versus $26 million. \u001d  The recording was made by a person who says he took part in the conversation, who identifies the other speaker as Danks and who contends that others have told him they have had similar discussions with the iMergent CEO. Such conversations would appear to violate Regulation FD of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which mandates that a company can't disclose material information about its operations selectively, but instead must make \"fair disclosure\" to all potentially interested parties -- investors, analysts, brokers -- simultaneously. \u001d  Asked about this Friday afternoon, Danks adamantly denied having spoken with any outsiders about the quarterly earnings. \"I would never give that information to anyone who would use it to trade the stock.\" \u001d  On the recording, the voice that sounds like Danks' tells the other person that a Barron's reporter has contacted him and appears to be working on a positive article about the company. \u001d  Barron's also has learned that analyst Michael E. Shonstrom, who follows iMergent for Emerging Growth Equities, a securities firm in King of Prussia, Pa., has alerted some clients that, based on information from the company, he expects better results than he had forecast. The company has not publicly made such a statement. \u001d  In an April 24 e-mail supporting his 12-month price target of $36 and Buy recommendation for iMergent (ticker: IIG), which late last week traded around 25.50, Shonstrom advised one client that his previously published estimates for 2007's March and June quarters were \"conservative,\" based on new data from the company. His e-mail reads in part: \" . . . in conversations with management, they note that the 9th seminar [sales] team has started off very strongly and that consumer response rates continue to exceed prior metrics . . . .\" \u001d  Neither his description of the results of the sales team nor data about the firm's key metric, which measures the percentage of customers who buy products at iMergent seminars, were mentioned in a research report issued April 30, about a week after the private investor received the e-mail. In February, Shonstrum and Danks appeared on CNBC, extolling the stock and deriding shorts for \"ganging up\" on it. \u001d  Asked about the April 24 e-mail, the analyst says: I don't think it constitutes inside information because [it does] say 'based on conversations with management.' In general, all that I am saying is that they are reiterating what they said at the quarter conference call.\" \u001d  The person who says he tape-recorded his conversation with Danks is short iMergent stock, meaning he's sold borrowed shares in the hope that the price will fall, letting him replace them with shares costing less. \u001d  Why, then, would Danks, who presumably would like the shares to rise -- he owns more than 500,000 -- speak with this person? Probably because this individual previously was long the stock, viewing it as undervalued, and hadn't told Danks that he'd changed his view. He'd turned into a bear after becoming suspicious of the company's business model and fearful that iMergent ultimately would collapse. \u001d  Since the end of the company's third fiscal quarter, on March 31, the shares have risen 30%. The advance has come despite the absence of positive news and in the face of an SEC investigation into iMergent's accounting, plus legal problems on other fronts. \u001d  The company, whose headquarters are in Orem, Utah, stages more than 1,000 day-long seminars each year in the U.S. and abroad through its StoresOnline unit. These seminars are aimed at would-be Internet entrepreneurs. Those who sign up pay, on average, $5,000 and a small monthly fee to iMergent for such things as software to run their Websites, Web-hosting services and advice on online commerce. \u001d  IMergent has been under heavy attack for the past year by short sellers. They've made massive bets that its shares will drop amid the SEC accounting probe, which began in 2005, and private and public lawsuits alleging that the company engages in fraudulent, unfair practices. \u001d  Illinois is suing iMergent in Madison County, Ill., Circuit Court, alleging that it misled workshop participants about the ease of using its e-commerce software and the availability of technical support. Illinois officials want the company to stop selling or promoting its products in the state. Through an attorney, the company calls the charges \"unwarranted.\" \u001d  A spokeswoman for the Florida state attorney general's office says it is pursuing an \"active investigation\" of iMergent. And, Barron's has learned, investigations of iMergent's business practices are at early stages in Oregon and Maryland. \u001d  The company has already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in refunds and legal expenses to defend itself against charges of deceiving consumers (see the box below) in Texas, California, Indiana and Australia. \u001d  In addition, sometime in the next few days -- possibly Wednesday -- Utah could deal the company a potentially heavy blow. Its consumer-protection division is expected to designate iMergent as a \"business opportunity\" provider. That designation would force the company to disclose how much money its customers make from their Websites, how many sites are running, how many are hosted by StoresOnline, and other sensitive financial information that the company claims it doesn't have or doesn't want to reveal for competitive reasons. Danks pledges that he'd fight such a designation \"all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary.\" \u001d  If the success rate for iMergent's online customers were shown to be unfavorable, the information could devastate the company by discouraging prospective customers from signing up. The shorts obviously view this as a possibility. \"The short overhang is incredible,\" says Jamie Halegoua, head trader and a derivatives expert at Goldsmith & Harris, Wall Street financial consultants. \"I've never seen anything like this.\" \u001d  As of March 15, the number of iMergent shares that had been shorted hit a record 7.4 million -- 60% of the 12.4 million outstanding, according Hedge Fund Trades, a Dow Jones online publication. Since then, shorts have suffered more than $50 million in paper losses, the publication says, as the stock has gone up. That's a continuation of an unpleasant trend for the shorts, who've squirmed as the stock has risen over 110% in the past two years, driven by earnings reported to have been growing at a double-digit clip, strong reported cash flow and a net dollar volume of contracts written that bulls believe will grow by more than 50% this year, to over $140 million. \u001d  \"The company fundamentally has a lot of growth opportunity and new products that will generate significant recurring revenues,\" says one of those bulls, Brad Halverson, a fund manager with Troy, Mich.-based Northpointe Capital, one of the stock's largest institutional holders. \"But no one focuses on that.\" \u001d  What the shorts -- and the SEC -- are focused on is the company's business model and its accounting. \u001d  Andrew Left, whose Los Angeles financial Website, Citron Research (formerly Stocklemon.com), has been a persistent thorn in the company's side, says that iMergent uses \"cookie-jar accounting to pad current earnings.\" The company denies that its accounting is improper. \u001d  Left and Danks are old adversaries. Left has been short the stock for two years. In 2005, Danks filed a $15 million defamation suit against him and the Website; it was dismissed in 2006. Left says that he recently has been \"deluged with anonymous hate e-mail from [iMergent] supporters who have been telling me I am wrong about the company and will be proven so when it reports earnings 50% higher than what's been projected for the third quarter.\" And, he asks rhetorically: \"Where did that number come from?\" \u001d  Investor and sports mogul Mark Cuban, who owns the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is another longtime  iMergent bear. Cuban, who once was short the stock but says he no longer is, contends that the company doesn't produce for its customers. \"That means it's not a question of if it collapses, but when,\" he declares. \u001d  In 2005, the SEC forced the company to restate its financial data from 2002 to 2005 and change its accounting from an \"accrual\" to a \"cash\" system, meaning that it had to recognize revenue after it had been received, rather than when it was expected to materialize. If the company had used cash accounting, profit growth wouldn't have been nearly as robust as it had reported. The restatement turned results for iMergent's 2003 and 2004 fiscal years into losses. \u001d  Danks has been reassuring investors that the current SEC probe is basically finished and that the company has been given a clean bill of health. But the agency's recent correspondence with iMergent indicates that the investigation remains ongoing. At issue now is how the company accounts for its contract revenues and its failure to distinguish between cash sales and financed sales. Inclusion of financed sales can paint an overly rosy revenue picture. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"09f8484bd89862de512d6b5afe56dd9e","symR":["MA"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) Follow-Up: A Charge To Risky Peaks","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MA"],"IndustryCodes":["CFN","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Michael Santoli \u001d  Cash is well on its way to being dethroned by plastic, the new king. \u001d  That's the inescapable conclusion to be drawn from MasterCard's stupendous surge in profits, reported last week. The credit-card payment processor uncorked a 67% jump in first-quarter earnings per share, to $1.57, demolishing Wall Street's consensus forecast of $1.15. The bottom-line bounty was driven by a 16.4% rise in the dollar volume of card purchases, a 19.4% increase in transactions and 11% growth in the number of cards issued. \u001d  MasterCard's shares  jumped more than 17% on the news, to 134, thus proving it still is possible to impress holders of a stock that had nearly tripled from its May 2006 offering price of 39. At current prices, however, buyers might want to think twice before whipping out the plastic to pay for more shares. \u001d  Just before its  IPO, Barron's flagged MasterCard, then a cooperative owned by its member banks, as an attractive way to play the global advance of credit- and debit-card use (\"Finally Charging Ahead,\" May 15, 2006). But no one -- us included -- foresaw just how rapidly the company  would be able to accelerate its profit growth. Nor did we expect the stock to ramp to its present lofty valuation, which makes it a much riskier investment than it was a year ago. \u001d  At the time of our story, analysts estimated MasterCard would earn $2.20 a share in 2006 and $2.50 this year. Instead the company booked $3.41 a share last year, and the current forecast for 2007 is $4.28. \u001d  The lesson: Never underestimate the earnings leverage of a duopoly player converting from a sleepy co-op to a profit-seeking entity. \u001d  The  blossoming of earnings expectations, and then some, now is  reflected in MasterCard's stock price. When it first came public,  MasterCard was trading for 17.7 times 2006 profits   and 15.6 times 2007 numbers, based on analysts' estimates at the time. In reality, we know the multiples were far lower, given the company's subsequent profit growth. \u001d  Now the stock is trading for more than 29 times this year's estimate and 25 times the 2008 forecast. A year ago, MasterCard traded at a discount to First Data (FDC), a transaction processor with a roughly comparable business. Now, with First Data about to be acquired in a leveraged buyout for $34 a share, that company fetches 23.2 times expected 2008 earnings, a notable discount to MasterCard. \u001d  This doesn't mean MasterCard has finished its run, but it does suggest that the company will need to keep beating expectations to support its now-aggressive valuation. \u001d  Brisk global economic growth, the long-term trend of plastic replacing cash and the impressive economies of scale enjoyed by MasterCard are all encouraging factors. It's also reassuring that Wall Street isn't wholly enamored of MasterCard shares, even as they continue to hit new highs: A minority of analysts recommend the stock, and there are even four Sell ratings. Short interest, at last report, was also fairly high. \u001d  Despite all that, the risk-reward proposition for the stock has eroded in the past year. At the IPO, the Street was consumed with worry over possible legal liabilities from a lawsuit over alleged anticompetitive practices. Today, investors are fixated on the growth story and inattentive toward the legal risks, even as a trial date of September 2008 has been set and the stock's valuation leaves little room for the slightest disappointment. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"10014d4f85a9e487f94d8fa48493d322","symR":["SCHW"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) Streetwise: Curbed Enthusiasm","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SCHW"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XFFX","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Michael Santoli \u001d  As perennial as the end of April itself, space-filling commentary about the old \"Sell in May and go away\" market-timing strategy is back. \u001d  In years when stocks have been strong heading into May, you often see the subject treated with headlines such as this one: \"Wall Street May Not Abide 'Sell in May' Adage.\" That one was from a newswire dispatch dated April 27 --  of last year. \u001d  Citing a well-known investment-advisory firm, the piece featured the quote, \"The market has proven to be resilient this year, even amid negatives.\" Such negatives were said to include high oil prices and a vigilant Federal Reserve. The same could be said about today's situation, almost word for word. \u001d  We now know the Dow reached a short-term high on May 5, 2006, before tumbling about 8% into mid-June. It then stabilized and took flight through year end. \u001d  In addition to the coincidence of the Dow sitting at a new high on May 5 in each year, there are a few more similarities. This year and last at this time, the S&P 500 was up about 6% year to date. The Dow Transports were at a record in both instances. And the \"global economic and liquidity boom\" was the dominant cover story for the bullish market action, then and now. \u001d  Yet there is a noteworthy difference in the two periods relating to investor psychology and behavior. This year's run to new highs is being met with a bit more skepticism than was last year's. Short interest is appreciably higher, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of overall trading volume. \u001d  Other indicators of investors' gut feel are dissonant, but on balance folks appear less giddy now, a modest net positive for the market. There has been a divergence in investor sentiment between professional investors and the retail set for a long time, and currently it is rather pronounced. \u001d  Surveys that ask active pros what they think have showed steady if not extreme bullishness, and long-only fund managers are and have been \"all in,\" with cash levels at stock funds reported last week to have fallen to a record low of 3.7%. One notable exception to this outburst of optimism: the latest Barron's Big Money poll, featured in last week's issue. \u001d  The American Association of Individual Investors poll, on the other hand, dipped below 35% bulls last week, a level breached only nine times in the past 15 years -- and only once after the market posted a gain in the prior month. Clearly, the broad populace is fighting the market trend. \u001d  None of this insulates the market from succumbing to what most would consider an overdue pullback of some variety, with nearly all buying interest in the past few weeks concentrated in the shares of buyout candidates (real or imagined) and companies that just pulverized -- and not merely beat -- earnings expectations. \u001d  But the abiding reluctance of the public to get excited about stocks in the face of record Dow highs and manic merger activity implies that a correction would probably stop short of being \"The Big One.\" \u001d  Rod David of the trading-advisory service AvidTrader.com, when asked about the recent pattern of abortive early-day selloffs, says, \"pullbacks are short, if not also shallow. This stage of the rally is reliant on pre-existing momentum. It's not that more buyers are being attracted, it's that the rally's existing sponsorship isn't being challenged with much selling pressure.\" That's a positive trend, but one that inevitably ends. \b \u001d  The buyout binge -- now working toward a silly extreme but not there yet -- has driven investors to contemplate once-unthinkable deals. The rail stocks, for instance, are the new trendy targets of catalyst-seeking hedge funds, who contend the rails could vastly increase debt levels, sell their land holdings, buy one another or get bought in leveraged buyouts. \u001d  This underscores the degree to which sectors that have always been considered acutely cyclical -- steel and other materials stocks, machinery makers, energy names -- are now seen as perpetual growers thanks to the global development boom. It's at least worth asking whether this song rhymes with the one a decade ago that said tech wasn't cyclical anymore, even if these Old Economy sectors are nowhere near as extended or expensive as late-'90s tech. \u001d  When Charles Schwab (SCHW) last week postponed an investor meeting, it prompted reflex speculation that some kind of deal might be afoot. Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone wrote to clients that he doubted this, yet added that a longshot LBO was \"more plausible\" on second look, \"primarily due to the fact that a massive flood of capital flowing into private-equity firms [is] washing away traditional rules, policies and constraints.\" \u001d  It's as good an expression of the present ethos as any, in which the onetime smart-money buyout pros become -- as the LBO cycle matures -- the greater fools. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"13e720453c15f095f6f145ae9922ece2","symR":["AMGN","US0311621009"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) Amgen's Got The Goods","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMGN","US0311621009"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Johanna Bennett \u001d  The dip in Amgen shares over drug-safety issues may be overdone. And with multiples bouncing off five-year lows and profits still beating the broader market, Amgen looks cheap at 15.1 times projected profits over the next four quarters. \u001d  The stock trades at discounts of 28% to the biotech industry and 6% to the Standard & Poor's 500. And since hitting a record high in September of 2005, its price has fallen 26%. The culprits include new competition, and fears that Amgen is too big while its pipeline is too thin. Management has admitted safety issues may hinder demand for its blockbuster anemia drugs. \u001d  Yet Cliff Hoover, co-chief investment officer with Dreman Value Management (which bought Amgen shares last quarter), says: \"If investors step back, they see a company of size with good existing drugs and a pipeline,\" adding it \"can grow earnings 10% to 15% annually over the next three years.\" \u001d  With the stock up 16% off a 52-week low on March 29, others appear to agree. Morgan Stanley recently upgraded it to Overweight from Equal Weight. HighMark Capital Management added Amgen to its portfolio last quarter. Still, at \"13 or 14 times potential earnings in 2008, [Amgen] is not being rewarded for its potential,\" says HighMark analyst Robert Kang. \u001d  Amgen is the world's largest biotech company by revenues -- $14.3 billion in 2006 -- mostly from drugs to treat chemotherapy's side effects. Anemia-fighting Epogen and Aranesp sales totaled $6.6 billion last year. Infection-fighters Neupogen and Neulasta added $3.9 billion. Sales of rheumatoid-arthritis drug Enbrel exceeded $2.8 billion. And the Food and Drug Administration approved a new colon-cancer drug in September '06. Amgen spent $3.3 billion on research and development last year. It has almost 50 products in development, including potential blockbuster denosumab, to treat osteoporosis. \u001d  Unfortunately, Aranesp sales of $4 billion last year may have hit a wall. Several new studies suggest increased risk of heart problems and death for patients using drugs like Aranesp in high doses or outside regulatory guidelines. Medicare health plans have stopped covering off-label use, which has led Amgen to reconsider 2007 revenue projections. Amgen says Arenesp and Epogen are safe when used within FDA guidelines. A study released April 20 bolstered that belief. \u001d  Meanwhile, Amgen remains on track to file an application for an important bleeding-disorder treatment. \u001d  The company says cost-cutting will get it to the low end of guidance, issued in January, predicting '07 earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.50. \"I think we are doing the prudent thing here to deliver value to shareholders,\" CEO Kevin Sharer said in a first-quarter-results conference call. Amgen reported net profits of 94-cents a share, up 15% versus the same '06 period, on sales of $3.68 billion. Amgen could even beat Wall Street's $4.31 a share consensus estimates for 2007. \"They are good at managing earnings expectations, and they have beaten guidance consistently over the last three years,\" says Montgomery & Co. analyst Shiv Kapoor. \u001d  Investors will balk if Amgen lowers financial projections this summer or if denosumab stumbles. But with its promising pipeline and profits, Amgen looks healthy. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:10 ET (04:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"19941e4360e3c62841f6e3d6e7626963","symR":["6762.TO","6971.TO","6976.TO","6981.OK","KYO","TDK","JP3249600002","JP3452000007","JP3538800008","JP3914400001"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Japan's TDK To Build Y50B Ceramic Capacitor Plant - Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T18:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6762.TO","6971.TO","6976.TO","6981.OK","KYO","TDK","JP3249600002","JP3452000007","JP3538800008","JP3914400001"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","ITC","X225","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--TDK Corp.

Williams \u001d  Laid low a few years ago by asbestos claims and other woes, McDermott International is enjoying a new power surge. \u001d  The Houston engineering and construction concern, which specializes in providing energy services, has seen profits zoom 400% since 2004, to last year's $342 million, while its stock has more than quadrupled, to 59. After losing almost $1 billion from 2000 through 2003, the 84-year-old firm has been re-energized by a resurgence in exploration and drillingamong oil and gas producers -- driving demand for its offshore platforms and undersea pipelines. Its power-generation unit's emergence from bankruptcy protection last year also is fueling double-digit profit growth. \u001d  With a record order backlog of $7.6 billion, McDermott (ticker: MDR) could rally at least into the mid-60s in the next 18 months. Trading for almost 16 times analysts' projected earnings-per-share estimate for '08, the stock is a relatively inexpensive play on the upturn in energy, oil and gas exploration, and the push for cleaner-burning coal. \u001d  Analysts think McDermott, with its OxyFuel carbon-dioxide separation technology, could be among the winners in the race to provide a commercial solution to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants. \"Both bidding activity and industry fundamentals suggest the company has several years of robust earnings performance ahead of it,\" says Stephen Gengaro, an analyst with Jefferies & Company. \u001d  Analysts project earnings per share will rise 7% this year, to $3.22, and 20% next year, to $3.85. Revenue could grow to $5.8 billion in '08 from the $5.1 billion expected this year. McDermott earned $3.01 a share in '06, on $4.1 billion in revenue. Some analysts expect earnings to grow an average 20% a year for the next three to five years. \u001d  Cost-cutting and an integrated portfolio of services give McDermott an industry-leading operating-profit margin of more than 9%. After retiring $250 million of debt in April, the company is virtually debt-free. McDermott had more than $1 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet as of the end of December, some of which management intends to use for acquisitions. \u001d  Despite such attributes, McDermott is trading below the average price-to-earnings ratio of 20 times '08 estimates afforded other engineering and construction players such as Fluor (FLR), Foster Wheeler (FWLT) and Shaw Group (SGR). Even more appealing is McDermott's price-to-earnings-growth, or PEG ratio, 0.85. \u001d  McDermott's exposure to the volatile offshore-construction market accounts for some of the valuation gap. Also, the stock was hit hard in mid-February when TXU (TXU) suspended contracts with McDermott, after the Texas utility agreed to be bought out by a private-equity group. The loss cuts $1 billion from McDermott's backlog, but analysts expect the company to replace the work with relative ease. \u001d  Even with a 22% gain this year, McDermott's stock is trailing most other energy and construction stocks, but analyst John Rogers of D.A. Davidson thinks more project wins and higher earnings will lift the shares 10% in the next 18 months, to 65, or 18 times his '08 estimate of $3.60 a share: \"The marine-construction and power-generation segments are in the early stages of significant cyclical recoveries, which should lead to both higher revenue and margins.\" \u001d  Founded in 1923 to supply wooden oil rigs to Texas wildcatters, McDermott has three divisions: offshore oil-and-gas construction, government operations and power-generation systems. It is relying on offshore  construction, which accounts for 39% of sales, to power growth. \u001d  With crude fetching $65 a barrel, drillers are rushing to add reserves. Almost 300 oil rigs are operating in international waters, almost double the count from eight years ago, according to oilfield-services company Baker Hughes (BHI). McDermott is going with the flow, so to speak, by building an undersea pipeline in the Caspian Sea and expanding an oil-exploration facility in Qatar. It is bidding on other projects in the Middle East and Asia, as well, and winning some. Marine construction posted a record backlog of $4.1 billion at the end of last year, which the company expects to translate into $2.1 billion of sales this year, up sharply from segment sales of $1.6 billion in 2006. \u001d  Brad Handler of Wachovia Capital Markets says that likely project wins in Mexico, and better asset management in the marine-construction business could spur earnings surprises. He thinks McDermott could earn as much as $4.05 a share in 2008. Handler views the stock's gain in recent days -- it hit a record high Friday -- as a possible sign of \"growing optimism\" among investors that McDermott will beat results for the first quarter when it reports earnings Monday. The Street consensus calls for McDermott to earn $86 million, or 75 cents, for the quarter, on sales of $1.3 billion, up sharply from 48 cents on sales of $645 million in the year-ago period. McDermott officials declined to comment, citing the quiet period before the company's earnings announcement. \u001d  McDermott's other businesses, such as government operations, through which it sells nuclear components and has provided site-management services of high-profile jobs -- like the historic Manhattan Project -- will grow at a decidedly slower pace, but are well-positioned to benefit from an expected increase in the building of new coal and nuclear-power plants in the next few years. \u001d  The power-generation division, which accounts for 46% of sales, is a leading maker of boilers for coal-fired plants, with a 40% market share. That will rise if the public continues to warm to coal, which is cheaper than natural gas and oil. The Department of Energy estimates 153 new coal plants could come online by 2010. \u001d  The power-gen unit has been boosted by the revival of Babcock & Wilcox. McDermott bought B&W in 1978, only to see it crumble under asbestos lawsuits and seek bankruptcy protection in 2000. McDermott excluded B&W from its reported financial statements for six years, before agreeing to settle the claims for more than $900 million in August 2005. \u001d  With B&W back in the fold, McDermott has cranked up its effort to commercializing technologies to cut CO2. McDermott recently inked a deal with American Electric Power (AEP) to test its oxy-coal combustion technology on one of AEP's plants, and will complete a pilot demonstration this summer. Commercialization of the technology, which uses pure oxygen for the combustion of coal, isn't expected until at least 2012. \u001d  It's a crowded field, but McDermott has made it clear it will be a major player. Citing the company's success with reducing other noxious gases such as fly ash and sodium dioxide, Chairman Bruce Wilkinson said on a conference call in March, \"Our engineers often say, 'if you had only told us CO2 was the problem, we would have solved it by now.\"' \u001d  His Texas-size bravado aside, Wilkinson has brought manufacturing and financial discipline, as well as smarter project bidding, to McDermott, since taking over the corner office in 2000. \u001d  A whopping 215% return on equity at the end of last year also attests to his management skill. McDermott's singular focus on energy works when demand is hot, but the business can go south quickly, as it did in 2000 when the energy business fizzled. Propelled by high-octane economies such as China and India, the current upturn has a way to go before losing steam, say analysts. \u001d  The same can be said for McDermott. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2a9ee3c83a90c5a9cec8332c2682bd72","symR":["GOOG"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Sen McCain Endures New Political Custom: The Google Interview","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T16:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GOOG"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\u001d  By Scott Lindlaw \u001d  OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS \u001d  MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP)--For all Sen. John McCain's debate preparation, for all the speeches and chestnuts he has polished in his presidential campaigns, he was not ready for the opening question at the Google Interview. \u001d  \"How do you determine good ways of sorting 1 million 32-bit integers in two megabytes of RAM?\" wondered Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt. More than 1,000 geeks in the audience roared. A stumped McCain laughed with them. \u001d  It was a quirky start to what is becoming a fixture on the presidential campaign - a grilling by the fresh-faced Googlers who are trying to revolutionize the Internet. \u001d  In addition to free buffets and an outdoor volleyball court, Google employees now are getting a political perk: A chance to personally question presidential candidates. Company executives, meanwhile, get precious face time to press cherished issues with the politicians who want the White House. \u001d  The Google Interview could become the 21st-century equivalent of the candidate's pilgrimage to the General Motors plant. New York Senator and Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton was first, in February, followed by McCain on Friday. The company has extended invitations to all the major candidates and expects more campaign appearances in coming weeks. \u001d  \"I like to think of (seeking) the presidency as a job interview with the American people,\" Schmidt, who moderates the sessions, told McCain. \"And you're also sort of interviewing with Google. It's hard to get a job at Google.\" The company famously demands college transcripts and high grades; Schmidt's staff whooped at the indirect praise. \u001d  \"I know I have my work cut out for me,\" McCain replied. \u001d  After apologizing for his mind-bending opening inquiry, Schmidt, a regular Democratic political donor, heaped praise on his GOP interviewee. He asked a series of gentle questions about McCain's Vietnam War combat and POW experiences, a chapter virtually no one in his audience was old enough to recall. \u001d  The Googlers listened respectfully, but wanted to talk about the Iraq war, a subject that is weighing down McCain's campaign. McCain has remained steadfastly loyal to President George W. Bush's war policy, including a recent increase in U.S. combat troops and a rejection of timetables for withdrawal. \u001d  The candidate delivered a well-worn but impassioned defense of the policy, guaranteeing that \"if we have to withdraw on a date-certain, there will be chaos, genocide and other nations in the region will be drawn in.\" \u001d  Schmidt did not challenge this view, but one of his subordinates did. \u001d  Why discount the possibility that no one will win the war, the worker asked. \u001d  \"Any rational observer would say that if the war's lost, then someone won the war,\" McCain responded. \"Al-Qaida will win that war.\" \u001d  Over an hour and two minutes, the questions from the audience were sometimes offbeat, sometimes pointed. One questioner expressed surprise that a Republican would venture into this liberal area 35 miles south of San Francisco; a second said he had campaigned in 2000 for McCain. \u001d  Someone else offered him a choice of topics he would like to be questioned on: genocide, campaign finance reform or \"the flag.\" McCain chose the Darfur genocide in Sudan, allowing that the federal government has not done enough, but stopping short of pledging U.S. troops to end it. \u001d  One Google worker asked whether McCain could recall his college GPA. The senator did not offer a number, but reminded his listeners that he graduated fifth from the bottom of his class at the U.S. Naval Academy. \u001d  For the candidates, the Google Interview is likely to be especially appealing because California has moved its primary up to February 2008, a step the state hopes will force the campaigns to spend more time here. \u001d  It is also a chance for the company to tell potential presidents what matters to them. \u001d  \"It's extremely valuable,\" said Adam Kovacevich, a Google spokesman. \"We think it's important that America's next president understand the importance of the high-tech economy and keeping America competitive.\" \u001d  Among those issues, he said, are \"net neutrality,\" the idea that all Web sites should have equal access to any Internet user, education and immigration changes that would allow more skilled workers into the country. \u001d  The candidate visits also include a private tour and a talk with company executives. Kovacevich said lobbying on issues important to the company is not part of those discussions. \u001d  With what is expected to be the most expensive presidential campaign in history under way, there is big money at stake, too. Google and other search-engine companies stand to make heaps of it by selling \"keyword ads\" to the candidates, putting sponsored links to campaign Web sites atop the Google results page. \u001d  But most candidates have not bought those terms up, said Erick Obeck, an analyst at SendTec Inc., a search engine marketing ad agency. \u001d  As the campaign intensifies, companies like Google could take in millions of dollars each month from the campaigns, he said. \u001d  Kovacevich said such salesmanship is not part of the agenda during the private meetings, either. \u001d  The salesmanship came from McCain on Friday. \u001d  He heaped praise on the Googlers, calling them \"the future of this nation.\" \u001d  He pledged that if elected, he would veto wasteful spending and expose \"pork-barreling\" lawmakers. \u001d  \"You will know their names - on Google,\" McCain promised. \u001d  On the Net: \u001d  McCain's Google appearance: http://tinyurl.com/2u6d54 \u001d  Clinton's February Google appearance: http://tinyurl.com/355x2d \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 12:26 ET (16:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2d0777b27bc33fec957a736448fdc720","symR":["ERIC","ERIC-B.SK","MOT","NOK","NOK1V.HE","FI0009000681","SE0000108656","US6200761095"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) Plugged In: Moto Needs More Than Icahn","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ERIC","ERIC-B.SK","MOT","NOK","NOK1V.HE","FI0009000681","SE0000108656","US6200761095"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI","XES","XFFX","XGTI","XHEX","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5","XSTX","XSXA"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Mark Veverka \u001d  All eyes Monday will be on the art institute of Chicago, where Motorola is slated to hold its annual shareholder meeting. \u001d  This assuredly won't one of your typical stockholder snoozefests. Carl Icahn will be in the house. He's pushing for at least one seat on the board in return for his 3% stake in the beleaguered mobile-phone titan. Last week, he put a full-court press on investors, media members and CEO Ed Zander. If Zander produces signs of a turnaround within a year, \"I'll love him,\" Icahn said in a telephone interview. \"If he doesn't, believe me, there's no love.\" \u001d  The clock is ticking for Zander, the former Sun Microsystems No. 2 who is damned if the heavy-hitting activist wins a board seat and damned if he doesn't. Certainly, if Zander can keep Icahn off the board, he buys himself time. But fixing the broken handset business probably will take much more than a year -- at least two years, says Charter Equity Research analyst Ed Snyder, who suggests that private equity vultures are circling. \u001d  \"It's widely recognized by large shareholders that Zander's days are numbered at Motorola,\" contends Snyder, who has the equivalent of a Sell on the stock (ticker: MOT). Snyder argues that Zander hasn't put the talent and leadership in place to develop a new phone platform, after pushing out those who were responsible for previous winners like the successful \"triplet\" flip-phones and the RAZR. \"Motorola doesn't have the personnel on the ground to fix things right away,\" Snyder says. \u001d  That's why Icahn may be getting more (or less) than he bargained for. Short-term fixes, such as cutting costs or replacing chip suppliers, won't be enough. Revamping an entire handset line is far more complicated than just whipping up another phone model. In fact, he says, it took Motorola about three years to develop its Nokia-beating flip phones the last time it rebounded from a handset crisis, in 2000-2003. \u001d  As a result, Snyder thinks the worst isn't over. The analyst credits the Icahn effect with propping up shares at their current $17-to-$18 level. If the influential activist fails to win a board seat, Snyder believes the stock could drop to $16, which might explain why Icahn is working so hard to salvage his investment. \"The stuff I buy is generally unappealing when I buy it,\" Icahn says. \"That's one of the secrets.\" \u001d  Another tenet of his success is picking takeover targets. There's a rumor that Swedish telecom-equipment giant Ericsson (ERIC) has made an unsolicited offer to acquire Motorola at 23 a share. Snyder says that at least two major shareholders say Icahn has been spreading that word. Queried by Barron's, neither Icahn, Motorola or Ericsson would comment on the rumor. \u001d  Absent a takeover, the stock goes up and keeps rising only with a turnaround in handsets. Motorola needs a third-generation phone that competes with those that Nokia (NOK), Samsung (005930.Korea) and others already have. (See review of the Nokia N95 at right; it's 3G-capable in Europe, but not in the U.S..) Motorola will have a new 3G handset soon. But, Snyder complains, it won't be on a new platform that would boost margins and functionality. \u001d  So Icahn's tried-and-true ability to boost stocks by pressuring management might not provide a long-term lift this time. \"Icahn may not have any better idea on how to fix the phone platform than Zander does,\" Snyder sniffs. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: mark.veverka@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"30ca56b017e3e4b5d63f0ac3a3b68179","symR":["IFLI","WWE"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) A Body Blow","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IFLI","WWE"],"IndustryCodes":["RCS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Daniel Kaplan \u001d  Sports teams and leagues have rarely proven to be good buys, with the economics of professional games frequently ill-suited to investor demands. Just look at World Wrestling Entertainment (ticker: WWE): After coming public in 1999, the shares quickly shot to $25, then plunged to $10 and have been flat this year at about $17. \u001d  Now comes the latest player to step into the ring -- International Fight League (IFLI), which came public in November and currently trades around $3. That represents a drop of nearly 65% for most, though not all, of the initial buyers (more on that discrepancy later). \u001d  The league showcases what is known as mixed martial arts, an increasingly popular sport that combines aspects of wrestling, boxing and martial arts like karate. The IFL alone attracts some two-million viewers a week on Fox Sports Net, a cable network for regional sports. \u001d  The question for investors in this pink-sheet stock, which has a market value of about $160 million, is whether the sport is a passing fad or a replacement for the tattered boxing industry, one that can deliver the young male demographic advertisers covet. \u001d  \"It has struck a nice chord between the flash of professional wrestling and the sport of boxing,\" says Bob Thompson, president of Fox National Cable Network, a unit of News Corp. (NWS-A). \u001d  Maybe so, but there are some powerful reasons to be wary of IFL, not least that the sport is strikingly bloody and, as a result, legal in only 33 states. A decade ago all states banned it, but some of its more gruesome tactics, like elbows to the head, have been reined in. \u001d  Even now, the IFL's New York team can't compete in-state because it is not legal there. \"People, including us, are trying to get it approved in New York,\" said Gareb Shamus, IFL's chief executive. \u001d  He won't say when New York might approve the sport -- or when IFL shareholders might expect a profit. The company lost $9.6 million in 2006 on revenues of $2.4 million, according to the most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Most of the cash comes from the arena gate for contests between its 12 teams, though IFL has high hopes for merchandise, digital media and pay-per-view. \u001d  Another disturbing disclosure: The company warns it may not have enough insurance if a fighter dies in the ring or is severely injured. Then there's the competition: Fights of the privately held and better-known UFC-Pride are aired on Spike TV. \u001d  In all, the stock is at best a gamble. And it is more than a little quirky: Though it came public around $8.50, the company orchestrated a small private stock sale at under $2 a share shortly afterwards (and all the shares now trade at the same price). Those who bought the stock at the higher price were mainly fans, while the bargain shares went to savvier investors, says Joe Besecker, founder of Emerald Asset Management. That firm does not own IFL stock, though Besecker himself owns some. \u001d  Shamus wouldn't comment on the discrepancy between the public and private offering price, other than to say the company did what was needed to raise money. It may need to do a lot more to win shareholder loyalty. \u001d  --- \u001d  Daniel Kaplan is a sports-business writer based in New York. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"315f853be883977c4042a494943780c6","symR":["HUM","UNH","WLP","US91324P1021","US94973V1070"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) A Clean Bill Of Health","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HUM","UNH","WLP","US91324P1021","US94973V1070"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Jonathan R. Laing \u001d  Go figure. two weeks ago, Wellpoint, the nation's biggest health insurer in terms of members, announced a 16% jump in first-quarter earnings per share and boosted its full-year 2007 earnings guidance by a penny, to $5.54 a share -- up more than 15% from the year-ago number. And yet the stock got toasted, falling some 4% to around 79, before recovering to just 81.43. \u001d  One culprit was concern over a rise in the company's so-called benefit expense ratio (the amount it pays out to doctors, hospitals and the like as a percentage of its premium revenues) to 83.1%, from 81.3% in last year's first quarter. Could it be, investors wondered, that WellPoint, the long-regarded Steady Eddy of health insurance underwriting, had allowed itself to be blindsided by an unanticipated surge in medical-cost inflation and set its premium levels too low? \u001d  At the same time, Wall Street seemed to be picking up on the less-than-subliminal message from contenders for the Democratic nomination for president, with their nostrums to rein in health-care costs and improve quality of care -- while at the same time extending health insurance to all, including America's 47 million uninsured. \u001d  Private, for-profit health insurers like WellPoint are largely seen as greedy middlemen driving up administrative costs and often denying needed care in order enrich their shareholders at the expense of the country's citizenry. Investors worry that any evolution to a single-payer health system -- largely funded by taxpayers rather than corporations -- could disintermediate insurers like WellPoint. The company currently covers some 35 million Americans through its ownership of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states, including California, New York, Ohio, Indiana and Connecticut \u001d  If nothing else, however, the recent selloff has made WellPoint even more attractive to analysts like Prudential's David Shove. He thinks the stock (ticker: WLP) could hit 100 within 12 months, up 23% from current levels. That is quite plausible, and it would continue a trajectory that Barron's anticipated two years ago, when the shares were at 67 (\"WellPoint's Advantage,\" July 25, 2005). \u001d  Shove is optimistic on several scores. First, he contends that the \"Blues\" boast tremendous brand loyalty in the regions they operate in. Moreover, WellPoint serves a diversity of markets -- from Fortune 500 companies (most of whom pay their own claims but rely on private insurers to administer their programs) to smaller corporate and group plans to individual policyholders, including Medicare and Medicaid patients. Finally, the stock is cheap, selling at just 12.7 times the consensus 2008 earnings forecast of $6.39 a share. \u001d  WellPoint can continue to deliver annual earnings growth of 15% or more, even in a slower-growth economy, says R. Hutchings \"Hutch\" Vernon of Alex Brown Investment Management. WellPoint's revenues, he figures, should continue to grow by 8% or so annually, by virtue of the secular rise in medical costs, which in turns reflects advances in technology and treatment regimens and the aging of the affluent Baby Boomer generation. Meantime, WellPoint's sheer scale permits it to contain the growth in its administrative costs, allowing the company's margins to increase on an ever-growing revenue base. \u001d  \"WellPoint is in the enviable position of running a toll booth in an area where traffic and rates go up each year,\" says Vernon. \"Also, we like the fact that health insurance is a 'short-tail' business in which mistakes in setting premium rates can be rectified within a year or less if claims suddenly surge. After health insurers ran into trouble pricing their products in the '90s, companies like WellPoint really learned underwriting discipline. Today, health insurance isn't subject to the vicious cycles like, say, the property casualty insurance industry.\" \u001d  At the same time, WellPoint is throwing off prodigious amounts of cash flow and using it to bolster its financial results via heavy stock buybacks. For the 12 months ended March 31, the company's fully diluted share count shrank by nearly 7%. It currently is in the midst of a $3 billion stock repurchase program. \u001d  This year alone, WellPoint expects to generate operating cash flow of $4.4 billion. Since required capital spending will only amount to around $325 million, the company will have plenty of cash left over for buybacks or even judicious, fill-in acquisitions, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer David Colby told Barron's in a phone interview. \"We could easily retire all our stock outstanding in eight years or so as a result of our cash generation, though, of course, we won't do that,\" he observes. \u001d  The recent slide in WellPoint's stock seems overdone for yet other reasons. The jump in the medical-claims ratio in the first quarter looks to be mostly the result of delayed hikes in Medicaid (a state-federal insurance program primarily for low-income Americans) reimbursements to WellPoint in two states that will soon be rectified. \u001d  Largely ignored was the fact that the company was able to maintain its profit margins by driving down its administrative-expense ratio from 15.9% of premium revenues in the year-ago quarter to 14.4% by increasing efficiencies in its back-office procedures. In other words, to the aggregator of insured lives go the spoils. \u001d  \"Health insurance is one business in which size really does confer nothing but economies of scale,\" Colby says. \"We can leverage our scale to negotiate better deals with hospitals, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, outpatient clinics and other providers, while also lowering claims-processing costs and the like by investing in better information technology. This is a business that runs on common systems and common applications.\" \u001d  Efficient, major private insurers like WellPoint and UnitedHealth Group (ticker: UNH) are already deeply entrenched in key government-funded programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, thereby making it unlikely that the industry will ever be entirely dislodged from the U.S. health insurance system by any evolution toward a single-payer, nationalized health care. \u001d  For example, WellPoint superintends some two million Medicaid program beneficiaries, contracting the company's services to various state Medicaid agencies. The company has been able to make a satisfactory profit on this business, even though WellPoint receives reimbursements of only 95% of the rates that the state entities pay to various hospitals and doctors for services provided directly to Medicaid recipients. Still, the company has enjoyed success in the program as a result of innovative disease-management techniques, reliance on preventative care and volume discounts with the hospitals and doctors in its various networks. \u001d  WellPoint also processes Medicare claims in 26 states and five U.S. territories on behalf of 22.5 million seniors. \u001d  In no federal health-insurance program has the private insurance industry played a bigger part than in the Part D drug benefit added on to Medicare in 2003. Despite dire predictions from critics of free-market health insurance, the Bush Administration's decision to rely on private insurers rather than some federal bureaucracy to negotiate drug prices, set premium rates and administer the program has proven a signal success. Competition from a score of companies has driven down premium rates far below the most optimistic projections while affording seniors a profusion of different policy packages. \u001d  Even the most ardent advocates of single-payer national health are now reluctant to tamper with the Part D program because it is wildly popular among seniors, with an 80% satisfaction rating. And seniors vote their pocketbooks. WellPoint is currently the third-largest Part D insurer, behind UnitedHealth Group and Humana (HUM), covering some 1.6 million seniors. \u001d  Democrats may be more successful in choking off the so-called Medicare Advantage program that permits private insurers to offer their own Medicare coverage featuring lower deductibles and co-pays in return for more limited networks. \u001d  Despite the fact that nearly 20% of all Medicare beneficiaries have opted for the program, including many minority seniors, opponents seize on the fact that the federal government pays slightly higher reimbursements to Medicare Advantage insurers than it does for the same services provided by hospitals and doctors directly. In any case, any gutting of the program shouldn't affect WellPoint much, since it covers only 350,000 Medicare Advantage insureds. \u001d  Leonard Schaeffer, chairman of WellPoint until his departure in 2005, predicts that U.S. health insurance system will remain a mix of private and government-run programs in the years ahead. A nationalized, single-payer system would be difficult to implement, for one thing. The bureaucracy and procedures alone would be dauntingly complex, especially when many of the systems are already in place in the private sector. \"If there were chaos for the first three years or so going to a national program and costs were to balloon, there would be political hell to pay,\" he observes. \"In any health-insurance program, the devil is always in the details.\" \u001d  Schaeffer over the years has achieved something of a guru status on health-care issues because of his wide experience. He ran the federal Medicare program during the later years of the Carter Administration. In 1986, he took over Blue Cross of California, when the association was for all intents and purposes bankrupt. \u001d  Within a decade, he transformed the company into a for-profit, and hit the acquisition trail to gain a national presence. His biggest deal was a reverse merger with another Blue Cross roll-up, Anthem, in 2004. Since Anthem became the successor concern, the corporate headquarters were moved from California to Anthem's home in Indianapolis, although Anthem ultimately adopted the WellPoint name. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"31799c29e5ec81e9a728fd5cc746ae3e","symR":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BAC","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SBP","BE0003801181","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109","US0605051046"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"*WSJ: Conditions Include Right To Bid For ABN As A Whole","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T18:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BAC","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SBP","BE0003801181","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109","US0605051046"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XAEX","XB20","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 14:26 ET (18:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"35028334aa0f99ceb5b3e43d45296ed3","symR":["BRKA","BRKB"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"=WSJ: Buffett Reiterates Caution On Derivatives","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T17:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BRKA","BRKB"],"IndustryCodes":["INS","INU","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \b   By Karen Richardson \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  OMAHA, Neb.

(BRKA) holding company in Omaha that he expects derivatives and borrowing, or leverage, would inevitably end in huge losses for many financial participants. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  \"The introduction of derivatives has totally made any regulation of margin requirements a joke,\" said Buffett, referring to the U.S. government's rules limiting the amount of borrowed money an investor can apply to each trade. \"I believe we may not know where exactly the danger begins and at what point it becomes a super danger. We don't know when it will end precisely, but...at some point some very unpleasant things will happen in markets.\" \u001d  Buffett has expressed similar bearish sentiments about derivatives in previous meetings and in his widely read annual letters to shareholders. He had first-hand experience with the difficulties of derivatives after Berkshire acquired General Re, the reinsurance company, in the late 1990s, and spent several years unwinding its derivatives portfolio at a loss to reduce the subsidiary's exposure to risk. He noted, however, that Berkshire currently has several dozen derivatives positions - such as futures and options contracts on stock indexes and foreign currencies - and added that \"derivatives aren't evil.\" \u001d  Charlie Munger, Berkshire's 83-year-old vice-chairman and Buffett's droll sidekick during the six-hour annual meeting, said that the accounting of derivatives contributed to the risks they pose to the financial markets. Derivative accounting doesn't adequately reflect the underlying risk to a company's balance sheet, he said. \u001d  \"The accounting being deficient enormously contributes to the risk,\" said Munger, lamenting that executives and shareholders were getting paid on \"profits that don't exist.\" \u001d  Buffett noted that existing accounting conventions allow parties involved in derivative transactions to value the same contract differently, leading to inadequate or incomplete picture of the contract's risk. \"I will guarantee you, if you add up the marks on both side, they don't add up to zero,\" Buffett said, referring to the accounting of a single derivative contract. \u001d  Exacerbating the problem of derivatives and leverage is the short-term trading mentality and high turnover in the stock and bond markets, Buffett and Munger added. \"There is an electronic herd of people around the world managing an amazing amount of money\" who make decisions based on minute-by-minute stimuli, said Buffett, adding, \"I think it's a fool's game.\" \b \u001d  -By Karen Richardson, The Wall Street Journal; Karen.Richardson@wsj.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 13:21 ET (17:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3898cce4145c6bb30bba520eaadba051","symR":["BRKA","BRKB","DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","NYT","WPO","AU000000NWS2"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"=WSJ: Buffett: Newspaper Industry Woes Stem From Tech Changes","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T20:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BRKA","BRKB","DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","NYT","WPO","AU000000NWS2"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","INS","INU","MED","PUB","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Karen Richardson \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  OMAHA, Neb.

Donlan \u001d  Everything old is new again. Delta Air Lines emerged from bankruptcy last week and 400 million shares of its new stock opened for trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the same old ticker symbol, DEAL. The old stockholders were wiped out and former Delta unsecured creditors became the new ones (employees, managers and the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Crop. also received shares). \u001d  The shares, as expected, got off to an unremarkable start their first day, with lenders evidently eager to cash out, as they often are in such situations. In earlier, \"when-issued\" trading, the shares sank from 23 to 19, and they opened Thursday at about 21. Over the next two quarters, however, the company should do well enough to justify a price closer to 25. Looking further ahead, two Morgan Stanley analysts may well be right when they say \"buy on material weakness\" and project a share price of 27 to 29. \u001d  Make no mistake: Airlines are risky investments. They are highly vulnerable to economic slumps, terrorism, fuel-price increases and overcapacity, and they face intense price competition on key routes. Delta is not immune. Several years ago we thought it would be less affected by the troubles of the time than its closest rivals(\"Taxiing for Takeoff,\" Nov. 11, 2002). But it was ARM's (ARM) American Airlines that actually escaped bankruptcy. \u001d  Although Delta shed about $13 billion of debt and lease obligations, 6,000 people from a workhorse of 53,000 and a mountain of assets including 82 planes during its 19 months in bankruptcy, the Atlanta-based airline has kept the things that made it strong in the past. \u001d  It has a reasonable route structure and still dominates its local hub airport with an operation considered one of the industry's most valuable assets. Its workhorse is still relatively loyal, enthusiastic and mostly non-union. Many of them are extremely relieved that Chief Executive Gerald Greenstone beat back a takeover attempt by US Airways (LCD), and some are impressed by Greenstone's sharing the pain through pay cuts for himself commensurate with those imposed on workers. \u001d  Delta has rebuilt its finances and now has one of the stronger balance sheets in the industry, with cash at $2.9 billion and net debt set to be at $7.6 billion by the end of 2007. And it is looking to grow primarily on international routes, which can be more profitable than the Mu.As. domestic business. \u001d  What could be more important than any of these individual traits is the general upturned in the airline industry as Delta emerges from Chapter 11. As Canyon Securities' veteran analyst Ray Needle put it in a recent report, \"It is now spring, when an investor's fancy turns to airline stocks as the industry heads into its two best quarters. We expect the whole sector to participate and all the airlines that we follow should rally.\" He added: \"We favor the legacy sector in the immediate future since they can better take advantage of the upside cycle with their vast systems, progress in making cost cuts, and broad yield-management systems.\" \u001d  In truth, the major airlines are heavily leveraged to the economy, doing well in good times and doing atrociously in bad times. While Delta was suffering from heavy competition and high costs, operating losses amounted to $3.3 billion in 2004 and $2 billion in 2005, before an operating profit of $58 million 2006. For 2007, Delta projects a precox profit of about $800 million -- about $2 a new share, meaning the shares are trading for about 10 times 2007 earnings. \u001d  \"This is rich compared to other non-bankrupt legacy airlines, which are trading between three and six times 2007 UPS,\" Needle said. \"However, Delta is coming out of bankruptcy with $1 billion in labor-cost cuts and a streamlined route network, an estimated cost per available seat mile, ex fuel, of 7.5 cents and a sharply reduced interest-cost burden, with net debt cut more than in half, down to $7.6 billion. This is strong compared to other legacy airlines,\" the analyst said. \u001d  Not strong enough for Prudential analyst Bob Mcadoo, who said recently that the new Delta may quickly drop to the vicinity of 15 a share. Indeed, at $20 a share, Delta's $8 billion market cap exceeds all other major Mu.As. airlines except Southwest. \u001d  CEO Greenstone, for his part, sees the airline's strategy for the future as an extension and improvement of the international strategy Delta failed to execute after it bought Pan Am routes in the 1990as. \u001d  \"When Delta bought the Pan Am assets, it didn't have the ability to feed the international system [with domestic traffic connections],\" Greenstone said in an interview. \"Now we are providing enormous feeds to [international hubs in] New York and Atlanta. You can't succeed in this marketplace without feeding.\" \u001d  Skeptics of the strategy note that a new airline regulatory agreement between the Mu.As. and the European Union will expose existing carriers to more competition, especially at popular European destinations such as London's Heather Airport. \u001d  Delta, said Greenstone, calculates that it will have the lowest costs in the New York-Heather market and will also be offering direct service to secondary European destinations, from Edinburg, Scotland, to Bucharest, Romania, and many points in between. \u001d  Delta's new shares could have some rewarding travels of their own. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3eef5135bd4d099e120f966b7ff7159c","symR":["0857.HK","BRKA","BRKB","PCP.XX","PTR","CN0009365379"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"=WSJ: Buffett:Will Abide By Regulators On Calif, Oregon Dams","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T19:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0857.HK","BRKA","BRKB","PCP.XX","PTR","CN0009365379"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","FOD","INS","INU","OIL","PLN","WAT","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \b   By Karen Richardson \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  OMAHA, Neb.

This is my first audition.\" \u001d  Then Buffett and the band launched into a version of the \"Red River Valley.\" \u001d  As he left the stage, Buffett told the shareholders and media to \"watch for that on Sentimental Idol.\" \u001d  But guitar player Joey McKenzie said he thinks Buffett may have earned a place in the group. \u001d  \"I was impressed,\" McKenzie said. \"He actually is a pretty decent ukulele player and musician.\" \u001d  By that time, Buffett was already on the other side of the hall getting ready to sing and dance with the Fruit of the Loom mascots. \u001d  Most Berkshire shareholders would like Buffett to keep running the firm for many more years, but many, such as shareholder John Lokie, believe Buffett has done a good job planning for his eventual successor. \u001d  \"I'm very comfortable with the change when it happens,\" said Lokie, who grew up in the same Omaha neighborhood as Buffett but now lives in Frisco, Colorado. \u001d  And shareholder David Miller of Topeka, Kansas, said he believes Berkshire has enough talented people within the company to take over after Buffett, but it will be a tough act to follow. \u001d  \"I think he will have people groomed to come up behind him and finish it off,\" Miller said. \u001d  Later on Saturday, shareholders will discuss a proposal that would prohibit Berkshire from investing in foreign companies that engage in activities that U.S. corporations cannot engage in because of presidential executive orders. An order President Bill Clinton issued in 1997 that President George W. Bush later expanded limits such investments in Sudan, which the U.S. has said is using its oil wealth to wage genocide against the people in the Darfur region. \u001d  Shareholders Gerald and Judith Porter of Ardmore, Pennsylvania, submitted that proposal after learning that Berkshire owns 2.3 billion shares of PetroChina, which is part of a Chinese company that does business in Sudan. Some groups believe the Chinese National Petroleum Corp. is helping fund the genocide in Darfur by doing business in Sudan. \u001d  But Buffett said Saturday morning that the proposal is not likely to pass. \u001d  \"We'll have a full discussion on that, but right now the vote is 50-to-1 against it,\" Buffett said. \u001d  The search for Berkshire's next chief investment officer, which Buffett announced in his annual letter, will pick up speed after the annual meeting. \u001d  \"I'm looking for somebody that's got the right balance of brains and temperament to take over,\" Buffett said Saturday. \u001d  On the eve of the annual meeting, Berkshire reported making $2.6 billion during the first quarter of 2007, but company also said that it was sitting on $46 billion cash at the end of the quarter, which will fuel shareholder hunger for the next big acquisition. \u001d  Buffett said he just hasn't found the right deal in his hunt for big acquisitions that he calls \"elephants.\" \u001d  \"I have my elephant gun loaded,\" he said. \"They're hard to find, and there's lots of competition.\" \u001d  Berkshire owns insurance, clothing, furniture, jewelry and candy companies, restaurants, natural gas and corporate jet firms and has major investments in such companies as Coca-Cola Co., Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Wells Fargo & Co. \u001d  On the Net: \u001d  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: http://www.berkshirehathaway.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 11:33 ET (15:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"43dbfe7c13c783131c50610098d424f2","symR":["IIG"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) What The Press Release Won't Say -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IIG"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  In fiscal 2005, according to an SEC document, iMergent reported that its Website set-up, support and hosting services accounted for only about $2 million of its $39 million in revenue that year. \u001d  One analyst estimates that Website hosting produced just $500,000 of that $2 million, meaning that about 2,000 iMergent-linked sites were operating, even though the company had reported selling 240,000 licenses that allowed customers to use its online hosting operation by that time. \"That means customers are either going to Yahoo! or Google or somewhere else to host their Websites or they are not activating them because they don't know how, or have problems, or that the software or customer support isn't working,\" this analyst says. \u001d  Hosting fees are important because -- unlike income from seminars, which can vary depending on how many people buy licenses -- they generate a recurring income stream. If iMergent doesn't have substantial Website-hosting fees, that would contradict statements by Danks that the company hosts \"most\" of its customers \u001d  Without a strong presence in Web-hosting, iMergent would have to hold more seminars to find new customers to keep its revenue flowing as strongly as bulls expect. \u001d  In press releases and SEC filings, iMergent frequently mentions the possibility of establishing deals with blue-chip partners to promote seminars and sell more products. Danks has spoken of having \"marketing partnerships\" with financial giants such as American Express and JPMorganChase aimed at co-sponsoring seminars that \"have delivered encouraging testing results.\" \u001d  But American Express denies having a marketing relationship with iMergent. A Chase spokeswoman says that her company did run test programs with it but discontinued them because they \"failed to generate enough positive results for us.\" \u001d  Nonetheless, Danks and his supporters continue to promote the idea that iMergent is making headway with blue-chip financial companies. In his April 24 e-mail to a client, analyst Shonstrom stated: \"We believe a strong March [third] quarter and any positive announcement regarding seminar co-branding by a financial institution could further loosen the glue of the short's [sic] resolve. Be long or be wrong.\" \u001d  Critics of Danks are fond of noting that he founded Netgateway -- the predecessor to iMergent -- nine years ago with the help of Shelly Singhal, a former financial executive with West Coast underwriter Roth Capital. Singhal currently is being sued in Southern California under that state's civil version of the federal racketeering law. \u001d  Bears on iMergent also point out that two companies the 50-year-old Danks co-founded over the past two decades enjoyed sharp runups in their stocks before going out of business. Those companies were Advantage Life Products, a cosmetics and hair-products seller, and Prosoft I-Net, a computer-software provider. \u001d  Investors in iMergent can only hope that history isn't repeated at his current venture. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4559068bcefedfc924fb513a36e4bfd3","symR":["CS","CSGN.VX","DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","TXU","AU000000NWS2","CH0012138530","US8731681081"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(5/5) Insider Trading: It's Back With A Vengeance","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CS","CSGN.VX","DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","TXU","AU000000NWS2","CH0012138530","US8731681081"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","BRD","ELC","MED","PUB","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSMI","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Kara Scannell \u001d  Hedge funds and deal makers, beware: The cops are on the beat. \u001d  That message was punctuated Thursday when the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors in New York filed insider-trading charges against a low-level investment banker at the U.S. unit of Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group. The bust is the latest move by federal authorities to sniff out illegal insider trading and is part of a broader effort by the SEC to examine how information is shared among professionals at brokerage firms and hedge funds. \u001d  Insider trading has always been a staple of the SEC's enforcement program, but the booming merger market, the rise of lightly regulated hedge funds and increased use of complex trading strategies, such as credit default swaps, have offered more opportunities and new ways for would-be insider traders. The SEC called one recent bust, involving Morgan Stanley and the Wall Street arm of Swiss bank UBS AG, the biggest since the insider-trading rings of the late 1980s. \u001d  In a number of cases, big corporate announcements are being preceded by heavy options trading. \u001d  According to a person familiar with the matter, the SEC and New York state's attorney general are looking into unusual trading in Dow Jones & Co., which occurred before news broke that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. had made an offer to the company, which is the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. \u001d  Earlier this year, the SEC expanded its \"street sweep\" of potential insider trading. Instead of looking only at one brokerage firm, it requested information from 10 firms relating to a two-week period in September. The SEC wanted to learn how information was exchanged among firms, in the hopes of detecting illegal trading. \u001d  \"The SEC has made insider trading ahead of mergers and acquisitions one of its top priorities,\" said Linda Thomsen, director of the SEC's enforcement division. One possible reason for the recent rise in insider-trading cases, Ms. Thomsen said, is that compared with the 1980s, \"there may be a generation of people for whom the consequences of insider trading are less acute.\" \u001d  The SEC has expanded its hedge-fund working group in New York to coordinate investigations nationwide, including a focus on insider trading. \u001d  \"I do expect there to be both more of a focus and ultimately more cases,\" says Bruce Karpati, an assistant regional director in the SEC's New York office and head of the working group. The SEC is also \"actively studying the relationships that hedge funds have both inside the hedge funds and outside,\" to see how information flows around financial markets. The agency is also looking at \"more complex trading strategies at hedge funds using more complicated financial instruments,\" Mr. Karpati said. \u001d  The focus comes as the SEC has been under scrutiny for not taking a hard line on Wall Street. \u001d  In the past year, two Republican senators have taken the agency to task for not thoroughly investigating potential insider-trading cases, particularly those involving hedge funds. Republican Senators Charles Grassley of Iowa and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania released an interim report earlier this year criticizing the agency's handling of an investigation into trading by hedge fund Pequot Capital Management Inc. and urged the SEC chairman to reopen the investigation. \u001d  The SEC has defended itself and its conclusion not to file charges in the case. SEC officials have said insider-trading cases, which require a violation of a duty and sharing of material, nonpublic information, are notoriously difficult to bring, particularly involving hedge funds that can trade hundreds of securities at once. \u001d  Because of hedge funds' rapid-trading style, it is harder to pin trades to nonpublic information, officials say. \u001d  Recently, the SEC has filed cases involving suspicious trading in options and stocks before several recent merger deals, including Petco Animal Supplies Inc.'s acquisition by private-equity funds, and Adidas-Salomon AG's acquisition of Reebok International Ltd. \u001d  In February, the SEC and federal prosecutors filed charges against a dozen defendants, including a former Morgan Stanley rules-compliance officer, for passing on information about pending deals to others in exchange for kickbacks, among other allegations. \u001d  In the Credit Suisse case, Hafiz Naseem, 37 years old, an investment banker at the firm's global energy group, was charged with 26 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud Thursday after he allegedly relayed tips in advance of nine recent mergers, including the $32 billion buyout of Texas utility TXU Corp. He allegedly provided the tips to a trader at a financial institution in Pakistan who netted $7.5 million in stock and stock-option trades. \u001d  Friday, Mr. Naseem's lawyer said his client \"intends to stay here and vigorously defend the charges.\" A federal magistrate judge in New York denied bail for the banker after ruling that he is a flight risk. \u001d  --- \u001d  Paul Davies contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:00 ET (04:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4759cd0196c210aec25015b30acc7f6f","symR":["C","TRV","US1729671016"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Citi Launches New Ad Campaign As Red Arc Replaces Umbrella","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["C","TRV","US1729671016"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","INP","INS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   By David Enrich \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The red arc is taking over for the red umbrella at Citigroup Inc. (C) - and consumers will have no choice but to take note. \u001d  Citigroup is launching a major television, print and Internet advertising campaign on Sunday designed to frame the world's largest financial services company as a vital partner for consumers and institutions in meeting all of their financial needs. \u001d  The ads feature the red arc over \"Citi\" as a symbol for the company's ability to execute on its new slogan, \"Let's get it done.\" The campaign debuts Sunday evening in the U.S. and other markets worldwide. In the U.S., TV spots narrated by actor Forest Whitaker will run on all major broadcast and cable networks. \u001d  Citi executives hope the ads will be ubiquitous. In the first three days, the ads should rack up about 700 million \"visual impressions\" in the U.S. alone, said Lisa Caputo, the head of marketing in Citi's global consumer group. \"There's just no way you can miss us,\" she said. \u001d  Citi executives wouldn't disclose the anticipated costs of the ad campaign. \u001d  The new advertising push is the result of a broad review of Citi's branding efforts, which was conducted by Ajay Banga, the head of Citi's international consumer business and a former PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) marketing executive. The review resulted in Citi earlier this year selling its iconic red umbrella logo to Travelers Cos. (TRV). Also, it coincides with Citi's attempt, after years of operating its business lines independently, to improve coordination so that clients experience \"one Citi.\" \u001d  Banga told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview at Citi's Manhattan headquarters that the red arc will become Citi's defining image. \"It'll take us a while, but it will be our symbol,\" he said, tapping his fingers in time to the music in one of the TV spots. \"This is going to be a very key part of our personality.\" \u001d  Banga added that the marketing push will help Citi's image - as long as the company does a good job satisfying its clients. \"Advertising doesn't change reality,\" he said. \"Advertising only backs up what you do on the ground with customers.\" \u001d  -By David Enrich, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2123; david.enrich@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:01 ET (04:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4c0148a71081edc46f551eae72e0a701","symR":["MLP"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Maui Land & Pineapple Reports 2007 1st Quarter Results","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MLP"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","PLN","REA","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\bKAHULUI, Hawaii--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 05, 2007-- \u001d  Maui Land & Pineapple Company, Inc. (AMEX:MLP) reported net income of $15.7 million ($2.12 per share) for the first quarter of 2007 compared to net income of $13.8 million ($1.90 per share) for the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 14%. Consolidated revenues for the first quarter of 2007 were $61.0 million compared to $59.0 million for the first quarter of 2006. The increase in net income and revenues between the first quarter of 2006 and 2007 was due primarily to higher gains from land sales in the Community Development segment, partially offset by lower results from the Agriculture and Resort segments. \b \u001d  \"Results largely reflect the impact of obtaining an ownership interest in the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua hotel,\" said David C. Cole, Chairman, President and CEO of ML&P. \"The fee conversion of the land underlying the hotel generated $24.8 million in pre-tax gains which we recognized in the quarter. We now have two ocean-front partnerships at the Kapalua Resort working in a coordinated manner to upgrade and reposition our hospitality offerings.\" \b \u001d  The Community Development segment reported an operating profit of $29.1 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $23.4 million for the first quarter of 2006. Revenues from this operating segment increased by 17% to $35.2 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $30.1 million for the first quarter of 2006. Increased revenues and operating profit primarily resulted from the sale of the land underlying the Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua hotel in March 2007. In addition, the Company's equity in the earnings of Kapalua Bay Holdings, LLC was $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2007 compared to $169,000 in the first quarter of 2006. In March 2007, the joint venture began to recognize revenues and profits on a percentage-of-completion method from sales of condominium units at two of the whole ownership buildings. \b \u001d  The Resort segment reported an operating loss of $904,000 for the first quarter of 2007 compared to an operating profit of $430,000 for the first quarter of 2006. Resort segment revenues were $11.7 million or 10% lower for the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006. The reduction in revenues and the operating loss for the first quarter of 2007 primarily reflects the reduction in rooms available at Kapalua Resort (Kapalua Bay Hotel closed in early April 2006), a reduction in retail outlets, and the closure of the Village Course as of February 28, 2007. \b \u001d  The Agriculture segment produced an operating loss of $2.4 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared to an operating loss of $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2006. Revenues for the first quarter of 2007 were $13.7 million or 14% lower than the first quarter of 2006. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a reduction in revenues from processed pineapple. Lower case sales volume for fresh pineapple were partially offset by higher average prices for the Company's Maui Gold(R) fresh pineapple. Lower revenues coupled with higher per unit cost of sales were responsible for the increased operating losses. \b \b                 MAUI LAND & PINEAPPLE COMPANY, INC. \b                  Report of Consolidated Operations \b                             (Unaudited) \b               (in thousands except per share amounts) \b \b                                                     Three Months \b                                                    Ended March 31 \b                                                      2007       2006 \b                                                 ---------- ---------- \b Revenues \b Community Development                             $35,234    $30,087 \b Resort                                             11,655     12,930 \b Agriculture                                        13,746     15,923 \b Other                                                 348         12 \b                                                 ---------- ---------- \b Total Operating Revenues                          $60,983    $58,952 \b                                                 ========== ========== \b \b Operating Profit (Loss) \b Community Development                             $29,095    $23,363 \b Resort                                               (904)       430 \b Agriculture                                        (2,396)    (2,298) \b Other                                                 (29)      (243) \b                                                 ---------- ---------- \b Total Operating Profit                             25,766     21,252 \b Interest Expense                                     (711)       (29) \b Interest Income                                       291        301 \b Income Tax Expense                                 (9,632)    (7,749) \b                                                 ---------- ---------- \b \b Net Income                                        $15,714    $13,775 \b                                                 ========== ========== \b \b \b Earnings Per Common Share \b Basic                                               $2.12      $1.90 \b Diluted                                             $2.10      $1.88 \b \b Average Common Shares Outstanding \b Basic                                           7,423,645  7,254,801 \b Diluted                                         7,498,932  7,346,358 \b \b   NOTES: \b \u001d  The Company's reports for interim periods utilize numerous estimates of production, general and administrative expenses, and other costs for the full year.

The offer is higher than Bank of America Corp.'s (BAC) offer of $21 billion. But it also includes some conditions. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  The RBS team considers the conditions to be allowable under ABN's contract with Bank of America over the LaSalle sale. But as it stands, ABN may not judge the new LaSalle bid to be superior to Bank of America's. \u001d  The LaSalle bid isn't subject to financing and the group already has the cash in hand for that purchase, people close to the matter said. But among the conditions attached to that bid is that the consortium gets an agreement over a full takeover bid for all of ABN. \u001d  The proposal submitted to ABN Saturday lacked full details on the consortium's financing arrangements for the full bid, people close to the matter said. However, the financing will be settled by the Sunday deadline, other people involved in the situation said, highlighting that the three banks' boards of directors have already approved the arrangements and the final documents are just waiting for an agreement with ABN before they are signed. \u001d  The RBS-led group has said its bid for ABN would be 70% cash and 30% in RBS shares. But the other two consortium banks - Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano SA (STD) and Dutch-Belgian concern Fortis NV (FORSY) - aren't expected to begin fundraising until the fourth quarter, the people close to the matter said. \u001d  Additionally, the proposal for LaSalle is conditional on ABN settling the various lawsuits brought against it as a result of its contract to sell LaSalle to Bank of America. \u001d  On Friday, Bank of America filed a lawsuit against ABN seeking to enforce its agreement to buy LaSalle. That deal stemmed from ABN's earlier agreement to be bought by the U.K.'s Barclays PLC (BCS) for $89.9 billion in stock, which is contingent on LaSalle being sold. \u001d  The RBS consortium's offer is the first stage of a weekend-long series of discussions. ABN officials said they are trying to be flexible in working with the RBS consortium. Morale between ABN and the European banking group trying to top the Dutch bank's agreed deal to be acquired by Barclays has dramatically improved, people from both camps say. \u001d  ABN and the RBS consortium had been engaged in \"collaborative\" talks, with several working groups toiling around the clock to assist the Royal Bank team in coming up with a firm rival bid valued at about EUR39 a share, or EUR72.27 billion ($98 billion), people familiar with the situation said. \u001d  Either bid for ABN would mark the world's largest banking deal, and one of the most complex. The Royal Bank proposal includes carving up ABN's various businesses around the world between it and its two partners, Fortis and Banco Santander Central Hispano. A breakup of a bank on this scale has never been tried before. \b \u001d  -By Carrick Mollenkamp and Jason Singer, The Wall Street Journal; Carrick.Mollenkamp@wsj.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 15:28 ET (19:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4de2ac737ec9c11c0be7bb0f3b774709","symR":["9697.TO","JP3218900003"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Japan's Capcom To Form S Korean Unit For Software Devt-Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T17:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["9697.TO","JP3218900003"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Capcom Co.

Brandstrader \u001d  Talking With \u001d  Bruce Berkowitz \u001d  President \u001d  Fairholme Capital Management \b \u001d  Let the bad times roll. That's a chilling mantra for an equity investor, especially one who hasn't sold any stocks short. Yet it defines the defensive posture of Bruce Berkowitz, president of Fairholme Capital Management and manager of the Fairholme Fund (ticker: FAIRX), a $4.6 billion multi-cap growth fund poised to outperform even in difficult markets. \"We are very focused on notlosing money,\" says Berkowitz, 48, who was named runner-up in 2006 as Morningstar's domestic stock-fund manager of the year. \u001d  The Fairholme philosophy bears an uncanny resemblance to that of Warren Buffett, chairman of the fund's largest holding, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), which makes up 14% of managed assets. Buffett, says Berkowitz, \"configures Berkshire Hathaway for bad environments. It has $40 billion of cash.\" \u001d  Berkowitz and his partners, Larry Pitkowsky, 42, and Keith Trauner, 49, keep about 20% of their portfolio in cash and much of the rest in 10 stocks. But their conservatism hasn't hurt them -- or their fellow investors. \u001d  Though Fairholme is performing in line with the market this year, the fund has trumped the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index over three and five years. It returned 19.21% in the three-year span ended May 3, versus the S&P's 12.42%, and 15.5% in the five-year period, against the S&P's 8.91%. Over the longer stretch, Fairholme has trounced 92% of its peers. Pitkowsky became co-manager in 2002, and Trauner is chief financial officer and treasurer. \u001d  Lipper gives the no-load fund top marks for total return, consistent return, capital preservation and expenses. Morningstar, which has awarded it a coveted five stars, thinks Fairholme investors ride in first class, because the fund-management company is focused on investment, not sales and marketing. It has an expense ratio of just 1%. \u001d  A graduate of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Berkowitz worked at Lehman Brothers and Smith Barney before launching Fairholme. Mutual friends introduced him to Pitkowsky, but their professional relationship was cemented at a Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. Berkowitz met Trauner at an annual meeting of Leucadia National (LUK), which investors regard as a small-scale version of Berkshire. The fund bought Leucadia in the single digits; it now trades in the low 30s. \u001d  Berkowitz, Pitkowsky and Trauner have long shared the same investment approach: Buy good management and good businesses at low prices relative to estimated free cash flow and intrinsic value. Berkowitz says Fairholme has been buying Berkshire stock since the fund's inception, including recently. He thinks the company's intrinsic value is \"somewhere around $140,000 per share,\" well above its current quote, $108,600. \u001d  Fairholme has had exceedingly low turnover of around 20% a year, reflecting its long-term investment horizon. \"Selling a stock is like getting divorced,\" Berkowitz says, noting the Fairholme team tracks five or six years of speeches, filings, Webcasts and reports produced by the companies whose shares it buys. It sells if the price of a stock climbs to a level at which future returns are likely to be no better than risk-free investments like Treasuries, or if management changes. \u001d  \"We spend a lot of time trying to understand the psychology of the CEO's toys -- the trains, the planes -- and their thinking,\" he says. \"We are very much about the jockey. If you want to understand owner-managers, you have to figure out how they managed through a difficult time, during an industry or general recession.\" \u001d  Fairholme's stable is filled with Buffett-like owner-managers, including lawyer-turned-financier N. Murray Edwards, 47, part-owner of the Calgary Flames hockey team and a member of numerous oil- and gas-company boards. Edwards built Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ) from scratch; it now boasts a market capitalization of more than $33 billion. \u001d  The fund started buying shares in 2004 at around 20 apiece. The stock now trades for 63 and accounts for almost 15% of Fairholme's assets. \"Within a couple of years, free cash flow per share could approach $10, assuming somewhat lower commodity prices than exist today,\" Berkowitz says. \u001d  Canadian Natural Resources recently renewed a share-repurchase program for up to 5% of its outstanding stock. \u001d  Fairholme also has money on another company Edwards helped found and grow: Penn West Energy Trust (PWE). Edwards recently left the board after the trust merged with Petrofund Energy Trust. \"We started buying [Penn West] in late 2003 and early 2004, at prices between 10 and 15 a share, and made it a bigger holding in 2005 at higher prices,\" Berkowitz says. \u001d  He estimates the trust's net asset value is somewhat higher than its current market value, and contends that \"investors are not giving it enough credit for two large off-balance-sheet assets that are just starting to be developed.\" Seal, a 300,000-acre oil-sands property, is believed to hold 6.8 billion barrels of oil, while Pembina is a mature light sweet oil field from which the company could realize between 150 million and 400 million barrels. \u001d  Charlie Ergen, 54, chairman of EchoStar Communications (DISH), is another owner-manager of the sort Berkowitz loves. Fairholme bought EchoStar in the high-20s per share from mid-2005 to early 2006, a time of great uncertainty for pay-TV distribution companies, especially those in the DBS/Satellite industry. The stock now trades for about 49. Berkowitz wagers the company's free cash flow could approach $5 a share after taxes \"in a couple of years,\" up from around $3 now. \u001d  Fairholme also was attracted to copper giant Phelps Dodge despite concerns about management. \"We got it at an incredibly cheap price, and [the presence of] activist shareholders gave us confidence that shareholders would be protected,\" Pitkowsky says. The company was purchased in March for $26 billion, or $128.68 a share, by Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX). \u001d  Fairholme picked up most of its Phelps Dodge shares in the spring and summer of 2006, at prices ranging from the high-70s to mid-80s. At the time, says Berkowitz, the company's \"unhedged cash flow per share was approaching $20.\" \u001d  The Fairholme team plans to hang on to the Freeport-McMoRan shares it received in exchange for its Phelps Dodge stock. \"It looks attractive to us because of demand from China and 20 years of underinvestment in new copper facilities,\" said Trauner. \u001d  Freeport-McMoRan said last week that its first-quarter profit came close to doubling, due to rising metals prices and the acquisition of Phelps Dodge. If commodities prices hold at current levels, the company's free cash flow could climb to more than $7 per share from a current $6, Pitkowsky says. \u001d  Given Fairholme's evident talent for picking winners, why the side bet on cash? Typically cash averages 20% of the portfolio, though it currently accounts for 24%. \"We think cash is a strategic asset for the fund,\" Berkowitz says. \"Though we would eagerly become fully invested under the right circumstances, shareholders have benefited to date from holding some cash.\" \u001d  Twenty-four percent isn't \"some,\" but it's hard to argue with Fairholme's sterling record. \u001d  --- \u001d  J.R.

Long-term performance declines, however, continued and recently accelerated, making that test not viable. \b \u001d  \"This action in no way reflects adversely on the hard work of people associated with Smokey Bones and we will take care of every employee affected by this action,\" said Darden Chairman and CEO Clarence Otis. \"The remaining Smokey Bones restaurants are a viable business, but one that is not consistent with Darden's vision for a national restaurant concept.\" \b \u001d  Remaining Smokey Bones restaurants are located primarily in the South, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and New England. \b \u001d  The decision to sell Smokey Bones allows Darden to better focus its efforts on more productive businesses that will provide stronger opportunities for employees, said Drew Madsen, Darden's president and chief operating officer. The company will carefully evaluate each closing restaurant to determine whether it is suitable for use by one of Darden's other restaurant brands, and will begin marketing the remainder immediately. \b \u001d  \"Many of these closed restaurants are valuable locations,\" Madsen said. \"They just didn't work as barbecue restaurants.  We expect these properties to serve the public again as vibrant restaurants and retail businesses.\" \b \u001d  Darden will give 4,000 employees who worked at closed Smokey Bones restaurants opportunities to transfer to other Darden locations.  And for those who leave the company, Darden will provide support to help their transition. \b \u001d  \"Darden is doing the difficult things required to grow,\" Otis said. \"The company's long-term growth goals remain unchanged.\" \b \u001d  Darden, headquartered in Orlando, FL, owns and operates about 1,400 Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze, Smokey Bones, and Seasons 52(R) restaurants. The company is the 25th largest employer in the United States with 160,000 employees. It is also the world's largest casual dining company with $5.7 billion in annual sales. \b \b \b          Smokey Bones and Rocky River Grillhouse Closed Restaurants \b                       (Listed alphabetically by state) \b \b    State  Market              Address                    Location \b \b    1.

But we at Barron's, at least, noticed a curious discrepancy in a graphic montage that was part of the package. \u001d  Among pictures of various Dow Jones publications, the graphic showed a purported Barron's front page dated March 3, 2003, with the headline \"Barron's on Bankmark.\" We all drew a blank. Our cover story in that issue was actually apiece on Cathay Pacific, with utterly different art. \u001d  Worried that disgraced Times scribe Jason Blair might've infiltrated the art department, we called the paper's design chief. He surmised that some staffers, out later in the week, had picked what they thought was a legitimate image from Google, where the befuddling cover does indeed feature prominently. \u001d  \"Look, screw-ups happen, especially when one is not careful picking stuff off the Web,\" he explained equably. \"I will chastise them Monday when they come back to work.\" \u001d  No need to. We all make mistakes. But if they had asked, we could have loaned them a real copy of Barron's. \u001d  -- JONATHAN R.

Bank of America (BAC), which had agreed to pay a net $16 billion for LaSalle, has reason to be angry. \u001d  The LaSalle sale would have made ABN less attractive to the RBS consortium, furthering the Dutch company's goal of being bought instead by Barclays (BCS). RBS contends that the LaSalle sale can't proceed without ABN shareholder approval; ABN asserts that it can. \u001d  Bank of America is highly unlikely to get anywhere by suing ABN over the blocked deal. For one thing, a court -- not ABN -- froze Barclay's sale of LaSalle. And even if BofA somehow moves the litigation into a U.S. court, its chance of overturning the ruling seems slim, given that ABN is domiciled in the Netherlands. In addition, it should be fairly easy to argue that the LaSalle sale was effectively a poison pill to prevent a rival bid for ABN from succeeding. \u001d  There are multiple potential outcomes to this fraught takeover battle. The most obvious: Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.U.K.) offers ABN more for LaSalle than BofA is willing to pay. But RBS makes its bid contingent on buying all of ABN. In essence, it ends up paying itself. ABN's Dutch retail business probably would then go to Royal Bank's consortium partner Fortis (FORA.Netherlands), a Dutch-Belgian bank, while Spain's Banco Santander (STD) would buy ABN's Brazilian and Italian operations. \u001d  Another possibility: Barclays revises its original all-share offer. Add a cash component -- possibly followed by a rights issue, to balance the leverage on its balance sheet -- and you might have a credible counteroffer to the RBS-led consortium's. \u001d  In any case, the stakes have gotten higher for Barclays. If it loses ABN, it could become a target itself, with perhaps BofA as its leading hunter. After all, the U.K. bank's bid for ABN -- with which it has few geographic overlaps -- indicates that it is running out of immediate internal growth opportunities. Moreover, Barclays' shares currently trade at roughly 8.4 times forward earnings, around a 6% discount to its peers. \u001d  The Dutch judge has given ABN until mid-June to appeal the move, ample time for both bidding parties to revisit their strategies. The only immediate loser after Thursday's ruling is ABN's management, for whom the court decision is a direct snub. \u001d  News Corp., which launched a takeover bid last week for Dow Jones, Barron's parent, isn't the only Rupert Murdoch property making stock-market news these days. \u001d  BSkyB's New York-traded American depositary shares (BSY) were fetching 50.32 at midday Friday, about 25% above where they began the year. Why? \u001d  True, the U.K. satellite broadcaster recently reported good first-quarter earnings, but it also disclosed that its marketing costs had jumped and that its customer-churn rate is on the rise. And it is facing multiple legal and regulatory challenges to its latest strategic moves. \u001d  BSkyB might yet have to sell its stake in cable's ITV at a loss and see the terrestrial broadcaster fall into the hands of rival Virgin Media, which has taken BSkyB to court in a dispute over the supplying of basic Sky channels to the cable company. And the success of ITV and Setanta Sports in outbidding the BBC and BSkyB for rights to show the FA Cup, English soccer's top knockout competition, is an ominous sign of growing competition. \u001d  But investors seem to have concluded that BSkyB has crossed a critical threshold. Capital spending is leveling off after the broadcaster's initial broadband and high-definition TV assault, while subscriber growth is accelerating and the company is taking a bigger share of U.K. television advertising, even if that pie is shrinking. \u001d  BSkyB says its gross direct-to-home customer additions were the highest in a fiscal third quarter in six years. At 340,000, the total exceeded even bullish forecasts. Churn did worsen, but BSkyB points to the phasing-out of discounts that cost it some business, short-term, and left net new customer additions at a more modest 51,000. But those new customers seem to be buying higher-priced products, with average revenue per user coming in above 400 British pounds for the first time. \u001d  All this promises extra earnings growth, perhaps not fully reflected in the admittedly robust 21 times forward earnings multiple that BSkyB's stock has been trading at. \u001d  That said, BSkyB now faces much higher expectations of its operating performance, suggesting that any slippage will be judged harshly by investors. \u001d  --- \u001d  Arindam Nag, who is based in London, and Matthew Curtin, who writes from Paris, are contributors to The Skeptic, a Dow Jones Newswires column on which this European Trader is based. \u001d  --- \u001d  DOW JONES GLOBAL INDEXES \b \b Region/ \b Country \b  DJ Global          DJ Global          DJ Global     Point \b   Indexes,           Indexes,           Indexes,      Chg.    % Chg. \bLocal Curr.

So the bet is at these lower levels, a good management begins to identify more with the new environment and build up Internet-related activities.

(QAN.AU) was up in the air Saturday, with Australia's Takeovers Panel considering whether to allow the consortium to proceed with its A$10.8 billion offer for the airline. \u001d  The Airline Partners Australia consortium, which includes U.S. buyout group TPG Inc., is seeking permission from the panel to continue with its bid for the airline after receiving a late acceptance for its A$5.45 a share offer, pushing its interest in the airline over the key 50%-level. \u001d  The world's largest airline takeover looked to have failed late Friday after APA said acceptances fell short of 50% - the level necessary to trigger an automatic two week extension of the bid - by the 0900 GMT Friday deadline. \u001d  A person familiar with the situation said at the time the acceptance level for the offer had reached 46%. \u001d  \"However, subsequently on Friday, APA received an acceptance from a large investor, which would be sufficient to take acceptances for Qantas shares to more than 50%. APA intends to make submissions to the Takeovers Panel to allow the offer to continue,\" APA said. \u001d  A spokeswoman for the APA consortium declined to give further details, including who the large shareholder was and what time the acceptance arrived. \u001d  Unsourced local media reports said U.S. corporate raider Samuel Heyman, who had built up a 10% stake in the airline, had failed to accept the offer by the deadline. Without citing sources, The Australian newspaper said APA had expected Heyman to accept. \u001d  It is not known whether the late acceptance came from Heyman. \u001d  Officials from Macquarie were not immediately available for comment. \u001d  The Takeovers Panel called an emergency meeting Saturday to consider the bidders' plea, a person familiar with the situation said. The person did not indicate how long the panel could take to make a decision, although they said a ruling was unlikely Saturday. \b \u001d  APA Situation Unprecedented; Outcome Uncertain \b \u001d  \"We don't believe the APA is over the line,\" BBY analyst Fabian Babich said. \u001d  \"Technically, the offer closed at 7.00 pm (local time) and what we have here is an unprecedented event. We are in uncharted waters,\" Babich said \u001d  Babich said from a commercial perspective, it may not matter that the bid was late, but the key consideration by the Takeovers Panel will be whether any party will be hurt by the situation. \u001d  \"There're all sorts of considerations that the Takeovers Panel has to take into account,\" he said. He noted that while Qantas shares were not trading, the credit default swap market traded wildly in the wake of the developments. \u001d  \"In making the decision, because it is a first, it will be a precedent setting decision and they will have to consider it very, very carefully,\" Babich said. \"We thought this one would be a photo finish, but we had nothing like this in mind,\" he added. \u001d  The Qantas board also held an emergency meeting Saturday and said afterwards it will make a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange before trade starts on Monday. It did not specify the exact timing of the statement. \u001d  If the panel rules against the consortium, and deems the late application as unacceptable, APA will drop the A$5.45 a share bid, which was strongly supported by Qantas' board. This is expected to prompt calls for the resignation of members, including Chief Executive Officer Geoff Dixon and Chairwoman Margaret Jackson, who readily embraced the takeover offer. \u001d  The offer for Qantas, a former state-owned national carrier fondly known as the Flying Kangaroo, was one of the largest and most controversial takeover bids in Australia's corporate history. \u001d  Even before Friday's deadline, APA was forced to revise its bid a month ago due to shareholder dissatisfaction at the offer price. \u001d  BBY's Babich expects Qantas shares to nosedive if the consortium is told it cannot progress with the offer. \u001d  If that happens, analysts say shares are likely to fall below A$5.00. Many of the airlines' shares are held by hedge funds, who are seen as likely to quickly sell down their holdings in the wake of the bid's failure. \u001d  Qantas shares closed up 1 cent Friday at A$5.38. \u001d  Babich said if the panel does not reach a decision by Monday, trading in Qantas shares will almost certainly be suspended on the Australian Stock Exchange. \u001d  Qantas has upgraded earnings twice since the bid was launched six months ago, and the airline continues to report strong passenger growth. In its statement Saturday, the Qantas board said it is confident that the various businesses in the group \"continue to operate in a highly professional manner.\" \b \u001d  -By Lyndal McFarland, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2957; lyndal.mcfarland@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Alan Soughley \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 02:14 ET (06:14 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8233fa761ebcf09cb64258bba98e848c","symR":["AEP.AU","AFG.AU","MBL.AU","QAN.AU","AU000000AEP3","AU000000AFG9","AU000000MBL3","AU000000QAN2"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Australia's Qantas: Note APA Submission To Takeovers Panel","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AEP.AU","AFG.AU","MBL.AU","QAN.AU","AU000000AEP3","AU000000AFG9","AU000000MBL3","AU000000QAN2"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","AMG","FIS","SCR","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8660efceda7eda7124dd75acf80d23db","symR":["30110.AE","ABN","BAC","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109","US0605051046"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(5/5) Trade In ABN Shares Draws Review By UK Regulator","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30110.AE","ABN","BAC","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109","US0605051046"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Carrick Mollenkamp, Ann Carrns, Alistair MacDonald and Jason Singer \u001d  The United Kingdom's financial-services regulator has begun a preliminary review of hedge-fund trading in ABN Amro Holding NV shares shortly before a recent takeover bid by a consortium of European banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, according to people familiar with the situation. \u001d  Separately, Bank of America Corp. filed a lawsuit against ABN seeking to enforce its $21 billion agreement to buy the Dutch firm's LaSalle Bank unit in the U.S. That deal stemmed from ABN's earlier agreement to be bought by Britain's Barclays PLC for $89.9 billion in stock. \u001d  People familiar with the hedge-fund inquiry said Britain's Financial Services Authority is looking into trading that took place shortly before the consortium of European banks disclosed on April 25 that it intended to bid about 39 euros ($52.87) a share, or 72.27 billion euros ($98 billion), for ABN. The consortium and ABN in recent days have struck a conciliatory chord in discussing that bid. A bid had been expected Friday night but it may not arrive until Saturday morning or as late as Sunday as RBS scrambles to finalize one, according to people familiar with the situation. \u001d  One trade under review, according to these people, involves the purchase of about 100 million euros in ABN shares by London hedge fund Toscafund Asset Management LLP on April 24. The next day, after the RBS-led consortium announced its bid, ABN shares rose 3.5% in Amsterdam. \u001d  The consortium's desire to bid for ABN was well-known at the time of the Toscafund purchase. The RBS group issued a statement April 13 disclosing its interest. People familiar with the situation said the FSA probe, which started within the past week, is preliminary. A spokesman for the FSA declined comment, as did a spokeswoman for RBS. \u001d  Toscafund, which has $4.5 billion under management and specializes in investments in financial firms, is owned by Old Oak Holdings Ltd., according to U.K. corporate records. Old Oak's nonexecutive chairman is George Mathewson, the former chairman and chief executive of RBS. \u001d  A Toscafund spokesman said the fund doesn't comment on its portfolio. During RBS's annual meeting April 25, the day RBS announced its bid for ABN, Mr. Mathewson said in an interview that Toscafund owned about 1% of ABN. He also said the hedge fund supported RBS's consortium bid and that he hadn't discussed the proposed offer with his successor at RBS, Fred Goodwin. \u001d  A Toscafund spokesman said Mr. Mathewson isn't involved in any investment decisions of Toscafund. \u001d  Dutch regulator Autoriteit Financiele Markten, or AFM, also is conducting an inquiry into stock trading tied to ABN. A possible focus is how hedge funds gathered information amid the fight for ABN, according to people familiar with that probe. \u001d  Meanwhile, Bank of America's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, further complicated the complex merger scenario unfolding on two continents. \u001d  Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by stock-market value, claimed it has the legal right to buy Chicago-based LaSalle and sought an injunction blocking ABN from selling LaSalle to anyone else or even negotiating with other potential buyers, except under the conditions specified in their original agreement. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., also seeks unspecified monetary damages. \u001d  ABN Amro declined to comment on the suit. \u001d  ABN \"is contractually obligated to proceed with the LaSalle transaction whether or not it merges with Barclays [or any other party or no party at all],\" Bank of America said in the lawsuit. \u001d  The legal action followed a ruling a day earlier by a Dutch court that ordered ABN to halt the sale of LaSalle until ABN shareholders can vote on the transaction. ABN agreed to the sale to bolster its original agreement to be taken over by Barclays. \u001d  Under the agreement between Bank of America and ABN, another buyer -- such as the consortium led by RBS -- has until Sunday to offer a competing bid for LaSalle. Bank of America would then have five business days to match the higher offer. If Bank of America declined to match that offer, it is entitled to a substantial breakup fee. \u001d  In its suit, Bank of America said ABN has breached \"representations and warranties\" in its agreement to sell LaSalle, because ABN had assured Bank of America that it had the authority to sell LaSalle without any shareholder vote. As a result, the suit says, Bank of America has suffered \"substantial harm.\" \u001d  Amid those maneuvers, ABN and the RBS group have become much more friendly. ABN and the consortium have several working groups toiling around the clock to assist the Royal Bank team in coming up with a firm rival bid, people familiar with the situation said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:00 ET (04:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"90a3563d6d99b75a84fa6f6f90f540d9","symR":["HUM","UNH","WLP","US91324P1021","US94973V1070"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) A Clean Bill Of Health -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HUM","UNH","WLP","US91324P1021","US94973V1070"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  Yet Schaeffer was succeeded as chairman and CEO by Anthem alumnus Larry Glasscock, a 59-year-old former banker best known for his amiability and skill in \"relationship management.\" According to some observers, the integration of more than a dozen disparate computer systems -- a legacy of past WellPoint/Anthem acquisition blitzes -- has languished somewhat under Glasscock. Product innovation has likewise flagged. \u001d  But that might be about to change. Last February, Glasscock announced his intention to give up his posts as president and CEO at the beginning of June, though he would remain chairman. Named by the board to fill the two positions was dark horse Angela Braly, WellPoint's current executive vice president and general counsel. \u001d  Wall Street was stunned. CIBC analyst Carl McDonald called the move \"a curve out of left field.\" Most analysts were betting on Colby, their long-time contact at the company. Yet Colby tells Barron's and whoever else asks that he's perfectly comfortable with Braly's promotion and has no plans to leave the company. \u001d  In fact, Braly is likely to surprise the skeptics with her creativity and drive, several sources told Barron's. Moreover, her background in corporate law and public affairs make her an ideal advocate for the company in the battles that likely loom, particularly if the Democrats by 2009 control both the White House and Congress. Universal coverage for America's 47 million uninsured is among the hot-button issues. \u001d  WellPoint and other managed-care companies are no longer as demonized as they were in the 'Nineties for unfairly rationing care and penny-pinching by booting new mothers out of maternity wards after 24 hours. But the battle is now about to be joined between the all-government health-care jihadists and the proponents of the competitive, free-market health model. \u001d  We suspect that the managed care industry will fare well in the struggle. And that, at least, will be good news to WellPoint's shareholders. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:10 ET (04:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"939c6a877d2a15dc8b9510c110b90820","symR":["PTTRX"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) Fund Of Information: Gross: Unfazed After 20 Years","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PTTRX"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","ZFU"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \u001d  By Lawrence C. Strauss \u001d  Twenty years ago this week, bill gross rolled out the Pimco Total Return Fund (ticker: PTTRX). Gross wasn't the superstar he is today. But the timing of the launch turned out to be right on the money. \u001d  Interest rates were coming down, boosting bond prices. Gross and his crew put a bigger weighting on price appreciation than on yield. \u001d  That sometimes meant buying bonds with longer maturities and durations -- \"in some cases, a sacrifice of yield relative to price potential,\" he says. And \"people just didn't view bonds moving in price,\" Gross, Pimco's managing director, told Barron's in an interview last week. \"They were viewed in terms of their yield.\" \u001d  As the fund name attests, Gross emphasized total return -- a combination of yield and price-appreciation -- continuing an investment philosophy that the Newport Beach, Calif., bond shop had developed on the institutional side. \u001d  Gross was on the right side of a secular trend. Rates continued to fall, and the fund has been very popular with investors. It now has about $103 billion in assets, the largest bond fund in the U.S. \u001d  From its inception until April 30, the fund's institutional share class had an annual return of 8.28%, besting the 7.52% gain of the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index (which measures investment-grade bonds), according to Morningstar. \u001d  Gross was a big believer in derivatives. Pimco had started using futures in the early 1980s. Interest-rate swaps followed. \u001d  The latest derivatives phase surfaced more recently, with credit-default swaps, collateralized debt obligations and indexes tracking those products. \"We've trailed the enthusiasm for many of these recent products, if only because they have been introduced at a time when their yields aren't that attractive,\" says Gross, a member of the Barron's Roundtable. \u001d  Credit spreads remain tight, and many yield-hungry investors have chased riskier assets. \"The trade has been to jump on the bandwagon, and I sort of wish we had,\" admits Gross. \"The problem is that, from today's starting point, the valuations are extremely high and you are not getting much in return for the potential risk that you take.\" \u001d  He maintains that the explosion of derivatives in recent years allows the global financial system to \"lay off\" some of the risk, but \"the problem is that these derivatives, by their nature and design, are inherently leveraged.\" \u001d  Gross sees a \"strong global economy but a weak U.S. economy that's predicated primarily on housing,\" and he expects the Fed to cut rates later this year, most likely by a quarter or half percentage point. He warns, however, that \"there's limited total return over the next six to 12 months.\" \u001d  The fund's girth, which some say has limited his selection of securities, doesn't faze Gross. \"We can still do whatever we want to do,\" he says, pointing out that the swaps and futures markets are very liquid. \u001d  His record does have a few blemishes. Gross didn't think the Fed would raise rates as much as it did in recent years, and he exited corporate bonds \"a little early.\" Still, his smarts and savvy have far outweighed his mistakes. Just ask anyone who invested in Total Return 20 years ago. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: lawrence.strauss@barrons.com \u001d  --- \b                        Scoreboard \b \b                    Edging Out the S&P \b \b Equity-income funds have gained 17.72% in the past year, a little ahead of \bthe S&P 500's 16.67% total return, according to Lipper, the fund-tracking \barm of Reuters.

Fialka and Kathryn Kranhold \u001d  WASHINGTON -- Manufacturers and environmentalists are hammering out a nationwide energy-saving lighting standard that, if enacted by Congress, would effectively phase out the common household light bulb in about 10 years. That in turn could produce major cuts in the nation's electricity costs and greenhouse-gas emissions. \u001d  The new standard is expected to compel a huge shift by American consumers and businesses away from incandescent bulbs to more efficient -- but also more expensive -- fluorescent models, by requiring more light per energy unit than is yielded by most incandescents in use. The winner, at least in the near term, likely would be the compact fluorescent light bulb, or CFL. \u001d  Whatever rule is proposed by the groups would likely be incorporated into energy legislation passed last week by the Senate Energy Committee that the full chamber is set to debate by the end of the month, committee aides say. This bill, the Democrats' first major energy initiative since taking control of Congress in January, calls for new efficiency standards for appliances and motor vehicles and mandates the use of more alternative fuels, such as ethanol, by 2022. \u001d  While the move could face resistance from some consumer groups and from low- and fixed-income constituencies, Energy Committee aides say there is bipartisan support in Congress for a new lighting standard. \u001d  \"Congress should do all it can to encourage industry and consumer groups to work with government in setting standards for energy-efficient products, including light bulbs and new lighting technologies,\" said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat who is chairman of the panel. \u001d  Fluorescent bulbs have been around for years and are known to be more economical over the long run, but consumers have shown a clear preference for the softer and more easily adjusted glow of incandescent bulbs, which also carry a much cheaper sticker price. Now, there is push toward using regulation to force adoption of the more energy-efficient product. \u001d  The Senate panel estimates a shift from the standard tungsten filament incandescent bulb and other relatively inefficient forms of lighting would save $18 billion in electricity costs every year. Because 50% of the nation's electricity comes from coal-fired power plants, this would also reduce demand equivalent to that currently met by 80 coal-fired power plants. Burning coal releases pollutants including carbon dioxide, which scientists think is accelerating climate change, and mercury, which can damage the nervous systems of small children. \u001d  The move away from the current incandescent bulb, invented by Thomas Edison in 1879, would create at least an $8 billion market for more-efficient lighting, analysts say. There are four billion electric light sockets in the U.S., most of them in homes, and some would be filled with CFLs, which use 75% less energy and can last more than six times as long, according to industry estimates. Manufacturers expect over the next decade to provide consumers with other choices as well, since CFLs don't work as well in applications such as reading lamps. \u001d  \"It's the right thing to do,\" says Randall B. Moorhead, vice president for the North American affiliate of Royal Phillips Electronics NV of the Netherlands. \"But we're also hoping we'll make some money. It's not entirely altruistic.\" \u001d  The three biggest light-bulb makers, Philips, General Electric Co. and Osram Sylvania, a unit of Germany's Siemens AG, have more efficient lighting products in development. GE is the biggest seller of compact fluorescent lights in the U.S. In February, the Fairfield, Conn., company announced it would be introducing an incandescent bulb that will be comparably efficient to CFLs and would likely meet standards now being discussed. Manufacturers also are re-engineering light-emitting diodes that are currently too pricey for the consumer market but will likely fall in price over time. \u001d  One reason bulb makers are willing to negotiate a new federal standard is that a half-dozen states, led by California and Texas, are weighing bans on incandescent bulbs. Australia, Canada and the European Union are also considering phasing out such lights. \u001d  \"If there are all these intrastate regulations, it will become tough as a skunk to get these things to work. It becomes very challenging to the retailer,\" says Richard Upton, president and chief executive of the American Lighting Association, which represents lamp makers and retail-lighting showrooms in the U.S. and Canada. \u001d  The talks on establishing a new nationwide standard include the bulb makers, the lighting association, the Alliance to Save Energy, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy and the Natural Resources Defense Council, among others. They have been under way since March, after Phillips declared that incandescent bulbs should be phased out within 10 years. \u001d  \"I think we're half to two-thirds of the way there,\" says Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. He predicts the result will be a two-stage federal standard that will require bulbs that use 30% less electricity within five years and bulbs that are 75% more efficient within 10 years. The talks are also aimed at standards that would remove the least-efficient street lights and fluorescent lights that are used in offices. \u001d  The resulting sharp cut in electricity demand would be the quickest and most effective energy curb in this year's energy bills, says Bill Prindle, acting executive director for the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. Noting that electricity consumption is scheduled to increase by 20% by 2020, Mr. Prindle says new \"clean tech\" energy forms such as alternate fuels and advanced wind power won't begin to reduce emissions until energy demand is cut. \"We have to do both,\" he says. \u001d  GE's Earl Jones, senior counsel for the company's consumer and industrial business, says the goal is to agree on efficiency standards that reduce greenhouse gases and cut energy consumption, but also \"satisfy basic consumer interest in the quality of light in their home and at work.\" \u001d  \"The winners will be the manufacturers whose technology can deliver the highest lumens without compromising quality of light,\" Mr. Jones said. A lumen is a measure of light. \u001d  Shifting to compact fluorescent light bulbs will be more expensive for homeowners at the outset. Incandescent bulbs can be bought as cheaply as 25 cents, but compact fluorescent bulbs can cost between $2 and $3. However, because the more-expensive bulbs use much less electricity and last far longer, they can pay for themselves in as little as six months, depending on usage, says Jeff Harris, vice president for the Alliance to Save Energy, a coalition of business, government, environmental and consumer leaders that advocates efficiency policies that minimize costs to society and consumers. In addition, the prices of compact fluorescents are falling. But it isn't known whether CFLs will be more economical or efficient than future technologies. \u001d  There are other drawbacks that have limited the more efficient bulb's market penetration. Aside from lighting quality, compact fluorescent bulbs include a tiny amount of mercury that would require their disposal through recycling programs. According to Mr. Moorhead of Philips, CFLs only fill an estimated 6% of American sockets. \u001d  GE and Osram, in weighing the details of a new standard, need to ensure that they have enough time to retrofit their incandescent-light factories to make more energy-efficient lights. Philips doesn't have any incandescent factories in the U.S. CFLs, which are much more labor intensive, are mostly manufactured in China. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9f7dc4f4539709a6e7ba3d81e60a946b","symR":["AEP.AU","AFG.AU","MBL.AU","QAN.AU","AU000000AEP3","AU000000AFG9","AU000000MBL3","AU000000QAN2"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Qantas, APA In Uncharted Territory; Deal Uncertain - Analyst","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T05:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AEP.AU","AFG.AU","MBL.AU","QAN.AU","AU000000AEP3","AU000000AFG9","AU000000MBL3","AU000000QAN2"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","AMG","FIS","SCR","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--The outcome of the A$10.8 billion takeover bid for Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN.AU) is far from certain, and even though the bidding consortium now has more than 50% of the company's shares, the Takeovers Panel could still stop the deal from proceeding, BBY analyst Fabian Babich said Saturday. \u001d  The Macquarie Bank Ltd. (MBL.AU)-led bidding consortium said it is seeking permission from Australia's Takeovers Panel to continue with its bid for the airline after receiving a late acceptance for its A$5.45 a share offer, pushing its interest in the airline over the key 50%-level. \u001d  The world's largest airline takeover looked to have failed late Friday after the consortium, Airline Partners Australia, said it appeared that acceptances fell short of 50%, the level necessary to trigger an automatic two week extension of the bid. \u001d  The Takeovers Panel has been convened for an emergency meeting Saturday, a person familiar with the situation said earlier. \u001d  \"We don't believe the APA is over the line,\" BBY's Babich said. \u001d  \"Technically, the offer closed at 7pm (0900 GMT, Friday) and what we have here is an unprecedented event. We are in uncharted waters,\" Babich said. \u001d  Babich said from a commercial perspective, it may not matter that the bid was late, but the key consideration by the Takeovers Panel will be whether any party will be hurt by the situation. \u001d  \"There're all sorts of considerations that the Takeovers Panel has to take into account,\" he said. He noted that while Qantas shares were not trading, the credit default swap market traded wildly in the wake of the developments. \u001d  \"In making the decision, because it is a first, it will be a precedent setting decision and they will have to consider it very, very carefully,\" Babich said. \u001d  \"We thought this one would be a photo finish, but we had nothing like this in mind,\" he added. \u001d  If the panel rules against the consortium, and deems the late application as unacceptable, APA will drop the bid. \u001d  Babich expects Qantas shares to nosedive if the consortium is told it cannot progress with the offer. \u001d  If that happens, analysts say shares are likely to fall below A$5.00. Qantas shares closed up 1 cent Friday at A$5.38. \u001d  Babich said if a decision is not reached Monday, trading in Qantas shares will almost certainly be suspended on the Australian Stock Exchange. \b \u001d  -By Lyndal McFarland, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2957; lyndal.mcfarland@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Alan Soughley \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 01:13 ET (05:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9fc2f374729c0840b3023f39064b038b","symR":["DRI","US2371941053"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Darden Restaurants Announces Intent to Sell Smokey Bones; Expects Pre-Tax Charge of Approximately $260 Million in Fourth Quarter","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T14:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DRI","US2371941053"],"IndustryCodes":["RES","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  ORLANDO, Fla., May 5 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Darden Restaurants, Inc., (NYSE: DRI) today announced its intention to sell its Smokey Bones restaurant operations.  The Company estimates it will incur a pre-tax charge of approximately $260 million in the fourth quarter in connection with this action. Seventy-three operating Smokey Bones restaurants will be offered for sale, and the other 54 Smokey Bones and two Rocky River Grillhouse restaurants were closed today. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20050203/FLTH026LOGO ) \b \u001d  \"This was a difficult decision because guests continue to give the Smokey Bones experience solid marks and there is a core of restaurants with good sales and earnings levels,\" said Clarence Otis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Darden.  \"However, the Smokey Bones concept and related business model was designed to be a nationally advertised brand.  Since it is not on a path to achieving this vision, we have concluded that it is not a meaningful growth vehicle for Darden.  As a result, we've decided to exit the Smokey Bones business and offer it and the related assets for sale. Even as we make this difficult decision, we appreciate the passion and commitment of the employees of Smokey Bones and we're working to ensure that employees affected by the closures are given opportunities to transfer to other Darden locations. We are convinced this action is appropriate, timely and beneficial to our shareholders.\" \b \u001d  The fourth-quarter estimated pre-tax charge of approximately $260 million includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of $235 million for all 129 restaurants and $25 million in other estimated costs related to the closure of 54 Smokey Bones restaurants and two Rocky River Grillhouse restaurants.  The Company will immediately pursue a sale of the remaining 73 Smokey Bones restaurants, which are located primarily in the eastern half of the U.S.  The Company's financial statements will now include a line-item for discontinued operations that includes the charge related to this action as well as the operating results for all Smokey Bones and Rocky River Grillhouse restaurants. Based on projected proceeds from the sale of the business and certain closed restaurants, the total cash effect of the steps being taken is expected to be positive. \b \b    Fiscal 2007 Outlook \b \u001d  The Company anticipates that diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations will be $2.48 to $2.52 in fiscal 2007 (which includes the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2007), or an increase of 11% to 12% over last year.  Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2006 was approximately $2.24, compared to the previously reported diluted net earnings per share of $2.16, indicating an estimated net loss per share from discontinued operations of $0.08.

Forsyth \u001d  Prof. Reddam, residing in Laguna Beach with 20 racehorses in training, no doubt is enjoying life a lot more these days than the purchasers of his former company. General Motors last week reported a 90% plunge in first-quarter earnings, largely stemming from big losses at GMAC Financial Services on subprime mortgages. GM still has a 49% stake in GMAC, which has seen the retirement or resignation of the CEO, CFO and treasurer of its ResCap mortgage unit in recent weeks. \u001d  Liquidity, the colt, has speed early on, Sandy says, but probably will get stressed out and lack the kick to sustain him down the stretch. In any case, the choice of his name says something about the zeitgeist, at least among thoroughbred owners who compete at this level. (Don't ask what the name of 50-1 shot Imawildandcrazyguy implies.) \u001d  Liquidity, in the financial sense, also made for a burst of speed for subprime lending out of the gate, but hasn't been enough to sustain these marginal mortgages down the stretch in recent months. The liquidity hasn't disappeared, but simply moved to other arenas. \u001d  Liquidity clearly rules in all the financial markets around the globe, providing the fuel for moonshots and melt-ups everywhere from Shanghai to even the staid Standard & Poor's 500. Scarcely a week after the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 13,000 mark, the S&P topped 1500 for the first time since Sept. 7, 2000, and ended Friday just 20 points shy of the Bubble peak of March 24, 2000. \u001d  The DJIA wound up the week with its 23rd winning session out of the past 26, posting its 18th record of the year. But instead of the Dow industrials, much of the week's focus was on Dow Jones & Co., Barron's publisher, which received an unsolicited takeover bid from News Corp. Dow Jones' board took no action after Bancroft family trusts representing 52% of voting power opposed being absorbed into Rupert Murdoch's media empire. \u001d  And as a shareholder in Dow Jones, I'm precluded by the company's rules about reporting and writing about the stock. If those guidelines apply to other media outlets, the ranks of reporters available to write about the explosion of deals may be getting pretty thin. \u001d  Friday came news that Reuters was approached for a buyout, with the suitor widely reported to be Thomson of Canada. Suddenly, media are hot properties, even ones that just a few months ago couldn't get arrested. \u001d  Even the new media seemed to be getting into the act, with Microsoft and Yahoo! apparently doing their mating dance once again, Murdoch's New York Post reported in Friday's editions. Later that afternoon, The Wall Street Journal Online reported that the two tech giants had talked in recent months about a merger or combination, but the talks were no longer active. A year ago, Mr. Softy and Yahoo! explored ideas about taking on Google, but nothing came of that, either. \u001d  That's likely to come as a disappointment Monday morning to traders who bid up Yahoo's shares by as much as 19% at Friday's peak, before settling with a 9.9% gain on 12 times the usual turnover. At least in the case of Yahoo!, the move in its shares came after the news. In the case of the Dow Jones and Reuters overtures, somebody seemed to have too good a nose for news -- before it happened. \u001d  Call-options buying on Dow Jones jumped Monday, the day before News Corp. announced its stunning bid at a 67% premium over the previous day's closing price. Just lucky, right? In the same vein, Reuters' shares jumped 6% on heavy trading in London, before the news broke about merger talks, according to Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  But as in previous episodes of merger mania, insider trading appears to be alive and kicking, notwithstanding the best efforts of the SEC and other enforcement agencies. \u001d  Just last week, a Credit Suisse investment banker, Hafiz Naseem, was charged with conspiracy and securities fraud for leaking word of nine mergers, including the $32 billion buyout of TXU. The Pakistani banker who was the alleged recipient of Naseem's tips was said to have collected ill-gotten gains totaling $7.5 million, with $5 million coming from TXU stock and options. \b \u001d  This sort of deal frenzy is more indicative of market tops than bottoms. Doubly so, in fact, because it involves the purveyors of business and financial news and data. Now that finance is far and away the stock market's biggest sector, a News Corp. takeover of Dow Jones could be seen as analogous to the infamous AOL-Time Warner deal at the peak of the tech bubble, if not in size, then in symbolism. \u001d  News Corp.'s designs on Dow Jones clearly are rooted in the impending launch of a Fox business-news channel to take on CNBC. During the bear market, CNBC's ratings fell in tandem with the Nasdaq. But while CNBC's ratings are a tiny fraction of broadcast channels, it is wildly profitable, given the premium advertising paid to reach the affluent, investing public. \u001d  Oddly enough, the same public seems wary of jumping on the bullish bandwagon. \u001d  Mutual-fund inflows slowed further in March, while the American Association of Individual Investors' latest sentiment index finds 54.3% of respondents say they're bearish, nearly twice the 28.6% that declare themselves to be bulls (the other 17.1% are neutral fence-sitters.) \u001d  A couple of weeks ago, some 46.9% in the AAII survey were bullish, or more than half again the 29.6% that were bears. \u001d  By contrast, the pros are bullish. Investors Intelligence finds 51.7% of the investment advisers it polls are positive, with 24.7% bearish and 23.6% looking for a correction. \u001d  The memory of the Feb. 27 market downdraft seems fresh in the minds of individual investors, along with the similar correction that took place last May. What's remarkable is the rapidity of the recovery from the recent dip, with the 8% or so drop recouped in a matter of weeks instead of months, as was the case in 2006. \u001d  Indeed, with deals seemingly endless in number and boundless in size, the stock market has entered a proverbial melt-up that probably will continue until John and Jane Q. Public get sucked in. With the billions being thrown around by private equity, hedge funds and foreign-government funds, what else would you expect? \u001d  On the latter score, the central banks abroad are getting a little restive sitting on trillions of dollars of reserves parked in boring Treasury notes. Japan and China have announced plans to emulate Singapore in investing some of their cache in something other than cash, like stocks, for instance. (For more, see my Up & Down Wall Street Daily April 26 column on Barron's Online, \"Global Capital-Governments Compete with Capitalists.\") \u001d  This influx of liquidity has produced a seeming paradox -- a rapidly accelerating market set against the backdrop of a rapidly decelerating economy, writes Barry L. Ritholtz, chief market strategist of Ritholtz Research & Analytics. \"This is now a trading market, where momentum and trend dominate, increasingly detached from the decaying domestic fundamentals.\" \u001d  To attempt to square that circle, investors have been rotating increasingly to the big-cap names that populate the Dow 30 and dominate the Standard & Poor's 500. While the U.S. economy's growth slowed to a crawl of 1.3% in the first quarter, S&P earnings so far are posting gains on the order of 7% to 8%, twice the lowered expectations going into earnings season. And much of the those earnings gains are coming from overseas, in part because they're being translated into depreciated dollars. \u001d  As for the economy, proof of the continued slowdown arrived Friday morning in the form of another punk employment report, in which only 88,000 folks were added to nonfarm payrolls in April, the fewest in any month since November 2004. The unemployment rate ticked up by 0.1 percentage point, to 4.5%, which actually understates the weakness. In the household survey, the one used to calculate the jobless rate, some 392,000 folks were estimated to have dropped out of workforce. If you're not pounding the pavement for a job, you are not counted as unemployed. Had they been, the jobless rate would have been up 0.2 percentage points. \u001d  According to the Liscio Report, eateries and health care continue to account for the bulk of new jobs; over the past year, these sectors, comprising 16% of employment, accounted for 37% of new jobs. Meanwhile, the housing downturn was apparent, with construction jobs falling by 11,000 and finance jobs by the same number. (Mortgage brokers, perhaps consider bartending school?) \u001d  The good news -- from the standpoint of the markets and the Federal Reserve, if not working stiffs -- is that the growth in average hourly earnings has slowed markedly to just a 3.7% annual rate. That's what Bernanke & Co. have been waiting to see, but they'll continue to stand pat when the Federal Open Market Committee meets on Wednesday. \u001d  --- \u001d  e-mail: randall.forsyth@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a59c0457c7141c48a1fb8969759aebb2","symR":["KAL.NR","KE0000000307"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Kenya Airways Plane Crashed In S Cameroon-State Radio","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T08:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KAL.NR","KE0000000307"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR"],"Story":"\b \u001d  YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP)--A Kenya Airways flight with more than 100 people aboard has crashed in southern Cameroon, state radio reported Saturday. \u001d  The radio said the flight, which lost contact with airport controllers soon after taking off around midnight, crashed near the southern town of Niete. \u001d  The report did not provide further details. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 04:47 ET (08:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ab8c0d322903c0af81c17ba25a58b6a4","symR":["DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","AU000000NWS2"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(5/5) Regulators Probe Suspicious Trading In Dow Jones","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","AU000000NWS2"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","PUB","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Kara Scannell \u001d  The New York state attorney general's office and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating suspicious trading in Dow Jones & Co. stock and options prior to the public disclosure of News Corp.'s $5 billion offer for the company this past week, people familiar with the matter said. \u001d  News of the bid broke on Tuesday, two weeks after the board of Dow Jones received the unsolicited, $60-a-share offer from News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch. \u001d  A Dow Jones spokesman said the company had received a subpoena from the attorney general and an inquiry from the SEC. \"We will cooperate fully with the authorities investigating the matter,\" the spokesman said. A News Corp. spokesman said that company too had received a subpoena from the attorney general and an SEC inquiry. \"We are cooperating fully,\" the spokesman said. \u001d  Eric Corngold, New York state's executive deputy attorney general for economic justice, declined to comment, as did an SEC spokesman. \u001d  Several investment banks are advising News Corp. and Dow Jones. It isn't clear if any have been contacted yet by authorities. \u001d  The investigations into trading ahead of the Dow Jones bid come as the SEC has ramped up its focus on potential insider trading, especially involving Wall Street professionals and merger activity. On Thursday, the SEC and federal prosecutors in Manhattan filed insider-trading charges against a former Credit Suisse Group banker, accusing him of passing inside information about nine pending deals, including a takeover of Texas utility TXU Corp., to a financial executive in Pakistan while he was still at the bank. \u001d  The authorities likely will be looking at trading in Dow Jones options from late April. More than 10,000 call options on the stock changed hands in that period, compared with about 7,000 during the entire first quarter. \u001d  The gains that traders hoped to see came Tuesday, when shares of Dow Jones rose $19.87 to $56.20 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading on news of the News Corp. offer. Yesterday, shares of Dow Jones rose three cents to $55.80. \u001d  The stock move left some option traders with enormous profits. For example, on April 30, with Dow Jones shares trading around $36, traders snapped up call options that give them the right to pay $45 for the stock in the coming months. More than 3,400 of the call options changed hands during the session, which was the first time these traded at all in almost three months, according to Track Data. The following day, as the stock surged on news of Mr. Murdoch's offer, the positions rose to $12 from 35 cents -- a more-than-34-fold return. \u001d  Dow Jones's shares themselves traded very heavily on April 17, the day Mr. Murdoch sent a letter containing his proposed offer to the Dow Jones board. The company reported its first-quarter earnings the same day, and held its annual shareholder meeting the following day. The share price rose $1.13, or 3.2%, to $36.24, while nearly 2.8 million shares changed hands, more than double the average daily volume. \u001d  The outcome of the bid is in the hands of Dow Jones's controlling shareholders, the Bancroft family, which controls 64.2% of the voting stock through special Class B shares. Earlier this week, Dow Jones said members of the family accounting for about 52% of the voting stock opposed the offer. \u001d  Separately, Nora Vides, a Dow Jones shareholder, filed suit May 3 in New York state court, claiming that Dow Jones directors, including members of the Bancroft family, breached their fiduciary duty through a \"hasty\" rejection of News Corp.'s bid. The bid was rejected, the plaintiff claimed, so that the directors could maintain \"their controlling voting position against any real or perceived threat.\" Ms. Vides filed the suit, which seeks class-action status, on behalf of other shareholders. Legal representatives for the family couldn't be reached for comment. Dow Jones said it hadn't received the complaint and didn't have any comment. \u001d  --- \u001d  Mohammed Hadi, Randall Smith, Paul Davies, Stephanie Kang and Nathan Koppel contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:00 ET (04:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"abbc152d088d0cf4a3b456eaeddbe3e7","symR":["AMD","DJ","INTC","MRVL","MSFT","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","RTR.LN","RTRSY","TOC","TOC.T","YHOO","AU000000NWS2","CA8849031056","GB0002369139","US0079031078","US4581401001","US5949181045","US9843321061"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) Tech Trader: Waiting For Rupert's Call","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMD","DJ","INTC","MRVL","MSFT","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","RTR.LN","RTRSY","TOC","TOC.T","YHOO","AU000000NWS2","CA8849031056","GB0002369139","US0079031078","US4581401001","US5949181045","US9843321061"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","IAS","ISV","MED","PUB","SEM","SOF","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX","XTSE"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Bill Alpert \u001d  Rupert Murdoch hasn't yet called me. I hear he plans to pitch journalists as part of his campaign for Dow Jones and since I'm sure I'd be first on his list, he must not have started. I'll let you know. \u001d  News Corp. is hankering to put The Wall Street Journal on its television channels and online properties (ticker: NWS). Microsoft (MSFT) may be after the popular portals owned by Yahoo! (YHOO), if you can believe what's reported in Murdoch's New York Post. Reuters Group(RTRSY) says it's been approached by a buyer, reportedly Thomson (TOC), the data company that once owned newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic but which has been ditching paper-based stuff like it was burning. Even though I'm my floor's deputy fire warden I suggest you save some paper copies of Barron's, as the information business seems on the verge of a tectonic lurch online. These issues may soon become as valuable as Department 56 collectibles. \u001d  Barron's had said -- many times -- that Yahoo! looked undervalued (see, for example, \"Yahoo!'s Edge,\" May 22, 2006), assuming it succeeded in transforming itself from an Old Internet company to a New Internet company. I'll recuse myself from opining on our parent company's value, but after Friday's 10% jump to around 31 on the Post report, Yahoo! is now around 60 times some estimates of what it will earn this year. Those not-to-be fooled reporters at Dow Jones looked into the rumor and reported that the talks between Yahoo! and Microsoft were not active. So if you find a buyer who wants to pay up for an olde tyme business like Yahoo! or Reuters, then perhaps you should let 'em have it. \b \u001d  Intel held an impressive meeting with analysts Thursday, in which it showed it isn't going to let Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) steal a march on its microprocessor business any time soon. Several years back, Intel (INTC) got complacent in its processor monopoly and in 2003 AMD began winning market share with superior chips. But Intel is roaring back this year with chips that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company will produce on the processor industry's most advanced technology. As it shifts its production to transistors with features as small as 45 nanometers (or billionths of a meter) over the next year, Intel will be able to make processors that are either cheaper or more feature-packed than those from AMD. \u001d  Intel also discussed product and production plans that don't bode well for competing chip developers like Britain's ARM Holdings (ARMHY) or for capital equipment vendors like Applied Materials (AMAT), Novellus (NVLS) or KLA-Tencor (KLAC). In the next year, a tiny chip design that Intel has code-named Silverthorne will go after ARM's processor market in hand-held devices. And while Intel is investing in chip-making gear for its \"blizzard\" of new products, the company says that it can re-use 90% of its last-generation capital equipment for the new-gen chips. \u001d  Chief Financial Officer Andy Bryant said that he expected Intel's capital spending to drop about 5%, or $250 million, this year in comparison with last year -- as part of a broad cost-cutting campaign that will trim $2 billion from operating expenses this year and an additional $1 billion next year. As the company completes its startup of 45 nanometer production in 2007, it expects capital spending to decline as a percent of its cost-of-goods sold. That probably means a further decline in its purchases of stuff from vendors like Applied Materials. \u001d  Intel will remain a big buyer, mind you. Bryant estimated that the equipment it redeploys in next-generation production (the above-mentioned 90%) will supply about 60% of what Intel needs for its 45 nanometer fabrication. Nevertheless, that's an impressive level of re-use. Combine the thriftiness of firms like Intel with the calamitous oversupply now afflicting the market for memory chips, and it doesn't look like there will be torrid demand for semiconductor capital equipment in the next year. Too bad for Applied, Novellus and KLA. \u001d  Intel began winning back market share from AMD in the past six months, with chips that contained four processor \"cores\" on a single piece of silicon. AMD is promising its own quad-core processors by the end of the summer, which it says will be about 50% better than Intel's. But Intel is intent on being a fast-moving target. This year Intel will move its current processor architectures to the smaller 45 nano transistors and then next year introduce new processor architectures onto the 45 nano process -- for a four-fold performance gain. The company likes to call this alternation of process and architecture advances its \"Tick-Tock\" strategy, and it may leave AMD with the strategy of \"Huff and Puff.\" \u001d  The last time Intel tried to venture beyond computers into the market for cellphone chips, it failed. Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) is taking over the remnants of Intel's communications chip business. But Intel is taking another run at communications with its Silverthorne family of processors. The chips will be software-compatible with everything that runs on Intel's computer processor chips, yet require a fraction of the space and electrical current. These products will power a new generation of mobile devices for surfing the Internet without the compromises faced by today's cellphone and BlackBerry users. \u001d  The mobile internet market could be worth $10 billion to chipmakers by 2011, said the manager of Intel's ultra mobile group, Anand Chandrasekher, at Thursday's meeting. He's confident that Intel's low-power chips will beat out those from today's leader in handheld devices, ARM Holdings, as well as processors from Qualcomm (QCOM) and Texas Instruments (TXN) because Intel's will be compatible with all the Intel computer software developed for the Internet. He acknowledged the incumbency advantage those suppliers enjoy in the cell phone market, and predicted that Intel's first successes will be in pocket-sized computers and gaming gadgets. By 2009, however, Intel will be ready for a run at the phone market with a chip codenamed Moorestown that combines data processing with video graphics, yet consumes 1/20th the power of today's cellphone processors. \"It's a very different approach from the one that we took in the past,\" said Chandrasekher. \"We're leading with what we do best . . . our process technology and our Intel architecture.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ae4132f700b6031dc122d04c527a38a2","symR":["BSX","CELG","CYTX","GE","GENZ","GERN","KOOL","MRK","OSIR","SCTC","STEM","US3696041033","US5893311077"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) Stem Cells' Powerful Promise -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BSX","CELG","CYTX","GE","GENZ","GERN","KOOL","MRK","OSIR","SCTC","STEM","US3696041033","US5893311077"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","IDD","ITC","MDS","MDV","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  With StemCells' shares trading at about 2.50, one can argue that downside risk is capped. Still, there's little need to rush in, either, since results for its Batten trial aren't expected until late next year. \u001d  In comparison, Baltimore-based Osiris Therapeutics is further along the commercial track. It already has on the market Osteocel, a bone-regeneration treatment that drummed up $8.3 million in revenue last year. But the rising cost of its growing number of clinical tests also pushed its 2006 loss up 125% to $45 million. \u001d  Early results from safety trials for Provacel, its heart-disease treatment, and Prochymal, for treating Crohn's and acute graft-versus-host disease, have been promising. Both use similar stem cells but are branded differently because of a pact with Boston Scientific over the heart treatment. Under the deal, Boston Scientific will market and distribute the Provacel treatment Osiris developed, with revenue split evenly. \u001d  While this opens a crucial door for Osiris to the heart market, its 35-year-old CEO, Charles Randal Mills, tells Barron's he isn't pursuing more of these cost-defraying partnerships. \"We have the financial backing to do it on our own, and the company is more valuable whole,\" he says. \u001d  The size of the market for heart treatment bodes well for Osiris. But much of that potential already may be factored into its stock price. William Tanner, a bullish analyst at the brokerage firm Leerink Swann, reckons Osiris shares are worth 19 to 22 , based on projected 2011 per-share earnings of $1.77, discounted at 35%, and a price-earnings multiple of between 35 and 40. The shares, which jumped above 22 after the late-March announcement of encouraging Provacel heart-disease results, fell below 15 recently. \u001d  If there's a face from stem-cell research that's made for prime time, it's the one belonging to Hans Keirstead. The strikingly telegenic neurobiologist from U.C. (Irvine) -- he rides a Ducati -- has already been tucked into Calvin Klein and shot for Men's Vogue, which hailed him for \"fast approaching a cure for paralysis.\" \u001d  What Keirstead has actually done is harvest stem cells from embryos that can help regenerate neurons damaged in spinal-cord injury. When these are injected into lab rats with damaged spines, the rodents end up walking again after about nine weeks. \u001d  Keirstead is one of the researchers sponsored by Geron, which has invested more than $100 million in stem-cell research since 1995. Based on his research, Geron is applying to the FDA to begin clinical trials later this year on people with spinal-cord injuries -- potentially the first government-approved test using human embryonic stem cells. That would be a key milestone for Geron (which has two other clinical trials for treating cancers). But the market has assigned a generous \"technology value\" of $326 million to its pipeline, obtained by subtracting its $214 million in cash from its market capitalization of $540 million. \"We believe that the market has already priced in pipeline progression,\" says Needham analyst Mark Monane, who expects the stock to trade \"in line with the overall market until further clinical efficacy data\" emerge. \u001d  If small stem-cell stocks can't bloom until the science begins to flower, businesses that support and facilitate stem-cell research might reach fruition sooner. \u001d  An example of enabling technology comes from ThermoGenesis, which makes devices and related disposable items for personalized cell therapy, including one of the more advanced machines for harvesting stem cells from blood and storing them. \u001d  \"Until recently, stem cells were harvested and stored using decades-old technology created for bull-sperm storage, basically vats of liquid nitrogen,\" says Steve Brozak, president of the independent biotech research and brokerage firm WBB Securities. Demand for ThermoGenesis' Auto- Xpress and BioArchive machines, Brozak says, should grow with stem cells' popularity. \u001d  Already, GE has secured the rights to distribute these machines, and some analysts say ThermoGenesis ultimately could be a target for GE or medical-equipment giants like Biomet (BMET). Recent manufacturing glitches haven't helped the company. But the backlog of orders augurs well for future sales -- as does the rising trend among affluent parents who are banking their babies' umbilical-cord blood as some sort of future medical insurance. \u001d  \"Stem-cell therapy represents one of the most under-penetrated market opportunities in health care,\" and ThermoGenesis is \"well positioned to garner share in this market,\" notes Maxim Group analyst Michael Tu, who in March initiated coverage of the stock with a target of 5. Shares were at 3.23 recently. \u001d  Brozak also likes the prospects for Cytori. The company already has pulled off the rare feat of finding a use for fat tissue. It has also developed a \"Celution System\" machine, which extracts stem cells from fat, with at least 18 first-generation machines already in the market. \u001d  \"Because you can get a good dosage from fat tissue and get it quickly -- usually within an hour -- you don't need to go through the process of growing them in a Petri dish\" or sending donor cells for cultivation in a lab, says Cytori President Marc Hedrick. \u001d  Cytori's method of extracting stem cells from fat that are then used to treat the patient was approved in Europe. The company hopes to apply for U.S. approval later this year. Japan's Olympus has invested $44 million in the past two years for the right to make these machines, with manufacturing profits to be split evenly. Cytori expects to book revenue from its next-generation devices in 2008. \u001d  An ill-advised attempt to package stem-cell treatment with liposuction earned Cytori some derision, even though there's some logic in linking the battles against cellulite and disease. Cytori, after all, got its start seven years ago when a biotech exec planning to have her body fat hoovered asked about its storage (she had heard that fat was rich in stem cells). Hedrick, 44, who trained as a reconstructive surgeon, still sees the nexus between liposuction and stem-cell treatment as a potential \"growth area in the future.\" But for now, he says, Cytori is focused on its Celution-based stem-cell treatment. The company, which is burning through $2 million a month, is also beginning clinical trials in Europe to test how stem cells extracted from fat affect heart-disease patients. \u001d  To hear Hedrick tell it, \"you can almost give away the machines\" -- each of which has a cost estimated in low five figures -- since lucrative profit margins will be driven by the sale of consumable accessory products. Inquiries are coming from hospitals and from doctors and plastic surgeons in private practice. \u001d  The Kerners -- Daniel's parents -- suffered two miscarriages some years ago. So Marcus Kerner says he's heartened to learn the source of the stem cells that have helped Daniel -- \"to know that something good has come out of a dead fetus.\" He understands how divisive stem-cell research can be, even when the cells don't come from embryos, but wishes that the regulatory process could be quickened. \"Diseases don't wait for FDA approval,\" he says. \"As parents, we can only hope other kids can get the treatment they need soon enough.\" \u001d  Investors in stem-cell stocks, too, are impatient, and hope doctors can more quickly decipher the mysteries within the cells. The increased funding for stem-cell research should help speed the science. It should also create more investment opportunities in ancillary businesses that support scientific research and generate quantifiable measures of progress, like sales and profits, that Wall Street craves. \u001d  Investing in stem-cell researchers, however, is a far riskier game -- one best guided by hope, not expectations. Medicine does not march to a ticking clock, and miracles take time. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b6b008334b1bf92b27fc270550e33e6d","symR":["BA","KAL.NR","KE0000000307","US0970231058"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"3rd UPDATE:Kenya Airways Jet Carrying 114 Crashes In Cameroon","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T21:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BA","KAL.NR","KE0000000307","US0970231058"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  (Updates with details about search, comment from Boeing spokesman, U.S. National Transportation Safety Board sending team to assist investigation) \b \u001d  LOLODORF, Cameroon (AP)--A Kenya Airways jet with 114 people on board crashed early Saturday after sending out a distress signal over a remote rainforest in southern Cameroon, officials said. Nearby villagers reported hearing a loud boom. \u001d  The jet bound for the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, went down near Lolodorf, a town about 90 miles southeast of the coastal city of Douala, where it had taken off after midnight, said Alex Bayeck, a regional communications officer. \u001d  There was no word on survivors, Bayeck said by telephone en route to the crash site. He said search planes were flying over the forested area where the airliner gave off a distress signal but no wreckage has been spotted. \u001d  Residents in the area, which has few roads and is dotted by small villages, reported hearing a \"large boom\" during the night, Bayeck said, and some people said they saw a flash of fire that looked markedly different from lightning. \u001d  Close to a dozen ambulances stood ready in Lolodorf, and a handful of family members of passengers gathered in the city center. Some said they had traveled as far as 250 miles that day. \u001d  \"It is very difficult because this area is very mountainous and heavily forested. And we suspect the plane may have fallen into a valley,\" said Jean Francois Villong, a local official who is coordinating the rescue effort. \u001d  Search and rescue operations would continue on the ground through the night, but the air search stopped with nightfall because the helicopters couldn't operate effectively in the dark, Villong said. He said helicopters would start again Sunday morning, when more rescue workers, including security forces, were expected. Much of Saturday's searching was done by volunteers from local villages, he said. \u001d  Kenya Airways (KAL.NR) Chief Executive Titus Naikuni held back on confirming the crash \"until we see the plane - until then, it's missing,\" he said. \u001d  He said the distress call was issued automatically - \"from a machine, not a pilot\" - but said a crash isn't the only reason a plane issues an automatic distress signal. \u001d  Boeing Co. (BA) spokesman Jim Proulx said the plane that crashed was equipped with an emergency transmitter that sends out an automatic locator signal \"in the event of a rapid change in velocity.\" \u001d  Proulx told The Associated Press by telephone from Seattle that the transmitter would have been activated upon impact, and can also be manually turned on by the plane's flight crew. \u001d  Naikuni said the plane, which was almost new, took off an hour late because of rain. Douala airport officials confirmed thunderstorms at the time of takeoff, but said that was unlikely to have been the sole cause of the accident. \u001d  \"There was a thunderstorm, but there were other planes that left after (the Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi) that had no problems,\" said Thomas Sobatam, head of weather observation at the airport. \u001d  Kenya's transport minister, Ali Chirau Makwere, said it was too early to determine what happened. \u001d  \"We need to get information from the technical experts as to whether it was occasioned by the weather or pilot error or mechanical fault,\" he said in Nairobi. \"We really don't know. It's too early to make any conclusions.\" \u001d  The Boeing 737-800 was carrying 114 people, including 105 passengers from at least 23 countries, Kenyan airline officials said. A Nairobi-based Associated Press correspondent, Anthony Mitchell, was believed to be among them. Mitchell had been on assignment in the region for the past week. \u001d  \"Anthony...had contacted his family before boarding the flight to let them know he was headed home,\" AP Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll said. \"We hope for the best.\" \u001d  Relatives at Nairobi's airport began wailing as news reports of the crash filtered in. Dozens of family members collapsed in the airport terminal. \u001d  The flight departed Douala at 12:05 a.m. and was to arrive in Nairobi at 6:15 a.m. The flight originated in Ivory Coast but stopped in Cameroon to pick up more passengers, the airline said. \u001d  Kenyan government spokesman Alfred Mutua urged patience. \"The area is in a very dense forest; the weather has been horrid to say the least,\" he said, suggesting that rain was hampering the search. \u001d  That area of Cameroon isn't well-covered by radar, and investigators are having a hard time pinpointing the plane's flight path, Mutua said. \u001d  Infrastructure is poor in Cameroon's interior, with much of the area being searched only accessible by dirt tracks that turn to impassable mud in the rainy season. The country of 17 million on Africa's western coast has oil reserves and lush farmland but many of its citizens remain poor subsistence farmers. \u001d  The Douala-Nairobi flight runs several times a week and commonly is used as an intermediary flight to Europe and the Middle East. Kenya Airways - considered one of the safest airlines in Africa - said most passengers were planning to transfer to ongoing flights in Nairobi. \u001d  The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team to assist the government of Cameroon in its investigation of the crash. \u001d  Proulx said there have not been any safety concerns with Chicago-based Boeing's fleet of 737-800s. About 2,000 737-800s are in use around the world. \u001d  \"We express our profound concern for the passengers and crew on board on the Kenya Airways flight that went missing,\" Proulx said Saturday. \"We stand ready to assist the authorities if they ask us to do so.\" \u001d  The last crash of an international Kenya Airways flight was on Jan. 30, 2000, when Flight 431 was taking off from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, on its way to Nairobi. Investigators blamed a faulty alarm and pilot error for that crash, which killed 169 people. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 17:15 ET (21:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bb7419be6c7b52e93e7202db43bd3eb6","symR":["CKEC","CNK","JRC","MNI","RGC","RYPNX"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) Popcorn, Soda, Shrek III And Old Media","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CKEC","CNK","JRC","MNI","RGC","RYPNX"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB","RCS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Sandra Ward \u001d  Interview with Buzz Zaino \u001d  Manager, Royce Opportunity Fund \b \u001d  When you consider the returns delivered by mutual-fund manager Buzz Zaino, an investment veteran with nearly 40 years of picking winners under his belt, you have to wonder why anyone would invest in a hedge fund. Overseeing the $2.6 billion Royce Opportunity Fund for the past nine years, Zaino has done what he has done for most of his career: focus on finding undervalued small and microcap stocks, often turnarounds, special-situation asset plays and broken IPOs that arepoised for growth. That formula, combined with a special genius all his own, has resulted in returns of 16.2% on average, versus 7.2% for the Russell 2000, since he took the helm in 1998. Year-to-date, the fund is up 7.13%. His custom is to beat the benchmarks by a wide margin and here's the thinking that leads to such performance. \u001d  Barron's: Dow 13,000. Seems hard to believe we got there after the action in February. \u001d  Zaino: It is amazing. What a volatile market! Yet all the earnings have been coming in at very nice levels and people are encouraged. There has been consistency in terms of good managements producing better margins. The world economies have continued to grow, and that helps U.S. companies one way or another. There's pricing power in a lot of areas, and it's producing nice numbers and new products, and that's helping the market. \b \u001d  Q: Does this make you sanguine? \u001d  A: The market always goes through its same cycles: rallies and pullbacks and rallies and pullbacks. So, yes, I am sanguine, but we've reached a higher level, and we are moving into that point of the seasonal cycle where the market tends to pull back. \b \u001d  Q: Sell in May and go away? \u001d  A: That's right. You see it time and again. The next consideration to worry about is higher interest rates. People are focused on lower interest rates, but the strength of the worldwide economies and inflationary pressures are there. The Fed is very inflation-conscious. One of my worries is if the housing market comes back more quickly than is now suggested. Right now, we are seeing the results of the winter selling season, which is very depressed. But we are into the spring selling season, and people are employed and lots of people qualify for mortgages. People who actually want to own homes are out there and they are going to be getting bargains. Lower prices, free granite tops, whatever it takes, will be offered to them. There is a potential the housing market comes back more quickly. \u001d  That's a worry because the rest of the economy is very strong. Look at what is going on in nonresidential construction -- projects in process that just don't stop because of a subprime lending problem or because the Fed raises rates by a quarter percent. They can't be stopped. They are going to be completed. They employ a lot of people. Also, the public sector is very, very strong. The highway transportation bill, which includes about $286 billion or thereabouts in spending, is now starting to have an effect. Aztec Industries, which makes road-building equipment, had a huge backlog at the end of December and again at the end of January and coming into the quarter just reported. Contractors don't buy that equipment unless they have the business in hand. They have the business and they are out there hiring people. They are absorbing a lot of resources: cement, asphalt and steel. If you layer that on a recovery in the housing market in the near term, you may run into very serious inflation pressures. It is still difficult to get cement in places, and that's even with the decline in housing activity. So you see the implications. \b \u001d  Q: This is a completely different song than the chorus we've been hearing on recession and rate cuts. \u001d  A: I see higher interest rates as a better probability than a recession and lower interest rates. There is no problem with jobs. People can go to the bank and show a tax return and buy a house. What's being eliminated is the fraudulent activity. A year ago, people wanted mortgages to speculate on the increase of the price of a house. That's the problem with the statistics coming out on default rates, foreclosures and delinquencies. If you take off the layer of people who were speculating and simply go back to those people who are dedicated homeowners, the experience today is no different than it would have been two or three years ago before the speculators inflated what happened. There will be some problems with the adjustable-rate mortgages and higher reset rates and higher monthly payments, but even then there won't be a major problem, and maybe it's a problem that can be refinanced. If you are employed and have cash flow, they are going to help you out. People will have the opportunity to take money out again, which will allow them to spend money on automobiles or furniture, or something that will stoke the economy. \b \u001d  Q: Any particular areas that represent good opportunity? \u001d  A: Suddenly companies are showing growth above expectations, and so there is a marketplace that is momentum-oriented and that is going to create higher prices on those stocks where visibility is good on earnings and backlogs and that sort of thing. \u001d  Q: We've had a long stretch of outperformance by small-caps and value. What does a small-cap-value investor like yourself do? \u001d  A: It makes me work harder. There are always interesting circumstances. An area currently in vogue, which I find very interesting, is movie-theater chains. Three or four years ago they got into trouble because they grossly overexpanded, borrowed a lot of money and lost money. Some of them went bankrupt, some of them got absorbed. \u001d  The characteristics of this business are terrific cash flow and no inventory. Once you stop spending on new theaters and new screens, there are no capital expenditures. If you have ever gone to a movie theater and spent $4 for a bag of popcorn, you know the gross margins are ridiculous. Cash flows are terrific. Now, the private-equity guys are bringing them public. Cinemark [ticker: CNK] came public in April. Regal Entertainment Group [RGC] is healthy and has absorbed others. Carmike Cinemas [CKEC] has come out of bankruptcy and is a public company. \b \u001d  Q: Why all the excitement? What's changed? \u001d  A: It is easy to bring them public because this summer we've got a slate of movies that have high expectations: Shrek III, Pirates of the Caribbean Part III. These are known winners that should do terrific at the box office, and it's nice, PG-rated fare. Ocean's Thirteen is coming out, and I'm dying to see that. There's good product coming, and there's going to be great earnings. Also, there is a new concept called digital theater that is interesting. Movie theaters are converting to digital projectors from 35-millimeter-film projectors. This gives them new avenues. No. 1 is flexibility in programming. If you have a 12-screen theater and have a movie on DVD disk you can duplicate it and show it on three screens. You can fill up more seats, sell more popcorn. \b \u001d  Q: Are enough people going to theaters for these companies to be successful? \u001d  A: Yes. Box-office receipts are up year-to-date by 7.2%. People like getting out of the house to go to a movie. It is entertainment. That gets to the second feature, the ability of these companies to create new programming to fill seats. Basically a theater makes its money selling soda and popcorn. You want to fill the seats. If you can create additional programming, alternative programming other than the things strictly coming out of the movie studios and add 5% and 10% to your weekly attendance, you are going to have leveraged earnings. There can be concerts or local-interest activities. Carmike has 75% of its theaters converted to digital screens, and they have been testing alternative product, but it is very early. The others, Cinemark, AMC and Regal, are just beginning to convert their theaters to digital, so you are not going to see the results for the next couple of years. But it is a new avenue of growth that we haven't seen before in this particular segment that will only add to already-huge cash flows. \b \u001d  Q: What do you own? \u001d  A: I bought Carmike out of bankruptcy, and that's been decent. \b \u001d  Q: Cinemark? \u001d  A: I participated in the Cinemark IPO. It's a broken IPO. It hasn't done well. The AMC IPO was cancelled as a result. There's too much merchandise being brought to market at one time. I also own Regal. I've got a full boat. Carmike is the fun one because it is already converted to digital theater and we are going to see what happens. \b \u001d  Q: Why own all of them? \u001d  A: There is fairly high confidence that there will be nice incremental box-office receipts this year versus last. That produces high earnings and great comparisons. Whether or not you raise interest rates or housing is strong or not strong, people are going to go to the movies to see these films, buy popcorn and generate a lot of income. The companies will be paying down their debt and improving their balance sheets. Then, there's the alternative programming that will create excitement. \b \u001d  Q: What about their values? \u001d  A: These companies are coming public at roughly eight times Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization]. It is a reasonable valuation, and that's fine, but what is really going to be of interest is the incremental cash flow going forward. There's a speculative element to it. And Regal pays nearly a 6% dividend. Carmike pays a dividend, and Cinemark indicated they would pay almost a 4% dividend. \b \u001d  Q: What else do you like? \u001d  A: Old media. \b \u001d  Q: Ah, somebody likes them. \u001d  A: These are where the theaters were a couple of years ago.

She said she spent $5,398, but couldn't get her jewelry site up and running. \"We never got any support from StoresOnline and the support they promised us earlier was now going to cost us $1,400 more.\" Kevin Olsen, the head of Utah's Consumer Protection division, says that the state has received more than 400 complaints against SOL over the past two years. \u001d  In Illinois, in a suit filed on behalf of 15 customers, Attorney General Lisa Madigan alleges that iMergent representatives \"misled clients in regard to the ease of using their e-commerce Website software and about the availability of technical support.\" The 15 say that iMergent refused to provide refunds after they were unable to set up an online business using its system. \u001d  Imergent CEO Don Danks says such complainers are a very small and atypical minority. In fact, he notes, after seeing a negative report on his company in the online RipOff Report (www.ripoffreport.com), he hired the Website's editor, Ed Magedson, to evaluate his operation. Danks says that the RipOff Report then reversed its opinion, finding that iMergent \"was fulfilling its commitment to provide excellent customer service.\" \u001d  Turns out that RipOffReport.com itself is being sued by Energy Automation Systems, a Hendersonville, Tenn., firm, for allegedly trying to extort money from it to reverse a similar negative report.

Sears \u001d  \"Lookin' good, Billy Ray!\" \u001d  \"Feelin' good, Louis.\" \u001d  Options traders often utter those lines from the movie Trading Places after a good day in the market. But they could also have been said last week by David Krell and Gary Katz -- co-founders of the International Securities Exchange, after they pulled off a stunning trade, selling ISE for a staggering $2.8 billion to Deutsche Boerse on Monday. \u001d  At a time when the ISE's market share appears stalled and there'stalk of an exchange-valuation bubble, Krell and Katz, who each own about 5% of the ISE, negotiated an all-cash offer. Deutsche Boerse's $67.50-a-share bid was 48% above ISE stock's last closing price. (The exchange's ticker is also ISE; the deal may not close until late '07.) The stock ended Friday of the previous week around 46. \u001d  All exchanges hoping for a merger now owe a debt of gratitude to Deutsche Boerse. The ISE deal has lifted, and firmed, exchange-merger valuations. ISE was priced at 18 times earnings at its 2005 initial offering, and was sold at 30 times 2008 earnings. The deal also added urgency to the industry's multiyear-consolidation dance. In fact, the New York Stock Exchange just obtained a $3 billion credit line for \"general corporate purposes\" that some suspect might be used to bid for ISE or another derivatives exchange. \u001d  Indeed, conditions are ripe for what investment bankers glibly call the \"hubris hypothesis,\" in which mergers are done at excessive multiples and are predicated upon overly optimistic analyses, simply because chief executives want to, or feel that they have to, do a deal. \u001d  For traders -- the time for investing in exchange stocks is over -- market conditions pose challenges. The remaining options exchanges, all of which are takeover targets to varying degrees, are privately held. Traders would have to try to buy memberships at the American Stock Exchange, Boston Options Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange or Philadelphia Stock Exchange to profit from future deals. \u001d  The Nasdaq, which in the past stumbled as badly as Deutsche Boerse in pursuing a transformational merger, just weeks ago was rumored to be acquiring the Philadelphia exchange. This deal could re-emerge, provided the multiple on a bid is suitably robust. \u001d  Aside from the thinly traded Exchange Index (ticker: EXQ), the best means of possibly cashing in on the exchange-merger phenomenon may be to buy futures-exchange stocks, particularly those of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Nymex (NMX), in the hope of riding the momentum created by the Deutsche Boerse bid. \u001d  Another play is Interactive Brokers (IBKR), which is expected to sell shares this week in an initial public offering. Founded by one of the architects of the modern options industry, Thomas Peterffy, Interactive Brokers is a major options-market-maker and runs a deep-discount brokerage firm that operates at 60 exchanges around the world. \u001d  Lest there be any doubt about how insiders view sector valuations, remember that Katz and Krell are selling -- and they know more about options exchanges than almost anyone. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: steven.sears@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bfe6db7b58bf5c26c895d23e8f206639","symR":["DRI","US2371941053"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Darden Restaurants Offers Barbecue -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T14:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DRI","US2371941053"],"IndustryCodes":["RES","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b    46.

He said the worker was a subcontractor on the rig that was working for Nigerian oil company ConOil. \u001d  Work was subsequently suspended on the rig, and the 23 people on board were safely taken to shore, the Transocean official said. \u001d  The latest abduction brings to 22 the number of people seized in armed attacks within 36 hours in Nigeria's troubled southern oil region, where militants seeking greater control of the region's wealth and criminals kidnapping for ransom have stepped up attacks in recent days. \u001d  No demands were made by the gunmen who took away the British worker, Cantwell said. \u001d  Nigerian military spokesman Maj. Sagir Musa confirmed there was an \"incident\" on an offshore rig, but declined to give any details. \u001d  Nine of 21 attackers seized in three separate incidents Thursday were freed the same day, while military negotiators have made contact with armed men still holding 11 foreigners also taken the same day in an attack at a power plant. \u001d  Such kidnappings are rife in Africa's largest oil producer, where militants and criminals use them as leverage against the government, or to extract cash. \u001d  The latest kidnapping brings the total number of foreigners kidnapped in the Niger delta to at least 94 so far this year, more than the figure for all of last year. In 2006, more than 80 foreigners were seized in the region. \u001d  Nigeria is Africa's leading oil exporter and the United States' fifth-largest supplier, usually exporting 2.5 million barrels daily. \u001d  Unrest has plagued Nigeria's southern river delta region for years, and in recent months gunmen have stepped up a campaign against the oil industry, blowing up oil pipelines to cut production by a fifth and kidnapping scores of foreign workers.

So his parents were baffled when his speech began to deteriorate. Then his motor skills started to falter until one day, when he was 4, Daniel had to crawl off the school bus that dropped him off at his suburban Southern California home. \u001d  -- Doctors diagnosed the boy with Batten disease, a rare degenerative disorder in which the brain stops producing enzymes needed to clear cellular waste that accumulates and grows toxic. Afflicted children become blind, bedridden and demented; very few live to their teens. \u001d  -- So on Nov. 14, 2006, Daniel became the first volunteer in a risky clinical procedure. Over eight hours at a Portland, Ore., hospital, doctors drilled a hole in his skull and injected his brain with neural stem cells collected and purified by a small biotechnology company called StemCells. Doctors hoped these cells would grow into healthy, enzyme-producing tissue. \u001d  -- It's too soon to call the surgery a success. But within a month, Daniel's parents noticed he made more eye contact. Then Daniel said \"Dad\" for the first time in two years. \u001d  -- \"He was just a kid waiting to die, and he was given a gift of life,\" says his father, Marcus Kerner, an assistant U.S. attorney and lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserve. Today, \"Daniel is getting stronger steadily and very excited when he tries to talk.\" For his seventh birthday earlier this year, and with help from an instructor and special equipment, Daniel went skiing at Mammoth Mountain, a resort in the eastern part of his home state. \u001d  Minor miracles like Daniel's are why stem cells inspire so much hope -- and hype. Both will intensify this year as money pours in from states and private donors, as the political climate becomes more supportive and as small biotech companies -- many of them long on promise yet short on profit -- seek to capitalize on this wave of optimism. Investors would be well advised to pay close attention, particularly to companies whose products support the research effort, but to proceed carefully -- and with patience -- as the science develops. \u001d  Already, some companies are lining up clinical trials this year to test how stem cells -- primal cells that can grow quickly into different tissues -- will affect patients suffering from cancer, heart disease and spinal-cord injury. But the scope extends beyond life-threatening ailments; the San Diego company Cytori Therapeutics (ticker: CYTX), for example, is testing 19 patients in Japan to see how stem cells extracted from fat can reconstruct breast tissue after mastectomies. \u001d  \"We don't even know what the potential scope or limits are,\" says Arnold Kriegstein, director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of California (San Francisco) and a founding director of Columbia University's Neural Stem Cell Center. \"But we're at a transformative moment, and stem cells could change what we know of medicine.\" \u001d  So what gives stem cells their biological potency? While the human body has many types of cells -- bone, blood, nerve and muscle, among others -- stem cells are versatile primary units that can divide, differentiate and grow into other specialized cells. These include adult stem cells, found in bone marrow, blood or other body parts, as well as embryonic stem cells, which come from human embryos and, as such, carry more ethical baggage. \u001d  Human embryonic stem cells were first extracted in 1998 (by researchers at the University of Wisconsin), so the science is still young. Embryonic stem cells -- culled, for example, from unused embryos at in vitro fertilization clinics -- are controversial, since their extraction destroys the embryo. But scientists also believe they hold greater potential for self renewal and can grow into more complex organs. \u001d  It is a measure of how much is unknown that scientists differ widely when asked the time it would take to develop a marketable human embryonic stem-cell treatment, with answers ranging from three to 30 years. Among the obstacles: transplanted embryonic stem cells in animal experiments that sprouted unwanted hair, teeth and tumors -- a sign that scientists haven't fully figured out how to coax them to grow only into specific cells. \u001d  In comparison, more limited therapies using adult stem cells are expected to reach the market sooner. In fact, some of these have already produced encouraging signs in early human trials designed to verify the treatments' safety, although not yet their effectiveness. \u001d  Researchers from Osiris Therapeutics (OSIR) recently injected bone-marrow-derived stem cells intravenously into 53 patients who had suffered heart attacks. Compared with those given a placebo, treated patients were four times less likely to suffer irregular heartbeats, and the \"ejection fraction\" -- a measure of the amount of blood a heart efficiently pumps -- improved. No one died. Next up: efficacy trials that involve hundreds or possibly thousands of patients. \u001d  In a separate, independent test in Brazil, 13 of 15 Type 1 diabetes patients who were treated with stem cells from their own blood were able to stop using insulin to maintain normal blood-sugar levels. \u001d  If Wall Street believes in following the money, much of its own private cash has gone to stem cells lately. And private-equity money could well follow as the science gathers momentum. \"There's a whole developing field of socially responsible investing, and I think it hasn't yet looked at critically necessary medicine,\" says Robert Klein, the real-estate developer who was the driving force behind California's decision to fund stem-cell research. Within three years, more money should come from venture-capital investors, pensions with a social mandate, and the growing pool of socially responsible funds, Klein says. \u001d  Stem cells have already drawn the attention of large corporations. Genzyme's (GENZ) stance, for one, is fairly typical of big biotech's. The Cambridge, Mass., company is no stranger to cell-based treatment and therapy, having explored the field for more than a decade. \"Cell and gene therapy in the last 20 years has tended to over-promise and under-deliver,\" says John McPherson, head of its biologic research. Still, Genzyme says it continues to study the field, and this includes watching for small promising companies to buy. \u001d  Others are moving in selectively, a sign they see future commercial potential. Merck (MRK) has provided funding in exchange for shares -- with warrants to buy more -- in Geron (GERN), a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech company that works with embryonic stem cells. Boston Scientific (BSX), which makes the nation's top-selling drug-coated heart stent, has a joint venture with Osiris to develop its stem-cell treatment for heart disease. \u001d  At the same time, symbiotic deals have sprouted between small stem-cell companies with emerging technology and large device makers with manufacturing muscle. General Electric's (GE) health-care unit has acquired exclusive global rights to distribute a device from ThermoGenesis (KOOL) that extracts and stores stem cells, while Japanese camera and equipment maker Olympus (7733.Japan) has a deal with Cytori to manufacture a machine Cytori designed to harvest stem cells from fat tissues. \u001d  This surge of interest from deeper-pocketed players is not lost on the small biotech companies struggling to turn their developing science into commercial payoffs. In fact, most companies are desperate to milk any goodwill -- one reason why investing in stem-cell companies can be treacherous. \u001d  For a start, most stem-cell companies have only a thin pipeline of one or two products -- usually based on hard-to-handicap science. Few are profitable. Almost all are burning through wads of cash and only too willing to use any means within reach to raise money needed to stay afloat. Advanced Cell Technology (ACTC) never seems to have taken a step too small to trumpet in a press release. (Recent example: The company's ability to rescue vision in blind rats was noted in Scientific American's March issue.) \u001d  Also, a major breakthrough, when it does arrive, might not come from a company whose shares currently trade. \u001d  No question, the payoff for picking right can be big. The $23 billion drug-discovery company Celgene (CELG) was once a small-cap stock before the Food and Drug Administration approved its Thalomid drug. As a result, speculation in stem-cell stocks is rife. Anticipation of imminent breakthroughs sent Geron shares above 75 in 2000; today they trade around 7. Few of these stocks attract the kind of long-term institutional investors that lend a stabilizing influence, and most jump and slide on mere mentions or rebuttals in medical journals, which makes them susceptible to academia's ego-driven swipes and snipes. \u001d  So where should an investor interested in a relatively pure stem-cell play begin? \u001d  From the outside, the squat, nondescript building that houses StemCells  in Palo Alto, Calif., looks just like a college lab. A trickling brook out front strives for a bucolic touch. There was no receptionist on a recent afternoon when a reporter came calling; the CFO himself answered the door. \u001d  The company with the industry's most coveted ticker symbol -- STEM -- is run like a lab; three-quarters of its 46 employees are in research. Its current Phase 1 trial for Batten disease ultimately will involve six patients, and was the first FDA-approved test using human neural stem cells (extracted, in this case, from aborted fetuses). So far, both Daniel Kerner and a second child who was treated are doing fine. \u001d  But because Batten disease affects just one in about 250,000, the treatment has no blockbuster potential -- one reason the shares have been dormant. CFO Rodney Young stresses, however, that the effort has \"substantial impact\" on the study of degenerative neural disorders. StemCells is also planning a clinical trial this year for liver disease. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"dd49f0f42238ab270ca2242d53b603ba","symR":["DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","AU000000NWS2"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) The Trader: Even The Bulls Aren't So Bullish","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","AU000000NWS2"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","PUB","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Kopin Tan \u001d  There are many ways to mark a milestone -- with champagne, a lavish party, a tattoo. A week after the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 13,000, the Standard & Poor's 500 enjoyed its own big-round-number moment when it trudged above 1500, but its arrival was met with doubt. \u001d  The lack of jubilation was understandable. Consumer spending had increased 3.8% in the first quarter -- thank you, bonuses! -- but gas-pump prices topping $3 a gallon could make that harder to replicate this quarter. Friday's government report showing the jobless rate rising in April to 4.5%, and wary employers adding the fewest jobs in two- and-a-half years, also didn't help. \u001d  Money managers have recently been buying every dip, mindful of the market's abundant liquidity and anxious not to fall behind the robust rally that began mid-March. But stocks' advances grew tentative last week, and the question asked up and down Wall Street was whether stocks had run up too far too fast. Even a rash of mergers -- both real and speculated- that egged on buyers began to raise a nagging question: What happens if the merger mania cools? \u001d  Climbing for the fifth straight week, the Dow added 144, or 1.1%, to 13,265. It has risen in 23 of the past 26 days -- the longest such streak since 1944. The S&P 500 also rallied for a fifth straight week, and for the sixth time in seven weeks, adding 12, or 0.8%, to 1506. It stands just 1.4% from its March 2000 peak. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 15, or 0.6%, to a new six-year peak at 2572, while the Russell 2000 Index of small stocks snuck up 3, or 0.4%, to 833. \u001d  The Dow's recent outperformance certainly bears watching. \"Blue chips tend to show relative strength late in sustained declines and late in sustained advances,\" notes Miller Tabak's chief technical analyst, Philip Roth. In a slipping market, investors return by nibbling at big, safe stocks, and large-cap outperformance can signal an impending upturn. \u001d  But after a long rise, still-confident investors who grow wary of high prices start taking profits in their broader portfolio and funnel those toward blue chips. \"The longer the broader averages make little progress in an environment of blue-chip strength, the more likely a top is forming,\" Roth says. \u001d  To Barry Ritholtz, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Research & Analytics, the juxtaposition of rising stocks and a cooling economy makes this \"a trading market, where momentum and trend dominate, increasingly detached from decaying domestic fundamentals.\" A melt-up to Dow 14,000 would not surprise, Ritholtz says, but that represents a risky \"trading, not investing, opportunity.\" \u001d  Whether the rally is slowing -- or, as the bulls prefer, consolidating -- remains to be seen. For days, the benchmarks have made new highs on dwindling volume and waning leadership. Yet, sentiment is far from excessively bullish. In fact, short interest that is nearly 18% above a three-year average suggests there are skeptics, and money on the sidelines, that might still be converted. \u001d  Mark Boyar has lobbied for years for a sale of Dow Jones (DJ). But last week, as Dow Jones' stock jumped from 36 to 56 after a stunning $5 billion bid from News Corp. (NWS), the president of Boyar Asset Management promptly sold half of the nearly 300,000 shares he held. \u001d  Not that Boyar doesn't believe the odds are good that Rupert Murdoch, who controls News Corp., will wrest the publisher of Barron's and the Wall Street Journal from the Bancroft family, a sprawling clan that owns 25% of Dow Jones' shares but controls 64% of the voting rights. But with the stock up 56% to a five-year peak, the downside risks cannot be ignored. \u001d  Already, family members with 52% of the voting power had indicated that they opposed Murdoch's $60-a-share offer, which carried a staggering 65% premium rich enough to give rival suitors pause. If no better bid emerges, and if the Bancrofts can fend off Murdoch, the stock easily could fall back below 40. \"And if it does, I'll buy back my position,\" Boyar says. \u001d  Right now, the market seems to regard a return trip to 40 as a possible but unlikely event. Shares held steady near 56 even after the Bancrofts said \"no\" -- a sign traders don't see the rebuff as final. Breathless media coverage has already flagged the likelihood of a sweetened bid from Murdoch, and the arrival of possible \"white knights.\" \u001d  Forty-two million Dow Jones shares changed hands Tuesday -- the stock's busiest day in three decades -- and the crushing volume since then suggests shares increasingly are held by arbitrageurs angling for a deal. Pressure could mount on the independent board members to put the offer to a shareholder vote. In the days ahead, expect stories about the Bancrofts' fragile voting majority, the rift between older family members drinking from the dividend trough and younger heirs more eager to sell, and the waning allegiance to family businesses with the passing of generations. \u001d  An eventual sale of Dow Jones isn't considered a lock either. With shares at 56, Dow Jones' September 40 put options -- which ensure the right to sell shares at 40 over the next five months -- were priced at about $1.55, while September 35 puts were trading at $0.70. \"These out-of-the-money puts would be almost worthless if the market believed a deal is a sure thing,\" says Citigroup derivatives strategist Andrew Wolchek. \u001d  In fact, option prices pegs the likelihood of a thwarted bid -- and the stock retreating below 40 -- to be between 25% and 30%, Wolchek estimates. The option market also sees a 20%-25% chance for a bid higher than 60. Meanwhile, June options are projecting an annualized volatility of 72%, compared with 49% projected by September options. That's a sign the market anticipates more noise and maneuvering over the next six weeks, before the uncertainty recedes by the fall. \u001d  For a man who hates to fly, Thomas Peterffy has amassed a geographically expansive empire -- an automated brokerage and market-making firm that trades 357,000 securities at more than 60 exchanges in 23 countries. Last week, the owner and founding CEO of Interactive Brokers Group tested public appetite for his company and was greeted with clamor. \u001d  IBG priced 40 million shares through an online auction at $30.01 a piece- near the top end of its recently-raised range between 27 and 31, and after IBG doubled the allotted shares in recent months. Shares (IBKR) debuted Friday at 33, and ended the session at 31.30. The deal valued the firm at $1.2 billion. \u001d  About $1 billion of the proceeds will go to Peterffy, an impeccably dressed and impossibly trim 62 year-old Hungarian immigrant. And he swelled his bank balance without relinquishing his stranglehold on the firm he founded 25 years ago, which he controls with 91.3% of voting rights post-IPO. \u001d  IBG has two main businesses: Timber Hill, a market-making firm that handles nearly one in every five listed option traded in the U.S. and one in every six globally; and Interactive Brokers, a low-cost electronic brokerage popular with active traders. \u001d  Net revenue grew 65% in 2005 and 35% last year, and the company keeps costs low with savvy use of automation. No surprise, then, to see shares accorded a plump valuation. At 31, IBG shares trade at a staggering 4.4 times tangible book value, or 26 times 2006 earnings of $1.21 per-share. That presupposes derivatives volume will keep growing at a galloping pace of more than 20% a year, and that Peterffy will continue to stay two nimble steps ahead of the crowd. \u001d  --- \b                     VITAL SIGNS \b \b                             Friday's     Week's  Week's \b                                Close     Change  % Chg. \b \b DJ Industrials              13264.62   +143.68      +1.10 \b DJ Transportation            5171.09    +48.70      +0.95 \b DJ Utilities                  526.24     +1.86      +0.35 \b DJ 65 Stocks                 4547.19    +40.04      +0.89 \b DJ US Total Mkt               366.41     +2.72      +0.75 \b NYSE Comp.                   9793.00    +87.64      +0.90 \b Amex Comp.                   2243.17    +38.18      +1.73 \b S&P 500                      1505.62    +11.55      +0.77 \b S&P MidCap                    892.30     +5.87      +0.66 \b S&P SmallCap                  431.72     +3.47      +0.81 \b Nasdaq                       2572.15    +14.94      +0.58 \b Value Line (arith.)          2417.79    +10.93      +0.45 \b Russell 2000                  832.87     +3.17      +0.38 \b DJ Wilshire 5000            15194.08   +101.33      +0.67 \b \b                                     Last Week  Week Ago \b \b NYSE \b Advances                              2,167      1,909 \b Declines                              1,350      1,596 \b Unchanged                                75         74 \b New Highs                               690        759 \b New Lows                                 54         44 \b Av Daily Vol (mil)                    3,085.0    2,995.1 \b Dollar \b (Finex spot index)                       81.74      81.53 \b T-Bond \b (CBT nearby futures)                    111-27     110-29 \b Crude Oil \b (NYM light sweet crude)                  61.93      66.46 \b Inflation KR-CRB \b (Futures Price Index)                   311.24     314.20 \b Gold \b (CMX nearby futures)                    687.20     678.70 \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"dee6a174c7acc3515f198c0d0c89df87","symR":["CCO","CCU"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) Follow-Up: Offer Sweetened, Yet Deal Seems Doomed","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CCO","CCU"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","BRD","MED","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By andrew Bary \u001d  The $26 billion leveraged buyout of Clear Channel Communications is hanging by a very thin thread ahead of Tuesday's shareholder vote. \u001d  In a last-ditch effort to save the high-profile deal, a private-equity group led by Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital Partners last week lifted its offer to the company's public shareholders to $39.20 a share from $39 and said it would let them participate in the LBO. Late Thursday, Clear Channel's board rejected that proposalasstill too low. The company said proxies received so far show that more than one-third of holders are voting no, dooming the deal because it needs a two-thirds majority of outstanding shares. \u001d  Many shareholders believe that a public Clear Channel (ticker: CCU) is worth more than $42 a share, owing in part to the rising value of the company's billboard business, traded publicly as Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO). Clear Channel also has become a rallying point for institutional holders angry that private-equity firms have reaped big profits at their expense in prior LBOs. Two big shareholders, Fidelity Investment and Highfields Capital Management, which own a combined 15% of the stock, have opposed the deal. \u001d  It's conceivable that Clear Channel's board will reconsider its opposition to the new proposal if a sufficient number of large shareholders express support by Tuesday. The private-equity firms had planned to put $4 billion of equity into the deal. But after discussions with some dissidents, they decided to give about $1.2 billion, or 30%, to the public. This new equity wouldn't be subject to any fees from the private-equity group, actually making it a superior investment to the buyout firm's equity, according to a knowledgeable person. \u001d  The proposed equity available to public holders, however, is well short of Clear channel's current $18 billion equity value, meaning that any shareholder seeking to participate in that new proposal likely would get much more cash than stock. The new proposal would have offered the founding Mays family less -- $37.60 a share -- than the public holders' $39.20. \u001d  The betting on the Street is that the deal, originally announced in November, is dead and that Clear Channel's board, which appears tired of the long, acrimonious dispute over the buyout, will be content to run out the clock Tuesday. \u001d  Clear Channel shares moved up 40 cents, to $36.35, Friday, still well shy of the new bid by the buyout group. If investors and arbitragers had viewed board reconsideration of the new proposal likely, the shares probably would be above $37. \u001d  If the deal dies, there will be pressure on Clear Channel's management, led by CEO Mark Mays and President Randall Mays, to deliver for shareholders. Under a \"Plan B\", Bear Stearns analyst Victor Miller has written that Clear Channel could sell its international billboard business and then spin off the valuable domestic outdoor business to Clear Channel holders. Clear Channel's stake in Clear Channel Outdoor is worth about $18 per Clear Channel share. Miller values Clear Channel at $44 a share, before any steps to buy back stock by taking on added debt. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e5ab5819eb8fa4f09e54edbc3110d4f7","symR":["ACW","HPT","HRS","IPCC","JLL","LDR","OMTR","RATE","RDC","SOLD","WBMD","YUM","US9884981013"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(5/7) Research Reports: How Analysts Size Up Companies","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACW","HPT","HRS","IPCC","JLL","LDR","OMTR","RATE","RDC","SOLD","WBMD","YUM","US9884981013"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","DRL","IAS","INP","INS","ITC","MED","OIE","PUB","REA","RED","REI","RES","SOF","TRQ","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   Edited By Anita Peltonen \u001d  The research reports excerpted here were issued recently by investment firms.

Q107 included only $1.1 million of favorable-reserve development (3 cents per share) versus $19 million of favorable development in Q106 (59 cents per share). Gross written premium was up 17.2% for the quarter, with growth in California, Arizona and Texas important contributors. The California growth of 22.5% was favorably influenced by electronic enforcement of mandatory insurance coverage. The Q107 GWP advance was slightly better than Q406 and represents the strongest quarter since Infinity went public in early 2003. We note that management's execution of the business plan it presented to investors at that time has been nearly flawless. Book value rose to $34.87 per share and the company purchased about 188,000 shares during the quarter under its $100 million repurchase program. Management guidance was raised moderately to $3.35-$3.75 per share for 2007.

Our '08 EPS estimate is lifted from $6.10 to $6.50 . . .

The company provides radiation dosimetry services to hospitals, universities, nuclear power plants, and many small offices in the U.S. and in foreign markets. Lower-than-expected spending resulted in second fiscal quarter earnings well above our estimate. \u001d  Earnings for the quarter were 65 cents a share, up 5% from 62 cents per share last year, excluding nonrecurring items . . . Revenue for the quarter rose 5% to $21.6 million from $20.6 million last year. Sales were in line with expectations. . . . We now look for flat earnings in fiscal 2007. The expected level of spending on new information systems and increased revenue will apparently be less than first thought. Consequently, we have raised our fiscal 2007 EPS estimate by 10 cents, to $2.20, even with $2.20 in fiscal 2006, excluding restructuring charges and costs for management transition. We've changed rating to Long-term Buy from Buy. Despite modest growth prospects, Landauer has typically traded at a premium valuation. We feel this is due to its high margins, reliable revenue, and attractive yield. Our 60 target assumes resuming growth in '08 and sustaining current valuation as earnings exceed $2.50 in two to three years. \b \u001d  Omniture \u001d  -- OMTR-NNM \b \u001d  Sector Perform \u001d  -- Price 18.29 on May 1 \u001d  by Pacific Crest \b \u001d  Omniture is a leading provider of on-demand Web analytics and digital marketing solutions. Q1 results [were] ahead of expectations. Omniture reported non-GAAP revenue and EPS of $29.5 million and 2 cents, compared with our consensus estimates of $27.9 million and (a loss of 1 cent). The upside was driven by continued robust demand for Web analytics and strength in Omniture's products, as well as international acquisitions closed in the quarter and a large deal with AOL. Growth remains strong, but investments cloud earnings outlook. We expect Omniture's above-average growth to continue because of its heavy investing in sales personnel, marketing, research and development, international expansion and technology platform. However, these investments will limit leverage in the model in 2007 and lower visibility on longer-term growth in EPS and free cash flow, in our view. \b \u001d  Rowan Cos. \u001d  -- RDC-NYSE \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 36.65 on May 2 \u001d  by Sterne Agee \b \u001d  [Houston-based offshore driller] Rowan Cos. reported operating 1Q07 EPS of 70 cents, versus 53 cents in 1Q06.

Special items included 14 cents per share on an asset-sale gain, offset by a loss of 7 cents per share on new construction of the Panueo, a rig built for Perforadora Central, a Mexican rig owner.

However, we continue to believe that current valuation, although now more attractive (the stock has declined about11% over past two to three weeks), reflects the company's near-term growth potential. Our new fair-value estimate for WBMD is 46 and our 12-month price target is 53. \b \u001d  Yum!

(Dow Jones)--Inspiring cheers from among a crowd of 27,000 shareholders, billionaire Warren Buffett Saturday defended his charitable contribution to organizations that support women's reproductive rights, such as Planned Parenthood. \u001d  Buffett was responding to a question from a shareholder from St. James, N.Y., during the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Lazo \u001d  Pepsico is pepping up its payout for the 35th year in a row. The beverage and snack-food giant sweetened its quarterly common dividend 25% Wednesday, to 37.5 cents a share from 30 cents. Disbursement is slated for June 29 to stockholders of record June 8. The ex-dividend date is June 6. \u001d  The action, which was a result of PepsiCo's increasing its dividend payout target to 50% of the prior year's earnings, gives the shares a 2.23% yield. Dividends have been ongoing since 1952. \u001d  The Purchase, N.Y.-based company, whose corporate roots reach back to 1916, also enriched its stock-buyback program by $8 billion through mid-2010. That'll kick in when Pepsi wraps up its $8.5-billion plan begun in 2006, which has $6 billion left to go. It expects to repurchase $4.3 billion worth of its stock in 2007. \u001d  Chief executive Indra K. Nooyi said the announcements \"reflect our continued confidence in the growth of our business and our steadfast commitment to providing strong cash returns to our shareholders.\" She said Pepsi has a \"rich acquisition pipeline\" and that deals could range from $5 million to $2 billion. \u001d  The stock (ticker: PEP) set a 52-week high of 67.72 on the Big Board Thursday. Archrival Coca-Cola (KO), a Dow industrials component, set a 52-week high Friday of 53.32, raised its quarterly three cents in February to 34 cents a share-its 45th annual hike -and yields 2.56%. Coke expects to repurchase as much as $3 billion of its stock this year.

Chief among them, besides its carbonated offerings, are Frito-Lay snacks, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices, Quaker foods and Aquafina water. Pepsi's first-quarter results exceeded Wall Street's estimates, with profits climbing 16% from a year earlier, to $1.1 billion, or 65 cents a share, on a 9% revenue gain, to $7.35 billion. \u001d  The nation's No. 1 source of home mortgages, Fannie Mae (FNM), publicly owned but operating under federal charter, finances more than one in five U.S.home loans. Back in January 2005, it halved its dividend to 26 cents a share to help rebuild capital depleted by losses on derivatives contracts used to hedge interest-rate risk. In December 2006, its dividend  started climbing with an increase in payout of 54%, to 40 cents a share. \u001d  Last Wednesday the quarterly was enriched again, by 25%, to 50 cents a share. The respective payment and record dates are May 25 and May 18, and the stock goes ex-dividend May 16. Yield: 2.60%. Fannie Mae has paid dividends since 1956. The home-mortgage lender's shares trade on the Big Board close to their 52-week high of 62.37, set Nov. 8. \u001d  Also last week, federal regulators said they will distribute roughly $400 million by October to Fannie Mae stockholders hurt by the company's alleged accounting fraud. Investors may be eligible if they bought Fannie Mae common between Jan. 14, 1999, and Dec. 22, 2004, or Class N preferred stock from Sept. 25, 2003, to Dec. 22, 2004. Fannie Mae just reported 2005 net of $6.3 billion, or $6.01 a share, versus 2004's $5 billion, or $4.94. It expects to post 2006 results later this year. \u001d  When Felix Zulauf, one of Barron's Roundtable luminaries, again listed Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (POT) among his picks in mid-January, the stock was around 144. It set a 52-week high of 193.79 April 26 and is now around 187. Wednesday Potash declared a 3-for-1 stock split and doubled its quarterly common dividend to a pre-split 30 cents a share (10 cents post-split), its first hike since July 2004. Potash's share price has surged 280% on the Big Board since its previous split, in August 2004. \u001d  The world's largest fertilizer company, Potash -- which Barron's wrote about on Nov. 6, 2006 -- earned a record $198 million, or $1.85 a share, in the first quarter of 2007, on a 34% jump in sales, to $1.15 billion. Fertilizer demand is strong worldwide, and supplies are tight. Thus, Potash has boosted its 2007 earnings estimate to $7.50-$8.50 a share from an earlier $6.25 to $7.25. It earned $5.95 in 2006. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e86980f0761e896d86dffba17d738503","symR":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BAC","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109","US0605051046"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: WSJ: RBS Consortium Makes Bid For LaSalle - Sources","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T20:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BAC","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109","US0605051046"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XAEX","XB20","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XIBEX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Updates with details) \b \b   By Carrick Mollenkamp and Jason Singer \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  The European banking consortium seeking to make a bid for Dutch bank ABN Amro Holding NV (ABN) Saturday afternoon made a conditional $24.5 billion bid for ABN's LaSalle Bank unit, after scrambling in the past 24 hours to finalize a memo outlining the proposal, according to people familiar with the situation. \u001d  The consortium, led by Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN) and chief executive Fred Goodwin, made the bid ahead of a Sunday deadline. The offer is higher than Bank of America Corp.'s (BAC) offer of $21 billion. But it also includes some conditions. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  The RBS team considers the conditions to be allowable under ABN's contract with Bank of America over the LaSalle sale. But as it stands, ABN may not judge the new LaSalle bid to be superior to Bank of America's. \u001d  The LaSalle bid isn't subject to financing and the group already has the cash in hand for that purchase, people close to the matter said. But among the conditions attached to that bid is that the consortium gets an agreement over a full takeover bid for all of ABN. \u001d  The proposal submitted to ABN today lacked full details on the consortium's financing arrangements for the full bid, people close to the matter said. However, the financing will be settled by the Sunday deadline, other people involved in the situation said, highlighting that the three banks' boards of directors have already approved the arrangements and the final documents are just waiting for a takeover agreement with ABN before they are signed. \u001d  The RBS-led group has said its bid for ABN would be 70% cash and 30% in RBS shares. But the other two consortium banks - Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano SA (STD) and Dutch-Belgian concern Fortis NV (FORSY) - aren't expected to begin fundraising until the fourth quarter, the people close to the matter said. That could raise questions for ABN shareholders whether financing is secure. \u001d  Additionally, the proposal for LaSalle is conditional on ABN settling the various lawsuits brought against it as a result of its contract to sell LaSalle to Bank of America. \u001d  But on Friday, Bank of America filed a lawsuit against ABN seeking to enforce its agreement to buy LaSalle. That deal stemmed from ABN's earlier agreement to be bought by the U.K.'s Barclays PLC (BCS) for $89.9 billion in stock, which is contingent on LaSalle being sold. \u001d  The RBS consortium's offer is the first stage of a weekend-long series of discussions. ABN officials said they are trying to be flexible in working with the RBS consortium. Morale between ABN and the European banking group trying to top the Dutch bank's agreed deal to be acquired by Barclays has dramatically improved, people from both camps say. \u001d  ABN and the RBS consortium had been engaged in \"collaborative\" talks, with several working groups toiling around the clock to assist the Royal Bank team in coming up with a firm rival bid valued at about EUR39 a share, or EUR72.27 billion ($98 billion), people familiar with the situation said. \u001d  Either bid for ABN would mark the world's largest banking deal, and one of the most complex. The Royal Bank proposal includes carving up ABN's various businesses around the world between it and its two partners, Fortis and Banco Santander Central Hispano. A breakup of a bank on this scale has never been tried before. \b \u001d  -By Carrick Mollenkamp and Jason Singer, The Wall Street Journal; Carrick.Mollenkamp@wsj.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 16:16 ET (20:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e8d8b1b7357c3230d3de2c90607fad98","symR":["KAL.NR","KE0000000307"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"State Radio Reports Kenya Airways Plane Crashed In S Cameroon","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T08:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KAL.NR","KE0000000307"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 05, 2007 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"eecf79257351f6dcf91a02ed9d56cb9d","symR":["9501.TO","9503.TO","9504.TO","9505.TO","9506.TO","9507.TO","9509.TO","9511.TO","JP3194700005","JP3228600007","JP3350800003","JP3522200009","JP3585800000","JP3605400005","JP3845400005","JP3850200001"],"date":"2007-05-05","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Japan Elec Utilities To Open 8 LNG Pwr Plants By 2012 -Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-05T18:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["9501.TO","9503.TO","9504.TO","9505.TO","9506.TO","9507.TO","9509.TO","9511.TO","JP3194700005","JP3228600007","JP3350800003","JP3522200009","JP3585800000","JP3605400005","JP3845400005","JP3850200001"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","X225","XATI","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Electric power companies around the country are constructing and upgrading power stations fueled by liquefied natural gas, The Nikkei reported in its Sunday edition. \u001d  With eight LNG facilities scheduled to be built over the next five years, the ratio of LNG-produced power to all thermal power generation will jump to 47% from the current 43%, slashing carbon dioxide emissions by almost 10%. \u001d  Thermal power plants account for nearly 30% of all emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in Japan.  The electric utility industry has set a target of slashing CO2 emissions per kilowatt of power generation by 20% from the fiscal 1990 level by fiscal 2010. \u001d  Because LNG contains less carbon than other types of energy, increasing the ratio of LNG power generation is an effective way to reduce CO2 emissions.  LNG stations emit 40%-50% less CO2 per unit of generated power than coal-burning plants and 20%-30% less than oil-fired facilities. \u001d  Shikoku Electric Power Co. (9507.TO) plans to start building its first LNG power plant, in Kagawa Prefecture in October, by converting an oil-powered station located there, aiming to have the facility go online in August 2010.  The conversion will lift the output capacity of the plant by 50%.  The company intends to begin converting another oil plant into an LNG power station in fiscal 2009. \u001d  Okinawa Electric Power Co. (9511.TO), which currently has no LNG power plants, intends to begin construction of two facilities in June, targeting the start of operations between 2010 and 2011. The only utility among the nation's 10 electric power companies without a nuclear plant depends on coal and oil to generate almost all its power.  After the new LNG plants go onstream, the ratio of coal and oil generation will fall to two-thirds. \u001d  In five years, Hokkaido Electric Power Co. (9509.TO) and Hokuriku Electric Power Co. (9505.TO) will be the only domestic utilities without LNG power plants. \u001d  Other firms are expanding their LNG power generation, with Chugoku Electric Power Co.
