Under German regulations a company must make an offer for the remaining shares of a company after acquiring a 30% stake. \u001d  However, spokesman Christian Dau said Porsche didn't expect many shareholders to tender into the offer and it wasn't \"seeking a majority takeover of Volkswagen.\" Another spokesman said Porsche would simply sell any shares that were tendered. \u001d  Porsche has deliberately set the tender offer very low. In its statement, it said it expects to pay EUR100.92 per Volkswagen share under its offer, the minimum price prescribed by German law. It said it doesn't want to pay a premium to that price because Volkswagen's ordinary shares have already risen 100% since Porsche first acquired a stake in Volkswagen in September 2005. Volkswagen shares closed at EUR117.70 Friday. \u001d  However, in light of the likely repeal of a law that currently protects Volkswagen from a takeover, the move would help block any potential full takeover because Porsche and the German state of Lower Saxony, which holds 20% of Europe's biggest car maker, will between them hold 51% of the company. The state of Lower Saxony welcomed Porsche's move. \u001d  Last month, a legal advisor to the European Union's highest court announced that a German law intended to preserve the state's influence at Volkswagen violates E.U. regulations on the free movement of capital. The so-called VW law limits any shareholder's voting rights in the car manufacturer to 20%, regardless of the number of shares held. \u001d  Porsche confirmed it was making the move because the VW law is likely to be invalidated. \u001d  Dau didn't rule out further stake increases in the future. \"We're keeping all our options open,\" he said. \u001d  The move was also welcomed by Volkswagen. \"A stable shareholder structure is very important fo the long-term automobiles business,\" Volkswagen's Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said in Wolfsburg. \u001d  He added that Porsche's move to raise its Volkswagen stake was targeted at securing the existing cooperation agreement. \"The VW group and its eight brands still have high potential. I'm sure that Porsche like any other investor is making an good investment in the VW share,\" Winterkorn added. \u001d  In a statement following an extraordinary general meeting, Stuttgart-based Porsche said its supervisory board had authorized the company's management to make the stake increase and launch the bid in the \"short term.\" \u001d  Dau said Porsche would raise its Volkswagen stake Monday. He added that Porsche doesn't plan to make a capital increase to fund its buying. \u001d  Porsche also said it will also create a holding company, which will be a European stock corporation, or Societas Europaea (SE), so that it can split its Porsche operational business from its Volkswagen holding.   Although investors have long speculated about the potential for a full takeover of Volkswagen by Porsche, the sportscar maker had in recent months denied any intention of launching such a bid, and its announcement Saturday caused an initial stir in industry circles. \u001d  \"It's really a surprise,\" said Georg Sturzer, an auto-industry analyst with HVB Corporates & Markets Research in Munich. \"I thought they had enough influence to put through their ideas and targets.\" \u001d  Sturzer said a full acquisition of Volkswagen by Porsche could help the Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker in its goal of one day matching the efficiency and profitability of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. (TM). \u001d  But it also risks diluting Porsche's profit margins, among the highest in the global auto industry. \"The more they increase their stake in Volkswagen, the more exposed they are to the volume business,\" Sturzer said. \"I would prefer to stay in the luxury business.\" \u001d  If it does eventually seek to acquire Volkswagen, Porsche would be moving in the opposite direction of Germany's other two carmakers, both of which have learned from experience how difficult it is to generate high-profits in the mass-market car business, amid growing competition from low-cost Asian rivals such as Toyota. BMW AG's (BMW.XE) acquisition of Britain's Rover Motor Cars in the 1990s cost the company billions and ultimately forced it to dump the brand. Similarly, DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) has announced it is seeking alternatives for Chrysler unit after repeated huge losses at the division. \u001d  Porsche and Volkswagen already have close ties. As well as Porsche being Volkswagen's largest shareholder, Volkswagen's powerful supervisory board chairman and former CEO Ferdinand Piech is at the same time a key shareholder and supervisory board member at Porsche. \u001d  A full takeover of Volkswagen by Porsche would clear the way for Piech to consolidate his grip on Europe's largest car manufacturer. He is a descendant of Porsche founder Ferdinand Porsche and belongs to the extended family that owns 100% of Porsche's voting stock, giving him a major influence at both companies. \u001d  In recent years, Piech has clashed with Lower Saxony officials and other Volkswagen shareholders over what critics said were their concerns about potential conflicts of interest stemming from Piech's close ties to Porsche. But as Porsche's stake in Volkswagen has grown since September 2005, Piech has seen his influence grow. Earlier this month, Piech confirmed his intention to seek another term on the Volkswagen board when his current term ends next month. \u001d  Last fall, Volkswagen's CEO, Bernd Pischetsrieder resigned his post after a series of clashes with Piech.  Pischetsrieder -- who has been replaced by Martin Winterkorn, a close ally of Piech -- had been moving to scale back the company's investments in luxury cars. \u001d  A possible Porsche takeover also has wider implications and could eventually see the creation of an European auto giant producing everything from sports cars to heavy trucks. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.porsche.com \u001d                     www.volkswagen.com \b \u001d  -By Steve McGrath, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9284; steve.mcgrath@dowjones.com \u001d  (Jan Hromadko in Frankfurt, Michael Brendel in Hamburg and Christoph Rauwald in the U.K. contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 11:30 ET (15:30 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"060b5cf2bd311c3a65add7a08e887806","symR":["EQY"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Equity One Discloses Independent Valuation","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T19:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EQY"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\bNORTH MIAMI BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 24, 2007-- \u001d  Equity One, Inc.

Racanelli \u001d  Is a bigger Barclays better? A merger of the London-based bank with ABN Amro Holdings, a large Dutch rival, would create a $170 billion banking colossus, No. 5 in the world, with commensurate clout. But Barclays holders would face near-term dilution, and the integration might not go smoothly. \u001d  Talk of a potential deal surprised Barclays shareholders, as the bank -- itself a regularly rumored deal target -- long has emphasized organic growth over acquisitions, particularly transformative tie-ups such as this one would be. But the market cheered the prospect of a merger that would create \"a lot of banking muscle,\" as CreditSights analyst Simon Adamson put it. Barclays' American depositary receipts (ticker: BCS) rallied from 53.50 to 59.42, on the week, and ABN Amro (ABN) rose from 36.24 to 43.10. \u001d  Barclays' robust outlook and low stock price attracted Barron's 13 months ago, when we suggested (\"London Calling,\" Feb. 13, 2006) that the shares were undervalued and investors were overlooking the fast-growing investment bank and Barclays Global Investors divisions. Since then the company, under CEO John Varley, has only done better, posting a 33% gain in profit last year. \u001d  What would a merger with ABN do for Barclay investors? Since there is no agreement, and no specifics on price, funding and synergies, a detailed analysis must wait. Moreover, Citigroup (C) and several European banks are thought to be contemplating rival bids. But it's possible to hazard a guess. \u001d  Among other things, Barclays presumably could do more with ABN's relatively undermanaged assets. Although CreditSights' Adamson says he's somewhat skeptical about the deal, he thinks greater global diversity would lessen geographic risk and temper criticism that bank profits are too wedded to the U.K. \u001d  The banks have little geographic or product overlap, and ABN operates in more countries than Barclays. Thus Barclays would be able to bring its popular BarclayCard, investment-banking and asset-management expertise to a host of new locales, such as Asia and Brazil, in a relatively short period of time. ABN also owns an attractive Italian franchise, and LaSalle, a lackluster Midwest bank with $73 billion in assets. \u001d  But there could be drawbacks, too, including relatively modest cost savings for a deal of this magnitude. Analysts have estimated Barclays could cut some 1.5 billion to 2 billion euros, about 10% of ABN's total expense base. \u001d  Alex Potter, an analyst at Collins Stewart, figures Barclays will pay for the deal mostly in stock; ABN has a current market value around 60 billion euros. Since Barclays sells for 11 times estimated '07 earnings, a discount to ABN's 15 times, Barclays holders would be diluted -- unless the bank could produce some unexpectedly large synergies. Huge job cuts aren't typical in a friendly merger such as this, the more so because overlaps exist here only in corporate banking and capital markets. \"Using an 8% to 10% reduction in ABN's cost base, Barclays can pay as much as 34 euros per share,\" Potter says. \u001d  That would produce a 9% return on investment by 2009, at which point the deal would add to earnings. \"There's an awful lot of deal risk for a modest shareholder accretion three years out,\" he says. \u001d  An ABN link-up also would carry execution risk. \"This deal is on a scale they've not done before, and Barclays has a patchy track record in mergers,\" says S&P analyst Nick Hill, \u001d  At the end of the day, Barclays' strong management team could deliver on the union's potential. Just the same, the bank's stock would go from a no-brainer to one that requires much closer attention. And if it fails to win ABN, Barclays itself might be a takeover target. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0cd81922c2d005409ffb4d1fa61f1b05","symR":["MOT","US6200761095"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) Follow-Up: Don't Ring Up Motorola Just Yet","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MOT","US6200761095"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Mark Veverka \u001d  Don't be tempted by Motorola after last week's warning that its annual earnings could plunge as much as 60% from previous projections. Things could get worse before they get better. \u001d  Two months ago (Plugged In, Jan. 29), we surmised that Motorola's shares (ticker: MOT) were no better than dead money. We haven't changed our ring tone. The shares closed Friday at 17.75, versus 18.31 when our report was published. Since then, the situation has deteriorated -- especiallywith the shocking February departure of handset head Ron Garriques, who left for equally troubled Dell (DELL) -- of his own volition. \u001d  Garriques was around before CEO Ed Zander arrived and was integral to the first Motorola handset revival that spawned the RAZR. Word is that Garriques wasn't interested in spearheading yet another mobile-phone turnaround, especially under Zander, a former computer executive who critics contend doesn't fully understand the engineering complexity behind mobile- phone development cycles. \u001d  Motorola can't get fresh models to market fast enough to match its competitors, and it takes at least two years to design new phones. In addition, Nokia (NOK) is expected to unveil more compelling models this week at a major wireless trade show in Florida. (Zander cancelled his appearance there.) At press time, rumors ran rampant that Motorola is in talks to buy handset maker Palm (PALM). \u001d  The only thing keeping Moto shares from plummeting more is Carl Icahn's 2.4% stake and his pressure that has brought more buybacks. Otherwise, the stock might be near 15, says a hedge-fund manager. Prior to the pre-announcement, the shares actually spiked on speculation that the company might be bought by private-equity interests.

The key point in this process is making a takeover offer it does not expect to be successful. \u001d  Under German law, Porsche will have to make a takeover offer for Volkswagen after exceeding the 30% threshold. \u001d  It would have to make an offer if, as planned, it increases its stake to 31% on Monday. \u001d  However, the company said it would launch a tender that would pay around EUR100.92 per VW common share under its offer, the minimum price prescribed by German law. \"For (Volkswagen's) preferred shares the price will likely be between EUR60 and EUR65 per share,\" Dau said. \u001d  Porsche, therefore, expects a low tender rate in the offer, which it expects to be ultimately unsuccessful. \u001d  The next threshold that would trigger another mandatory threshold under German law is at 50%. Thus, Porsche could raise its holding to that level without making another takeover offer. \u001d  \"We're keeping all our options open,\" by raising our stake in Volkswagen, Porsche spokesman Christian Dau added. \u001d  \"By presenting a mandatory offer to Volkswagen shareholders we're improving our flexibility for the future, because Porsche won't have to make another mandatory offer in case it intends to increase its stake in VW further,\"  Dau said. \u001d  The sportscar maker's move was also a preemptive step taken in anticipation that the so-called VW-law will become redundant, Dau said. That law limits any shareholder's voting rights in the car manufacturer to 20%, regardless of the number of shares held. \u001d  Last month, a legal advisor to the European Union's highest court announced that a German law intended to preserve the state's influence at Volkswagen violates E.U. regulations on the free movement of capital. \u001d  With Porsche's raised stake of 31% and the 20.3% stake that German state Lower Saxony holds in Volkswagen, the two largest VW shareholders would control a majority of 51%. \u001d  Both VW shareholders could therefore block a takeover and a possible breakup of the volume carmaker Volkswagen. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 11:13 ET (15:13 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"10e14f29ec40c27f7e47c3c27b47f02b","symR":["BGP.XX","KKR.XX","PSO","PSON.LN","WKL.AE","WTKWY","GB0006776081","NL0000395903"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Blackstone, KKR Among Potential Pearson Bidders - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T12:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BGP.XX","KKR.XX","PSO","PSON.LN","WKL.AE","WTKWY","GB0006776081","NL0000395903"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","IAS","MED","PUB","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XFT1","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Private equity groups Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. are thought to be among those considering a takeover of media conglomerate Pearson (PSO), The Times reported Saturday citing sources close to the company. \u001d  The talk was fueled by Bridgepoint's purchase of Wolters Kluwer's (WKL.AE) European education business Friday for up to GBP525 million, the paper said. \u001d   Although, the paper said the company is understood not to have received any offers yet. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.thetimes.co.uk \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires;

Chenault now is doing all he can to expand the company's franchise. He's trying to lure younger consumers with the notion that American Express is \"an aspirational brand.\" And he's going so far as to let its affluent cardholders use their plastic as down payments on luxury condos in Manhattan. \u001d  Sound risky? AmEx has some of the lowest credit losses in the industry -- no small matter in these jittery times. \u001d  -- A.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  George David \u001d  United Technologies, CEO since '94 \u001d  Why: UT, not GE, is the top-performing conglomerate \b \u001d  David is the total package, combining Japanese efficiency techniques, shrewd bets on products and unusual attentiveness to soft, human values. \u001d  It's paid off in hard dollars. David has delivered double-digit profit gains in quarter after quarter, year after year, in good times and bad. GE may be the most famous conglomerate, but under David, United Technologies has taken its measure in both stock-price performance and earnings growth. \u001d  United Technologies, best known for such brands as Otis elevators, Carrier air conditioners, Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters, has been been absolutely humming under David's guidance. Its employees have been getting smarter, too: David's scholarship program pays all expenses for employees taking college or graduate-school courses. The tab in recent years: $600 million. \u001d  David insists the company is set to achieve superior results long after his retirement, slated for next year. Not even Jack Welch was able to do that for GE. \u001d  -- Jonathan R. Laing \u001d  --- \u001d  Charlie Ergen \u001d  EchoStar Communications, since '80 \u001d  Why: A disciplined approach to growth put shares in orbit \b \u001d  Charlie Ergen loves to defy the doubters. While many worry about the staying power of satellite TV in a time of intense competition from cable operators, EchoStar Communications added over a million net subscribers in 2006, bringing its total to 13.1 million. That made the company No. 4 in pay TV -- behind only Comcast, Time Warner Cable and DirecTV. \u001d  Ergen has been beating the odds ever since he launched his service 11 years ago. He's done it by offering lower prices than cable, serving rural areas and keeping costs down. He talks little to Wall Street and believes fiercely in a strong balance sheet. If that sounds like an owner, there's a reason: Ergen controls 240 million shares of EchoStar stock, a stake worth over $10 billion. \u001d  In the past year, EchoStar shares have shot up 40%, thanks to strong results and takeover potential. The most likely buyer: AT&T, a current partner. Or EchoStar and arch rival DirecTV may try to hook up. With any luck, the stock will make like a satellite and head for the sky. \u001d  -- A.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  Larry Fink \u001d  BlackRock, CEO since '88 \u001d  Why: The smarts to assemble a world-class money manager \b \u001d  From zero to $1 trillion in 19 years. That's the steep trajectory of BlackRock's assets under management since the firm was founded in 1988 as a unit of investment firm Blackstone Group. And for every day of its existence, BlackRock's CEO has been Laurence D. Fink, one of the sharpest minds in financial services. \u001d  Fink, a former mortgage-securities trader at First Boston, has steered BlackRock toward the top ranks of asset managers by instilling a performance-driven culture and cutting deals to fuel growth. \u001d  Fink saw early the value of growing within a larger institution, and then sensed the virtues of independence as a fiduciary before that became the standard view. He sold the firm to PNC Financial in 1995, bought a minority stake public in 1999 and then, last year, boldly combined the firm with Merrill Lynch Investment Management. Since the IPO, the shares have surged 35% a year. It's enough to make an old mortgage jockey smile. \u001d  -- Michael Santoli \u001d  --- \u001d  Lew Frankfort \u001d  Coach, CEO since '95 \u001d  Why: Unparalleled grasp of a luxury brand \b \u001d  Few companies understand their brands as well as Coach, the handbag and accessories maker whose smart designs seem to glide off store shelves. \u001d  That's because few chief executives know their customers' preferences and aspirations better than Frankfort, who arrived at Coach in 1979 and is responsible for turning a staid old leather-goods producer into an iconic purveyor of \"affordable luxury.\" \u001d  Frankfort recites the key markers of the Coach brand without hesitation, from quality workmanship to a casual sophistication to the distinctive hardware on the bags. Unlike many fashion houses, Coach researches its customers' behavior and choices rather than dictating what's \"in.\" \u001d  Though Coach shares sold off sharply last year amid consumer-slowdown fears, the financial results beat forecasts, with earnings up 38% for the year. No need to research the source of long-term investors' brand satisfaction: The stock is up from a split-adjusted $2 in its late 2000 IPO to a recent 49. \u001d  -- M.S. \u001d  --- \u001d  Richard Fuld \u001d  Lehman Brothers, CEO since '94 \u001d  Why: Turning a bond shop into an elite investment bank \b \u001d  Meet Mr. Wall Street. A Lehman Brothers lifer who joined the firm in 1969, Fuld brings passion and competitiveness that are powerful even by Street standards. \u001d  Thank Fuld for saving Lehman, which nearly lost its storied identity as part of American Express in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since its spinoff in 1994, Fuld has made the bond specialist into a rival to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. \u001d  A tough former trader Fuld, 60, has developed the polish to woo corporate clients. Last year, Lehman was the adviser to AT&T on its $86 billion purchase of BellSouth, one of largest takeovers ever. \u001d  Lehman's stock is up 20-fold since '94. That's good news for employees, who own 30% of the company. And here's some even better news: Fuld has no plans to retire. \u001d  -- A.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  Fred Goodwin \u001d  Royal Bank of Scotland, CEO since '00 \u001d  Why: Adding a touch of tartan to the color of global money \b \u001d  After raising dividends by 15% or more for 14 straight years, what does a Scottish CEO do for an encore? If you're Goodwin, you crank up your business in America and Asia. \u001d  For years, Goodwin made his name on rigorous cost-cutting and by melding numerous acquisitions into the giant lender that Royal Bank is today. Now his Edinburgh-based institution wants to be a major corporate banker in the U.S., competing with the likes of Citigroup and Bank of America. That means getting more out of its U.S.-based Citizens Bank, which has posted flat results. But Goodwin is surely up to the job: He has a knack for coaxing double-digit growth from his businesses. Last year, total net climbed 15%, to GBP 6.2 billion. Meanwhile, Goodwin's once-criticized investment in the Bank of China looks set to produce the kind of returns his shareholders are accustomed to. \u001d  -- Vito J. Racanelli \u001d  --- \u001d  Jeffrey Immelt \u001d  General Electric, CEO since '01 \u001d  Why: Building an even stronger giant than the one he inherited. \b \u001d  Jeff Immelt has accomplished much since succeeding Jack Welch six years ago. GE's earnings have nearly doubled, to $21 billion, while Immelt has engineered an overhaul, buying high-return businesses in areas like health-care and shedding low-return reinsurance and life insurance units. GE is now heavily invested in aircraft engines and power generation, as well as water, wind and other environmentally promising products. \u001d  Immelt's GE is stronger than Welch's GE. The business mix is better, earnings quality is higher, and double-digit annual profit growth is more achievable. \u001d  But Immelt's GE share performance can't match Welch's. At around 35, the stock is about where it stood when he took over. Part of that reflects the stock's hefty price-earnings ratio in 2001. Before too long, Immelt's accomplishments ought to start getting more recognition on Wall Street. \u001d  -- A.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  Satoru Iwata \u001d  Nintendo, CEO since '02. \u001d  Why: Teaching the House of Game Boy to grow up \b \u001d  Little more than a year ago, it looked like game-over for Nintendo as Microsoft and Sony duked it out over the next generation of gaming consoles. Iwata, 47, changed all that with Wii (pronounced we, not why). The strikingly innovative console converts body motions like the swing of a tennis racquet into actions on a screen. Meanwhile, Nintendo's Brain Age, aimed at boomers fearful of losing mental acuity, has become one of America's top-selling games. Result: Kyoto, Japan-based Nintendo's earnings are jumping and its cash hoard has swelled to more than $6 billion. \u001d  Iwata, a former game developer, says his strategy is simple: \"We are not fighting against other companies -- we are fighting against ignorance of video games.\" Certainly, no one is in the dark anymore about Nintendo's potential. \u001d  -- Leslie P. Norton \u001d  --- \u001d  Steven Jobs \u001d  Apple, CEO since '97 \u001d  Why: As he goes, so goes Apple \b \u001d  Jobs is arguably more important to investors than any CEO in America. He's so connected to the fate of Apple that even fund managers who love the shares have been known to hedge their bets by taking sizable short positions on the chance he leaves. They think the shares could plunge by 20% or more if something were to happen to the iconic leader. That puts the man's stock market capitalization at $16 billion-plus. \u001d  Jobs indeed has faced some peril in a messy options-backdating probe that is still under way. But that doesn't seem to have slowed him down in the slightest. Through the ever-expanding line of iPods, the new Mac personal computers and the forthcoming iPhones, Steve Jobs is setting the agenda for Silicon Valley, Hollywood and the global wireless communications industry.

(ABT) that's designed to be absorbed by the body shows no cases of stent-related clots after six months. \u001d  The trial, called Absorb, also showed one major adverse event among the 30 patients involved - a case where repeat intervention occurred at the site of the original procedure. The Absorb six-month data were unveiled Saturday at the American College of Cardiology's annual conference. \u001d  Abbott called the results encouraging, and said it would push on by expanding this study. This new technology is years away from reaching the market, but Abbott believes bioabsorbable stents could eventually become the most common type of stent, and that the company has a strong lead in the development race. \u001d  The Absorb trial is the world's first to examine the safety and performance of a fully bioabsorbable stent. All stents are designed to prop open arteries, but stents on the market today are made of metal and stay in the body forever. \u001d  The stent Abbott is studying is designed to be metabolized by the body over time, eventually fading away completely with the goal of leaving a healed, natural vessel behind. Rather than metal, the bioabsorbable stent is made of polylactic acid. \u001d  Like Abbott's metallic Xience stent, the bioabsorbable product is coated with a drug called everolimus that's used to stop renarrowing that can lead to complications. \u001d  Abbott had previously said that it would make a decision about how to proceed with the bioabsorbable stent program after the six-month data came out. John M. Capek, senior vice president of Abbott's vascular business, said in an interview that Abbott is \"excited to take the next step\" based on the results. \u001d  That step includes enrolling more patients - the trial is designed for up to 60 - and checking them for longer periods of time. The next phase of the Absorb study will include a next-generation bioabsorbable stent that's designed for improved strength and deliverability. \u001d  The Absorb trial is a prospective study that isn't randomized. It's taking place in multiple European countries and New Zealand. \u001d  Looking ahead, if the device progresses through further study and eventually gains regulatory approval, it could reach the U.S. around 2012, Capek said. European approval could come two years earlier. \u001d  -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 12:00 ET (16:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"18adfe3fd8b160acc998fd604ff14b36","symR":["AVT.XX"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Bridgepoint Wins GBP360M Auction Race For Fat Face Brand -FT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T10:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AVT.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Fat Face, the fast-growing active lifestyle brand and clothing retailer, has been snapped up by Bridgepoint Capital in a deal worth GBP360 million the Financial Times reports Saturday. \u001d  The paper, citing company sources, says Bridgepoint beat at least three rivals to win the auction process quickly after tabling a knock-out bid. \u001d  Fat Face, which was sold by N.M.

The trick is to find financials that are sensitive to short-term interest rates but not to credit, and there aren't many. Our favorites would be residential- mortgage REITs. When we spoke two years ago, we were short Annaly Capital Management [NLY], and we rode it down from the high teens to the low teens as short rates were rising and the yield curve inverted and it hit Annaly's book value and dividend-paying ability. We've since covered it and gone long. They own prime-agency mortgage securities with no credit risk, and they lever them with short-term borrowing, a pretty simple model. With the end of Fed tightening, the dividends will head back up and will accelerate to the upside if the Fed cuts rates. Annaly is the biggest of the residential mortgage REITs, with a $4 billion market cap. It trades at a premium to book value because it is so liquid and accessible. \u001d  Our favorite way to play the residential mortgage REITs is Anworth Mortgage [ANH], which is our biggest long position. It is a $400 million market cap and it trades at only 87% of book. We love the guy who runs it, Lloyd McAdams, because he thinks like a shareholder and bought back a lot of stock when the shares were even lower than they are today, despite the fact that shrinking their balance sheet runs counter to his personal compensation in the short term. They own a greater percentage of adjustable-rate mortgages than Annaly does, and those will benefit more as they are reset upward, and because of that they are facing a sweet spot in late 2007 and 2008 when their funding costs go down on the Fed cuts we expect and their ARM assets are still repricing upward. Book value, which is now $9.75 a share, should rise to about $11 over the next few years as the value of their adjustable-rate mortgages go up. We think they could revisit their 2002 peak earnings of $2 a share by 2008 or 2009, and the stock, now 9 or so will trade back up to around its old high of 16.65. \b \u001d  Q: Any others along these lines? \u001d  A: A racier way to play mortgage REITs would be to buy Opteum [OPX]. Two-thirds of the company is a credit-risk-averse mortgage REIT just like Annaly or Anworth, and one-third of it is an ATL-A, or low-documentation mortgage originator -- a result of a horrible, ill-advised acquisition in 2005, and the market has really hammered the stock for it. But it has gone too far. Book value is $7.85 a share and the stock is around $4.50, so you can buy it for less than 52% of book. \u001d  If the Fed cuts rates, their REIT is a major beneficiary. We think they should just liquidate or sell the origination operations for a small hit to book value. But, lo and behold, Citibank bought 7 1/2% of the originator for 150% of book at year-end 2006. They are losing money now, but we would expect them to return to profitability in the second half of '07, even without the Fed cutting as their ARMS reset in price and book value goes up. If the Fed cuts, they will be quite profitable and have big dividends again, and the stock should trade up to or above book value. \b \u001d  Q: Let's go back to your view that there is going to be some aggressive easing. How does that square with some of the inflation data that we are getting? \u001d  A: It will prevent the Fed from easing in the short term. But again, if we are right that a credit crunch in mortgages is developing and are right about its effect on the consumer, by the middle of this year, inflation will be the least of the Fed's worries. \b \u001d  Q: Any other bright spots? \u001d  A: We are long Origen Financial [ORGN], a REIT and the only remaining player in manufactured-housing finance. With the end of the housing boom and a possible decline in home ownership, especially in the low end of the market, manufactured housing would benefit. \b \u001d  Thanks, Sy. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"27b1103ebd5cc69c2562274233466b1a","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005","POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Porsche Ups Volkswagen Stake To 31%, from 27.3%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T11:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 07:50 ET (11:50 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2d5e8df36ba6232834beb2ed7e6fd3d7","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"German State Lower Saxony Welcomes Porsche Raising VW Stake","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T13:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 09:55 ET (13:55 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2d5fdf72422fd1852f247eada50da7dc","symR":["BSX","JNJ","US4781601046"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Denmark Study Backs Coated Stents, But Sees Small Clot Risk","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T16:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BSX","JNJ","US4781601046"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","MDV","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Jon Kamp \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW ORLEANS (Dow Jones)--A large study on stent heart devices from Denmark shows that drug-coated stents did not increase the overall risk of serious problems at 15 months, compared with bare-metal stents, but did appear to raise the risk of dangerous clots and heart attacks after one year. \u001d  There was a small but statistically significant increased risk of these problems between 12 and 15 months among patients who received a coated stent, according to the study, unveiled Saturday at the American College of Cardiology's annual conference. \u001d  The coated stents, however, also led to a 43% reduction in the need for further intervention in the treated artery compared with bare-metal stents, and mortality was similar among both groups. The coated devices used in the study were made by Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), the two major players in the global stent market. \u001d  The study comes during an ongoing debate about the safety of coated stents amid signs the first-generation devices can increase the risk of clots long after implantation, compared with bare-metal stents. The study doesn't look very far beyond the one-year mark, though, which is where much of the focus on stent-related clots has fallen. \u001d  \"Future studies following this same group of patients for a longer period of time will allow us to determine if the very small excess of stent thrombosis and heart attack in the 12 to 15 month time period will continue to increase,\" said Michael Maeng, a study author from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, in an ACC release. \u001d  While the minor risk of very late clots and heart attacks warrants further research, \"these results do not outweigh the benefits of drug-eluting stents at the 15-month follow up,\" Maeng said. \u001d  The study's data were collected at three University Hospitals in Western Denmark, and included 12,395 stent patients. Among them, 11,730 coronary lesions were treated with bare-metal stents while 5,422 lesions were treated with coated stents. \u001d  The rate of stent thrombosis, or stent-related clots, was 2.2% among patients with bare-metal stents and 1.9% among coated-stent patients at 15 months. Heart attack rates were also low in both groups at 15 months. \u001d  Stents are tiny mesh devices that prop open arteries, and coated stents use medication to prevent the renarrowing that occurs more often in bare-metal stents. \u001d  This new study adds to a growing amount of evidence regarding stent safety performance, which has become a hot-button issue since last year's ACC meeting. The evidence includes controlled trials for stents on the market or aiming for regulatory approval, and registry studies that can reflect real-world experience, but don't have the same controlled circumstances. \u001d  A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel said in December that, while the devices from Boston Scientific and J&J seem to carry a small elevated risk of clots, the risk doesn't translate to a higher rate of heart attacks and deaths when the stents are used under FDA-approved guidelines. But the performance of the devices is less definitive in so-called \"off-label\" cases, which are typically more complex cases and make up more than 60% of stent usage. \u001d  Coated stent patients in the Western Denmark study were recommended for a 12-month course of anti-clotting medicine, which was the duration recently recommended by the FDA advisory panel. The study included clotting definitions created last year to create a common way to track the issue across different studies. \u001d  -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 12:00 ET (16:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"319117c31c5ce65d2f549f43dc8df9ac","symR":["BGP.XX"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) Streetwise: Read Their Lips","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BGP.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Michael Santoli \u001d  Yes, this describes Wednesday's Fed-reaction rally, when a nervous market cheered a softer policy statement by lifting the Dow about 150 points. But that Journal article ran June 30 of last year, the day after another Fed-reaction rally, when a softer statement also sent the Dow up about 150 points. \u001d  The periods were roughly similar. At both points, stocks had pulled back sharply from a bull-market high and partially recovered. The selloffs had spread nervousness and led to tentative recoveries. As stocks rallied last week, NYSE short interest reportedly jumped nearly 10% in the month through March 15. The Fed news then acted as an excuse for some deferred buying and short-covering. \u001d  Without making too much of analogies from the archives, these instances show that this market has continually over-anticipated the arrival of a friendlier Fed, imagining that the conditions that would prompt a rate cut would help stocks. \u001d  It's ironic that the bullish case on stocks begins with copious global liquidity, and yet quickly segues to a Fed rate cut -- necessary, we're told, for valuation multiples to expand as profits slow. \"We're liquid, but sure would like more liquidity,\" says the market. \u001d  It's like the popular comedian's line about the guy buying a Powerball ticket who says, \"Boy, I sure could use that money.\" He responds, \"You sure could use $275 million? What kind of mess have you gotten yourself into?\" \u001d  The fear is that the mortgage mess becomes a bigger housing mess and makes the expected slowdown into something too slow or worse. It will be months before we know whether these current concerns were alarmism or prescience. \u001d  By handicapping a greater chance that the Fed will ease in the coming months, the markets are either hoping for an irresponsible Fed that cuts rates before inflation is controlled, or an exceedingly deft Fed that can foresee inflation cooling before it's in the numbers. \u001d  To those who insist the Fed would never initiate rate cuts with stocks at a high, it did so both in June 1989 and July 1995, says Birinyi Associates. The S&P 500 gained 9% and 11% in the subsequent six months, respectively. Yet in both cases, GDP growth was either near zero for a quarter or would get there within a few months. It's not clear the market is now priced for a brush with the minus sign. \u001d  The market's body language, it should be said, has been pretty good in bouncing after the quick, nasty drop of late February. After last June's \"Fed-is-our-friend\" rally, stocks settled back a couple of percent and then launched into the huge run that carried into 2007. \u001d  But the present retreat has been both shallower (6%) and briefer (one month) than the corrective phase of 2006 (8%, and more than two months), and this one so far looks like a \"V,\" while the former was more like a \"W.\" \u001d  The countless wags who rushed to call the Blackstone Group IPO a sign of a market top must have been disabused of their wit Wednesday when a New York Times editorial offered the same thought. \u001d  Not that the Times always gets it wrong, mind you. But a financial notion has to be atomized at a pretty high concentration in the Manhattan atmosphere to garner space on that page. \u001d  In any case, the chatter only intensified after Blackstone filed plans for its $4 billion IPO Thursday. It shows the firm to be stupendously profitable, as expected, earning $2.2 billion last year, or $2.8 million per employee, though that figure is not fully taxed and doesn't speak to the partners' share of those profits. \u001d  Blackstone will have little problem achieving a $40 billion market value. It will become a core holding in an emerging \"alternative asset management\" sector. And the stock will probably open with a big pop -- which means it immediately will be unattractively valued. \u001d  This IPO essentially capitalizes a scintillating reputation and a phenomenal performance history. But the former can't be improved and it's hard to see how the latter can be counted on to get any better, given its size and the competition for deals. \u001d  Still, this is not only about ego and cashing out already-rich partners. The idea of having access to permanent capital rather than dialing up pension funds for every cent Blackstone invests makes some sense. In other words, you can respect the logic of the deal without buying the stock. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:10 ET (04:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"33233f9f70463a2de16b655efba51a38","symR":["OPWV"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) Follow-Up: Is Openwave's Sale Imminent?","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OPWV"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Mark Veverka \u001d  Openwave Systems slid Friday after the mobile-communications software outfit warned that it would miss its third-quarter revenue target.

Just ask Mr. Bush. Here he makes an extremely gracious offer to the Democrats who control the Congress and do the louts say, \"Thank, you, George\"? Not on your life. \u001d  Instead, the wretches raise a most unseemly ruckus and become positively apoplectic, pushing to sic the law of the land on several of the president's loyal and trusted aides. Hard to believe they'd get so darn riled up just because Mr. Bush canned a bunch of government lawyers for not doing the job they were hired to do -- which was to send as many Democrats to jail as possible. \u001d  For heaven's sakes, all eight of those birds who got the boot were Republicans. You'd think the Democrats would be beside themselves with glee to see the rascals get thrown out for whatever reason, rather than threatening Harriet Miers, who had been the president's counsel and came within a whisker (her rejection was simply a sexist thing) of sitting on the Supreme Court, and the noble Karl Rove, who serves as the White House's deputy chief of staff and moonlights as Mr. Bush's brain. \u001d  The Democrats insist on grilling Ms. Miers and Mr. Rove, seeking to uncover some deep, dark secret as to why the U.S. attorneys were fired. Like that Mr. Bush's mother made him do it. The president, in what can only be described as an extremely generous gesture, agrees that Ms. Miers and Mr. Rove can be questioned, but with a few modest provisos: The masses don't hear what they have to say, and there will be zilch record of what they have to say, and whatever they have to say will not be said under oath (Ms. Miers is a very proper lady and, like any proper lady, abjures oaths). \u001d  It's no wonder the rude response to his proposal got Mr. Bush's dander up, and he vowed that, unless the Democrats showed a little couth, he'd refuse to permit his aides to be interrogated and would invoke executive privilege to keep them mum. In case you're not familiar with the term, executive privilege is critical to the separation of powers that distinguishes our paragon democracy. More specifically, executive privilege grants this proud nation's revered chief executive the privilege of avoiding the awful truth. Every president worth his salt has jealously guarded this precious right and none more so than the present one. \u001d  However the brouhaha over the firing of the attorneys general is resolved -- if it ever is -- it does put into question the favored notion of professional wiseacres, especially in Wall Street (including us in an aberrational moment or two), that a Republican presidency and a Democratic Congress would ensure gridlock, which, in turn, would act as a barrier to an excess of mischievous lawmaking in Washington. The template was the '80s and the '90s, when one party lacked simultaneous control of both branches. \u001d  This time it's different, not least because of Iraq and the serious damage it has wrought to the president's popularity. What plays hob with the gridlock prospect, too, is that 2008 is an election year, and every politico with a pulse is either running for president or for reelection, a condition obviously more conducive to legislative extravagance than parsimony. In the circumstances, any Democratic initiative to appeal to the voters would likely attract more than a few Republican defectors. \u001d  This foreshadows a spate of noisy and stridently publicized hearings that could easily lead to action on a vast array of things of more than passing interest to the economy at large and investors in particular. Stuff like energy policy, health care, lending practices -- in real estate, student loans and the business of extending credit generally --  hedge funds, private equity, etc., etc., etc. All of which is great -- if you believe that bull markets climb a wall of worry. Otherwise, we admit, it might be a tad disturbing. \u001d  For the nonce, anyway, the stock market doesn't seem in very much of a need a wall of worry, or, for that matter, a bright blue sky. Just about everything and anything is reason enough for the beast to go up. Last week, for example, the Fed, after deciding not to fuss with interest rates, essentially confessed that it really didn't have a clue as to what tomorrow, much less next month, would bring, although it suspected that inflation was working its insidious way higher and the economy was losing some of its zip. That was enough to get investors furiously partying again. \u001d  And supposedly, too, feeding animal spirits was the sense that the jobs picture was improving, as illustrated by several weeks of decline in new claims for unemployment insurance. In truth, claims are not a very reliable indicator of employment conditions, which, no doubt, is why they've become so closely followed in Wall Street. \u001d  This is, as we've noted more than once, the worst employment recovery of any expansion in the past half-century. As Charlie Minter and Marty Weiner of Comstock Partners point out in a recent commentary, as of February, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics last issued its data, 63 months had passed since the cycle bottom in November 2001. During this stretch, the total increase in jobs amounted to 5%. In contrast, in the 63 months following the previous seven recession bottoms, the rise in employment ranged from 9.3% to 19%, averaging 13.9%. So what's all the shouting about? \u001d  The most noteworthy piece of market news last week was confirmation of rumors that the goliath of private equity, Blackstone, was planning to go public. Launched in 1987 by Pete Peterson and Stephen Schwarzman on a relative pittance ($20 million or $30 million), the firm has done spectacularly, racking up returns of more than 30% a year. At last count, it had a healthy $78.7 billion in assets under management, and it hopes to raise $4 billion via its IPO. \u001d  It's tempting to view Blackstone's conversion to the joys of public ownership as a sign that we've reached the top in the private-equity boom. But that's a little too glib even for us. Rather, we suspect it means that the game is more competitive, a lot of the low-hanging fruit (to use that delicious cliche) has been picked and the shrewd guys who run Blackstone are aware that nobody ever went broke taking a few billion off the table. \u001d  Still, it's probably a given that when the private-equity crowd (and more of that gang is sure to take its cue from Blackstone) decides to edge toward the exit, it's probably the better part of wisdom if you choose to grab a piece of the action to make certain you know where the exit is. \u001d  Any rush by other private-equity types and those other fully loaded stealth investors, the hedge funds, to take the plunge a la Blackstone and Fortress, will obviously swell the supply of equities, just in case you were worried about a shortage of the things. \u001d  A fortnight ago, in our doodling about Scooter Libby's plight for having lied and obstructed justice and the calls for his pardon, we alluded to the fact that Scooter was well-equipped to make a plea for pardon, since he had served on the team of lawyers who represented Marc Rich in his successful bid for a pardon from Bill Clinton. \u001d  That reference prompted a letter from Rich's Swiss lawyer protesting that contrary to what we wrote, Marc Rich was not found guilty of cheating on his taxes. And indeed, a little checking by our ace researcher, Teresa Vozzo, discloses he was not found guilty of cheating on his taxes. So, we wondered, precisely what was -- How shall we put it? -- the indiscretion he was pardoned for? We did mention, too, that Rich's former wife Denise had been a hotshot fund raiser for Bill Clinton; but while cynics might aver that helps explain why he was pardoned, it didn't really tell us why Rich needed a pardon. \u001d  So with Teresa's help, we felt obliged to do a bit more checking. And we're happy to say, we discovered right off the bat that Rich did not commit some serious crime like spitting on the sidewalk or jumping a subway turnstile. Rather, Marc Rich and his partner, Pincus Green, on Sept. 19, 1983, were indicted for allegedly evading $48 million in taxes and illegally buying oil from Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis. \u001d  Our old pal, Rudy Giuliani, then the U.S. Attorney in New York, declared it the largest income-tax evasion indictment ever. Both Rich and Pincus were conveniently in Switzerland when the indictments were handed down and were deemed fugitives. \u001d  We've no excuse for getting hazy about the details of Marc Rich and the oil-pricing scheme that he employed to avoid the tax bite. For, as it all came rushing back to us, Barron's did a fantastic story, published the weekend prior to the indictment -- a true scoop, as they say in the movies -- in which two of our crack writers, Jaye Scholl and Lawrence Tell, wrote a marvelous piece entitled \"Crude Scheme? The Fantastic Saga of Marc Rich.\" In it, Jaye and Larry, related how Rich and Pincus from scratch and with only $2 million in seed money built a global commodities trading operation that cleared profits of $100 milion in the early 1980s. They also described in fascinating detail the ruses Rich and Pincus used to hide those profits from huge oil sales. \u001d  There are worse things, it turns out, than being a rich fugitive in dear old Switzerland. Rich continued to trade commodities to the tune of $30 billion a year and prospered mightily. As for Rudy Giuliani, we blush to say we've kind of lost track. Wonder whatever happened to him? \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:10 ET (04:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"339424d511f4ca7c7ed9e8b933e0be06","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Porsche Expects Low Tender Rate In Volkwagen Bid","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T13:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 09:28 ET (13:28 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"393c2a1b83e91c9c26315b93c98935c5","symR":["CSCO","HPQ","PLCM","TNXI","WEBX","US17275R1023","US4282361033"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) Plugged In: Small-Cap With Big Promise","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CSCO","HPQ","PLCM","TNXI","WEBX","US17275R1023","US4282361033"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","CPR","ISV","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Mark Veverka \u001d  Looking for another reason to short the airline industry over the long haul? \u001d  Thanks to the generosity of the federal bankruptcy code and relentless efforts to slash costs, the air carriers have finally rebounded from their post-9/11 funk. But high fuel tabs and the general unpleasantness of flying these days (think JetBlue) could challenge their recovery. \u001d  Still, the bigger long-term threat is video-teleconferencing. It isn't a question of if, but when, this technology becomes so effective that businesspeople won't feel compelled to hop on planes. The success of WebEx Communications (ticker: WEBX), an Internet-based video-conferencing and collaboration outfit that was bought by Cisco Systems (CSCO) two weeks ago for $3.2 billion, illustrates that this day could soon arrive. \u001d  The Cisco deal also raises the hopes of a little-known start-up, Telanetix (TNXI). The San Diego small-cap boasts a market value of only $58.5 million, but it has proven that it can compete with its bigger rivals in the high-end video-conferencing market: Cisco (which was already in the business before the WebEx acquisition), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Polycom (PLCM). In January, Telanetix beat its larger rivals by winning a major contract from Mercedes-Benz USA. \u001d  While WebEx is a lower-end desk-top solution, primarily used for internal communication within companies, the others provide systems that require conference rooms and studios. Prices run from as little as $30,000 for a Telanetix system to as much as $500,000 for an HP Halo system. HP is the industry leader, with a price to match its quality. \u001d  The Telanetix system -- largely a software product that can run on its competitors' legacy hardware -- delivers full-size, face-to-face images in high resolution on large flat-panel screens, along with real-time audio and data. It really gives the perception that users are in the same room, says Bob Jesenik, president of Aequitas Capital, which owns just under 5% of Telanetix. Jesenik, whose hedge fund has offices in Oregon and Washington State, says Telanetix has a high-end system that is easy to use. \"If they can make it CEO-proof, which we think they can, it could achieve mass-market growth,\" he comments. \u001d  Jesenik says that Telanetix has been breaking even and could turn a profit this year. Sales could take off, he adds, given its announcement last week that it will lease systems to corporations for as little as $1,000 a month. \u001d  Analyst Joe Noel of Dutton Associates, an independent research outfit outside Sacramento, pegs 2007 revenue at $8.5 million, up substantially from 2006's $1.7 million. He predicts annual earnings of 18 cents a share and rates the over-the-counter stock a Strong Buy, with a price target of 5. The shares were trading around 3.95 late Friday. \u001d  Noel argues that Telanetix's ability to deliver a high-quality product at a relatively low price will translate into many more big contract wins and possibly a bid for the company by Cisco or HP. \u001d  But even without a takeover offer, Jesenik contends that this small-cap could get big in a hurry. He says that management has a proven track record with technology start-ups. In addition, \"the senior team doesn't take salary, which tells us that they are aligned with shareholders' interests.\" \u001d  And that's not good news for the airline industry. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"407e3f85bd8220d6be9ceff7d1507d0b","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CORRECT: Porsche To Launch VW Offer In Short Term","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T12:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  German sports car maker Porsche AG  (POR3.XE) Saturday said it will launch a bid for the whole of Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) in the short term after it has completed raising its stake in Europe's biggest car manufacturer to 31%, from 27.3%. \u001d  (\"*Porsche Ups Volkswagen Stake To 31%, from 27.3%,\" published at 1150 GMT and the subsequent headlines and a following incorrectly said Porsche had already raised its stake and made an offer.) \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 08:17 ET (12:17 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"44c0d49ec7595581ae6849ab865dcf13","symR":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","CBK.XE","CRZBY","MER.XX","POR3.XE","UBS","UBSN.VX","VLKAY","VOW.XE","CH0024899483","DE0006937733","DE0007664005","DE0008032004","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Porsche Doesn't Seek VW Majority Buy, Sees Low Tender Rate -3","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T15:59:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","CBK.XE","CRZBY","MER.XX","POR3.XE","UBS","UBSN.VX","VLKAY","VOW.XE","CH0024899483","DE0006937733","DE0007664005","DE0008032004","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","BAN","BNK","ICS","SVC","XAEX","XDAX","XDJGI","XENX","XFT1","XGTI","XNYA","XSMI","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  If all outstanding Volkswagen shareholders tendered their shares to Porsche, the transaction would cost the sportscar maker around EUR35 billion, spokesman Dau said. \u001d  Porsche said it has secured financing for the mandatory offer from a banking consortium consisting of ABN Amro Holding NV (ABN), Barclays Capital, Merrill Lynch International, UBS Limited and Commerzbank AG (CRZBY). \u001d  Porsche's already existing option to acquire a further 3.7% in Volkswagen for around EUR1 billion can be financed with the agreed credit lines, Dau said. \u001d  \"We're not planning a capital increase,\" he added. \u001d  Dau also reconfirmed Porsche's earnings guidance for the fiscal year 2007, ending Jul. 31. \u001d  \"We're not expecting the Volkswagen offer to cost so much that we have to revise our earnings guidance,\" Dau said. \u001d  Porsche expects to exceed last year's pretax profit of EUR2.1 billion in the current financial year. \b \u001d  Company Web sites: http://www.porsche.com; http://www.volkswagen.com \b \u001d  -By Matthias Krust; Dow Jones Newswires; +49 69 29 725 500; matthias.krust@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 11:59 ET (15:59 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"44c8a4059d356ce72e47703a00738a13","symR":["ABT","BSX","JNJ","MDT","US0028241000","US4781601046"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Abbott's Xience Stent Meets Goals In Key Trial","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T19:59:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABT","BSX","JNJ","MDT","US0028241000","US4781601046"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","MDV","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Update adds comments from trial investigator) \b \u001d  By Jon Kamp \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW ORLEANS (Dow Jones)--A pivotal trial for Abbott Laboratories Inc.'s (ABT) \"Xience\" drug-coated stent met its main and secondary goals, putting the company in position to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the device. \u001d  Xience is seen by analysts as a key entry in the market for coated stents - a market that has been hurt recently by concerns over device safety. In the Spirit III trial on Xience released Saturday, at the American College of Cardiology's annual conference, Abbott's stent performed better than the blockbuster Taxus device made by Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) in certain measures of performance. \u001d  The goal of the trial was to prove that Xience was not worse than Taxus, which is the top selling stent in the U.S. \u001d  \"We not only hit the endpoint, but we hit it by a margin,\" said John M. Capek, senior vice president of Abbott's vascular business, in an interview. \u001d  Meantime, further results from a smaller, longer-term study also showed favorable results for Xience in a match-up with Taxus. \u001d  The Xience data are partly supportive for Boston Scientific, though, as it has the rights to sell Xience under a different name through an agreement with Abbott linked to last year's purchase of Guidant Corp. Boston Scientific said in a release that the study showed positive performance for the new stent and Taxus. \u001d  Xience went on sale in Europe and parts of Asia last fall. Based on the Spirit III results, Abbott continues to plan a filing with the FDA in the second quarter this year, and to target approval for Xience to enter the nearly $3 billion U.S. market in the first half of 2008, Capek said.  Stents are tiny metal devices that prop open arteries, and drug-coated stents like Xience use medication to combat renarrowing. \u001d  The Spirit III trial included 1,002 patients and had a primary goal of avoiding renarrowing around the stent. On that measurement, known as \"in-segment late loss,\" Xience led to a 50% reduction compared with Taxus at eight months. \u001d  In a secondary goal of avoiding \"target vessel failure,\" which measures re-treatment anywhere within the vessel at issue, and also cardiac death and heart attacks, Xience was non-inferior compared with Taxus. Xience showed a lower rate, at 7.2% compared with 9% for Taxus, but the difference isn't considered statistically significant. \u001d  On another secondary goal of the trial, measuring the avoidance of \"major adverse cardiac events\" like death, heart attacks or the need for retreatment, Xience also performed better than Taxus. There was a 4.6% rate of such events at nine months with Xience compared with an 8.1% rate with Taxus. \b \u001d   Impact For Boston Scientific \b \u001d  Thought the Spirit III data makes Boston Scientific's Taxus look inferior in certain respects, the company can market a version of Xience under the name Promus. Boston Scientific recently launched Promus in Europe. \u001d  The company would have to sell far more Promus stents than Taxus stents, though, to make up for lost Taxus contributions, as Abbott gets a big portion of profits on every Promus sale. \u001d  Gregg W. Stone, a cardiologist from Columbia University Medical Center and the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, and co-principal investigator in the Spirit III trial, was asked at a press conference whether the Xience data might make Taxus obsolete. \u001d  Stone, who has financial ties to Abbott and Boston Scientific, said a combination of attributes will make Xience \"the attractive choice for many physicians, but it will by no means obsolete the Taxus stent.\" Taxus has been studied in thousands of patients for years in a range of cases, he noted. \u001d  Among Boston Scientific benefits from the Xience program, Abbott will pay the company $500 million based on Xience regulatory approval - half when the device is approved in the U.S., and the other half when approval comes in Japan. \u001d  The profit-sharing deal is connected to the acquisition of Guidant by Boston Scientific and Abbott last year. Boston Scientific bought the bulk of Guidant while Abbott bought Guidant's vascular business, and struck a deal with Boston Scientific to share the rights to Guidant's coated-stent program. \u001d  The deal proved fortuitous for Abbott last October, when the company canceled its home-grown ZoMaxx stent program amid poor trial data. \u001d  Though the market for drug-coated stents has been hurt by concerns about links to clots, contributing to weaker stent sales among established players like Boston Scientific and J&J, it's still an emerging opportunity for Abbott. \u001d  Abbott's vascular division, which includes stents, posted revenue of $1.08 billion last year. The company has said it aims to ramp up vascular sales to about $3 billion by 2009. \u001d  In reports issued before the Spirit III data was released, analysts pointed to Xience's potential to be a major player in the coated-stent market. Banc of America analyst Glenn Novarro estimated Xience sales of $279 million this year and said the stent has \"market-leading potential.\" \u001d  Banc of America lead or co-managed a securities offering for Abbott and Boston Scientific in the last year, and has had an investment banking relationship with the companies. \b \u001d  Longer-Term Data \b \u001d  The clotting concerns grew over the last year amid signs that first-generation coated stents can cause a slightly elevated risk of clots over time compared with bare-metal stents. Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) lead the global coated-stent market, and have the only two devices currently approved in the U.S. \u001d  An FDA advisory panel determined in December that, while the devices from Boston Scientific and J&J seem to carry a small elevated risk of clots, the risk doesn't translate to a higher rate of heart attacks and deaths when the stents are used under FDA-approved guidelines. But the performance of the devices is less definitive in so-called \"off-label\" cases, which make up more than 60% of stent usage. \u001d  Coming devices from Abbott and Medtronic Inc. (MDT) have shown a good safety profile in studies to date. \u001d  On the issue of \"late stent thrombosis,\" or clots that appear after a month, one of 653 patients treated with Xience in Spirit III developed a clot, while there were no events among the 320 patients treated with Taxus. The difference was not considered statistically significant. \u001d  Looking out further, the Spirit II trial on Xience, which covers fewer patients out to one year, continued to show good performance in avoiding clots. Using new definitions of clotting produced last fall to create a common way to track clots, there were zero cases of late stent thrombosis with Xience in that study. \u001d  Among 300 patients in Spirit II, Xience showed a 71% reduction in major adverse cardiac events at one year compared with Taxus. \u001d  -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 15:59 ET (19:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"46804f80340e39912754bb9ec3e8dfdb","symR":["005930.SE","12064.FR","500470.BY","7974.OK","AAPL","AXP","BLK","BRKA","BRKB","CFC","COH","COST","DA","DISH","EXPD","FDX","GE","LEH","MBL.AU","MT","MT.AE","NTDOY","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","PG","RBS.LN","RYA.DB","RYAAY","SAP","SAP.XE","TSCDY","TSCO.LN","UTX","VNO","WFC","WFMI","XTO","ZFSVY","ZURN.VX","AU000000MBL3","AU000000NWS2","CH0011075394","DE0007164600","FR0000120644","GB0007547838","GB0008847096","IE00B1GKF381","INE081A01012","JP3756600007","KR7005930003","NL0000361947","US0258161092","US0378331005","US22160K1051","US3021301094","US31428X1063","US3696041033","US5249081002","US7427181091","US9130171096","US9497461015"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) The World's Best CEOs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["005930.SE","12064.FR","500470.BY","7974.OK","AAPL","AXP","BLK","BRKA","BRKB","CFC","COH","COST","DA","DISH","EXPD","FDX","GE","LEH","MBL.AU","MT","MT.AE","NTDOY","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","PG","RBS.LN","RYA.DB","RYAAY","SAP","SAP.XE","TSCDY","TSCO.LN","UTX","VNO","WFC","WFMI","XTO","ZFSVY","ZURN.VX","AU000000MBL3","AU000000NWS2","CH0011075394","DE0007164600","FR0000120644","GB0007547838","GB0008847096","IE00B1GKF381","INE081A01012","JP3756600007","KR7005930003","NL0000361947","US0258161092","US0378331005","US22160K1051","US3021301094","US31428X1063","US3696041033","US5249081002","US7427181091","US9130171096","US9497461015"],"IndustryCodes":["AIF","AIR","AMG","ARO","ASP","BNK","BRD","CFN","CLO","CPR","ENT","FDR","FOD","HPN","HPR","IDD","INF","INS","INU","MED","MFN","OFP","OIS","PUB","REA","REI","RTB","RTS","SCR","SEM","SOF","STL","TEX","TMF","XAEX","XATI","XCA4","XDAX","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XORD","XRUS","XSMI","XSP5","XST5","XSTF","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Andrew Bary \u001d  Many chief executives are critical to their organizations. But a much smaller number really matter on Wall Street. \u001d  In assembling our third annual list of 30 top corporate leaders from around the world, we've sought to identify CEOs who have top-notch reputations in the financial community and who likely would be missed by investors if they unexpectedly left their jobs. This admittedly is a subjective call, but we've talked to plenty of investors, looked at financial and stock-market performance and assessed intangible factors like leadership and industry stature. We've drawn on the knowledge of our staff, many of whom have contributed to this article. \u001d  To qualify, CEOs need to have been on the job for three years, but we tend to prefer those that have at least five years experience because it takes time to influence a large company and develop a reputation in the investment world. \u001d  Many of the CEOs in our pantheon this year founded their companies or have been with them for a decade or more. Founders include Rupert Murdoch of News Corp., Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Jim Sinegal of Costco Wholesale, Fred Smith of FedEx and Charlie Ergen of EchoStar Communications. Many investors mistakenly minimize the beneficial impact of the continuing presence of a founder on an organization, but patient holders have reaped the rewards of having a Buffett, Smith or Sinegal at the helm. \u001d  A founder often has intimate business knowledge, commands strong employee loyalty and can resist periodic entreaties from Wall Street for quick fixes to tough problems. Not every founder is an unalloyed plus for investor. Many on Wall Street, for instance, believe that it's time for the 83-year-old Sumner Redstone to step back from Viacom and CBS. \u001d  The ultimate CEO who matters is Steve Jobs, a co-founder and guiding force at Apple. Jobs' departure probably would result in a greater loss of stock-market value than the loss of any other CEO in the world. Jobs might be worth 20 or so points to Apple shares, roughly $16 billion. No wonder the company last year seemed eager to minimize Jobs' role in Apple's options-backdating problem. Apple continues to out-innovate Microsoft, which spends about 10 times as much on research and development. \u001d  A common theme among the 30 CEOs is that they have delivered for shareholders. Nearly all of the companies have stocks that have bested the Standard & Poor's 500 index during the CEO's tenure. One notable exception is General Electric, whose share price is little changed under the five years of Jeff Immelt's leadership. Immelt deserves inclusion because of GE's strong financial performance during his tenure and his moves to remake GE's portfolio in favor of high-growth businesses. Just think about what the past five years could have been like at GE if its board had selected the imperious Bob Nardelli to succeed Jack Welch in 2001. A former GE division chief, Nardelli was a contender for Welch's job and went to Home Depot after losing to Immelt. \u001d  There are plenty of returning names on this year's list, with 21 of the 30 CEOs having made the cut in 2006. Two CEOs, Steve Reinemund of PepsiCo and John Browne of BP, departed because of retirement, or, in Browne's case, an impending departure. \u001d  Others were dropped as a result of business or financial difficulties. Gone from the list is Bob Toll, the co-founder of Toll Brothers. Toll may be the best CEO in the housing business, but industry profits have collapsed and the financial outlook for even top builders looks murky. Glenn Renwick of Progressive was dropped, although Progressive probably remains one of the two best-run auto insurers -- along with Berkshire's Geico. Progressive's operating margins -- and share price -- are eroding in an increasingly competitive environment. Also off the list is Chip Mason, who built Legg Mason into an asset-management powerhouse over two decades. Mason, however, may have done one deal too many in 2005 when he bought Citigroup's investment-management arm, a transaction that has proven disappointing so far. \u001d  Notable newcomers on our list include Murdoch, who continues to make intelligent business moves, like buying MySpace.com in 2005, and shrewd financial actions, like effecting a giant share buyback by swapping News Corp.'s controlling stake in DirecTV for a 16% stake in News Corp. held by John Malone's Liberty Capital. \u001d  Larry Fink of BlackRock Financial keeps a low profile but is known for being one of the smartest people in the asset-management industry. Under his leadership, BlackRock has become one of the country's top bond managers and its stock has risen 10-fold since a 1999 IPO. Fink, a former mortgage trader, isn't afraid to bet big, swapping shares equal to nearly half his company last year for Merrill Lynch's investment-management arm in a bid to build a large equity business. \u001d  There are 10 overseas CEOs on our list, including four new executives: Ratan Tata of Tata Sons; James Schiro of Zurich Financial; Franck Riboud of Groupe Danone, and Satoru Iwata of Nintendo. Tata, whose family-controlled company holds stakes in several major Indian companies, including Tata Motors and Tata Steel, is one of India's top business leaders. While rivals Microsoft and Sony engaged in a hardware war to develop more powerful videogame platforms, Nintendo came up with an elegant and popular alternative in Wii -- and Nintendo shares have nearly doubled in the past year. U.S. investors generally don't think of France as a breeding ground for world-class executives, but Riboud is an exception. Danone is a world-class food company and carries one of the industry's highest price/earnings ratios -- a clear sign of investor esteem. No wonder that PepsiCo, another well-managed enterprise, was rumored to be interested in buying Danone in 2005. James Schiro, an American, has engineered a revival at Zurich Financial since taking the top job in 2002. \u001d  In assembling this list, we seek to spotlight a mix of well-known and less familiar CEOs. Peter Rose, a co-founder and longtime CEO of Expeditors International, a freight forwarder, is no household name, but he's known in the transportation industry for building a top-notch global logistics company. Thanks to its impressive growth prospects, Expeditors has a forward price/earnings ratio of 35, the highest among the 30 companies on the list. \u001d  A pugnacious Rose doesn't have much patience for critics, whom he has skewered with glee in quarterly written reports in which he fields investor-related inquiries. When a bearish Street analyst complained about a lack of access in 2003, Rose shot back in one of those reports: \"Your calls and e-mails requesting a visit have been ignored. The message is one that any seventeen-year-old boy would understand: You are not going to get your date.\" \u001d  Another relative unknown is XTO Energy's Bob Simpson, who has built arguably the leading independent energy company. The name of the game in the energy business is reserve growth and XTO has excelled at that, expanding its reserve base at a rate of 30% annually since going public in 1993. Not surprisingly, XTO shares have risen at a 30% annual clip since then. \u001d  We gave considerable thought about whether to keep Angelo Mozilo, Countrywide Financial's CEO, on our list due to the shakeout in the subprime lending market. As the country's top mortgage originator, Countrywide is a sizable subprime lender. We're sticking with Mozilo because he has built a top-notch organization with strong risk controls that could emerge even stronger from the current subprime meltdown. \u001d  Some readers may question the selection of Mozilo or, for that matter, any of the other 29 CEOs.

Top investors like Buffett recognize that. \b \u001d  Warren Buffett \u001d  Berkshire Hathaway, CEO since '65 \u001d  Why: The era's most extraordinary investor and manager \b \u001d  Age isn't slowing Buffett. At 76, he remains at the top of his game. His Berkshire Hathaway is coming off its best year ever as operating profits hit $9.3 billion in 2006, almost double 2005. \u001d  In the past decade, Buffett has turned Berkshire from an insurance and investment company into a cash-spewing conglomerate with more than 70 operating businesses ranging from hamburgers (Dairy Queen) to private jets (NetJets) to electric and gas utilities (MidAmerican Energy). Thankfully, Buffett issues minimal amounts of stock for his acquisitions; nearly all the deals of recent years were for cash. \u001d  While publicly lukewarm on stocks, Buffett added to Berkshire's $60 billion equity portfolio in 2006, buying shares of Johnson & Johnson, ConocoPhillips and U.S. Bancorp. Berkshire's own Class A shares have topped $100,000, up from $20 when Buffett took over in 1965. \u001d  Buffett's shoes clearly will be hard to fill, but he may be around for a while yet: His actuarial life expectancy, as he wrote in his recent annual letter, is 12 more years. \u001d  -- Andrew Bary \u001d  --- \u001d  Kenneth Chenault \u001d  American Express, CEO since '01 \u001d  Why: Driving platinum results at a financial-services icon \b \u001d  Chenault never leaves home without it -- his managerial know-how, that is. Two years ago, for instance, he decided to spin off American Express' insurance and investment unit as Ameriprise Financial to allow AmEx to focus on its high-return charge-card business. The move paid off quickly: An independent Ameriprise has seen its shares gain 60% and AmEx's operating profits rose 18% last year as return on equity hit 34%, the highest figure among big financial firms. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4a41bfb787665d272bfa23634619828b","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Porsche To Launch VW Offer In Short Term -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T12:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  In a statement following an extraordinary general meeting, Stuttgart-based Porsche said its board had authorized the company's management to make the stake increase and launch the bid in the short term. \u001d  Porsche said it will also create a holding company, which will be a European stock corporation, or Societas Europaea (SE), so that it can split its Porsche operational business from its VW holding. \u001d  -By Steve McGrath, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9284; steve.mcgrath@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 08:19 ET (12:19 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4b7b2a9d2db21e4db65e466cfce08757","symR":["C","CIT","NNI","SLM","WB","US1729671016","C","CIT","NNI","SLM","WB","US1729671016"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Clemson Official: Education Fin Partners Deal Helps Students","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T17:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["C","CIT","NNI","SLM","WB","US1729671016"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","CFN","FIS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \b   By Chad Bray \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)-Clemson University has only received about $500 under a revenue-sharing agreement with Education Finance Partners Inc. that New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo claims is improper, the school's financial aid director said Saturday. \u001d  Marvin G. Carmichael, Clemson's director of financial aid, added the state-supported university has used the money to fund student financial aid. \u001d  Carmichael said the South Carolina school entered an agreement with EFP last summer. EFP is one of several private lenders at Clemson who offer loans to students beyond what is provided under federal student loan programs. EFP is one of two student-loan providers highlighted on the school's financial aid Web site for alternative loans to help students who need additional assistance to pay for their education. \u001d  The other is the South Carolina Student Loan Corp., a nonprofit organization. Units of Citigroup Inc. (C) and Wachovia Corp. (WB) also are listed as primary lenders on the Web site. \u001d  \"We feel the agreement is in the best interest of students,\" Carmichael said. \u001d  He said the university reached the agreement with EFP after a state-approved competitive bidding process. \u001d  Thursday, Cuomo announced that he has sent formal notice to EFP that he plans to sue the San Francisco specialty finance company over its revenue-sharing arrangements with at least 60 colleges and universities nationwide, claiming its practices are deceptive and violate New York's consumer fraud law. \u001d  Cuomo said EFP is improperly paying schools to steer loans its way and to put the company on preferred lender lists, including payments of more than $100,000 a year to some schools. The attorney general also said the loans are presented to students as coming from the university when they were actually coming from EFP. Cuomo said such practices can drive up the cost of loans to students and limit their choice of lenders. \u001d  Schools that have entered revenue-sharing agreements with EFP include Baylor University, Boston University, Drexel University, Duquesne University, Fordham University, Long Island University, Pepperdine University, St. John's University, Texas Christian University, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of Mississippi, Cuomo said. \u001d  EFP has said it is \"fully prepared\" to defend its business practices and were cooperating with the attorney general's office. The company has said money paid to the schools under revenue-sharing agreements are used to fund financial aid programs and don't impact the cost of borrowing. EFP said it discloses to all borrowers that it may have a revenue-sharing agreement with their school. \u001d  At a press conference Thursday, Cuomo singled out the Clemson Education Partners Loan as problematic, saying the marketing of the loans makes it appear they are from the university rather than EFP. \u001d  A Web site for the Clemson loan describes it as being offered \"in cooperation with Education Finance Partners\" and that the loan application will be sent from the company. The university is described as \"the marketing agent for the originating lender.\" \u001d  \"I don't think the Web site misleads students,\" Carmichael said. \u001d  EFP is one of six student-loan providers from which the attorney general's office requested information in November as part of a preliminary inquiry into potential financial arrangements they may have with schools. \u001d  The other lenders are SLM Corp. (SLM), which is better known as Sallie Mae; Nelnet Inc. (NNI); EduCap Inc.; the College Board; and CIT Group Inc. (CIT). Sallie Mae is the nation's largest student loan provider. \u001d  At Thursday's press conference, Cuomo said that his office is \"in discussions\" with other lenders and schools about the probe. He said settlements with - or legal action against - schools and lenders are possible. \u001d  Cuomo's office is \"actively investigating\" the student-loan practices at 100 public and private colleges and universities and has sent letters to more than 400 schools, urging them to end questionable relationships with lenders. \u001d  Carmichael said Clemson received a letter from the attorney general's office and sent a copy of its contract with EFP to Cuomo's office. \b \b   -By Chad Bray, Dow Jones Newswires; 212-227-2017; chad.bray@dowjones.com \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 13:01 ET (17:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4cd23d47ef1d396fa86d1b968c48996d","symR":["RSH"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) A New Day At RadioShack","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RSH"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Lawrence C. Strauss \u001d  Under its new CEO and Chairman Julian C. Day, RadioShack has begun to recharge its depleted batteries. His aggressive cost-cutting and more rigorous financial controls helped the ubiquitous consumer-electronics retailer lift its fourth-quarter earnings by more than 60% over the year-earlier level, to 62 cents a share on nearly $1.5 billion in revenue. That's put a charge into the shares: They recently were at 26.94, up 61% this year. \u001d  The run-up reflects the success that Oxford-educated Day, 54, has had during his eight months on the job. He closed underperforming stores, cut ad spending and managed inventory tightly to wring out more profit, giving himself the time and money to face a much sterner test: getting the proper mix of electronic gadgetry onto RadioShack's (ticker: RSH) sometimes cramped shelves so the 86-year old retailer's smallish outlets can compete with the likes of Circuit City (CC), Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT). \u001d  As Day himself told analysts last month, \"It is all about having the right product in the right stores at the right price.\" (RadioShack declined to make any senior executives available to speak with Barron's.) \u001d  Bears insist that Day already has picked the low-hanging fruit through his cost cuts and will find it nearly impossible to replace the profitable growth that cellphone sales -- now in decline at RadioShack -- have produced. And, they argue, the stock -- at a hefty 23.2 times next year's profit estimate of $1.16 a share -- is vulnerable. \u001d  But some smart money is betting that the retailing veteran, who worked on turnarounds at Kmart, Sears and Safeway, will succeed. Day \"has done what he's had to do with the balance sheet and the financials,\" says shareholder Robert Olstein, the well-regarded portfolio manager of Olstein Financial Alert. \"Now he's got to get the right merchandise in, and we think he's doing that.\" By another investor's estimate, the shares could gain 34% to near 36 over the next 18 months or so, if Day can trim more costs and reverse the company's recent revenue decline. \u001d  Day doesn't have to deliver a miracle right away, because of savings he has wrought -- and may still realize. RadioShack's gross profit margin climbed to 45.6% in the fourth quarter, up sharply from 41.1% a year earlier. \u001d  One way for a retailer to widen gross margins is to manage inventory better. At the end of the fourth quarter, RadioShack's inventory totaled $752.1 million, down from $964.9 million a year earlier -- which the company attributed in part to better purchasing analysis. Accounts receivable fell to $248 million from $309 million, suggesting that the company is also getting paid faster. \u001d  Further bolstering margins is Day's avoidance of what he calls \"empty-calorie sales.\" RadioShack has offered fewer markdowns since he arrived. \u001d  The company has slashed its cost of sales and general and administrative expenses to $482.8 million, from $572.3 million, year over year. A big portion of that came from reductions in ad spending. Other cuts in 2006 included the elimination of 514 jobs. \u001d  RadioShack's balance sheet is substantially stronger for the changes. Its cash balance was $472 million at the end of 2006, up from $224 million a year earlier, against slimmer long-term debt of $345.8 million. As a result, it has a cushion if the economy slows; it should still be able to make the investments needed to grow. \u001d  Bulls say that Day has other levers to pull. \"There is a tremendous amount of room to cut, and this is what people are missing,\" asserts Dennis Bryan, a partner and portfolio manager at First Pacific Advisors, which owns about three million shares. He says that additional layoffs are possible at corporate headquarters and in the company's field operations (but not at its stores). Eaton Vance analyst David Jenkins believes that fatter operating margins of around 5.5% last year should continue to improve, boosting profits. At the end of 2006, Eaton Vance held about 500,000 shares. \u001d  By Bryan's reckoning, RadioShack can boost its operating margins to around 10%. With just a small gain in sales to $5 billion from last year's $4.8 billion, that would mean $500 million of operating profit. After taxes, that would amount to $320 million, or $2.35 a share. Apply a conservative multiple of 15, and the stock's at 35.25, up more than 30%. \u001d  The financial improvements give Day more wherewithal to attack the product problem. \"There is a lot of brand equity still sitting in RadioShack, with the right vision and leadership,\" says Wade Fenn, founding partner of Retail-Masters, a consulting firm in Minnesota. \u001d  But to realize this potential, Day must offset declines in RadioShack's wireless business, a crucial profit center whose revenue, 35% of the company's total, fell in 2006. Cellphone carriers like Verizon (VZ) and AT&T 's (T) Cingular have opened their own retail outlets, and the industry is maturing. Another worry: Best Buy recently announced that it is opening more stores devoted to cellphones. At the same time, cell users increasingly are signing up for prepaid plans, in which they buy minutes in advance, rather than getting billed after usage. Wal-Mart and Target (RadioShack also offers them) are pushing these plans, which are thought to be less profitable. \u001d  RadioShack is trying to counter the cellphone shortfall with everything from iPods to flat-screen TVs. Accessories like batteries and cables that plug into home entertainment systems are vital (23% of sales) to its business, as are traditional landline phones, digital cameras, satellite radios, digital-music players, DVD players and home-satellite TV systems. \u001d  Retailing consultant Fenn says that RadioShack should focus on new niches where its sales staff can \"do something complex\" for customers, as they did in setting up wireless and satellite TV accounts for buyers before the growth trajectory of those businesses flattened. \u001d  Bryan believes that RadioShack \"has the ability to sell\" a hand-held device like a cellphone that incorporates broadcast TV, which is expected to become available in the U.S. in a year or two. (Despite selling iPods, RadioShack won't handle Apple's much-anticipated iPhone, due out in June.) \u001d  Day has vowed to make the company a better merchandiser by improving field support for stores and introducing different price schedules for certain items in different markets. He's also mentioned improving the shopping experience for customers. \u001d  RadioShack has advantages over its rivals that eventually could help the top line. It has about 4,470 company-operated stores (even after closing 505 last year), along with roughly 770 kiosks, mainly in Sam's Club locations and Sprint Nextel outlets in major malls. Circuit City, in contrast, has just 659 U.S. stores. \u001d  \"They reach people where the Best Buys and Circuit Cities just don't reach,\" says Douglas Asiello, a senior equity analyst at AIM Capital Management who thinks the stock can hit 35 in 18 months. \u001d  A bet on RadioShack is a wager that Day's operating and merchandising expertise pays off for a retailer that's suffered from years of strategy and management shifts. His predecessor was forced to resign after newspaper revelations about inconsistencies on his resume. Day isn't the typical consumer sales chief. \"He's very quiet; he's not a rah-rah, let's go out and get 'em kind of a guy,\" says Bryan. \"But he's very persuasive, very articulate and super intelligent.\" Shareholders hope that's the right mix for RadioShack. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4f3ae765756b08ec59495167906df3b9","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Volkswagen, Lower Saxony Welcome Porsche Raising Stake VW","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T14:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Germany's state of Lower Saxony and Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) Saturday welcomed news that sports car maker Porsche AG (POR3.XE) intends to raise its stake in Volkswagen to 31% from the current 27.3%. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 10:20 ET (14:20 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4ff86902f88f4b003bb4ba95c2ee61c6","symR":["HYC","JAS","LANC","MANA","NVL","NVL.T","QCCO","TLC.T","TLCV","WBSN","WLDA","WWVY","CA67000X1069","CA8725491002"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) 13D Filings: Investors Report To The SEC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HYC","JAS","LANC","MANA","NVL","NVL.T","QCCO","TLC.T","TLCV","WBSN","WLDA","WWVY","CA67000X1069","CA8725491002"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","ALU","CFN","CPR","FOD","FTS","HEA","OFP","OTS","RTS","SOF","TLS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XTSE"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \u001d  13Ds are supposed to be filed within 10 days of an entity's attaining more than 5% of any class of a company's securities.

Morin is trying to fend off two minority holders -- Pardus Capital Management and Guy Wyser-Pratte --  with diametricallyopposed views on creating value at Valeo. Pardus wants Valeo to buy Visteon (VC), Ford's former and ailing parts unit, to become a top global auto-sector supplier. Wyser-Pratte advocates slimming Valeo down to its higher-margin activities, no doubt to create a smaller, cash-generating business ideal for a leveraged buyout. \u001d  Morin insists that Valeo should steer a middle path, making bolt-on acquisitions in the U.S. where it can -- whether they're bits of Visteon or not -- as it whittles away at its lower-margin operations, with the aim of doubling its operating profit margin to more than 6% by 2010. \u001d  Valeo was headed for a crucial annual meeting in May, at which most of its directors, including Morin, will be up for reelection, when talk emerged Thursday that Apollo Investment, a U.S. private-equity fund, is mulling a takeover attempt. \u001d  Morin is in a fairly strong position because he has transformed Valeo in the past five years. Debt is down, quality indicators are up, and he's narrowed the company's business focus, diversified its customer base and moved production to lower-cost countries. \u001d  He'd be in a stronger position if Valeo didn't still have 13 product families, many of which are struggling to break even. The company remains heavily reliant on Europe's oversupplied car market, which was responsible for 69% of its revenue in 2006, compared with 66% in 2002. Deutsche Bank reckons that 35% of Valeo's business has a 6% Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) margin; 40%, a 3.5% margin and the rest, zero. Hence the lure of the breakup scenarios Morin is having to fight off. \u001d  Valeo's emphasis on R&D hasn't paid off yet, in sales growth, profitability or greater free cash flow, even if it has innovative products in the pipeline. The auto-parts sector is among the worst to be in. There's little sign of a letup in pricing pressures. And Morin's bet on taking Valeo into technologically more complex segments like transmissions and niches like electronic parking systems is surely the right way to ratchet margins higher, long-term. \u001d  Avoiding Visteon's labor-relations and financial baggage in favor of a more selective approach to U.S. assets looks like a less risky way to boost sales in North America, just as suppliers are starting to turn the tables on their customers. Refusals by Navistar (NAVZ) and Collins & Aikman to supply Ford (F) in disputes over pricing are a sign of that. But even though Valeo is to French auto components as Peugeot-Citroen is to French car-making, national pride is unlikely to come to Morin's rescue if he isn't more ruthless in ditching underperforming assets. \u001d  --- \u001d  Matthew Curtin is a contributor to The Skeptic, a Dow Jones Newswires column upon which this European Trader is based. \u001d  --- \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"62525a62954ff1b69b25296ee9b2a2cb","symR":["ABT","US0028241000"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Abbott's XIENCE(TM) V Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent Superior to TAXUS(R) Stent in SPIRIT III U.S. Pivotal Clinical Trial","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T16:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABT","US0028241000"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"- XIENCE V Demonstrates Superiority in Primary Endpoint of In-Segment Late Loss, Non-Inferiority in Major Secondary Endpoint of Target Vessel Failure and Superiority in Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) in the SPIRIT III U.S. Trial - - Data Show Continued Safety and One-Year MACE Superiority for XIENCE V Compared to TAXUS as SPIRIT II International Trial Reaches One Year - \b \b \u001d  ABBOTT PARK, Ill., March 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Data presented today from Abbott's SPIRIT III U.S. pivotal clinical trial at the American College of Cardiology's 56th Annual Scientific Session in New Orleans demonstrated the following key results: \b \b \b    --  The randomized SPIRIT III trial of 1,002 patients comparing Abbott's \b        next-generation XIENCE(TM) V Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System \b        with the TAXUS(R) paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system met both \b        its primary endpoint and major secondary endpoint. \b    --  In its primary endpoint of in-segment late loss at eight months, \b        XIENCE V demonstrated superiority to TAXUS with a statistically \b        significant 50 percent reduction in late loss compared to TAXUS (0.14 \b        +/- 0.41 mm XIENCE V, 0.28 +/- 0.48 mm TAXUS, p superior =0.004). \b        In-segment late loss is a measure of vessel renarrowing. \b    --  In its major secondary endpoint of Target Vessel Failure at nine \b        months, XIENCE V demonstrated non-inferiority to TAXUS with an \b        observed 21 percent reduction in Target Vessel Failure for XIENCE V \b        compared to TAXUS (7.2 percent XIENCE V, 9.0 percent TAXUS, p non- \b        inferior <0.0001).  Target Vessel Failure is a measure of re-treatment \b        anywhere within the target vessel and includes cardiac death or heart \b        attack. \b    --  Subsequent to SPIRIT III meeting its primary and major secondary \b        endpoints, an analysis of nine-month Major Adverse Cardiac Events \b        (MACE), such as cardiac death, heart attack or target lesion \b        revascularization (artery re-treatment due to lack of blood supply), \b        was undertaken in which XIENCE V demonstrated superiority to TAXUS \b        with a statistically significant 44 percent reduction in MACE at nine \b        months compared to TAXUS (4.6 percent XIENCE V, 8.1 percent TAXUS, p \b        superior =0.028). \b \b \b \u001d  \"Not only did the SPIRIT III trial meet its primary and major secondary endpoints, but it showed a statistically significant reduction in major adverse cardiac events, favoring XIENCE V,\" said Gregg W. Stone, M.D., of Columbia University Medical Center and the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, New York, principal investigator of the SPIRIT III clinical trial, who presented the results today.  \"The enhanced freedom from adverse events with XIENCE V, coupled with its low profile, makes the XIENCE V stent an important advance for patients with coronary artery disease.\" \b \u001d  One-Year SPIRIT II European Clinical Trial Results Demonstrate Continued Safety with XIENCE V; Zero Late Stent Thrombosis in SPIRIT FIRST and SPIRIT II Under New ARC Definition \b \u001d  In the important clinical endpoint of MACE, one-year follow-up results from 300 patients enrolled in Abbott's randomized SPIRIT II European clinical trial demonstrated superiority for XIENCE V compared to TAXUS in an additional analysis with a statistically significant 71 percent reduction in major adverse cardiac events for XIENCE V-treated patients compared to TAXUS-treated patients (2.7 percent XIENCE V, 9.2 percent TAXUS, p superior =0.04).  These data are available in an online poster session to registrants of the American College of Cardiology's 56th Annual Scientific Session. \b \u001d  Under the new Dublin/Academic Research Consortium (ARC) definition of late-stent thrombosis (blood clotting events in stents), which was developed to eliminate variability in the definitions across various drug-eluting stent trials, the late stent thrombosis rate with XIENCE V in the SPIRIT II trial out to one year was zero percent for XIENCE V (0/220 patients treated with XIENCE V) and 1.3 percent for TAXUS (1/76 patients treated with TAXUS).  The number of late stent thromboses in the SPIRIT FIRST trial, which compared XIENCE V to the MULTI-LINK VISION(R) metallic stent, remained zero for patients receiving XIENCE V out to two years of clinical follow-up. \b \u001d  \"The statistically significant reduction in major adverse cardiac events that we see in patients treated with XIENCE V in our SPIRIT III U.S. trial is consistent with the reduced MACE rates reported today from our SPIRIT II European trial,\" said John M. Capek, Ph.D., senior vice president, Abbott Vascular.  \"Across both of these trials, the risk of cardiac death, heart attack or re-treatment in the diseased artery area in patients was approximately two to three times lower with XIENCE V than with TAXUS.\" \b \b    About XIENCE V \b \u001d  The XIENCE V system utilizes everolimus, which has been shown to reduce tissue proliferation in the coronary vessels following stent implantation, and is based upon the highly deliverable and proven MULTI-LINK VISION coronary stent platform. \b \u001d  XIENCE V was launched in Europe and Asia Pacific in 2006.  XIENCE V is currently an investigational device in the United States and Japan.  Results from the SPIRIT III trial are intended to support U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the XIENCE V Stent System and Ministry of Health and Welfare approval in Japan.  Abbott expects to submit XIENCE V for U.S. FDA approval in the second quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  Abbott supplies a private-label version of XIENCE V, called the PROMUS(TM) Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System, to Boston Scientific as part of a distribution agreement established between the two companies last year. \b \b    About the SPIRIT Family of Trials \b \u001d  SPIRIT FIRST was a first-in-man study comparing the XIENCE V Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System with the MULTI-LINK VISION bare metallic stent system.  SPIRIT FIRST demonstrated positive results with one MACE event at one year and no additional MACE events out to two years.  SPIRIT II is a 300- patient randomized, single-blind, prospective clinical trial evaluating XIENCE V versus TAXUS in Europe and Asia Pacific.  SPIRIT III is a large-scale pivotal clinical trial comparing XIENCE V to TAXUS in the United States and Japan.  SPIRIT IV is currently enrolling patients and will evaluate the safety and efficacy of XIENCE V for the treatment of coronary artery disease in a more complex patient population in the United States.  SPIRIT V is an international clinical trial that will provide additional clinical experience with XIENCE V in approximately 3,000 patients at 100 clinical sites throughout Europe, Asia, Canada and Latin America.  SPIRIT WOMEN is the world's first drug-eluting stent trial to study only women and will evaluate the characteristics of women undergoing stent implantation as well as the performance of XIENCE V in those patients in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America. \b \u001d  For images of Abbott's XIENCE V stent and other information, please visit the company's online ACC newsroom at http://www.abbottvascular.com/ACCpresskit . \b \b    About Abbott Vascular \b \u001d  Abbott Vascular, a division of Abbott, is one of the world's leading vascular care businesses.

Rose calls it a \"travel agent for freight.\" For investors, it's been a ticket to riches. \u001d  -- A.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  Steven Roth \u001d  Vornado Realty, CEO since '80 \u001d  Why: He may take Manhattan \b \u001d  The normally low-profile Roth grabbed headlines in January when Vornado made a failed 11th-hour bid to buy Equity Office Properties, the giant office REIT that eventually went to Blackstone Group. Roth showed customary financial restraint in backing out when he felt the price for EOP got too high. \u001d  Sound judgment has come in handy for Roth during two decades of building one of Manhattan's biggest commercial real-estate empires. Vornado is now one of the most powerful companies in the hot sector of real-estate investment trusts. \u001d  Reflecting Roth's value orientation, Vornado's Manhattan properties are concentrated around Penn Station, one of the least desirable parts of Midtown. Roth is betting on a transformation of the area, which includes Madison Square Garden. \u001d  Roth wishes he had bought more properties in recent years, given the price run-ups. With Vornado sitting on a sizable cash pile, it may only be a matter of time before he finds a big deal to like. \u001d  -- A.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  James Schiro \u001d  Zurich Financial, CEO since '02 \u001d  Why: Repairing a Swiss miss \b \u001d  Call him the Transformer. In mid-2002, James J. Schiro took charge of big Zurich Financial Services during the market equivalent of a category-five hurricane. Shares of Europe's insurers were at multi-year lows in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In addition, low interest rates and plunging stock prices were taking a big toll on insurers' investment income. \u001d  Schiro moved decisively and dramatically. He refocused on core markets and products, dropping businesses that weren't meeting hurdle rates. He also repaired a sagging corporate balance sheet, instilled financial discipline, centralized processes and boosted profitability. \u001d  In fact, the U.S.-born CEO's efforts took the company from a loss of $3.4 billion to a profit of $4.5 billion last year. The stock has returned some 280% since the lows of 2003. \u001d  With operations in Europe and North America, Schiro's Zurich is now pushing into new regions like Russia and launching products like pay-as-you drive insurance. The travels are sure to be rewarding. \u001d  -- V.J.R. \u001d  --- \u001d  Bob Simpson \u001d  XTO Energy, CEO since '86 \u001d  Why: Hitting a gusher of his own \b \u001d  In the past year, Simpson has solidified his company's position as the country's best-managed independent oil and gas producer. XTO's proven reserves grew 12% in 2006 to the equivalent of 1.4 billion barrels of oil and its finding costs were half the industry average. \u001d  Simpson does it his own way. In an industry populated by oilmen with Texas-size egos, he is a deliberate, former accountant. He focuses his drilling in the supposedly mature continental U.S., leaving risky projects in the Gulf of Mexico and abroad to competitors seeking elusive, giant fields. Says he: \"Oil and gas is best found where the best oil and gas has already been found.\" \u001d  The investment community is warming to all this. The stock is up 28% in the past 12 months, beating the shares of Devon Energy, Apache, Anadarko and others. Though XTO probably would fetch a nice price in a takeover, shareholders are in no hurry to see a sale because the 58-year-old Simpson continues to build value. XTO's stock is up nearly 50-fold since XTO went public in 1993, to a market value of $20 billion. \u001d  -- A.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  James Sinegal \u001d  Costco Wholesale, CEO since '88 \u001d  Why: Low prices, high profits and happy workers \b \u001d  Sinegal has demonstrated that good treatment of customers and employees is good for shareholders. The 26 million consumers who shop at his discount chain know they will always find bargains -- no product is marked up more than 15% above cost. And Costco's 93,000 domestic employees know they'll get generous pay and health benefits compared with their counterparts at Wal-Mart. Costco picks up 90% of the health tab. \u001d  The twin focus on shoppers and workers is pure Sinegal. He co-founded the company and repeatedly turns aside entreaties from Wall Street to boost profit margins by raising prices. Sinegal, 71, sets an example by taking a modest salary of $350,000 before options, staying in modestly priced hotels and putting in 15-hour days to meet an ambitious goal of visiting all 506 stores twice a year. \"Jim would be on any intelligent list of the top 10 retailers of the past century,\" says Charlie Munger, a Costco director who's better known as Warren Buffett's long-time partner at Berkshire Hathaway. \u001d  -- A.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  Fred Smith \u001d  FedEx, CEO since '71 \u001d  Why: An overnight sensation delivers the goods in China \b \u001d  As one of the great entrepreneurs in American history, Smith pioneered the overnight package delivery business in the 1970s, expanding on an idea he developed as a student at Yale. \u001d  He went on to make FedEx a strong competitor to United Parcel Service and the post office in ground package deliveries. And he anticipated China's economic potential more than two decades ago. FedEx, now the leading international express carrier in China, said last week it will soon inaugurate next-day domestic express service servicing 19 Chinese cities. \u001d  Not all of Smith's initiatives have been successful. In 2004, he paid $2.4 billion for Kinko's, the chain of copier stores whose performance has been poor. But FedEx profits have tripled in the past five years, and Smith usually makes the right moves. One of his latest: cancelling orders for Airbus 380 freighters soon after the company acknowledged production delays. UPS waited until March. \u001d  -- A.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  Ratan Tata \u001d  Tata Sons, CEO since '91 \u001d  Why: Riding the elephant \b \u001d  Ratan Tata, 69, is the face of India Inc., overseeing an empire that includes everything from fine tea to IT. As chairman of Tata Steel -- just one of his roles -- he recently drove the firm's $12 billion purchase of Corus, an Anglo-Dutch producer four times its size, creating the world's fifth-largest steelmaker. He also chairs Tata Tea, Tata Motors, and IT services behemoth Tata Consultancy. He chairs the executive committee of Mumbai's Tata Sons, which owns big stakes in all these firms and sets the group's overall strategy. \u001d  Ratan Tata worked at a blast furnace at Tata Steel at the age of 26, studied architecture at Cornell and management at Harvard, and became chairman of the group in 1991, 150 years after it was founded by an ancestor. India then was emerging from socialism, and Tata was a sprawling network of 250 companies, many doing poorly. He chopped that to 96 and took Tata Consultancy public. Those shares are up 50% since. Not content to operate only in India,he's challenging managers to expand overseas. \u001d  -- L.P.N. \u001d  --- \u001d  Jong-Yong Yun \u001d  Samsung Electronics, CEO since '96 \u001d  Why: Climbing to the top of the world, one gadget at a time \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6ce96842c078bcc7993f9922ea507901","symR":["005930.SE","12064.FR","500470.BY","7974.OK","AAPL","AXP","BLK","BRKA","BRKB","CFC","COH","COST","DA","DISH","EXPD","FDX","GE","LEH","MBL.AU","MT","MT.AE","NTDOY","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","PG","RBS.LN","RYA.DB","RYAAY","SAP","SAP.XE","TSCDY","TSCO.LN","UTX","VNO","WFC","WFMI","XTO","ZFSVY","ZURN.VX","AU000000MBL3","AU000000NWS2","CH0011075394","DE0007164600","FR0000120644","GB0007547838","GB0008847096","IE00B1GKF381","INE081A01012","JP3756600007","KR7005930003","NL0000361947","US0258161092","US0378331005","US22160K1051","US3021301094","US31428X1063","US3696041033","US5249081002","US7427181091","US9130171096","US9497461015"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) The World's Best CEOs -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["005930.SE","12064.FR","500470.BY","7974.OK","AAPL","AXP","BLK","BRKA","BRKB","CFC","COH","COST","DA","DISH","EXPD","FDX","GE","LEH","MBL.AU","MT","MT.AE","NTDOY","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","PG","RBS.LN","RYA.DB","RYAAY","SAP","SAP.XE","TSCDY","TSCO.LN","UTX","VNO","WFC","WFMI","XTO","ZFSVY","ZURN.VX","AU000000MBL3","AU000000NWS2","CH0011075394","DE0007164600","FR0000120644","GB0007547838","GB0008847096","IE00B1GKF381","INE081A01012","JP3756600007","KR7005930003","NL0000361947","US0258161092","US0378331005","US22160K1051","US3021301094","US31428X1063","US3696041033","US5249081002","US7427181091","US9130171096","US9497461015"],"IndustryCodes":["AIF","AIR","AMG","ARO","ASP","BNK","BRD","CFN","CLO","CPR","ENT","FDR","FOD","HPN","HPR","IDD","INF","INS","INU","MED","MFN","OFP","OIS","PUB","REA","REI","RTB","RTS","SCR","SEM","SOF","STL","TEX","TMF","XAEX","XATI","XCA4","XDAX","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XORD","XRUS","XSMI","XSP5","XST5","XSTF","XSTX"],"Story":"\u001d  Kagermann's return engagement on our list almost marked his last hurrah. The charming, understated CEO was expected to retire at the end of this year, but his contract has just been extended, meaning he'll run the world's largest business-software company through May of 2009. That's good for SAP: He ably led the German giant through the post-bubble doldrums and took advantage of the disruptions caused by Oracle's takeover of PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and others. \u001d  Now that Oracle's consolidation strategy is bearing fruit, Kagermann may have to reconsider his staunch aversion to big deals and do some shopping of its own. And, while Web-based upstarts like Salesforce.com are making serious inroads in corporate software services, SAP's own attempts to develop such products have been lackluster. Our guess: Kagermann will rise to the occasion and fully earn his gold watch. \u001d  -- M.V. \u001d  --- \u001d  Richard Kovacevich \u001d  Wells Fargo, CEO since '98 \u001d  Why: King of the cross-sell. \b \u001d  In an industry with more than its share of ups and downs, Kovacevich has made Wells Fargo a paragon of predictability. The San Francisco-based banking giant has increased its earnings at an annualized 12% over the past five years and shows little sign of slowing. \u001d  Kovacevich (pronounced Koe-VAH-suh-vich) shuns the big acquisitions fashionable among other banks, preferring to grow organically. Nor is he keen on massive share repurchases, opting instead to husband capital for expansion. \u001d  His main mantra is cross-selling. He wants to cement relationships with customers by offering multiple banking products -- deposits, credit cards, home mortgages, auto loans. The average retail customer has over five products from Wells, far above the industry norm. \u001d  True, Wells could get dinged in the subprime mortgage mess; it's a big originator of the loans. But as Wells points out, it's also a careful originator. Ultimately, the crisis may be a boon for Kovacevich, thinning out weak rivals. \u001d  -- A.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  A.G. Lafley \u001d  Procter & Gamble, CEO since '00 \u001d  Why: Hasn't let bigger get in the way of better \b \u001d  Lafley says he's a big believer in keeping one's word, and he is doing just that as he approaches the second anniversary of his $57-billion merger of consumer products giants Procter & Gamble and Gillette. \u001d  Lafley, 59, has made good on a promise to trim $1 billion-plus annually from the new P&G. He has also presided over some big marketing splashes. With the introduction of such winners as the Gillette Fusion razor and Tide with Febreze \"freshness,\" P&G was responsible for five of 2006's top 10 new packaged goods for consumers, in the view of market researcher IRI. Such new products have helped the company post solid, organic sales growth of 5%-7%, despite the headwinds of higher commodity and and energy costs. \u001d  Lafley is now pushing hard into Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa. But for all his products and markets, his vision is strikingly simple: to be \"one team with one dream.\" For investors, whose holdings already have nearly doubled in Lafley's tenure, it's a sweet dream. \u001d  -- Robin Goldwyn Blumenthal \u001d  --- \u001d  Terry Leahy \u001d  Tesco, CEO since '97 \u001d  Why: Best-of-breed grocer with global ambitions \b \u001d  If there's no greater flattery than the attentions of Warren Buffett, Tesco, the big British supermarket chain, had ample reason to blush earlier this year. The Oracle of Omaha revealed that his Berkshire Hathaway had acquired a stake of nearly 3%. \u001d  It's easy to see why. CEO Terry Leahy has Tesco expanding its best-in-class operations around the world. Unlike most retailers, it has not only managed to defend itself against U.S. giant Wal-Mart on its home turf in the U.K., but has thrived there. One of every three British pounds goes through Tesco's cash registers. Now, Leahy is about to execute a long-planned invasion of Wal-Mart's backyard, opening stores in Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas and Phoenix. He's also expanded into China and Turkey. \u001d  Leahy always has taken Tesco's founding credo to heart: \"Pile it high and sell it cheap.\" Profits, too, have piled up, helping investors reap returns of 400% over Leahy's tenure. Investors' smiles may soon be greeted by the frowns of U.S. grocery store owners. \u001d  -- V.J.R. \u001d  --- \u001d  John Mackey \u001d  Whole Foods, CEO since '80 \u001d  Why: Capturing the growth potential in natural food \b \u001d  Mackey likes his job so much that he decided earlier this year to eliminate virtually all of his compensation. For $1 a year, he's adroitly guiding the pioneer of natural and organic grocery stores into a new era of growth and competition. \u001d  With everyone from Wal-Mart to Safeway muscling in on natural foods, Mackey is fighting back by offering a \"whole lifestyle\" -- prepared gourmet meals, linens, music and food supplements. He continues to expand the 190-store chain and has inked a smart deal to buy smaller rival Wild Oats. \u001d  Wall Street has pounded the stock by 25% over the past year, but don't sell Mackey, 53, short. His insights allowed him to build the business he created in 1980. Not only was he early to natural foods but he was among the first to see the promise in \"foodies,\" those affluent, well-educated people who crave good eats. \u001d  In giving up his pay, Mackey said Whole Foods already has given him more money than he ever dreamed of. With any luck, investors may soon be able to say the same. \u001d  -- R.G.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  Lakshmi Mittal \u001d  Arcelor Mittal, CEO since '76 \u001d  Why: Forging a global steel empire \b \u001d  Want to know how India became a leading incubator of multinationals? Read the story of Lakshmi Mittal. The 56-year-old tycoon took over Arcelor last year for 26.9 billion euros ($35.8 billion), creating the world's largest steel company and greatly expanding an empire he started in the 1970s. \u001d  Mittal, long a producer of low-cost steel, was an early advocate of industry consolidation and bought downtrodden plants in Mexico and Kazakhstan. Then, when the world began demanding more steel, Mittal was off to the races. \u001d  Today, he owns 44% of the Rotterdam-based company, which has annual sales of about $89 billion and produces 120 million tons of steel a year, or about 10% of global production. With a personal fortune estimated at $32 billion -- Arcelor Mittal, after all, is busy returning cash to shareholders by paying out a big dividend and repurchasing shares -- Mittal is now investing in Indian refineries and scouting for energy assets overseas. \u001d  -- L.P.N. \u001d  --- \u001d  Allan Moss \u001d  Macquarie, CEO since '93 \u001d  Why: The venturesome spirit to follow the open road \b \u001d  No one will begrudge Moss if he becomes Australia's best-paid executive in 2007. For the year ending March, his firm, Australia's biggest investment bank, is set to post its 15th consecutive year of profit -- A$1.3 billion, up more than 50% from last year. \u001d  Under the 14-year reign of the mild-mannered banker, Macquarie has snatched up tollroads, airports, and trophy properties around the world, on the theory -- correct, as it turned out -- that steady-return infrastructure investments will meld perfectly with pension funds' long-dated obligations. \u001d  Macquarie, which controls the Indiana Tollroad and the Chicago Skyway, is said to be eyeing the New Jersey Turnpike as well as a range of other assets. It's at the forefront of a trend that saw some $150 billion of infrastructure assets change hands last year. That activity can be intensely lucrative: When Macquarie advises a privatization, it can provide financing to a buyer or perhaps lease the asset itself. Running a tollbooth has never been so much fun. \u001d  -- L.P.N. \u001d  --- \u001d  Angelo Mozilo \u001d  Countrywide Financial, CEO since '98 \u001d  Why: Mortgage Master \b \u001d  Mortgage lending may look easy, but as many a troubled subprime lender can now attest, it's not easy to do it well. \u001d  Mozilo co-founded Countrywide in 1969 and eventually made it America's biggest writer of home loans. In the process, Countrywide also became one of the top loan providers to people with damaged credit. \u001d  Now, Wall Street is understandably concerned, given the wreckage in the $1 trillion subprime market. Countrywide shares have fallen to 36 from a 2006 peak of 44. But Mozilo, 68, argues his subprime exposure is manageable, and there's good reason to believe him: He's a straight talker with a strong grasp of his markets. Since 2000, he boosted his share of the mortgage market to 16% from 6%, diversified deeply into non-mortgage financial businesses, and grew profits by a factor of five. \u001d  His pay -- about $23 million in 2005 -- is hardly subprime. It's arguably too high. Then again, his investors aren't doing too shabbily: The stock is up four-fold in seven years. \u001d  -- A.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  Rupert Murdoch \u001d  News Corp., CEO since '53 \u001d  Why: The old lion gets wired \b \u001d  Always controversial, Murdoch has survived long enough in the white-hot, competitive world of global media to suddenly become respectable. \u001d  His company's Fox broadcast network, a conglomerate he put together in the face of much derision, is now garnering top ad dollars by virtue of hit shows like American Idol and 24. Fox News controls the cable-news universe. At the start it had to pay for its cable carriage but no more. Cable companies now have to pay up for this dominant outlet. The Fox movie studio is also thriving from new releases and DVD sales. \u001d  And no media boss has done better negotiating the change from print to cable and the Internet.

(SGP) drug reduced heart attacks and other cardiovascular events when it was added to standard drug therapy used during a type of heart procedure, a new study found. \u001d  The mid-stage study's primary goal wasn't to demonstrate the compound's effectiveness, and the reduction in cardiovascular events wasn't statistically significant. Thus, a further study of SCH 530348 will be needed to confirm the finding, researchers said. Schering-Plough plans to begin a large, late-stage trial later this year. \u001d  The patient trial did meet its primary goal of demonstrating no increase in bleeding, according to results presented Saturday at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology. \u001d  Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, N.J., is studying SCH 530348 as a potential drug to prevent and treat blood clots in people with cardiovascular disease. The company also thinks the compound has the potential to decrease the risk of bleeding, which is associated with some current anti-clotting therapies. \u001d  If SCH 530348 makes it to market, it would compete with Plavix, the blockbuster anti-clotting drug co-marketed by Sanofi-Aventis (SNY) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY). Also, Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) is developing its own experimental anti-clotting drug. \u001d  The trial of SCH 530348 in 1,030 patients was designed to evaluate its safety and tolerability in patients undergoing a certain procedure designed to prop open arteries, most often to insert a stent device. So-called antiplatelet therapy including Plavix and aspirin is used during such procedures to avoid blood clots, which can be deadly. \u001d  The study found a 46% reduction in cardiovascular events at the highest dose of SCH 530348 tested, when compared to standard of care. But the reduction wasn't statistically significant, which means it could have been due to chance. \u001d  The study found a lower incidence of bleeding in SCH 530348 users than in those who didn't use it. \u001d  The study was funded by Schering-Plough; its lead author has served as a consultant to Schering-Plough. \b \u001d  -Peter Loftus, Dow Jones Newswires; 215-656-8289; peter.loftus@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 15:43 ET (19:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"84c37392e002a58105eb20dc921a1140","symR":["AAPL","AMD","AXP","BRCM","CROX","DELL","INTC","JAKK","MA","NOK","NOK1V.HE","QCOM","SHW","THQI","WWE","FI0009000681","US0079031078","US0258161092","US0378331005","US1113201073","US2470251099","US4581401001","US7475251036"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) Long Arm Of The Law","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAPL","AMD","AXP","BRCM","CROX","DELL","INTC","JAKK","MA","NOK","NOK1V.HE","QCOM","SHW","THQI","WWE","FI0009000681","US0079031078","US0258161092","US0378331005","US1113201073","US2470251099","US4581401001","US7475251036"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","CFN","CMT","CPR","ENT","FOT","RCS","SEM","TEX","TMF","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XHEX","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XST5","XSTF","XSTX","XSXA"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Neil A. Martin \u001d  Shares of World Wrestling Entertainment have been smacked down 13.4% in the past 10 months, to 15.60, as some of the company's television superstars, including \"The Rock,\" have defected to Hollywood. But better days could lie ahead for the Stamford, Conn., provider of wrestling-related products and entertainment (ticker: WWE), especially if it wins several lawsuits filed in recent years against licensees it alleges have illegally acquired the rights to its name and franchise. \u001d  Though World Wrestling has mentioned these suits -- against videogame-software publisher THQI (THQI) and a joint venture controlled by THQI and toy maker Jakks Pacific (JAKK) -- in its regulatory filings, you won't hear much about them on the company's quarterly conference calls. That's all the more reason for investors to turn to Nick Rodelli, an analyst at the Center for Financial Research and Analysis and head of the forensic-accounting firm's new Legal Edge research service. Rodelli, who joined CFRA last fall, specializes in dissecting legal \"events\" likely to influence companies' earnings and shares. \u001d  \"Litigation has always been out there, but in the wake of Sarbanes-Oxley, legal issues have become more prevalent,\" says Rodelli, 34, a former corporate litigator, Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer and legal analyst for a hedge fund. \"More often than not, the shares of companies with outstanding legal issues are mispriced because they fail to reflect the potential negative or positive impact of recurring issues. Awareness of mispricing can be the difference between profit and loss for an investor.\" \u001d  For World Wrestling, which derived almost a fourth of its 2006 revenue from licensing, a win in court \"could provide a significant, recurring boost to financial results, specifically a 14% to 22% increase in earnings before interest and taxes. \u001d  An indication that things are moving in the right direction for the plaintiff could come within a few months if the company succeeds in defeating a pending motion to dismiss its federal racketeering suit against the THQI-Jakks joint venture. \"Such an event may provide the catalyst for investors to begin reassessing World Wrestling's earnings power, based on expectations of a higher royalty-income stream from WWE-branded videogame sales,\" Rodelli observes. \u001d  CFRA was founded in 1994 by Howard Schilit, a former accounting professor at American University, and quickly attracted a faithful following on Wall Street by spotlighting questionable accounting and bookkeeping practices at publicly traded corporations. \u001d  Short sellers, in particular, came to rely on the firm's research, which helped expose problems at New Century Financial (NEWC), Delphi (DFG), Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (KKD) and Shuffle Master (SHFL), among others. In an admiring profile two years ago, Barron's called CFRA \"one of the true leaders in forensic accounting\" (\"Super Sleuths,\" Feb. 28, 2005). \u001d  The legal issues affecting corporations have multiplied in recent years, in part because of greater regulation, more attention to corporate governance and the growing importance of technology in numerous businesses. Yet the risks and opportunities inherent in legal decisions are even less understood by equity analysts and investors than accounting issues. \u001d  \"We try to provide a real-time perspective on emerging legal and regulatory events,\" says Richard Leggett, who succeeded Schilit in 2005 as president and CEO of CFRA. Schilit sold his controlling interest in the Rockville, Md., firm in 2003 to the venture-finance firm TA Associates, but he remains an adviser to the company. \u001d  Consider MasterCard (MA), the Purchase, N.Y.-based credit-card issuer, which faces not only antitrust suits brought by American Express (AXP) and Discover, seeking billions of dollars in damages, but regulatory efforts to reduce fees and encourage more competition. In Rodelli's view, none of the risks associated with these issues is reflected in MasterCard's shares, which have almost tripled since the company came public last May and now trade for 108, or 22.5 times consensus 2007 estimates. \b \u001d  \"The market has been mesmerized by the great numbers posted by MasterCard since it went public, but is ignoring the greater threat to its operations from current legal risks,\" he says. \u001d  Rodelli expects these risks to gain more attention in coming months as the antitrust suits move toward trial and regulatory scrutiny of the company's fee structure heats up. Not only could damages be in the \"tens of billions of dollars,\" he says, but \"the market fails to appreciate the strategic interest of both American Express and Discover in using their strong antitrust claims to gain long-term advantages in the marketplace, as opposed to a one-time settlement payout.\" \u001d  If MasterCard appears to be the loser, American Express conceivably will benefit from the litigation, which focuses on the so-called exclusionary rule by which MasterCard effectively sought to prevent banks that issue its card from issuing AmEx or Discover cards. (The Department of Justice challenged this rule and won; the American Express and Discover lawsuits piggybacked off the DOJ action.) \u001d  Consequently, the two stocks might make for \"an excellent pair trade,\" says Rodelli, with an investor buying American Express at 16.5 times '07 estimates, and shorting MasterCard. (Shares of MasterCard have fallen about 2% since CFRA issued its first report Feb. 1, while American Express is roughly flat.) \u001d  Paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW) also faces potentially significant risks from litigation, says Rodelli. The threat to Sherwin-Williams comes from a recent ruling by a Rhode Island state judge, upholding a jury verdict that found the Cleveland company guilty of creating a \"public nuisance\" and health threat with its lead paint products, sold many decades ago. \u001d  The court also is demanding a statewide cleanup. Although Sherwin-Williams has said that it will appeal the ruling, other cases against it are pending in Ohio, New Jersey, Wisconsin and California, prompting fear that lead paint could become \"the next asbestos.\" \u001d  The company's shares have held up well in the face of legal threats and decisions, and its operating performance has been strong. Sherwin-Williams has rallied more than 52% since mid-July, to 67, and currently trades for 13.5 times Wall Street's 2008 earnings estimate of $4.98 a share. \u001d  The company's valuation \"doesn't reflect the significant risk,\" insists Rodelli. If law firms begin to see lead-paint litigation as \"an attractive return on investment,\" he adds, today's trickle of cases could turn into a torrent. \b \u001d  Just as investors ignore legal risk, they sometimes overreact to litigation and miss potential opportunities in mispriced stocks. That may be happening with Qualcomm (QCOM), a provider of wireless technology, which is embroiled in legal controversies with Nokia (NOK), Broadcomm (BRCM) and others. \u001d  The disputes center largely on the future division of royalty payments on third-generation, or 3G, mobile-phone technologies; Nokia has charged that Qualcomm's royalty rates of around 5% are too high, while Qualcomm has filed patent-infringement claims against Nokia. \u001d  The disagreements have weighed heavily on Qualcomm's stock, which peaked at 53 in May, troughed at 33 in August and now trades around 43. But with the shares fetching 24 times expected earnings (minus cash) -- a valuation near historic lows -- Rodelli argues that there's little downside risk, and substantial upside if \"any positive catalysts\" arise on the legal front. \u001d  \"Nokia already has done its damage to Qualcomm's share price, expending a great deal of its bargaining leverage in the process,\" he says. The end result could be a compromise that tilts in Qualcomm's favor. \b \u001d  Legal Edge, which CFRA launched in January, also has followed Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) antitrust suit against Intel (INTC). Rodelli sees strategic benefits for AMD, as the litigation overhang could provide the semiconductor company a window of opportunity to establish relationships with computer suppliers like Dell (DELL). Moreover, Intel allegedly failed to preserve key business documents, he says. \u001d  Rodelli warned clients early on that a probe of Dell's accounting practices by the SEC could be more serious than the company initially had indicated. He argued investors were overreacting to a disclosure by Commerce Bancorp (CBH) of investigations by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, which involved charges of \"related-party dealings\" by the bank's CEO and his wife; they fell short of \"major investigation\" status, he said. \u001d  He also expressed concern that Steve Jobs might yet be forced to leave Apple (AAPL) because of ongoing probes into the company's alleged backdating of stock options. And he highlighted how Crocs (CROX) potentially could beat back knockoffs as a result of a decision involving the footwear maker's patent-infringement claims before the International Trade Commission. \b \u001d  \"The market tends to look at these kinds of legal issues in a binary way: either this or that is going to happen and, when it does, it's all over,\" says Rodelli. \"The reality is that legal issues are like onions. You peel away one layer and there's another one below, and another.\" \u001d  Small wonder it often is hard for investors to distinguish good news from bad in matters before the court. Or that, with companies increasingly incorporating litigation into their business plans, Rodelli's docket is likely to stay full. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8b24e25bc056f831a05f03206cb6aa62","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Porsche To Launch VW Offer, Raise Stake","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T12:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (This updates an item published at 1150 GMT, adding background and more detail.) \b \u001d  By Steve McGrath \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DUBAI (Dow Jones)--German sports car maker Porsche AG  (POR3.XE) Saturday said that it intends to launch a bid for the whole of Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) after it has completed raising its stake in Europe's biggest car manufacturer to 31%, from 27.3%. \u001d  Porsche said it expects to pay EUR100.92 per VW share under its offer, the minimum price prescribed by German law.

Norton \u001d  In perusing this week's cover story about the world's best CEOs, you may wonder about our omission of Shigenobu Nagamori of Kyoto-based Nidec, arguably one of corporate Japan's most able executives. \u001d  A major part of our calculation is based on stock-market return, and Nidec shares (ticker: NJ) have been indubitably weak, down 12% over the past 12 months, versus a 7% gain for the benchmark Nikkei 225 index. In contrast, shares of Nintendo, whose CEO, Satoru Iwata, made the cut, are up 105%. \u001d  What accounts for Nidec's decline? \u001d  Blame the plunge in NAND flash-memory chips, which are popular in handheld gadgets. Nidec makes a range of motors, including the tiny ones that power hard drives and are used in Apple's (AAPL) original 30-gigabyte iPod, its 80-gig iPod, and its U2 iPod-multimedia, music-playing, picture-holding gizmos. The super-popular, slim Nano line, introduced in September, as well as the Shuffle, use flash instead of bulkier hard drives. \b \u001d  But the inevitable plunge in flash prices that followed the breakneck construction of new fabs had people worrying that Apple would switch to flash altogether, abandoning hard drives. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on that possibility, but this year, Apple unveiled its iPhone, which will use flash memory. \u001d  That raised questions about growth in the hard-drive market and whether Nidec, one of Japan's premier growth stocks, deserves a premium multiple. Then came an earnings release for the December quarter, in which net profit sank 23%, partly because of a higher tax burden and smaller gains from securities and foreign exchange. \u001d  We checked in with Masahiro Nagayasu, Nidec's investor relations chief. \"Apple may use NAND flash by the end of the year, and we can't deny that possibility,\" says Nagayasu. \u001d  By his calculation, 30 gigabytes of flash costs around $180, versus $60 for a hard drive with the same memory. But flash prices have halved every year, and by the end of the year, \"30 gigs may cost $90.\" (Market researcher iSuppli has forecast NAND flash prices will fall about 35% to 40% in the first quarter alone from the fourth quarter of 2006.) \b \u001d  What investors particularly worry about is the future of the 1.8-inch hard drive, used in iPod video players and in camcorders, continues Nagayasu. Hard-drive motors account for a third of Nidec's sales. But the bulk of those sales are in 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch drives. \u001d  \"If we lose the 1.8-inch market, our exposure is only 4%, or 1.3% of Nidec's revenues. If we lose half that this year, it would only be 0.6%. Clearly, the market is misunderstanding the impact,\" the IR chief maintains. \u001d  In fact, he adds, hard-drive volumes are on a pace to rise 15% to 20% in calendar 2007, and price erosion is much more muted than it has been. And he declares: \"The point is that because of this, people say hard drives will see slower growth for the next three years, and it wouldn't justify the higher multiple on Nidec shares. That's wrong.\" \u001d  What about the disappointing earnings? The previous December saw  extraordinary gains, Nagayasu says, partly because of the merger of Mitsubishi Bank and UFJ -- under U.S. accounting rules, Nidec's profit had to be recognized. \b \u001d  Meanwhile, Japanese tax authorities allege that Nidec underpaid taxes for its Thai and Singapore units. Nidec is appealing this. Nidec is sticking to its guidance of 580 billion yen in net sales, 65 billion yen in operating profit, and 40 billion yen in net income for the year that ends next week, says Nagayasu. \u001d  Moreover, Nidec's been on an acquisition tear in recent months, including the motor division of French auto-parts company Valeo and this month, 52% of Hitachi's micro-motor subsidiary called Japan Servo. That ought to help Nagamori achieve his target of doubling Nidec's sales to 1 trillion yen by 2010. Today, 60% of Nidec's business is in motors. That ought to increase to 70% in the next two years. And while the auto business is less profitable than information technology, Nidec is looking to boost the Valeo division's operating margin to 10% within two years from zero today. \u001d  At 7,830 yen last week, up from its low of 7,200 yen, Nidec trades at 28 times earnings, and sports a market cap of 1.13 trillion yen ($9.7 billion). The New York traded American depositary receipts were changing hands at 16.74 Friday. \b \u001d  Nidec's long-term growth rate, by Bloomberg's reckoning, is 52%. It isn't a cheap stock, and Nagamori has said that the right market cap on his target of a trillion yen in sales is at least 2.5 trillion yen. Indubitably true is that those who bet against Nagamori over the long haul have been wrong. \b \u001d  As the Fed dropped its tightening bias, Asian equities took off last week. China roared back to its highs, setting new records. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8dc0b74c89c5f1b4e1844afb68a087ee","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Porsche Doesn't Plan Capital Increase","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T13:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 09:29 ET (13:29 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"8e6f6d172831295cd2589e377b5f8b9e","symR":["CRG.XX"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Brazil Shuts Down Cargill Port On Amazon, Demands Assessment","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T20:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CRG.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","MAR","OFP"],"Story":"\b \u001d  RIO DE JANEIRO (AP)--Federal police and government environmental agents on Saturday shut down a port that U.S. grain giant Cargill Inc. had opened on the Amazon River, saying the company had failed to provide an environmental impact statement required by law. \u001d  Agents from the environmental protection agency IBAMA, backed by police, shut down Cargill's grain terminal at 9 a.m. local time (1200 GMT) in Santarem, a city of about 250,000 residents 1,550 miles northwest of Rio, police said. \u001d  The decision was handed down late Friday by judge Souza Prudente of the Regional Federal Tribunal, the Agencia Estado news service said. \u001d  \"It was peaceful,\" federal police agent Cesar Dessimoni said of the port shutdown. \"They can appeal the ruling, but no one resisted.\" \u001d  He said the Minnesota-based Cargill had prepared an environmental assessment that did not meet Brazilian federal standards. \u001d  \"They'll have to do it correctly, as the law demands,\" Dessimoni said by telephone from Santarem. \u001d  Cargill, present in Brazil since 1965, said it would appeal the decision, adding that Prudente \"extrapolated the findings of a previous decision\" that allowed the port to function, according to a company statement quoted by Agencia Estado. \u001d  But the public prosecutor in Santarem, Felipe Fritz Braga, told Agencia Estado the court's decision was \"historic, and changes the traditional absence of government and institutional presence in the region.\" \u001d  Three years ago, Cargill opened a $20 million port in Santarem, expecting to cash in on the rising global demand for soybeans that had become Brazil's richest agricultural export. The company tried to have a road paved from the central state of Mato Grosso - Brazil's biggest soy producer - to Santarem. \u001d  But the Minnesota-based company became a target for residents, environmentalists and federal prosecutors, who said the port was illegal and tried to shut it down. Greenpeace was a leader of protests against the agribusiness giant, shutting down the port for three and a half hours last May. \u001d  \"We're not against Cargill. We're against soy in the Amazon. It's the wrong development model. The federal prosecutors are the ones against Cargill, we're just trying to alert everyone to the fact that soy isn't good for the Amazon,\" said Paulo Adario, director of Greenpeace's Amazon campaign. \u001d  Soy farming has overtaken cattle ranching and logging as the worst destroyer of the rainforest. The Amazon lost 6,950 square miles of rainforest between 2003 and 2004. Some 4,633 square miles of soybeans were planted during that time, making Brazil the world's No. 2 producer of soy after the U.S. \u001d  The growing popularity of biodiesel as an alternative to traditional diesel fuel has made the demand for soy even greater. \u001d  Today, the road to Mato Grosso state still isn't paved, and Santarem handles only about 3% of the seven million tons of soybeans grown there each year- far below the two to three million tons Cargill expected to ship each year. Nearly all the rest is shipped from Atlantic ports in southeastern Brazil. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 16:19 ET (20:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8ec733063cc7304a599d3e55512a3432","symR":["1088.HK","CN000A0ERK49"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"China Shenhua Energy 06 Net Pft +12%; Higher Coal Sales,Prices","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T09:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1088.HK","CN000A0ERK49"],"IndustryCodes":["COA","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  HONG KONG (Dow Jones)--China Shenhua Energy Co.

(ABT) that's designed to be absorbed by the body shows no cases of stent-related clots after six months. \u001d  The \"first-in-man\" trial, called Absorb, also showed one major adverse event among the 30 patients involved - a case where repeat intervention occurred at the site of the original procedure. The Absorb six-month data were unveiled Saturday at the American College of Cardiology's annual conference. \u001d  The results also showed that the stent can recoil a bit after being expanded in an artery, an issue that's being addressed with a redesigned version, an investigator in the trial said. \u001d  Abbott called the results encouraging, and said it would push on by expanding this study. This new technology is years away from reaching the market, but Abbott believes bioabsorbable stents could eventually become the most common type of stent, and that the company has a strong lead in the development race. \u001d  The Absorb trial is the world's first to examine the safety and performance of a fully bioabsorbable stent. All stents are designed to prop open arteries, but stents on the market today are made of metal and stay in the body forever. \u001d  The stent Abbott is studying is designed to be metabolized by the body over time, eventually fading away completely with the goal of leaving a healed, natural vessel behind. Rather than metal, the bioabsorbable stent is made of polylactic acid. \u001d  Patrick W, Serruys, a professor of interventional cardiology at the Thoraxcentre, Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam, said he believed this technology will open up a new era after 21 years of metallic stents. Serruys is co-principle investigator in the Abbott-backed study. \u001d  \"I feel very guilty putting metal in the coronary artery,\" Serruys said during a press conference. \u001d  Like Abbott's metallic Xience stent, the bioabsorbable product is coated with a drug called everolimus that's used to stop renarrowing that can lead to complications. U.S. pivotal trial data for the Xience stent was also unveiled during a packed late-breaking conference at ACC Saturday, and showed that the trial met its goals, clearing a path for Abbott to seek regulatory approval. \u001d  Abbott had previously said that it would make a decision about how to proceed with the bioabsorbable stent program after the six-month data came out. John M. Capek, senior vice president of Abbott's vascular business, said in an interview that Abbott is \"excited to take the next step\" based on the results. \u001d  That step includes enrolling more patients - the trial is designed for up to 60 - and checking them periodically for up to five years. The next phase of the Absorb study will include a next-generation bioabsorbable stent that's designed for improved strength and deliverability. \u001d  Serruys said a redesigned version of the stent should address the issue of retraction seen with the bioaborbable stent so far, which he believes was due to some structural weakness. \u001d  The Absorb trial is a prospective study that isn't randomized. It's taking place in multiple European countries and New Zealand. \u001d  Looking ahead, if the device progresses through further study and eventually gains regulatory approval, it could reach the U.S. around 2012, Capek said. European approval could come two years earlier. \b \u001d  -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 15:17 ET (19:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"99901bf8ccc09b8936031a8d6d679680","symR":["BSC"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) Inside Scoop: A Self-Made Man Is Sold On Bear Stearns","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BSC"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Naureen S. Malik \u001d  Longtime Bear Stearns director Paul Novelly is making a bullish call on the financial-services giant as the stock pulls back from its record high. \u001d  Over three days last week, Novelly doled out $7.42 million to purchase 50,000 shares on the open market. He paid $147.49 per share for some of the stock, $150.18 for other shares and $150.29 for the rest, SEC filings show. All but 15,000 of the shares were bought at the lowest price. \u001d  Novelly is known for building up Apex Oil, a Clayton, Mo.-based privately held company that trades, stores and distributes petroleum products. He is chairman and chief executive officer of Apex. \u001d  The Bear Stearns director now holds 175,000 common shares of Bear Stearns (ticker: BSC), plus another 2,900 restricted shares. That's less than 1% of the company's 149 million shares outstanding. \u001d  The shares were purchased and are held through St. Albans Global Management, a hedge fund set up to handle Novelly's investments, notes Ben Silverman, director of research at InsiderScore.com, which tracks transactions by company insiders. \u001d  Novelly purchased more shares last week than he had in any full year since he joined the Bear Stearns board in 2002. Last year, he bought roughly 54,400 shares for $7.2 million. Those shares were priced from $118.90 to $137.27. \u001d  Together, Novelly's open-market purchases this year and last year were the largest reported by any insider of the big investment firm -- in terms of both share count and dollar value -- since early 1990, according to Thomson Financial. \u001d  Novelly couldn't be reached for comment. Bear Stearns, citing company policy, declined to discuss the transactions. \u001d  However, Silverman considers Novelly's purchases notable because he \"is someone who is self-made, who understands how to create wealth and manage it. . . through the good times and the bad.\" \u001d  He notes that Novelly helped make Apex Oil one of the largest privately held companies in the 1980s, then guided it through bankruptcy and rebuilt it into a petroleum-product powerhouse that generates around $1 billion in annual revenue. \u001d  As a Bear Stearns investor, Novelly \"accurately called the bottom to the stock\" in May 2004 at around $80 and has also been a prescient buyer on strength, Silverman observes. \u001d  At their price around 153 late Friday, Bear Stearns shares were 11% below their record intraday high of $172.61, hit on Jan. 18. Still, the stock is up 12% over the past 12 months. Its main competitors, Goldman Sachs (GS), Lehman Brothers (LEH) and Merrill Lynch (MER), have posted 52-week gains of 39%, 2% and 11%, respectively. \u001d  Even with the run-up, Bear Stearns shares are trading at 9.9 times earnings-per-share estimates for the next four quarters, close to the low end of their five-year range of 9.4 times to 12.9 times, according to Thomson Financial. \u001d  Novelly has been a consistent Bear Stearns bull, but Silverman says that \"we would be more concerned if he didn't buy the stock,\" given its recent price erosion. Silverman adds that, on a broader level and despite fallout from the subprime-mortgage debacle, insiders at investment banks and financial-services firms are buying on the open market at the highest levels in three years. Bear Stearns is the largest underwriter of mortgage securities on Wall Street, and many investors are wary of the potential impact of mortgage problems on its results. \u001d  In the company's surprisingly strong first-quarter report on March 15, Bear Stearns tried to alleviate concerns by saying that it has only a 3% exposure to subprime loans in its mortgage portfolio and indicating that it doesn't expect a ripple effect. \u001d  Meanwhile, insider selling at Bear Stearns has slowed. In the past year, insider sales -- concentrated in December through January -- amounted to $67.4 million, down from the $125 million in the corresponding year-earlier stretch, according to InsiderScore.com. Trading in Bear Stearns options also appears to indicate that the worst is over for Goldman, Bear Stearns, Citigroup C) and Lehman Brothers. \u001d  Institutional players have been supporting financial stocks over the past two years, says Joshua Hong, director of research at OwnershipAnalyzer.com. \u001d  At Bear Stearns, there was a selloff in the second quarter before interest in the stock revived slowly. At the end of 2006, 445 institutions controlled nearly 81 million Bear Stearns shares. At the conclusion of 2005, the corresponding figures were 415 institutions and 78.5 million shares. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a523c6630dbc547830d9ee8f11614caa","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005","POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Porsche To Offer EUR100.92 For Each VW Share","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T11:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 07:52 ET (11:52 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a6928c17636d37031bd3d244ebf33eb1","symR":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"RBS Chief Appears To Keep Options Open On ABN Amro - FT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T10:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XFT1","XGTI","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN) Chief Executive Sir Fred Goodwin has refused to rule out RBS as a potential suitor for ABN Amro Holdings (ABN) as the bank boosted its management team in the U.S., the Financial Times reports Saturday. \u001d  The paper reports that while on a conference call with journalists Friday, Goodwin sidestepped questions about his interest in ABN Amro or any other large deals. \u001d  The FT reports that his stance contrasts with comments following the publication of the bank's annual results this month, when he played down RBS's interest in acquisitions by saying there was no deal that was \"desirable or affordable on the horizon.\" \u001d  Citing people involved in the deal talks between Barclays PLC (BARC.LN) and ABN Amro, the paper also reports that John Varley, Barclays' chief executive, has agreed to move to Amsterdam if the bank's takeover of ABN Amro is successful. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.ft.com \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9330 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 06:13 ET (10:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a6ace9f96483cc2b794b6572183ecaea","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Porsche Will Up Volkswagen Stake To 31% From 27.3% Monday","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T13:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 09:29 ET (13:29 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a7588b432f835da9fb48c98ad7067fe6","symR":["ABT","US0028241000"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Abbott Announces Positive Six-Month Results From the World's First Clinical Trial of a Fully Bioabsorbable Drug-Eluting Coronary Stent","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T16:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABT","US0028241000"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"Abbott's Bioabsorbable Stent Technology Holds Promise as Future-Generation Treatment Option for Physicians Treating Patients with Coronary Artery Disease \b \b \u001d  ABBOTT PARK, Ill., March 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Abbott today announced positive results from ABSORB, the world's first clinical trial evaluating the overall safety and performance of a fully bioabsorbable drug- eluting stent platform for the treatment of coronary artery disease.  Six- month results from the first 30 patients in the trial, presented at the 56th Annual American College of Cardiology Scientific Session in New Orleans, demonstrated no stent thrombosis and a low (3.3 percent) hierarchical rate of ischemia-driven Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE), such as heart attack or repeat intervention. \b \u001d  \"The encouraging results from the first 30 patients of ABSORB suggest that drug-eluting bioabsorbable stent technologies may be a promising future therapy option for physicians treating patients with heart disease,\" said Patrick W. Serruys, M.D., Ph.D., professor of interventional cardiology at the Thoraxcentre, Erasmus University Hospital, Rotterdam, who is co-principal investigator of the study.  \"A drug eluting stent that would eventually disappear after restoring blood flow is an exciting concept that we look forward to further exploring.\" \b \u001d  The single MACE event reported was a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. The same patient underwent a repeat intervention that occurred at the site of the original procedure, resulting in an overall target lesion revascularization rate of 3.3 percent. The trial results confirmed that the treatment effect of everolimus in the bioabsorbable stent is similar to that observed in Abbott's studies of metallic drug-eluting stents, with everolimus actively inhibiting tissue growth into the artery.  The rate of device success (successful placement of the bioabsorbable stent at the site of the lesion) was 93.5 percent. \b \u001d  Abbott's everolimus-eluting bioabsorbable stent is made of polylactic acid, a proven biocompatible material that is commonly used in medical implants such as dissolvable sutures.  As with a metallic stent, the bioabsorbable stent is designed to restore blood flow by propping the vessel open, providing support until the blood vessel heals.  Unlike a metallic stent, a bioabsorbable stent is designed to be slowly metabolized by the body and completely absorbed over time. \b \u001d  \"Based on these encouraging safety results, Abbott will continue to advance this technology by enrolling the next cohort of patients in the ABSORB study in Europe and New Zealand,\" said John M. Capek, Ph.D., senior vice president, Abbott Vascular.  \"The next phase of the ABSORB study will utilize a next-generation bioabsorbable everolimus-eluting stent that incorporates several advancements designed to improve strength and deliverability.\" \b \b    About the ABSORB Trial \b \u001d  The ABSORB trial is a prospective, non-randomized (open label) study designed to enroll up to 60 patients in Belgium, Denmark, France, New Zealand, Poland and The Netherlands. Key endpoints of the study include assessments of safety -- MACE and stent thrombosis (blood clot formation) rates -- at 30, 180 and 270 days, with an annual follow-up for up to five years, and successful deployment of the bioabsorbable drug-eluting stent. Other key endpoints of the study include follow-up measurements assessed by angiography, IVUS, and state- of-the-art imaging modalities at 180 days and two years, as well as a new noninvasive technique in a subset of patients at 18 months. The co-principal investigator of the study is John Ormiston, M.D., of Mercy Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. \b \u001d  For images of Abbott's bioabsorbable stent and other information, please visit the company's online ACC newsroom at http://www.abbottvascular.com/ACCpresskit . \b \b    About Abbott Vascular \b \u001d  Abbott Vascular, a division of Abbott, is one of the world's leading vascular care businesses.

Today, CMGI gets paid a fee to streamline the delivery of electronics for companies such as Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Eastman Kodak (EK). \u001d  After a year of little or no attention paid to the company on Wall Street, Robert Stimson, business-software analyst for W.R. Hambrecht, initiated coverage of CMGI on March 9 with a Buy rating, saying the current value of CMGI's assets is $2.50 a share, a healthy cut above the stock's recent price of $2.22. \u001d  \"Where there has been enormous opportunity in tech is with some of these fallen angels,\" says Stimson. \u001d  But after a 66% jump this year in CMGI shares, is there any upside left? We think so. CMGI may be a cheap bet that there's value in the electronics supply chain. With $1 billion in sales over the past 12 months, $275 million of cash and $2 billion of net operating tax-loss carry-forwards, the company may even be an attractive take-out target for freight giants such as FedEx (FDX) or United Parcel Service (UPS). \u001d  \"As [CMGI] improves its gross profit and operating profit, this is a business whose sales can rise by 20% or more a year,\" says Stimson. \u001d  After the dot-com crash, CMGI spent 2001 to 2004 transforming itself into a seller of corporate printing and shipping. In 2004, it paid $231 million to buy Modus Media, a firm that was in electronics distribution. \u001d  Chief Executive Joe Lawler, who arrived in late summer of 2004 from printing giant R.R. Donnelley & Sons, now has the company earning fees for what's called the \"configuration\" of electronics products. For example, when a cable modem has to be shipped from Asia to a customer in the U.S., CMGI will take delivery of the modem from the manufacturer, bundle it with things like adapters for the U.S. power supply, and put it all in a box. \u001d  \"It's not even the same company as it was in the '90s, not even close,\" says Ryan Jacob, manager of the Jacob Internet Fund, which owned CMGI shares during the dot-com boom. \u001d  The new business has razor-thin margins: CMGI makes 10 cents on the dollar for moving a billion dollars worth of goods around the world. But there are signs Lawler is boosting efficiency. Gross profit after the cost of goods, which has bounced between 8% and 11% in the past couple of years, was 12.5% in the most recent quarter. \u001d  \"The whole supply-chain area is a worthwhile place to be dealing these days,\" adds Michael Shinnick, who helps manage $3 billion for 1st Source in South Bend, Ind., and doesn't own CMGI shares. \u001d  CMGI seems to be in a hot market as more electronics goods are designed, built and tested in Asia and shipped around the world. But building a business with stable margins and steady cash flow is no slam dunk. Results quarter to quarter have been uneven. Last year, the company lost $70 million in business from Kodak and $100 million from HP, as both found other ways to ship and configure products. The companies are still clients, though they represent a smaller percentage of total sales. \u001d  Hence, sales are expected to decline slightly in the fiscal year ending July 2008, while profit may slip to 11 cents a share from 13 cents this year. \u001d  What's more, CMGI still invests in young companies, which nowadays consist of alternative-energy start-ups. And proceeds from selling companies in its portfolio continue to be a big contributor to cash flow from quarter to quarter. \u001d  Former CEO David Wetherell, the deal maestro during the '90s, gave up his chairmanship last year but is sticking around as a consultant on venture investments. \u001d  All that gives Jacob and other investors pause. \u001d  \"The cash and low valuation make CMGI a potential value stock, but I want to know whether this a business that can improve margins and really grow earnings,\" says Jacob. \u001d  CEO Lawler tells Barron's Online he can achieve annual gross profit of 12% to 14% of sales in coming years by eliminating waste in variable costs. He says consolidating numerous software programs will help CMGI better plan the leases on its facilities and its labor costs around the world. \u001d  And Lawler believes CMGI can replace lost business at HP and Kodak with contracts for higher-value electronics such as communications equipment. CMGI's 41 locations in 13 countries outnumber competitors' facilities, which should be attractive to clients. \u001d  Lawler won't say who those new clients may be, but according to one source who declined to be identified, they could include storage-equipment vendor EMC. \u001d  As a sign of progress, Lawler says that aside from the HP and Kodak accounts, sales have grown around 8% in the past 12 months, in contrast to the 1% decline reflected on the latest income statement. \u001d  And the venture portfolio? \"We see compelling valuations in clean tech,\" says Lawler, which makes it worth using the company's in-house investing expertise, he says. \u001d  CMGI's cash may offer some cushion for the stock while Lawler pursues his plan. \"The presence of cash and of net loss carry-forwards adds some support to that kind of a story,\" says Alan Loewenstein, senior vice president with American Fund Advisors, which doesn't own CMGI shares. \u001d  After the stock's recent run, there's more risk than there was at a dollar a share that Renaissance and other hedge funds will cash in their chips. But the strength of that balance sheet means investors may be rewarded if they give Lawler time to show he can build substance at a company long known for dot-com pizzazz. \u001d  --- \u001d  A version of this article appeared March 20 in Barron's Online (www.barrons.com). \u001d  --- \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ab259b36b058626c4444264e9a8bae60","symR":["BSX"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Spirit III Clinical Trial Demonstrates Positive Performance for Both TAXUS(R) and PROMUS(TM) Drug-Eluting Stent Systems","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T16:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BSX"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"Results reaffirm strength of Boston Scientific's dual drug-eluting stent program \b \b \u001d  NATICK, Mass., and NEW ORLEANS, March 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) today welcomed the results of the pivotal SPIRIT III clinical trial, which reaffirmed prior safety and efficacy data for the market-leading TAXUS(R) Express2(TM) Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System and provided early positive data for the XIENCE(TM) V (PROMUS(TM)) Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System.  The XIENCE(TM) V Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System is manufactured by Abbott and distributed on a private label basis by Boston Scientific as the PROMUS Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System.  Boston Scientific is the first company to offer two distinct drug-eluting stent platforms. \b \u001d  Results of the U.S.-based, non-inferiority trial were presented at the annual American College of Cardiology Scientific Session in New Orleans. \b \u001d  \"This trial is important as it reinforces our understanding of the proven performance of the TAXUS Stent and generates enthusiasm for the early clinical data of this deliverable Olimus, the PROMUS Stent,\" said Martin B.

Stone, M.D., the trial's Principal Investigator, reported that the primary endpoint of angiographic in-segment late loss at eight months met its non-inferiority margin between the TAXUS Stent (0.28mm) and XIENCE V (PROMUS) Stent (0.14mm), pNI<0.0001.  The TAXUS Stent results are consistent with data from previous trials in terms of low angiographic and clinical restenosis rates, with excellent safety results.  The major clinical secondary endpoint of Target Vessel Failure (TVF, a composite of death, Myocardial Infarction, and ischemia-driven Target Vessel Revascularization at nine months) also showed non-inferiority between the TAXUS Stent (9.0%) and the XIENCE V (PROMUS) Stent (7.2%), pNI<0.0001, Psuperiority=0.30.  Though not powered as an endpoint, ischemia-driven Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR, or re-treatment rate) was comparable between the TAXUS Stent (5.0%) and the XIENCE V (PROMUS) Stent (2.6%), p=0.053. Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR) was also comparable between the TAXUS Stent (6.5%) and the XIENCE V (PROMUS) Stent (5.3%), p=0.47. \b \u001d  The TAXUS Stent and XIENCE V (PROMUS) Stent demonstrated impressive safety results through nine months.  In particular, the TAXUS Stent reported zero percent (0%) Stent Thrombosis and zero percent (0%) Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction (MI, or heart attack). \b \u001d  \"In today's safety-conscious environment, it is reassuring to see both the TAXUS and PROMUS Stents performed exceptionally well in the SPIRIT III trial on multiple measures,\" said Hank Kucheman, Senior Vice President and Group President of Boston Scientific's Interventional Cardiology business.  \"We were particularly encouraged by the zero thrombosis and Q-wave MI rates for TAXUS.\" \b \u001d  Boston Scientific offers two highly deliverable and complementary drug- eluting stent technologies.  The PROMUS Stent has CE Mark approval and is distributed in most European countries and other international markets.

The issue showed up after patients in the study stopped taking anti-clotting medication. \u001d  The coated stents, however, also led to a 43% reduction in the need for further intervention in the treated artery compared with bare-metal stents, and mortality was similar among both groups. The coated devices used in the study were made by Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), the two major players in the global stent market. \u001d  The study comes during an ongoing debate about the safety of coated stents amid signs the first-generation devices can increase the risk of clots long after implantation, compared with bare-metal stents. The study doesn't look very far beyond the one-year mark, though, which is where much of the focus on stent-related clots has fallen. \u001d  \"Future studies following this same group of patients for a longer period of time will allow us to determine if the very small excess of stent thrombosis and heart attack in the 12 to 15 month time period will continue to increase,\" said Michael Maeng, a study author from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, in an ACC release. \u001d  While the minor risk of very late clots and heart attacks warrants further research, \"these results do not outweigh the benefits of drug-eluting stents at the 15-month follow up,\" Maeng said. \u001d  Maeng noted, speaking at a late-breaking session and a later press conference, that investigators hope to have two-year data available for review at a different cardiology conference this fall. He also said that doctors in Denmark use drug-coated stents in about 60% of stent procedures, and are still confident in the devices. \u001d  The study's data were collected at three University Hospitals in Western Denmark, and included 12,395 stent patients. Among them, 11,730 coronary lesions were treated with bare-metal stents while 5,422 lesions were treated with coated stents. Data were collected between January 2002 and June 2005. \u001d  The rate of stent thrombosis, or stent-related clots, was 2.2% among patients with bare-metal stents and 1.9% among coated-stent patients at 15 months. Heart attack rates were also low in both groups at 15 months. \u001d  Stents are tiny mesh devices that prop open arteries, and coated stents use medication to prevent the renarrowing that occurs more often in bare-metal stents. \u001d  This new study adds to a growing amount of evidence regarding stent safety performance, which has become a hot-button issue since last year's ACC meeting. The evidence includes controlled trials for stents on the market or aiming for regulatory approval, and registry studies that can reflect real-world experience, but don't have the same controlled circumstances. \u001d  A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel said in December that, while the devices from Boston Scientific and J&J seem to carry a small elevated risk of clots, the risk doesn't translate to a higher rate of heart attacks and deaths when the stents are used under FDA-approved guidelines. But the performance of the devices is less definitive in so-called \"off-label\" cases, which are typically more complex cases and make up more than 60% of stent usage. \u001d  Coated stent patients in the Western Denmark study were recommended for a 12-month course of anti-clotting medicine, which was the duration recently recommended by the FDA advisory panel. The study included clotting definitions created last year to create a common way to track the issue across different studies. \u001d  -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 17:02 ET (21:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c5339470bf6e2ff11abbb6f19ecb1c0a","symR":["ANH","FMT","MCO","MHP","NFI","NLY","OPX","ORGN","RATE","SDP.XX"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) Slow-Motion Train Wreck Picks Up Speed","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ANH","FMT","MCO","MHP","NFI","NLY","OPX","ORGN","RATE","SDP.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","IAS","ICS","MED","MFN","PUB","REA","REI","SVC","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Sandra Ward \u001d  Interview With Sy Jacobs \u001d  Founder and Investment Manager, Jacobs Asset Management \b \u001d  People who read our Fourth of July 2005 interview with Sy Jacobs would hardly be surprised by the current meltdown in the subprime loan market. And it should come as no surprise that Jacobs, with a 23-year history of covering the financial markets, predicted the debacle. He has also shined as the principal of the $222 million Jacobs Asset Management in Manhattan, which includes a $45 million private-equity fund. Last year, his market-neutral financial fund gained 16.8% after fees, compared with 13.8% for the S&P 500. Since the fund's start nearly 12 years ago, it has returned 16.4%, on average, versus 11% for the S&P. He sees the debacle deepening, but spies opportunities, as well, in the adversity. \b \u001d  Barron's: Nearly two years ago, you saw the day of reckoning coming for sub-prime mortgage lenders. \u001d  Jacobs: When we spoke in 2005, I was worried about what was brewing in sub-prime, given the loosening in underwriting standards and the extension of credit to those with little equity and the inability to pay the loans back unless housing prices continued to rise. I'm surprised how long it has taken to unravel, but it has. Michael Farrell at Annaly Capital Management has been calling it the slow-motion train wreck, and the fact that it went on for another year or two since we spoke only makes it worse because the credit markets accepted more and more risk and got thinner and thinner margins while the party was still going on. The events of the past two weeks would tell you that the train wreck is accelerating and is turning into a contagion. Subprime will bring down mortgage lending, housing and, in turn, the economy and the market. \b \u001d  Q: Some insist the problems in the sub-prime market are manageable. \u001d  A: The problems in subprime are not self-contained. It is a pinprick to a larger problem, and it needs to be looked at that way. The notion that subprime home-equity lending is somehow ring-fenced because it is only 12% of total mortgage loans outstanding and won't affect the rest of the mortgage and housing market is absurd. First of all, subprime lending was over 20% of 2006's volume. That tells you it was growing rapidly as a percentage of the mortgage business when it hit the wall. \u001d  It also tells you that the subprime borrower was increasingly the marginal buyer of housing and tilted the supply and demand of housing that resulted in such big increases in home prices until late last year. \b \u001d  Q: How will the problems spread? \u001d  A: Mostly through housing. This year is going to be much worse than 2006 for mortgage and housing credit, and 2006 already laid the mortgage industry low. Nearly $700 billion of mortgages reset this year and nearly half of that is sub-prime. Remember 2004, when our esteemed former Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, was exhorting us to take out adjustable-rate mortgages, the federal-funds rate was only 1% and had nowhere to go but up? Prime refinancing volume peaked in 2004, and the most popular loan product at that time was a 3/1 adjustable-rate mortgage, three years fixed and adjustable every year after that. Those are resetting this year after 17 quarter-point increases in the fed-funds rate. The subprime home- equity market peaked in 2005, and the most popular product from that year was a two-year-fixed, 28-year-floating mortgage. It resets this year, and now credit spreads are widening, Freddie Mac [ticker: FRE] is going to stop buying as much subprime, as are the capital markets in general, and a lot of capacity is exiting through bankruptcy courts. \u001d  The remaining players left standing are raising credit standards and cutting loan products and raising coupons on the products they continue to make. Housing hasn't bottomed, and it is just getting going to the downside. \b \u001d  Q: How bad is the credit crunch? \u001d  A: It is spilling into the secondary market in the sense that credit spreads in the secondary market have widened in the past few weeks. We're seeing a reversal in the appetite for risk that we've seen for the past several years. Credit will get more expensive across asset classes, and that's another way in which the subprime contagion will spread. \b \u001d  Q: Are you hanging on to your subprime shorts, or have you moved on? \u001d  A: In subprime, the decline has been vicious already, and we are starting to look elsewhere for that kind of juicy downside. NovaStar Financial [NFI] is down from 39 to 6 since we last spoke, and we are still short. We are still short some others, and I think New Century Financial [NEW] is very likely going to zero. Another that has more downside is Fremont General [FMT], which we've been short for two to three years already. Fremont is a little more complicated, but if you read the cease-and-desist order that the regulators issued to them two weeks ago, and which started its stock crashing, it is hard to see how they don't eventually seize the bank. They as much as call Fremont's management incompetent and order them to stop doing business in subprime. Their losses from the loans they've made -- and they made $31 billion last year -- are going to be huge. Another part of their business is condo and construction lending, and the regulators criticized them for lax controls in this area and inadequate reserves, as well. By the time they take proper reserves on those loans and because of the losses they'll experience getting out of subprime, we see them as capital-deficient. Given the criticism of management by the regulators in this cease-and- desist order and the probable desire to make an example of someone, I don't see the regulators being lenient with them, and I don't see how they will avoid getting seized and wiping out equity holders. \b \u001d  Q: Some of these names have been bouncing back on capital infusions. Does that throw a wrench into your thinking at all? \u001d  A: No. People are bottom-fishing. \b \u001d  Q: Where else do you see opportunities from the fallout in subprime? \u001d  A: We are still short Bankrate [RATE]. We were painfully early on Bankrate, judging from the fact the stock went from 20 at the time we spoke two years ago to 39 now. But we actually think our original thesis is unfolding now and see Bankrate as a play on mortgage velocity, which is coming down. Organic growth has all but stopped, as you can see from the deceleration of their page-view growth, but they have made some acquisitions. They've surprised on the upside with earnings expectations because they raised prices aggressively for advertising on their site with Internet banner ads and click-throughs. We think the price increases on ad rates are unsustainable. Their customers are mortgage brokers and mortgage bankers. These mortgage bankers and brokers will go out of business in droves in 2007. You could see big revenue disappointments at Bankrate, which won't go over well with the stock trading at 30 times 2007 estimates. \b \u001d  Q: Where else do you see trouble brewing? \u001d  A: A secondary way we've found to play the demise of subprime and its fallout is by shorting the credit-rating agencies: Moody's [MCO] and McGraw-Hill [MHP], which owns Standard & Poor's. Standard & Poor's is 44% of McGraw-Hill's revenue and 76% of their operating profits. By our calculations, Standard & Poor's is over 100% of McGraw-Hill's profit growth because the rest of their businesses haven't been growing. Moody's and Standard & Poor's have been major beneficiaries of the wild growth in the structured-finance business such as CDOs [collateralized debt obligations] and RMBS [residential mortgage-backed securities] and subprime. The bulls would say that only 7% of their business is subprime. But when you add CDOs and RMBS and subprime together, all of which we think is driven by the home-equity business, the number jumps to roughly 20% of the rating agencies' revenue. \u001d  Revenues per deal on these three segments -- CDO, RMBS and subprime --  are three to four times that of the rating agencies' lower-growth and lower-margin corporate-finance business, which is rating corporate bond offerings. The areas we are focused on are contributing more like 30% to 40% of operating profits at Moody's and Standard & Poor's, and most of the growth in earnings. Subprime issuance is going to shrink dramatically this year, and a big chunk of CDO volume is backed by subprime assets, and so the rating agencies' entire structured-finance operations should see a big drop in growth this year, especially in their high-margin areas, and that's underappreciated by the stock market. \u001d  In light of the fact that Moody's is trading at 25 times estimates of 14% earnings growth and McGraw-Hill is trading at 22 times estimates of 16% earnings growth, and we see both missing their estimates this year and possibly showing little if any earnings growth, those multiples could get hurt badly. Besides the earnings risk, there is great regulatory and legislative risk here. When Barney Frank and Nancy Pelosi hold their hearings later this year or next year on what went wrong in subprime and why it caused so many foreclosures among their constituents, the rating agencies profiting from the growth of all this misguided credit extension will not escape their wrath. \u001d  Jim Grant of the Interest Rate Observer makes a really great point that is germane to what I'm talking about, which is that people will want to know how Wall Street was able to take a pile of subprime home-equity loans that were poorly underwritten and slice and dice them and turn them into CDO or asset-backed securities where about 80% of them were rated double-A or triple-A, and yet many of those loans are going to go bad. \b \u001d  Q: Are you positive on anything? \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c810b4e8c503d6de4b8ac87cc4f7af0f","symR":["WTB.LN","GB00B1KJJ408"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Starwood Eyes Whitbread's Premier Travel Inns - FT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T11:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WTB.LN","GB00B1KJJ408"],"IndustryCodes":["RES","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)-- UK leisure group Whitbread PLC's (WTB.LN) subsidiary Premier Travel Inns is being eyed by real estate investment group Starwood Capital, the Financial Times reports Saturday. \u001d  The paper writes, without citing its sources, that Starwood is targeting the budget hotels subsidiary which has boosted group profits.

But this kaffe klatsch was different. The company's profit margins had been under pressure, gains in same-store sales were slipping and concerns about competition and long-term growth were on the rise. Moreover, someone had recently leaked a memo from Starbucks founder Howard Schultz decrying \"the commoditization of our brand,\" and Consumer Reports had hurled perhaps the worst insult of all, declaring that McDonald's brews a better cup of coffee. No wonder Starbucks shares -- and shareholders -- had a severe case of jitters. \u001d  No more. The crowd of more than 5,000 heard some soothing words from Schultz, 53, and CEO Jim Donald, 53, that ought to put to rest for now concerns that the coffee seller's legendary growth spurt is over. Starbucks rose 3% on the week, to $31.42, and some Wall Street fans think the shares could rally into the mid-40s in 12 months. \u001d  In a preview of sorts of coming attractions, Donald told Barron's earlier in the week: \"I see no reason for growth to slow anytime soon. We are not near saturation, we see no sales cannibalization, the lines at stores say there is still opportunity to expand in existing markets, and we see tremendous opportunity to grow in new markets, both in the U.S. and overseas. We have a very strong brand and a robust business model.\" \u001d  Starbucks also has a stock (ticker: SBUX) that is down more than 20% from its November high of 40. The shares are by no means cheap at 36 times fiscal 2007 expected earnings of 89 cents a share, and 29 times fiscal '08 estimates of $1.08 (for the year ending in September), especially by comparison with the mid-teens multiples of McDonald's (MCD) and the broad market. But some savvy investors are buying into the bullish case for this modern American icon and see a rare opportunity to scoop up stock near prices last seen in late 2004. \u001d  Founded in Seattle in 1971 and publicly traded since 1992, Starbucks introduced new generations of java nuts to the idea that a cup of coffee is not just a spoonful of processed powder added to lukewarm water, but a grande experience. In the process it helped boost retail sales of coffee drinks to more than $12 billion a year in the U.S. alone, according to the National Coffee Association. Today lattes, espressos and cappuccinos, not to mention mochas, macchiatos, mistos and Frappuccinos, have entered the lingo, and the local Starbucks, whether on Main Street, in a mall, off a highway or within another store, is a hallowed destination for kids who like to hang out and adults who need a daily caffeine fix. \u001d  In the past decade, Starbucks' revenue has increased at a compound annual rate of about 30%, rising from $465 million in fiscal '95 to $7.8 billion last year. In the same span net earnings have climbed from $10.2 million to $564 million, or 73 cents a share. Adjusted for splits, the company's stock has soared over 4,000%. Put another way, a thousand dollars invested 15 years ago at the time of the company's initial public offering today would be worth about $40,000 -- or 10,000 venti lattes. \b \u001d  Wall Street is evenly split on Starbucks' near-term prospects: About as many sell-side analysts rate its shares Buy as Hold or Sell. But that could change soon. \"We are at the point where a long-term investor can make a strong case for buying the stock,\" says Marc Greenberg, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. \"This is a great brand, with great pricing power, an excellent operating model and good prospects. And now the stock is much cheaper\" than it used to be. \u001d  Steven Kron, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, recently placed Starbucks on the firm's Conviction Buy list. \"This is a high-quality company that offers tremendous long-term growth prospects,\" he says. \"It is a compelling buying opportunity. I expect the shares to change course on more favorable news and the change could be abrupt. My 12-month stock target is 43.\" \u001d  Barron's also spoke with two money managers who are buying the stock aggressively but wished to remain anonymous. \u001d  Arguably the biggest issue facing Starbucks is market saturation. Naysayers -- and there are plenty -- argue the company is likely to hit a wall in its efforts to expand. Starbucks operates 13,168 retail outlets, 9,401 of them in the U.S.; another 1,600 are scheduled to open in the remaining six months of this fiscal year, followed by 2,000 to 3,000 in fiscal '08. With the number of \"doors\" growing at a 20% annual clip, where is the limit? No one knows, including management. Just last year, the company officially raised its target to 40,000 stores, half in the U.S. and half overseas. It sees room to expand both in virgin markets and those it already serves. \u001d  Though it is hard to imagine a town or a mall without a Starbucks, there are only four stores in Vermont, 13 in New Hampshire and 19 in Delaware. Compared with California's 2,200-plus stores, New Jersey and Massachusetts look underserved with fewer than 200 units each. Still more opportunities await along the nation's highways and major commuting corridors. \u001d  Starbucks' aim is to move customers from line to drink in under three minutes. When the lines are too long to achieve that goal, the company will consider opening another store in an existing market, something that studies show benefits both stores and doesn't cannibalize returns. In New York and Chicago, it's not uncommon to see Starbucks outlets on opposite corners and across the road from each other. In Seattle, the company's densest market, one intersection boasts a Starbucks on three corners, and the company is considering opening a fourth. \u001d  \"We are heaviest on the ground in Washington state, where we have one store for every 12,000 people,\" says Donald. \"But the numbers here are as good or better than other states. I can't see any evidence that we are even approaching market saturation.\" \u001d  When and if the U.S. finally reaches saturation, there is the potential for growth overseas. The company currently operates 3,767 stores in Canada, the U.K., Australia and 37 other countries, and all are profitable. In fiscal '06 overseas markets chipped in 17% of total sales. Though countless U.S. companies have stumbled in exporting their brands -- Wal-Mart (WMT) in Germany is a recent example -- Starbucks so far has avoided problems, in part by playing it safe. \u001d  Rather than dilute its energies, Starbucks intends to focus its international efforts in the future on just four potentially huge markets: China, Brazil, Russia and India. In China, its most important foreign market, the company owned or licensed more than 261 outlets as of last year. If all goes as planned, China could rival the U.S. in both revenue and stores by 2015. But the path to profits might not be easy; earlier this month, a member of China's parliament demanded Starbucks remove its store in Beijing's Forbidden City. \b \u001d  For years, Starbucks' sales growth was driven by the number of transactions, or sales. But the company now is focusing on the value of each sale in an effort to drive up profit margins. In addition to brewed coffee, most stores sell coffee beans, coffee makers, thermal cups and pastries. They also sell CDs and shortly will market music from Starbucks' new label, which has signed Paul McCartney. \u001d  But food -- sandwiches, in particular, to boost lunchtime traffic -- is key to the company's initiative. Starbucks also is introducing both hot and cold breakfast items as it takes aim at rivals Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's. In more than 1,200 stores, the company has installed expensive, high-speed ovens made by Turbo-Chef (OVEN) that can reheat a breakfast dish in seconds, and more are being added almost daily. Food sales add roughly $35,000 a year to a store's volume, or an extra 3.5% to same-store sales. \u001d  Though Starbucks' top-line growth is rising, sales at stores open at least a year have been trending lower. Same-store sales rose 7% in fiscal '06, compared with 8% a year earlier and 10% in fiscal '04. \u001d  Profit margins, too, have been slipping, to 7.24% in the last fiscal year from 7.76% in fiscal '05 and 8.72% in fiscal '04. In part this reflects price increases enacted in earlier periods, as well as rising wages, higher-than-expected occupancy costs and upfront investments in international expansion. Real estate is Starbucks' biggest expense, followed by dairy. The company has hedged its coffee production four years into the future. \u001d  Same-store sales and margin comparisons for the current quarter will be tough. The figures, which will be reported in May, are unlikely to send the stock sharply higher. But third-quarter numbers, which will be measured against weaker results a year ago, are likely to generate more enthusiasm. Management has told the Street to expect 20% annual growth in net revenue and 20% to 25% annual growth in earnings for the next three to five years. \u001d  Looking much beyond that is unwise at this point, as is fixating on longtime rumors that Coca-Cola (KO) or PepsiCo (PEP) might buy the company. Instead, it's probably best to focus on just what Schultz and Donald do: Putting more brew in more customers' hands at an ever increasing rate, and enhancing what Schultz calls \"the Starbucks experience.\" \u001d  Make mine a double espresso. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ce0a836b3f7e05d8497407220e809a6c","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Volkswagen Welcomes Porsche Raising Stake In Co >VLKAY","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T13:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 09:52 ET (13:52 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cf97693c6340845ac6eeb8caba2f996b","symR":["DNA","NOVL","PWR","RHHBY","ROG.VX","CH0012032048"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) Research Reports: How Analysts Size Up Companies","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DNA","NOVL","PWR","RHHBY","ROG.VX","CH0012032048"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","CON","DRG","SOF","XDJGI","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSMI","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   Edited By Anita Peltonen \u001d  The research reports excerpted here were issued recently by investment firms.

On Friday, Tribune's stock rose 3.5%, or $1.03, to $30.53 as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Tribune has a market capitalization of about $7.3 billion. \u001d  Details of the Zell offer, which would take the company private, are still being negotiated. Since Tribune's board began exploring strategic alternatives in September, the process has taken many zigs and zags. \u001d  Mr. Zell's original proposal for the company was made after the deadline for bids in January, and his prospects looked dim as recently as a week ago. Tribune had earlier rejected several proposals from a variety of wealthy bidders, all of which it saw as disappointing. It had turned its focus toward doing a deal on its own involving the spinoff of its TV stations and payment of a dividend to shareholders. \u001d  But the board committee met this past week and decided to push to complete a deal with Mr. Zell, these people said. The committee had been concerned by the amount of debt entailed in Mr. Zell's proposal, some of which would be carried by an employee share-ownership plan he proposes to create to help finance the deal. Earlier this past week, Mr. Zell revised his offer, adding a small amount of cash to bring the total cash portion of the bid to above $300 million. \u001d  An internal restructuring also had become a less-attractive option because Tribune's special committee was pursuing a lower dividend payment than originally thought. Such a shift was unpopular with some investors -- particularly Tribune's biggest shareholder, the Chandler family, whose complaints about the company's stock price last summer precipitated the auction. \u001d  Even so, the situation is fluid and reaching an agreement with Mr. Zell hinges on a number of external factors. Winning regulatory approval could be tricky, because Tribune has gained an exemption from the Federal Communications Commission to own TV stations and newspapers in the same markets, something a new owner isn't necessarily guaranteed. The two sides were gauging how bond-rating agencies and banks would react to the additional debt load involved in the Zell deal, people familiar with the situation said. Tribune already is carrying $4.5 billion in debt. \u001d  Mr. Zell declined to comment. \u001d  --- \u001d  Dennis K.

Forsyth \u001d  The Federal Reserve eliminated the theoretical but highly unlikely chance of interest-rate increases, and global capital markets surged last week. Among the few lonely losers were long-dated Treasuries, which effectively have reversed their gains scored during the flight to quality after the subprime debacle moved to the front pages last month. \u001d  But the short end of the Treasury curve, which takes its cue from expected Fed actions, saw yields edge lower, with the two-year note ending the week at 4.61%, down from 4.63% the preceding Friday. In contrast, the benchmark 10-year note's yield moved up to 4.62% from 4.57%, and the 30-year bond's yield rose to 4.81% from 4.71%. \u001d  Those moves eliminated the inversion of the yield curve from two to 10 years, a sign that the market sees less chance of a rate hike after the Federal Open Market Committee omitted mention of \"additional policy firming\" from its statement Wednesday, following its two-day meeting. That temporarily boosted the odds in the federal-funds futures market of a rate cut by mid-year to 44%. But by Friday they were back down to 28%, about even with where they stood before the FOMC's statement, as stocks surged around the globe, hardly a sign of financial distress. \u001d  Meanwhile, the subprime mess has moved to center stage with the mainstream media putting on a full-court press and congressmen fulminating in hearings on Capitol Hill. That might tempt contrarians to think the worst is over, especially with news of seasonally adjusted upticks in housing starts and existing home sales in February. \u001d  But with credit standards tightening for lesser-quality buyers and foreclosures set to add to the inventories of unsold homes, it's unlikely the subprime debacle is over. The Fed didn't address the situation directly but it's certainly watching it. \b \u001d  Is what's good for GM good for the bond market? In its recently released 2006 annual report, General Motors (ticker: GM) revealed that its pension fund made a huge shift into global bonds, to 52% of assets. That represented an increase in fixed-income assets of about 20 percentage points, or $24 billion, in the portfolio. \u001d  The move, which took place at the end of last year and in early 2007, aims to dampen the future volatility of GM's pension plan, according to executives at the auto maker. It also recalls a similar shift that began several years ago at British corporations, which sharply increased the bond holdings in their pension funds. That change in British pension accounting has been credited with spurring the demand for bonds and holding down U.K. long-term interest rates. \u001d  But are the shifts into bonds by GM and U.K. firms harbingers of a similar reallocation of assets by other U.S. corporations? Maybe, but only if they're forced to do so. \u001d  For one thing, few other companies may be in GM's position to move heavily into bonds. Despite all the wailing about the General's problems stemming from so-called legacy costs for employee compensation, GM's pension plan actually is comfortably overfunded, to the tune of about $17 billion. As a result, the company can afford to shift into less-risky but lower-returning bonds for over half its pension portfolio. The remainder consists of 29% in global equities, 11% in alternative investments (such as private equity and hedge funds) and 8% in real estate. \u001d  Returns for the GM pension plan have been excellent -- 15% last year, about equal to the broad U.S. stock market but with less risk, given its relatively low stock weighting. But as it boosted the allocation to bonds, GM lowered its expected return on its overall portfolio to 8.5% from 9%. Assuming a 6% return from the bond portion, that implies optimistic assumptions about double-digit returns from the rest of the portfolio. \u001d  Still, GM's move represents a trend by corporations to manage the volatility not only of their pension assets, but also their liabilities, says Ronald J. Ryan, CEO of Ryan ALM, a pension consultant. \u001d  The present value of a company's liabilities depends on the interest rate at which they're discounted. The lower the rate, the higher the present value, which means the plan has to set aside more assets to meet those future liabilities. Juggling that funding ratio of assets versus liabilities has been a problem, especially since the tech bubble burst. Returns on assets plunged along with interest rates, which raised the present value of its liabilities, creating a vise squeezing both sides of pension funds' balance sheets. \u001d  Corporations must respond to this, Ryan contends. \"They have to go more into bonds to reduce the funding ratio volatility.\" \u001d  Why don't they? \"It may not be pretty for earnings,\" he says. \u001d  Shifting pension assets from equities to bonds may reduce the volatility of the funding ratio, but as with GM, it also means a lower assumed return on assets. That would require larger contributions to pension plans, at the expense of the bottom line. \u001d  The solution is to mark pension assets to market, says Ryan, who's been called Reverend Ron in the pension world for his evangelical fervor on the subject. \"After Enron and WorldCom, you'd think people would be mad as hell. Pensions are often the largest asset of a corporation but they also should be a moral obligation.\" This is partly addressed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board Number 158, which puts the excess of projected benefit liabilities over assets on the companies' balance sheet for companies reporting fiscal years ended after Dec. 15, 2006. Previously, this showed up only in the footnotes. \u001d  The world is slowly changing toward mark-to-market accounting, but won't completely until the rules change, Ryan says. Companies can choose between short-term profitability and long-term solvency. To Reverand Ron, the choice is obvious. But corporate executives thinking about their options grants and bonuses may be more inclined to invoke Keynes' dictum that in the long run, we're all dead. \u001d  --- \u001d  e-mail: randall.forsyth@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e6b0fd6a8ecd62c589e82dd0feef83ce","symR":["AAPL","FDX","MOT","US0378331005","US31428X1063","US6200761095"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) The Trader: The Patient's Improving, For Now","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAPL","FDX","MOT","US0378331005","US31428X1063","US6200761095"],"IndustryCodes":["AIF","CMT","CPR","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Kopin Tan \u001d  The progression of illness follows a typical arc: Symptoms surface. A diagnosis is rendered. Then comes a prescribed remedy and, possibly, recovery. \u001d  But for investors who had been fretting about the contagious spread of mortgage delinquencies, a benign economic prognosis from the Federal Reserve last week was all it took to feel sprightlier-and drive up stocks prices. In holding interest rates steady at 5.25%, the Fed also dispensed with a customary threat to tightenmonetary policy as needed. The famous phrase's conspicuous absence was interpreted, rightly or wrongly, as a willingness to begin cutting interest rates soon. \u001d  That mere whiff of a possible prescription was enough to send this patient into recovery. Stocks raced to their biggest one-day gain this year once the Fed statement hit the tape. The broad rally lifted all sectors, with financial stocks leading the way. Cash flow into U.S. mutual funds eventually topped $2.2 billion on the week -- the first time since July 2005, according to Banc of America Securities, that domestic-equity funds hauled in more cash than their overseas counterparts. \u001d  The Standard & Poor's 500 ended the week with its biggest point and percentage increase since March 2003, rising 49, or 3.5%, to 1436. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also snagged its largest point gain in four years, adding 371, or 3.1%, to 12,481. \u001d  The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 76, or 3.2%, to 2449, while the Russell 2000 index of small stocks climbed all five days to add 31, or 3.9%, to 810. Both had their best weeks since August 2006. \u001d  The rally returned all four benchmarks to their highest levels since the Feb. 27 selloff, and all four are in the black once again for the year. \u001d  Whether the market's suddenly improved sense of well-being is warranted remains to be seen. Barry Ritholtz, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Research & Analytics, likens investors' clamor for a possible rate cut to \"praying for chemotherapy.\" \u001d  \"The Fed begins cutting rates for two possible reasons -- when it's apparent that inflation is no longer a problem, which isn't the case here, or when economic growth slows dangerously,\" he says. Steady inflation gauges and firm commodity prices -- crude oil is at a three-month high, and copper prices are up 12% this month -- suggest inflation remains a threat. So was Dr. Bernanke more concerned about the economy than he lets on? \u001d  A surprising 3.9% rise in existing-home sales last month helped calm investors. But increasingly erratic housing data and blame heaped on fickle weather underscore the uncertainty about the depth of the housing slump -- even before subprime rot and tightening credit have wreaked their damage. \u001d  Merrill Lynch is tracking a 0.2% decline in leading economic indicators in March, which would mark the first three-month decline since the economy veered into recession in 2001. In a Merrill survey of 199 global money managers, 45% said the Fed should be more concerned about the threat of slower economic growth, versus 17% who fingered higher inflation. \u001d  Last week, warnings of sluggish profit growth from FedEx (ticker: FDX) and Motorola (MOT) offered yet another sign that corporate profits might have peaked and started their expected decline. But stocks' stubborn perch within striking distance of their bull-market highs points to an unyielding faith that though the rate of earnings growth will slip, actual earnings will continue to rise. \u001d  A rough survey of Wall Street firms finds many in a defensive crouch, loaded up on drugs and consumer staples. Viewed alongside stocks' surge, and signs of conscientious option hedging, it paints a picture of a crowd afraid to miss any bounce, but fearful the worst might not be over. \b \u001d  How staunch was the stock market's latest stand? Advancing stocks outpaced declining ones by 9 to 1  Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, the second time in a month the advance was so broad and insistent. This swift rebound suggests a crowd primed by recent history to anticipate a recovery. \u001d  Investor sentiment had turned bearish in late February, and put trading had jumped. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), the ratio of bullish calls purchased relative to puts dipped in early March to a year low of 0.58 to 1. It has since turned up. \u001d  Purchases of Rydex funds have hit four-year highs. The move to lessen risk exposure has been shallow, and the Chinese stock market, whose slippage triggered selling in the U.S., is back at record levels. How deep is despair that lasts a mere three weeks? \u001d  Birinyi Associates studied 10 Dow corrections of 5% or more since 1991. The declines averaged 9.2% and lasted 43 days. It took 136 days to make up the ground lost. \u001d  While stocks are now less overbought than in February, Morgan Stanley's chief investment strategist, Henry McVey, is among those questioning whether last week's spurt is sustainable in the short term. \"Clients have not really de-risked, earnings growth is coming in lower than expected, putting more pressure on multiple expansion, and the correction appears short-lived relative to history,\" he says. \u001d  How investors react as earnings season begins and as stocks once again approach their February highs will prove telling. Convincing volume and broad institutional participation will bode well for the market's recovery, but advances spearheaded by a narrowing group of stocks could point to a longer convalescence. \b \u001d  If there was ever a quiet time of the year for Apple (AAPL) fans, February and March might well be it. The heavy breathing in anticipation of new toys climaxed with January's MacWorld conference. Then came worries about a seasonally slower first half, and concerns that the launch of Microsoft's (MSFT) Vista operating system will eat into Mac's market share. \u001d  Yet Apple shares ticked up in last week's rally to 93.50, within reach of the stock's record January high. A successful test of that barrier could lift Apple above 100 and toward targets in the 115 to 125 range that bullish analysts say the company is worth. \u001d  Much of the recent hyperventilating was directed at the iPhone, which won't be available until summer. But any day now Apple TV will debut in stores across the country. For $299, the digitally savvy can play music, movies and videos stored on a home computer through television. Given the unknown potential, many analysts have yet to count Apple TV in their estimates, but a marginally successful rollout could snag a slice of the $26 billion market for DVDs and CDs. \u001d  Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore says it is conceivable that Apple TV will cannibalize 20% to 30% of the existing DVD market within several years. It \"opens substantial new market opportunities to Apple,\" he notes, and builds on Apple's stronghold in digital-content distribution. \u001d  That's not the only compelling catalyst. Barron's West Coast Editor Mark Veverka, who urged readers to buy Apple at its trough last summer (\"Mac Attack,\" July 17, 2006), sees a boost in Mac sales when \"Boot Camp\" gets delivered free this spring with Apple's new Leopard operating system. Boot Camp lets users run Windows on a Mac. \u001d  Recent handwringing over a Vista-inspired PC rush also might prove overwrought. While Mac sales could be muted in the March quarter, the wave of computer upgrades Vista is bound to spur will prompt consumers to evaluate their options. And that will allow Apple to sway some PC users its way. \u001d  Sure, demand for Apple gadgets will suffer if U.S. economic growth slows precipitously. But the brand's cachet and rabid following among the trendy and affluent provides some buffer. Sales of iPods, which have become ubiquitous in U.S. cities, are still growing rapidly in Europe and Asia. \u001d  Apple shares aren't cheap at 24 times expected earnings, but the stock's price-earnings multiple has been higher before. And a premium is warranted for profits projected to grow by 20% annually in the next five years, presuming Apple continues to capitalize on this still-budding digital product cycle. \u001d  --- \b                     VITAL SIGNS \b \b                            Friday's      Week's    Week's \b                               Close      Change     % Chg. \b \bDJ Industrials              12481.01     +370.60      +3.06 \bDJ Transportation            4973.27     +191.64      +4.01 \bDJ Utilities                  499.56      +21.00      +4.39 \bDJ 65 Stocks                 4316.20     +151.64      +3.64 \bDJ US Total Mkt               350.11      +12.14      +3.59 \bNYSE Comp.                   9338.40     +355.39      +3.96 \bAmex Comp.                   2150.21      +51.89      +2.47 \bS&P 500                      1436.11      +49.16      +3.54 \bS&P MidCap                    855.68      +31.79      +3.86 \bS&P SmallCap                  416.16      +16.28      +4.07 \bNasdaq                       2448.93      +76.27      +3.21 \bValue Line (arith.)          2325.00      +82.66      +3.69 \bRussell 2000                  809.51      +30.74      +3.95 \bDJ Wilshire 5000            14556.46     +502.08      +3.57 \b \b                                       Last Week   Week Ago \bNYSE \bAdvances                                   2,909      1,490 \bDeclines                                     621      2,046 \bUnchanged                                     75         70 \bNew Highs                                    418        207 \bNew Lows                                      40        128 \bAv Daily Vol (mil)                         2,888.0    2,808.8 \bDollar \b(Finex spot index)                            83.28      83.23 \bT-Bond \b(CBT nearby futures)                         111-27     112-28 \bCrude Oil \b(NYM light sweet crude)                       62.28      57.11 \bInflation KR-CRB \b(Futures Price Index)                        310.94     304.44 \bGold \b(CMX nearby futures)                         656.70     652.60 \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ea46072d8f20501a7c280b2c901de44e","symR":["ISTAX","JILSX"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(3/26) Fund Of Information: The Long And Short Of Long/Short Funds","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ISTAX","JILSX"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Lawrence C. Strauss \u001d  Some asset managers have seen the future of mutual funds, and it's in hedge funds -- that is, more funds will have the flexibility to short stocks and to employ leverage. \u001d  That's still a long way off, and it's hard to predict when it will become commonplace. But what is clear is how mutual funds that can also short stocks performed on Feb. 27. The U.S. market sold off steeply that day, following a big downturn in Chinese stocks. For long/short portfolio managers, it was like a pop quiz: How prepared were you for the big decline? \u001d  \"By and large, I think most of the funds did their job,\" says Todd Trubey, a fund analyst at Morningstar, who considers Feb. 27 a good litmus test. These funds, on average, lost 1.7% that day, he says. In comparison, the S&P 500 fell 3.46%. \u001d  Lipper's data show a somewhat worse picture, with long/short stock mutual funds off almost 2.40% on that miserable day last month. (Such funds vary considerably in their degree of short-selling, making comparisons tricky.) \u001d  Over longer stretches, long/short equity funds have turned in a solid performance. Trubey advises that they should \"play a supporting role\" in an investor's portfolio -- but shouldn't be considered a core holding. \"I wouldn't use them to replace bond funds, but they can play a role similar to bond funds,\" he continues. \"They help protect assets on the downside and provide diversification.\" \u001d  Just as hedge funds are supposed to do. \u001d  Another advantage that long/short mutual funds have for investors is lower costs. Hedge funds generally charge a management fee of 1% to 2%, plus 20% or more of annual profits. The JPMorgan Intrepid Long/Short Fund (ticker: JILSX) has an annual expense ratio of 1.50%, according to Morningstar. Some of these funds also have sales charges. Hedge funds would argue that investors get what they pay for. \u001d  Long/short equity mutual funds have a three-year annual return of 8.98%, versus the S&P's 10.11%, and a five-year gain of 4.35%, trailing the market by 1.21 percentage points, according to Lipper. \u001d  The Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index for long/short equity has a three-year annual gain of 11.17% and a five-year annual performance of 10.82% -- ahead of the comparable mutual funds. \u001d  On Feb. 27, a lot of these funds' returns resembled those of the overall market. The JPMorgan Intrepid Long/Short Fund fell 3.39% on the day, and the ICON Long/Short Fund (ISTAX) slumped 3.62%. The Intrepid fund is effectively 100% net long, once the long and short positions are added together, so the correlation with the market isn't surprising. \u001d  The Icon fund isn't market-neutral -- a term that means a fund's long positions are roughly equal to its short holdings. Instead, it takes a more opportunistic approach. Short positions account for only 3.8% of its $235 million portfolio, giving it a long bias. \"We're OK having exposure to the market when we see value in the market,\" says the fund's manager, J.C. Waller. \u001d  Waller's point is instructive. It's important for investors to be aware of a portfolio's holdings and strategy, its moniker notwithstanding. So even if it says long/short, it doesn't necessarily have a lot of short holdings. It can still have mucho beta, or market, exposure. This is often true as well for hedge funds, which tend to have higher correlations with the market when equities are rising. \u001d  As for Feb. 27, Waller says, \"We just rode through it and kept our eye on the horizon, not the wave.\" He refrained from making any trades that day. \u001d  The fund's longer-term track record is more impressive. Its I shares have a three-year annual return of 11.53%, beating the S&P by 1.42 percentage points. Waller predicts that this type of fund eventually will become more palatable as a core holding \"as alternative strategies become more mainstream.\" \u001d  That, of course, will hinge also on performance and investor fees. \u001d  And how did the hedge funds hold up on Feb. 27? \u001d  It's difficult to get performance data, which most hedge funds tend to guard zealously. But a look at one set of indexes points to declines, albeit not as severe as what the S&P 500 suffered through that day. \u001d  The HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index fell 1.37% on Feb. 27. A few of the indexes that gained ground included convertible arbitrage, up 0.52% on the day, and, not surprisingly, market-neutral, which climbed 0.46%. Macro funds took a big hit, falling 3.15%. \u001d  Far from an A, but not exactly an F, either. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"edb674f72b7ff14b3198db0c7223b172","symR":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Porsche Doesn't Seek Majority Takeover Of Volkswagen","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T13:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POR3.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006937733","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 09:28 ET (13:28 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f63211721894394b162d9ed7f70031d3","symR":["MEW.UN.T","CA5872891091"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Lawsuits Threatened As Recalled Food Blamed For 16 Pet Deaths","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T18:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MEW.UN.T","CA5872891091"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP"],"Story":"\b \u001d  ALBANY (AP)--Pet owners were rechecking their cabinets and threatening legal action after state officials said rat poison was found in pet food blamed for the deaths of at least 16 cats and dogs. \u001d  It was unclear how many deaths would eventually be linked to the \"cuts and gravy\" style food produced by Menu Foods Inc. (MEW.UN.T), but scientists said Friday they expected more would be announced. \u001d  The substance in the food was identified as aminopterin, a cancer drug that once was used to induce abortions in the U.S. and is still used to kill rats in some other countries, state Agriculture Commissioner Patrick Hooker said. \u001d  The federal government prohibits using aminopterin for killing rodents in the U.S. State officials would not speculate on how the poison got into the pet food, but said no criminal investigations had been launched. \u001d  The federal Food and Drug Administration has said the investigation into the pet deaths was focused on wheat gluten in the food. The gluten itself would not cause kidney failure, but it could have been contaminated, the FDA said. \u001d  Paul Henderson, chief executive of Menu Foods, confirmed Friday the wheat gluten was purchased from China. \u001d  Bob Rosenberg, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Pest Management Association, said it would be unusual for the wheat to be tainted. \u001d  \"It would make no sense to spray a crop itself with rodenticide,\" Rosenberg said, adding that grain shippers typically put bait stations around the perimeter of their storage facilities. \u001d  The pet deaths led to a recall of 60 million cans and pouches of dog and cat food produced by Menu Foods and sold throughout North America as \"cuts and gravy\" under 95 brand names. \u001d  After Friday's announcement, Menu Foods advised retailers to remove all affected products from their shelves regardless of the date it was packaged, a company spokesman said, though the recall still applies only to the dog and cat foods identified on its Web site since March 16. Those cover cans and pouches of food packaged from Dec. 3 through March 6. \u001d  \"The recall has not been expanded,\" Menu spokesman Sam Bornstein said Saturday. \u001d  Menu Foods, based in Ontario, Canada, said it would take responsibility for pet medical expenses incurred as a result of the tainted food, but it was cold comfort to the owners of pets sickened or killed. \u001d  \"Before they put this stuff in the bags, there should be some kind of test,\" said Jeff Kerner, whose Yorkshire terrier named Pebbles died Thursday. \"I can't just let it go. Even if they just change the law.\" \u001d  The dog had eaten some of the food, Kerner said, and he was contacting an attorney because he wanted to prevent another pet tragedy. \u001d  Some pets that ate the recalled brands suffered kidney failure, and the company has confirmed the deaths of 15 cats and one dog. However, pet owners and veterinarians said the tally could actually be higher, and other deaths were reported anecdotally around the country. \u001d  There is no risk to pet owners from handling the food, officials said. \u001d  Scientists at the New York State Animal Health Diagnostic Center at Cornell University and at the New York State Food Laboratory tested three cat food samples provided by the manufacturer and found aminopterin in two of them. The two labs are part of a network created after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to keep the nation's animals and food supply safe. \u001d  \"Any amount of this product is too much in food,\" Hooker said. \u001d  Aminopterin is highly toxic in high doses. It inhibits the growth of malignant cells and suppresses the immune system. In dogs and cats, the amount of aminopterin found - 40 parts per million - can cause kidney failure, according to Bruce Akey, director of Cornell's diagnostic center. \u001d  \"It's there in substantial amounts,\" Akey said. \u001d  Donald Smith, dean of Cornell's veterinary school, said he expected the number of pet deaths to increase. \"Based on what we've heard the last couple days, 16 is a low number,\" Smith said. \u001d  Aminopterin is no longer marketed as a cancer drug, but is still used in research, said Andre Rosowsky, a chemist with the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. \u001d  Rosowsky speculated that the substance would not show up in pet food \"unless somebody put it there.\" \u001d  Henderson said Menu Foods does not believe the food was tampered with because the recalled food came from two different plants, one in Kansas, one in New Jersey. Menu continues to produce food at the two plants. \u001d  The company, already facing lawsuits, said Friday it is testing all the ingredients that go into the food. \u001d  \"We have a lot of work to do, and we are eager to get back to it,\" Henderson said. \"This is a highly unusual substance.\" \u001d  When asked whether there would compensation for medical bills for sick pets, Henderson said \"to the extent that we identify that the cause of any expenses incurred are related to the food, Menu will take responsibility for that.\" \u001d  A complete list of the recalled products along with product codes, descriptions and production dates was posted online by Menu Foods and is available at http://tinyurl.com/2pn6mm. The company also designated two phone numbers that pet owners could call for information: (866) 463-6738 and (866) 895-2708. \u001d  --- \u001d  On the Net: \u001d  FDA pet food recall information: http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/petfood.html \u001d  Menu Foods: http://tinyurl.com/2pn6mm \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 14:02 ET (18:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fb3967bd190b6e8afe5c6d95e3bf957e","symR":["ABT","BSX","JNJ","MDT","US0028241000","US4781601046"],"date":"2007-03-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Abbott's Xience Stent Meets Goals In Key Trial","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-24T16:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABT","BSX","JNJ","MDT","US0028241000","US4781601046"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","MDV","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Jon Kamp \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW ORLEANS (Dow Jones)--A pivotal trial for Abbott Laboratories Inc.'s (ABT) \"Xience\" drug-coated stent met its main and secondary goals, putting the company in position to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the device. \u001d  Xience is seen by analysts as a key entry in the market for coated stents - a market that has been dinged recently by concerns over device safety. In the Spirit III trial on Xience released Saturday, at the American College of Cardiology's annual conference, Abbott's stent performed better than the blockbuster stent Taxus made by Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) in certain measures of performance. \u001d  The goal of the trial was to prove that Xience was not worse than Taxus, which is the top selling stent in the U.S. \u001d  \"We not only hit the endpoint, but we hit it by a margin,\" said John M. Capek, senior vice president of Abbott's vascular business. \u001d  Meantime, further results were made available from another, longer-term study on the Xience stent, where the device also showed favorable results in a match-up with Taxus. \u001d  The Xience data are partly supportive for Boston Scientific, though, as it has the rights to sell Xience under a different name through an agreement with Abbott linked to last year's purchase of Guidant Corp. \u001d  Xience went on sale in Europe and parts of Asia last fall. Based on the Spirit III results, Abbott continues to plan a filing with the FDA in the second quarter this year, and to target approval for Xience to enter the nearly $3 billion U.S. market in the first half of 2008, Capek said. \u001d  Stents are tiny metal devices that prop open arteries, and drug-coated stents like Xience use medication to combat renarrowing. \u001d  The Spirit III trial included 1,002 patients and had a primary goal of avoiding renarrowing. On that measurement, known as \"in-segment late loss,\" Xience led to a 50% reduction compared with Taxus at eight months. \u001d  In a secondary goal of avoiding \"target vessel failure,\" which measures re-treatment anywhere within the vessel at issue, and also cardiac death and heart attacks, Xience was non-inferior compared with Taxus. Xience showed a lower rate, at 7.2% compared with 9% for Taxus, but the difference isn't considered statistically significant. \u001d  On another secondary goal of the trial, measuring the avoidance of \"major adverse cardiac events\" like death, heart attacks or the need for retreatment, Xience also performed better than Taxus. There was a 4.6% rate of such events at nine months with Xience compared with an 8.1% rate with Taxus. \b \b Impact For Boston Scientific \b \u001d  Thought the Spirit III data makes Boston Scientific's Taxus look inferior in certain respects, the company can market a version of Xience under the name Promus. Boston Scientific recently launched Promus in Europe. \u001d  The company would have to sell far more Promus stents than Taxus stents, though, to make up for lost Taxus contributions, as Abbott gets a big portion of profits on every Promus sale. On the other hand, Abbott will pay Boston Scientific $500 million based on Xience regulatory approval - half when the device is approved in the U.S., and the other half when approval comes in Japan. \u001d  The profit-sharing deal is connected to the acquisition of Guidant by Boston Scientific and Abbott last year. Boston Scientific bought the bulk of Guidant while Abbott bought Guidant's vascular business, and struck a deal with Boston Scientific to share the rights to Guidant's coated-stent program. \u001d  The deal proved fortuitous for Abbott last October, when the company cancelled its home-grown ZoMaxx stent program amid poor trial data. \u001d  Though the market for drug-coated stents has been hurt by concerns about links to clots, contributing to weaker stent sales among established players like Boston Scientific and J&J, it's still an emerging opportunity for Abbott. \u001d  Abbott's vascular division, which includes stents, posted revenue of $1.08 billion last year. The company has said it aims to ramp up vascular sales to about $3 billion by 2009. \u001d  In reports issued before the Spirit III data was released, analysts pointed to Xience's potential to be a major player in the stent market. Banc of America analyst Glenn Novarro estimated Xience sales of $279 million this year, and said that, over a longer term, \"we believe that Xience can capture up to 25% of the global market.\" \u001d  Additionally, \"We believe that Xience possesses market-leading potential, and we are encouraged by the platform's success to date in the EU,\" Novarro said. \u001d  Banc of America lead or co-managed a securities offering for Abbott and Boston Scientific in the last year, and has had an investment banking relationship with the companies. \b \b Longer-Term Data \b \u001d  The clotting concerns grew over the last year amid signs that first-generation coated stents can cause a slightly elevated risk of clots over time compared with bare-metal stents. Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) lead the global coated-stent market, and have the only two devices currently approved in the U.S. \u001d  An FDA advisory panel determined in December that, while the devices from Boston Scientific and J&J seem to carry a small elevated risk of clots, the risk doesn't translate to a higher rate of heart attacks and deaths when the stents are used under FDA-approved guidelines. But the performance of the devices is less definitive in so-called \"off-label\" cases, which make up more than 60% of stent usage. \u001d  Coming devices from Abbott and Medtronic Inc. (MDT) have shown a good safety profile in studies to date. \u001d  On the issue of \"late stent thrombosis,\" or clots that appear after a month, one of 653 patients treated with Xience in Spirit III developed a clot, while there were no events among the 320 patients treated with Taxus. The difference was not considered statistically significant. \u001d  Looking out further, the Spirit II trial on Xience, which covers fewer patients out to one year, continued to show good performance in avoiding clots. Using new definitions of clotting produced last fall to create a common way to track clots, there were zero cases of late stent thrombosis with Xience in that study. \u001d  Among 300 patients in Spirit II, Xience showed a 71% reduction in major adverse cardiac events at one year compared with Taxus. \u001d  -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 24, 2007 12:00 ET (16:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."}]
