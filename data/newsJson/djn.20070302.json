Late Thursday Mediaset, Italy's largest private broadcaster and controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, warned that preliminary estimates showed its net profit for 2006 should be EUR505 million, well below EUR603.4 million in 2005, as consolidated advertising revenue fell. \u001d  Mediaset Thursday said 2006 gross Italian advertising revenue was EUR2.85 billion, down from EUR2.96 billion in 2005. \u001d  That was below the company's previous forecast, which was for the 2006 number to be broadly in line with 2005. \u001d  The drop reflected the change in Mediaset's advertising bookings policy. The company said revenue from some contracts sealed late in 2006 will be booked in 2007 accounts. \u001d  Nieri said a change in revenue bookings unveiled in a statement Thursday was \"an accounting operation which is absolutely transparent.\" \u001d  \"We have no difficulties to explain that to the market,\" she said. \u001d  Speaking at the conference, Nieri said 2006 was a tough year, with a difficult advertising market, but Mediaset was still able to post \"a relevant result\" in terms of net profit. \u001d  At 1135 GMT, Mediaset shares were 50 cents, or 5.7%, at EUR8.28, while the main Milan market index was slightly lower. \u001d  Nieri brushed off suggestions the sharp drop in the share price suggested Mediaset might have a credibility problem with investors. \u001d  \"We've been listed for 10 years and never had any kind of problem,\" she said. \u001d  Separately, in an exclusive interview with Italian business television channel Class CNBC, Mediaset Chief Executive Giuliano Adreani said the company was interested in Dutch TV program maker Endemol Entertainment Holding NV (34569.AE). Spanish firm Telefonica SA (TEF) is close to selling a 75% stake in Endemol. \u001d  \"It's a question of time and talks,\" Adreani said, when asked to explain Mediaset's interest in Endemol. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.mediaset.com \u001d  -By Giada Zampano and Sabrina Cohen, Dow Jones Newswires; 39-02-5821 9901; giada.zampano@dowjones.com \u001d  (Kenneth Maxwell in Milan contributed to this report) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:07 ET (12:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"061744f08279d8a72c80565e29f1b814","symR":["RIV"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Riviera Reports Record Results for 2006","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RIV"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LAS VEGAS, March 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Riviera Holdings Corporation (Amex: RIV) today reported financial results for the three-month and the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2006.  The Company reported record Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, and operating income for 2006. \b \b    Consolidated 2006 Results \b \u001d  Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $200.9 million, a decrease of $1.3 million or less than one percent from the same period in 2005.  The decrease in net revenue was primarily related to the leasing of the gift shops at Riviera Las Vegas to ABC Stores in February 2006.  The gifts shops were previously owned and operated by the Company.  In addition, Riviera Las Vegas discontinued two shows, in late 2005 and in the fall of 2006.  These revenue declines in Las Vegas were offset by a $2.8 million increase in Las Vegas gaming revenues and a $1.5 million increase in cash room revenues. Improvements in the average daily rate and targeted slot marketing efforts contributed to these increases. \b \u001d  Income from operations was $25.4 million, an increase of $3.0 million or 13.5 percent from 2005, and a record for the Company.  Included in income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was an expense of $1.3 million and income of $65,000 respectively in mergers, acquisitions and development costs, net of a non-refundable fee paid to the Company in 2005. Adjusted EBITDA (1) was $41.1 million, an increase of $1.0 million or 2.6 percent from the same period in 2005, and a record for the Company. \b \u001d  The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $335,000, or $0.03 per share, compared with a net loss of $4.0 million, or $0.34 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. \b \b \b    2006 Developments \b \b    *  Riviera Las Vegas net revenue decreased $1.5 million or 1.0 percent \b    *  Riviera Las Vegas Property EBITDA was $28.1 million, an increase of \b       4.8 percent \b    *  Riviera Black Hawk net revenue was $51.7 million, an increase of \b       0.4 percent \b    *  Riviera Black Hawk Property EBITDA was $16.8 million, a decrease of \b       2.6 percent \b \b    Fourth Quarter 2006 \b \u001d  Net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2006 were $46.5 million, an increase of $300,000 over the fourth quarter of 2005.  The increase in net revenues were generated from increased casino and room revenues in Las Vegas offset by decreases in the entertainment and other revenues in Las Vegas and a decrease in casino revenues in Black Hawk, as a result of the effects of the snow storms in the Denver area during December 2006.  The Colorado snow storms resulted in approximately $1.0 million in lost casino revenues; however, this loss in Black Hawk was offset by the favorable effects of a new slot product and upgrades to the casino floor in 2006. \b \u001d  Income from operations was $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $2.0 million or 75.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2005. Included in income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $3,000 in asset impairment costs compared to $579,000 in 2005, which was related to a write off associated with a proposed walkway to a competitor's property.  Net loss for the quarter of $1.6 million, or $0.13 per share, was an improvement of $2.3 million from the fourth quarter of 2005 when the Company reported a net loss of $3.9 million. \b \u001d  Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, was $8.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $8.2 million in 2005, an improvement of 5.5 percent. Adjusted EBITDA (1) consists of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, equity-based compensation, asset impairments, Sarbanes-Oxley Act expenses, and mergers, acquisitions and development costs, as shown in the reconciliation to net income in the tables and notes of this release. \b \b \b    Fourth Quarter 2006 Developments \b \b    *  Riviera Las Vegas net revenue increased $530,000 or 1.6 percent \b    *  Riviera Las Vegas Property EBITDA was $5.5 million compared to \b       $4.5 million in 2005 \b    *  Riviera Black Hawk net revenue decreased $230,000 or 1.8 percent \b    *  Riviera Black Hawk Property EBITDA was $4.1 million, a decrease of \b       10.7 percent \b    *  The Company has $25.3 million in cash plus a $30 million revolver which \b       was fully available as of December 31, 2006 compared to $20.6 million \b       at December 31, 2005 \b \b    Riviera Las Vegas \b \u001d  \"At the Riviera, we continue to focus on providing our customers great value for their Las Vegas Strip experience.  We have invested and will continue to invest in upgrades to our facility and slot mix, as well as continuing to implement key marketing programs for the value-oriented Las Vegas Strip customer,\" said Robert Vannucci, President of Riviera Las Vegas. \b \u001d  \"Our occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 92.2 percent and consistent with the same period in 2005.  However, our revenue per available room rate (RevPar) for 2006 was $72.37 compared to $66.51 in 2005, an 8.8 percent increase.  Our average daily win per slot unit increased for the fourth quarter of 2006 to $131.67 compared to $97.48 in the fourth quarter of 2005.  We have upgraded our slot mix and reengineered the slot floor to cater to the demands of our customers.  These changes have been very favorably received, and we will continue to provide capital for upgrades to the property,\" said Mr. Vannucci. \b \b    Riviera Black Hawk \b \u001d  William L. Westerman, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, said, \"We are pleased with the performance of our Black Hawk property given the significant weather issues encountered during the fourth quarter of 2006.  Our strong EBITDA margin and a fair share of over 142 percent for the quarter and 134 percent for the year, are a testament to our team and the quality of our property within the Black Hawk market.\" \b \b    Consolidated Operations \b \u001d  Mr. Westerman said, \"The Company recorded record results for 2006 as evidenced by our operating income and Adjusted EBITDA, which we believe are a result of capital improvements and targeted marketing efforts at both locations.  We continue to evaluate our debt structure, and given the call premium reduction on our Senior Secured Notes in June of this year and the current rate environment, we believe that conditions may be favorable for a refinancing of our notes as a means to free up additional cash for the continued reinvestment in our properties.  Our results for 2006 generated an all-time record for the Company.  In light of the number of distractions during the past year related to the potential sale of the Company, I am very pleased with our team members and their performance.\" \b \b    Conference Call Information \b \u001d  In conjunction with the release of fourth quarter 2006 financial results, Riviera will broadcast a conference call at 2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today, Friday, March 2, 2007.

She said it was hard to go into great detail about the cause and effects until the U.K.'s Trading Standards Office released their test results later Friday. \u001d  Tesco PLC  (TSCO.LN) has also begun to focus its own tests on silicon. In a statement released late Thursday the retailer said: \"Following advice from industry experts we have now started testing for silicon and other possible contaminants. We are also checking the levels at which any contaminant would start to cause engine problems. We hope to have results back soon.\" \u001d  The source of the contaminated gasoline has been traced back to Greenergy, a U.K. biofuels supplier which transported the gasoline from a Vopak storage facility in West Thurrock, Essex. Vopak, headquartered in the Netherlands, specializes in storing oil and chemical products. \u001d  A Vopak spokesman said: \"We are trying to work out what the cause of the contamination is and the trail that the gasoline has followed, but like everyone else we are awaiting the test results. It is far more complex than we originally thought but we feel that we are getting a bit closer to the answer.\" \u001d  Tesco, WM Morrisons PLC (MRW.LN), J Sainsburys PLC (JSAIY) and Asda, the U.K. arm of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), have all been named as selling contaminated gasoline. \u001d  Scientists say that when gasoline containing silicon burns, it forms silicon-dioxide which then forms a very thin sheet on the sensor in the exhaust of the vehicle. This probably gives a false signal to engine computer causing problems. \u001d  Spokesman Nick Vanderwell for the U.K. Petroleum Industry Association has recommended caution about jumping to conclusions. \"Silicon is only one of many possible contaminants.

(NEW), whose shares have fallen by nearly half since it reported deteriorating fundamentals at its lending operation Feb. 7, said late Thursday that it wouldn't file its annual report on time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u001d  New Century became at least the second lender in the heavily troubled sector to delay the key filing this week. On Tuesday, Fremont General Corp. (FMT) also said it would delay its annual filing. The decision sent its shares down some 24% the following day. \u001d  Companies that make mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit have been hammered by a wave of delinquencies stemming largely from a deterioration in lending standards last year as the slowing housing market pinched volumes. Their struggles have produced broader ripples of concern about the health of the U.S. economy and have contributed to a wave of risk aversion that led to a selloff in U.S. stocks this week. \u001d  New Century didn't give a reason for the delayed filing, and officials weren't available to comment, as the company disclosed the news around 10:20 p.m. EST, after its business hours. The short press release only said the company expected to submit a notice of late filing for its annual report to the SEC on Friday. \u001d  New Century said late Feb. 7 it will restate financial results for the first three quarters of 2006 to correct accounting errors regarding the company's allowance for loan-repurchase losses. The company postponed reporting its fourth-quarter results and said it expects a loss for the period. \u001d  The Irvine, Calif., real estate investment trust also said it expects its loan production to drop 20% in 2007 as the company tightens its underwriting standards due to early defaults on its loans and expected guidance from regulators. New Century previously said it expected its loan production to be flat in 2007. \u001d  The trouble in subprime is also affecting larger companies. On Feb. 7, HSBC Holdings PLC (HBC), one of the world's largest banks, said it was putting aside an extra $1.76 billion - 20% more than analysts had expected - to cover bad debts, largely due to higher than expected losses on U.S. subprime mortgages. \u001d  And on Thursday, General Motors Corp. (GM), the world's largest auto maker, disclosed that it will need more time to file its 2006 annual report with the SEC. Many analysts attribute the delay to a substantial hit GM might take from the exposure its part-owned finance unit - GMAC Financial Services - has to the subprime mortgage business. \u001d  -By Andrew Dowell, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5175; andrew.dowell@dowjones.com \u001d  (Lingling Wei contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:32 ET (12:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"06a9a3ae8b91fa00a4cc750a9b29cc21","symR":["UKDAY"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"DOW JONES GLOBAL INDEXES - LEADERS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b                 Leading Industry Groups \b           and Strongest Stocks in Each Group \b \b(Index values based on U.S. dollars; based on ICB universe; \ball stock prices are in local currency) \b                                 Index/       Net   Percent \b                              Stk Price    Change    Change \bSteel                            267.29      2.23      0.84 \b  QuintainStll(TW)                 8.14      0.53      6.96 \b  KHCIron&St(TW)                   6.71      0.43      6.85 \b  ChieShinStl(TW)                 12.10      0.75      6.61 \bFood Products                    231.11      1.36      0.59 \b  PacAndesHold (SG)                0.93      0.03      3.33 \b  TongYangConf(SK)            237000.00   7500.00      3.27 \b  Fujiya Co(JP)                  264.00      8.00      3.13 \bApparel Retailers                382.39      1.53      0.40 \b  UtdArrows(JP)                 2435.00    125.00      5.41 \b  PointInc(JP)                  7670.00    390.00      5.36 \b  AoyamaTrd(JP)                 3730.00    110.00      3.04 \bNonferrous Metals                363.64      1.27      0.35 \b  SumitomoMetMin(JP)            2240.00    125.00      5.91 \b  TohoZinc(JP)                  1148.00     22.00      1.95 \b  Thye-MingInd(TW)                28.10      0.20      0.72 \bPaper                            150.75      0.41      0.27 \b  NorskeSkogsFr(NW)              107.00      4.00      3.88 \b  Holmen B(SW)                   288.00      7.50      2.67 \b  Billerud(SW)                   105.00      2.50      2.44 \bPersonal Products                389.85      0.97      0.25 \b  BeautChina(SG)                   1.03      0.03      3.00 \b  Kao Cp(JP)                    3460.00     70.00      2.06 \b  SvenskCellB(SW)                365.00      6.00      1.67 \bHome Construction                213.23      0.52      0.24 \b  SekisuiHouse(JP)              1798.00     50.00      2.86 \b  SekisuiChem(JP)                987.00     23.00      2.39 \b  MisawaHome(JP)                2840.00     55.00      1.97 \bDelivery Services                598.39      1.14      0.19 \b  Kintetsu(JP)                  3890.00    150.00      4.01 \b  YusenAirSea(JP)               2970.00     95.00      3.30 \b  DeutshcePost(GR)                24.14      0.21      0.88 \bTelecommunications Equipment     281.41      0.52      0.19 \b  D-Link(TW)                      48.30      1.50      3.21 \b  IntracomHold(ER)                 4.34      0.12      2.84 \b  Tandberg(NW)                   110.25      2.25      2.08 \bIndustrial Machinery             113.72      0.20      0.18 \b  BodycoteIntl(UK)                 3.16      0.58     22.48 \b  ToriHold(JP)                    34.00      2.00      6.25 \b  HeidelbergerDruck(GR)           32.75      1.74      5.61 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:40 ET (11:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"06f624cf157f6e86f9aa826f75f44b9d","symR":["2888.HK","STAN.LN","GB0004082847"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UBS Upgrades Standard Chartered To Buy From Neutral","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T05:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["2888.HK","STAN.LN","GB0004082847"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:06 ET (05:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"07297dec91567d7d0fe79a0dee3f5ba0","symR":["LSI"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9738956],"ret5":[0.9809237],"Headline":": LSI Logic to Present at Morgan Stanley Technology Conference","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LSI"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MILPITAS, Calif., March 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- LSI Logic Corporation (NYSE: LSI) today announced that Abhi Talwalkar, President and Chief Executive Officer, will present at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference in San Francisco, Calif., on Monday, March 5, 2007, at 3:45 p.m. Pacific Time. \b \u001d  A live webcast of the presentation may be viewed by visiting the LSI Logic website at http://www.lsi.com/investors.

But lawyers for Vivendi say the German company has repeatedly ignored similar rulings in the past. \u001d  Vivendi's latest move opens a new chapter in the battle between the two European companies over the control of Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa, the leading wireless operator in Poland, the paper reports. \u001d  In October, Vivendi filed a $7.5 billion suit under the RICO law contending that Deutsche Telekom had conspired to cheat Vivendi out of its investment in the Polish company. Vivendi says it now has neither its shares nor compensation for them. \u001d  Deutsche Telekom, in reporting its quarterly earnings this week, said Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa had been consolidated within its operations since November. \u001d  On Feb. 20, Vivendi filed a 54-page amendment to its RICO complaint, asserting, among other things, that U.S. investors had been harmed by Deutsche Telekom's takeover of the company. \u001d  Vivendi lawyers also say they now have documents proving the illegal secret transfer of shares of the Polish company to Deutsche Telekom, which they say were discovered stored in a Polish courthouse in November, the Times reports. \u001d  The Times reports that perhaps the most significant new assertion in the amended complaint is that Deutsche Telekom's acquisition of the shares could have inflated its asset base, putting T-Mobile USA in a stronger position to support its successful $4 billion bid in a wireless spectrum auction by Federal Communications Commission that ended in September. Vivendi contends that T-Mobile's ability to raise capital for such transactions was based on false reports. \u001d  It argues that the defendants used phone and e-mail networks in the United States to perpetrate a crime, bringing the case under American jurisdiction. \u001d  Officials of T-Mobile USA, based in Bellevue, Wash., declined to comment on the case. Michael Lange, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom in Bonn, Germany, said, \"We shall answer these wayward allegations before the court.\" \u001d  Newsapaper Web Site: http://www.nytimes.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 01:03 ET (06:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0911ae64ad3a3d5d8ca86515b110fe2a","symR":["INQ.T","CA45769T1021"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Inscape Corporation Announces -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["INQ.T","CA45769T1021"],"IndustryCodes":["FTR","HPR"],"Story":"\b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \bLIABILITIES \bCURRENT \b Accounts payable and accrued \b  liabilities                                $    12,739       $    10,025 \bOTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS                          958             1,129 \bFUTURE INCOME TAX LIABILITY                        4,272             4,936 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                                  17,969            16,090 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \bSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY \bSHARE CAPITAL                                     57,059            57,059 \bCONTRIBUTED SURPLUS                                   84                84 \bDEFICIT                                           (3,740)           (4,727) \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                                  53,403            52,416 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                             $    71,372       $    68,506 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b \bINSCAPE CORPORATION \bCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS \bUnaudited (in thousands, except per share amounts) \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                            Three Months Ended           Nine Months Ended \b                      January 31    January 31    January 31    January 31 \b                            2007          2006          2007          2006 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \bSALES                 $   24,296    $   21,372    $   67,475    $   70,395 \bCOST OF GOODS SOLD        17,700        16,184        49,805        53,581 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bGROSS MARGIN               6,596         5,188        17,670        16,814 \b \bEXPENSES \b Selling, general and \b  administrative           6,052         6,345        17,199        18,763 \b Restructuring costs \b  and asset impairment \b  (Note 6)                  (151)            -

Diluted EPS were $1.14, up 28.1%. ROE was 27.3%, compared to 23.9% a year ago. This growth was largely attributable to strong earnings across all our business segments including an increase of 31% in RBC Canadian Personal and Business, 27% in RBC Capital Markets and 48% in RBC U.S. and International Personal and Business. \b \bCommenting on the results, Gordon M. Nixon, President & CEO, said, \"We have started 2007 with outstanding results that reflect continued investments in all our business segments. Execution of our strategic initiatives is helping us improve market share in Canada and expand our businesses globally.\" \b \bTotal revenue increased $738 million, or 15%, from a year ago primarily due to solid growth in our wealth management and banking businesses driven by expansion, targeted acquisitions and the successful execution of our strategic initiatives. Stronger equity and debt trading results due to significant transactions and increased revenue from certain equity trading strategies also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by lower insurance-related revenue mainly due to the negative impact of the implementation of the new financial instruments accounting standards which was largely offset in insurance policyholder benefits, claims and acquisition expense. \b \bNon-interest expense increased $316 million, or 11%, from a year ago primarily due to higher variable compensation on improved business performance. Higher costs in support of our growth, including increased staffing levels in our distribution network and additional branches, also contributed to the increase. \b \bTotal provision for credit losses increased $115 million from a year ago, primarily reflecting a $50 million reversal of the general allowance in the prior year and lower corporate recoveries this quarter. Higher provisions in our personal unsecured credit line, small business and credit card portfolios in the current period also contributed to the increase. \b \bInsurance policyholder benefits, claims and acquisition expense decreased $136 million, or 21%, from the prior year. The decrease mainly reflected the positive impact of the implementation of the new financial instruments accounting standards, and the prior year hurricane-related charge. These factors were partially offset by growth in our European life reinsurance and domestic businesses. \b \bIncome tax expense increased $103 million, or 31%, over the prior year largely commensurate with higher earnings before income taxes. The effective income tax rate of 22.3% in the current quarter compares to 22.0% a year ago. \b \bRBC Canadian Personal and Business net income increased $208 million, or 31%, from a year ago. This was largely due to strong growth across all business lines, reflecting the ongoing successful execution of our growth initiatives. The improvement in our results also reflected the prior year hurricane-related charge and a favourable adjustment related to the reallocation of foreign investment capital in the current quarter. \b \bRBC U.S. and International Personal and Business net income increased $48 million, or 48%, from the prior year. In U.S. dollars, net income was up US$40 million, or 45%, largely driven by the successful execution of our growth initiatives including the acquisition of Flag Financial Corporation (Flag). \b \bRBC Capital Markets net income increased $90 million, or 27%, from a year ago largely driven by broad-based growth across most businesses and product categories. \b \bCompared to the fourth quarter of 2006, our consolidated net income increased $232 million, or 18%, and diluted EPS rose $.18, or 19%. This increase largely reflected higher trading results in RBC Capital Markets, strong earnings growth across all business lines in RBC Canadian Personal and Business and solid business growth in RBC U.S. and International Personal and Business due to the successful execution of our growth initiatives including the acquisition of Flag. These factors were partially offset by higher variable compensation primarily in RBC Capital Markets due to stronger business performance. \b \bAs at January 31, 2007, the Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.2% was down from 9.5% a year ago, and down from 9.6% at the end of the previous quarter as the increase in risk-adjusted assets related to our lending and trading activities exceeded our strong internal capital generation. The Total capital ratio of 11.2% was down 160 basis points (bps) from 12.8% a year ago, and down 70 bps from 11.9% last quarter. \b \b \b    << \b    ------------------- \b    (1) Effective November 1, 2006, results reported on a total consolidated \b        basis are comparable to results reported as from continuing \b        operations for the corresponding prior periods. \b    >> \b \b \bPRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S MESSAGE \b \bOur earnings this quarter of $1.49 billion were driven by revenue growth in most business lines as we continued to execute growth initiatives in Canada and abroad. This performance reflected the strength of our diverse group of businesses globally. \b \bIn Canada, we have expanded our sales force and opened branches to extend our distribution network and build capacity around client relationships. In the U.S., we have completed key acquisitions and are continuing to expand our distribution network to help us pursue our growth initiatives. Globally, we continued to introduce new products and solutions to meet our clients' needs. We also continued to invest in technologies to make doing business with us even easier.  These efforts have helped improve our market share in Canada and grow our businesses globally. We have deployed capital through asset growth in our businesses, targeted acquisitions, dividends and share buybacks, all of which are helping to generate strong returns for our shareholders. \b \bOur 2007 annual objectives were established at the end of 2006 based on our economic and business outlooks. Our first quarter results are tracking well to these objectives: \b \b \b    << \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                                                    Q1 2007 \b                                                2007 Objectives   Performance \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    1.

Our three-month operating leverage of 6% compares with our objective of greater than 3%. We have maintained a solid capital position, with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.2%, which remains comfortably above our target of greater than 8%. In light of our continuing strong earnings, we are raising our quarterly common share dividend by $.06, or 15%, to $.46 in the second quarter to help us achieve our 2007 dividend payout objective of 40 - 50%. \b \b \b    << \b    We continued to make progress on our strategic goals this quarter. \b \b    1.

With total assets of $2.12 billion, the fund has not done particularly well of late. \u001d  The Eaton Vance Worldwide Health Sciences Fund has underperformed its specialty health category in the last four years, according to Morningstar Inc. \u001d  Last year, the fund's return was flat, at a time when the Standard & Poor's 500 Index recorded a total return of 15.8%. For the year through Wednesday, the fund is down 0.2% compared with the 0.5% decline in the S&P 500. For three years, the fund's annual return is 2.9%, trailing the S&P 500's 9.1% annualized return, Morningstar said. \u001d  Amgen Inc. (AMGN) is one of the fund's top picks. Isaly thinks the stock's recent fall - due to disappointing patient studies for its anemia drugs - is unmerited and that the stock is cheap. \u001d  Amgen shares have declined about 17% since hitting a 52-week high of $77 in late October, trading recently around $64. The stock now trades around 16 times Amgen's projected 2007 earnings, about half the price-to-earnings ratio of rival biotech Genentech Inc. (DNA), which is another of the fund's top holdings. \u001d  \"We do expect growth, we like the pipeline,\" Isaly said. \u001d  He is confident about Amgen's experimental osteoporosis drug, denosumab, which is said to increase bone-mineral density. Osteoporosis is a threat for an estimated 44 million Americans and therefore promises to be a huge market if Amgen's drug is approved. \u001d  Isaly is also a fan of Fred Hassan, the chief executive of Schering-Plough Corp. (SGP), who has won a lot of respect in the industry and is credited with turning around the company in the last few years. \u001d  Isaly said while the earnings growth is off a low base, he sees a return to normal margins and then continued growth. \u001d  \"It's also bite-sized for a combination with someone else,\" he adds. \u001d  But the fund has also broadened to owning medical-device companies of late, and has hired an analyst just to cover this sector. \u001d  Among the top picks in this field are Align Technology (ALGN), a medical-device company that makes removable aligners for teeth, and Lifecell Corp. (LIFC), which designs and makes tissue grafts and blood-cell preservation products. \u001d  \"Those two companies are specialty companies...but we like them for their specialty nature and their rapid growth,\" Isaly said. \u001d  Align shares have risen about 22% year-to-date. Lifecell reported Thursday its fourth-quarter net income rose 63%, to 18 cents a share, from one year earlier. \u001d  The fund, given its name, has also benefited from moving abroad, especially into Japan. The fund has about 25% of its stocks invested overseas. \u001d  It holds Japanese drug makers Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502.TO) and Astellas Pharma Inc. (4503.TO). Japanese drug makers have inexpensive valuations, Isaly said, and also benefit from growth in the U.S. market. \u001d  Isaly said he has learnt from the fund's losses in 2006. The turnover at the fund has increased, with the fund now quicker to sell stocks that have enjoyed a run-up.

Constellation earned $1.59 a share the previous fiscal year. Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings of $1.67 for fiscal 2007, according to earnings tracker First Call. \u001d  Constellation's guidance for fiscal 2008 didn't really dazzle either, with its projected range of $1.30 to $1.40 a share well short of the Street's starrier consensus of $1.79. It also announced a $500 million share buyback plan, but didn't set a time frame for its completion. \u001d  Several factors contributed to the headache-inducing picture, the biggest of which is that an oversupply from recent bumper harvests in Australia, where the wine-making industry is set up for mass production, has created a grape glut. That's allowed U.K. grocers such as Tesco and Sainsbury's to create good-quality, low-cost wines under their own private labels, cutting into Constellation's shelf space and sales. The U.K. will also increase import taxes next year, hurting Constellation margins. Wine accounts for 45% of Constellation's global sales. \u001d  \"The challenging environment could remain in place for quite a while,\" Chief Executive Richard Sands said during a Thursday conference call. \"Private label is sucking the normal growth we would have out of our business.\" \u001d  The next hiccup comes from the U.S., where major distributors have been consolidating, leaving only a few players standing. They've subsequently cut their inventory levels, which in turn forces Constellation to adjust and will lead to lower sales. That process will take place mostly over the first half of this fiscal year. \u001d  \"More inventory was good for our brands, but the brands can be well served at lower [inventory] levels,\" Sands said. \"All of our distributors are really moving to a different model, and I really think this is kind of an industrywide change.\" \u001d  Constellation's portfolio includes Corona Extra, Pacifico, St. Pauli Girl, Black Velvet, Fleischmann's, Mr. Boston, Robert Mondavi, Estancia, Simi, Ravenswood, Blackstone, Banrock Station, Hardys, Nobilo, Alice White, Vendange, Almaden, Arbor Mist, Stowells and Blackthorn. \b \b   The Analysis \b \u001d  While the next couple of years could well drive investors to drink, Constellation's got plenty of strengths in its cellar, and the pain will eventually wear off, both analysts and management say. \u001d  A devastating drought in Australia will cut this year's grape harvest by 25% to 30%, eventually reducing the surplus that's allowed U.K. grocers to sell so much of their own stingily priced screw-top chardonnay and shiraz. \u001d  In the U.S. and Canada, Constellation still expects midsingle-digit sales growth, despite the inventory cut. \u001d  \"This action does not reflect a change in market trends, as the U.S. wine market remains very healthy and we see the same trends in the Canadian marketplace,\" Sands said. \u001d  Wall Street analysts usually look at stocks from a 12-month horizon, and the anticipated low in the grape cycle has them on the wagon as far as Constellation's prospects. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg wrote Thursday that he didn't recommend buying the stock on weakness \"in spite of company indications that it expects a strong earnings recovery in fiscal 2009.\" Deutsche Bank analyst Marc Greenberg cut his 12-month price target to $20 a share from $28 a share, but kept his Hold rating on the stock. \u001d  Matthew Reilly, a food and beverage analyst with Morningstar, says the long-term picture is much better. Constellation is a tough company to understand, he cautions, partly because it continues to grow through frequent acquisitions, making its numbers a bit more fluid. \u001d  \"It's ugly in the U.K. - there's no two ways about that,\" he says. \"Management kind of came out this morning and said it's uglier. Right now, Constellation's in a very tough spot [with U.K. grocers] - they essentially have no leverage. They can't push price increases onto consumers, because retailers can go and start their own brands.\" \u001d  That will take more than 12 months to resolve itself, he cautions. \u001d  But he gave Sands, the CEO, credit for using fiscal 2007 results as a baseline for growth in 2009 and beyond. The company would have an easy time looking good on a year-over-year basis in 2009, because it would be using a very bad year as the basis of its comparison. By sticking with a better vintage, it's keeping its eye on real growth. \u001d  \"That was encouraging to me, their using long-term EPS guidance as the base,\" Reilly says. \"What they're saying is that we can grow from where we are now. I think that they are among the best acquirers in the beverage/alcohol space. They are the largest wine company in the world and do have some significant scale advantages over their peers.\" \b \b   The Bottom Line \b \u001d  Though Thursday took plenty of fizz out of a stock that's already down 12% over the last 52 weeks, this may be the time to uncork your opportunistic buying habits if you can cellar a short-term outlook. \u001d  \"I think it's time to buy the stock, but if you're looking for a 12-month pop, this is not your stock,\" Reilly says. \"I think a lot of the bad news is out. Certainly, the U.K. situation could get worse before it gets better. When you're talking about an oversupply of an agricultural product, like grapes, there's no telling how long it will take to go out.\" \u001d  But if the share buybacks go as planned, and the recently acquired Svedka brand of Swedish vodka provides a platform for high-end spirit sales, then this stock could ripen nicely. \u001d  \"We recognize that fiscal 2008 provides some tough challenges to our business environment,\" Sands said, but high-single-digit to low-teens growth won't be too far off. \u001d  For more information and analysis of companies and mutual funds, visit SmartMoney.com at http://www.smartmoney.com/ \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:34 ET (12:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"105b0f3545dbb2e27f8c7123d8924e3b","symR":["1925.TO","6519.TO","DWAHY","JP3165770003","JP3505000004"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Japan's Daiwa House: Offer To Pay Y368/Eneserve Share","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T06:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1925.TO","6519.TO","DWAHY","JP3165770003","JP3505000004"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","HOM","HPR","X225","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 01:13 ET (06:13 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"11e2179b0e637d6db936b6da66816cbc","symR":["DAL","DALRQ","US2473611083"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Delta Air Jan Capacity Rose 2.9% >DALRQ","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T13:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DAL","DALRQ","US2473611083"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 08:02 ET (13:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"12d2b591a4c9ec1d4a00645f205b4da9","symR":["30110.AE","ABN","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Dutch Grp Calls For Investigation Into ABN Holder TCI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30110.AE","ABN","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--A Dutch association which aims to improve corporate financial reporting has asked the Dutch regulator AFM to probe a hedge fund that calls for a breakup of ABN AMRO Holding (ABN) for possible insider trading and share price manipulation. \u001d  The Children's Investment Fund, or TCI, last week called for a strategic change at ABN AMRO, including a possible breakup of the Dutch banking group. \u001d  \"SOBI suspects this market speculator (TCI) to have built a stake of unknown size in ABN AMRO and then enriched itself at the cost of small shareholders through market moving comments,\" the Stichting Onderzoek Bedrijfsinformatie said in a statement. \u001d  AFM said it received SOBI's letter and added \"that the situation gets our full attention,\" without elaborating further. \u001d  A spokesman for TCI declined to comment. \u001d  -By Nicolas Parasie, Dow Jones Newswires; nicolas.parasie@dowjones.com; 31 20 6260770 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:37 ET (11:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"12f24cf9fc21fbafbfb3f07ffbb2e1e8","symR":["NET.WA","PLNETIA00014"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Poland's Netia Hldgs 4Q Financial Table","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T06:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NET.WA","PLNETIA00014"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Netia Holdings SA - Warsaw \b   3 Mos end Dec 31: \u001d  All figures in Polish zlotys (PLN) \b \b                                 2006            2005 \bSales Revenues               PLN209.7 Mln    PLN237.4 Mln \bOperational Profit/Loss        (351.2 Mln)       10.1 Mln \bPretax Profit/Loss             (367.8 Mln)        8.0 Mln \bNet Loss                       (373.0 Mln)      (11.6 Mln) \bEPS                              (0.96)          (0.03) \b   Figures in parentheses are losses. \b   Consolidated, unaudited results according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). \b \u001d  Netia Holdings (NET.WA) is Poland's largest alternative telephone operator.

Subsequently, the Group published the Scheme Document on Jan. 19, 2007 describing how it intends to implement the Offer by way of a court-approved scheme of arrangement under section 425 of the Companies Act. \u001d  Shareholder meetings to approve the Offer have been convened for Mar. 9, 2007. The expected timetable of events set out in the Scheme Document anticipates the Scheme of Arrangement will become effective on Apr. 18, 2007. \u001d  Gallaher delivered good shareholder returns while operating in challenging market conditions in Europe. The strength of the Group's performance was underpinned by its balanced portfolio of interests across mature, developing and emerging markets. Strong performances from CIS markets, along with robust trading in the U.K. and Republic of Ireland, helped compensate for the weaker trading conditions experienced in certain European markets and the increased investment in the RoW division. \u001d  The successful execution of the Group's strategy - to maximise profits from key E.U. markets to fund international expansion through exports, investing 'on the ground' and joint ventures and alliances - ensured that Gallaher continued to deliver organic growth in 2006. \u001d  Gallaher grew 2006 cigarette volumes, excluding German 'singles', by 5.0% to 182.4bn (2005: 173.8bn). Including the sales of singles, Group cigarette volumes increased by 4.5% to 183.7bn (2005: 175.8bn). After excluding the additional volume arising from the CITA acquisition, underlying Group cigarette volume sales increased 0.4% to 174.5bn (2005: 173.8bn), in spite of the adverse impact of the phasing of trade sales in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Sweden. \u001d  Gallaher increased sales volumes in some of its longer-established markets - including Kazakhstan, Greece and the Republic of Ireland. The Group also made good sales progress in its more recent 'on the ground' investments in Ukraine and South Africa and in its newer export markets - including the Middle East, Guinea, Kyrgyzstan, the Balkans and Taiwan. These strong performances were partly offset by the adverse conditions in some European markets. \u001d  Gallaher grew its strategic cigarette brands' volume sales by 9.7%. Sales of these brands - Benson & Hedges, Silk Cut, Sobranie, Sovereign, Memphis, Mayfair, LD and Ronson - totalled 91.9bn (2005: 83.8bn) cigarettes, accounting for 50.4% (2005: 48.2%) of the Group's total volume sales. \u001d  In January 2006, the Group acquired 100% of Cita Tabacos de Canarias SL, its group and related companies (\"CITA\") for a total consideration of GBP78 million. \u001d  Total sales for 2006 increased 2.3% to GBP8,401 million (2005: GBP8,214 million) while sales excluding duty (\"net sales\") grew 5.0% to GBP2,734 million (2005: 2,603 million), primarily reflecting the effects of the CITA acquisition. \u001d  Gallaher increased earnings before interest, tax, intangible asset amortisation and exceptional charges (\"EBITA\") by 3.4% to GBP692 million (2005: GBP670 million). Total tobacco EBITA grew 3.2% to GBP625 million (2005: GBP605 million), while EBITA from the European distribution businesses grew 4.9% to GBP67 million (2005: GBP65 million). Excluding the impact of acquisitions (CITA and the incremental contributions from the acquisition of trademarks in Cyprus and Malta in April 2005), total EBITA grew by 3.1%. \u001d  EBITA in 2006 from Gallaher's core markets of the U.K., Republic of Ireland, Austria and Sweden declined by 0.3% (core markets' EBITA increased by 2.1% in the second half). Gallaher's investment markets' EBITA rose by 16.4% in 2006. \u001d  The Group grew profit before tax, amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional charges (\"PBTA\") by 4.9% to GBP597 million (2005: GBP570 million). \u001d  Profit before tax increased 9.6% to GBP565 million (2005: GBP516 million). The positive impact of trading improvements and lower interest charges were aided further through lower net exceptional charges of GBP13 million (2005: GBP35 million). \u001d  Gallaher increased adjusted earnings per share by 4.3% to 65.8 pence (2005: 63.1 pence). After deducting intangible asset amortisation and exceptional charges (net of tax and minority interests), basic earnings per share were 61.6 pence (2005: 56.5 pence). \u001d  Since 2003, Gallaher has been restructuring elements of its European operations, distribution and administration functions. By the end of 2005, net exceptional charges of GBP91 million had been included in the Group's results. \u001d  Additional net exceptional charges of GBP13 million have been recorded in the year ended Dec. 31, 2006 (2005: GBP35 million). These charges reflect costs of the post-acquisition integration of CITA into the existing Gallaher operations and the restructuring of support functions in Sweden following changes in distribution arrangements. \u001d  Such costs are shown net of the negative goodwill arising on the acquisition of CITA (see page 15) and gains on disposals of former factory and depot sites in Austria. \u001d  These restructuring programmes are substantially completed and Gallaher expects to deliver annualised savings of at least GBP30 million from these programmes by the end of 2007. \u001d  Cash generated from operations before exceptional items was GBP798 million (2005: GBP733 million). Operating profit, as adjusted for exceptional charges, depreciation and amortisation (\"EBITDA\") was GBP742 million (2005: GBP727 million). This favourable movement was supplemented by a reduction in working capital of GBP78 million, compared to a reduction of GBP16 million during 2005. \u001d  In total, inventories fell by GBP34 million, primarily through lower inventory levels in Germany following the cessation of singles. Trade and other receivables reduced by GBP26 million, mainly reflecting reduced debt collection durations in Germany. Trade and other payables increased by GBP17 million, mainly reflecting higher duty creditors more than offsetting lower trade creditors. \u001d  After cash costs relating to the exceptional charges of GBP23 million (2005: GBP33 million), taxation payments of GBP114 million (2005: GBP143 million) and dividends received from joint ventures and associates of GBP16 million (2005: GBP15 million), net cash from operating activities totalled GBP677 million (2005: GBP572 million). \u001d  The reduction in taxation payments primarily reflects differing stage payments on assessments, and a one-off payment in 2005, following a tax audit, in Austria. \u001d  Net interest payments of GBP131 million were GBP12 million higher than 2005, mainly reflecting the higher net interest expense and adverse timing differences. \u001d  Capital expenditure of GBP130 million (2005: GBP103 million) primarily reflects the continuing investment in production machinery and merchandising equipment. The increased expenditure reflects the Group's ongoing investment in onshore facilities in Turkey and Singapore. Disposal proceeds of GBP44 million (2005: GBP21 million) include GBP23 million received from the sale of land acquired at the time of the CITA acquisition and GBP9 million received from the sale of former factory and depot sites in Austria. \u001d  Net expenditure of GBP60 million on the acquisition of subsidiaries reflects the purchase of CITA in January 2006, which together with borrowings of GBP18 million at acquisition gives a total consideration of GBP78 million. The fair value of CITA's net assets at acquisition, excluding net debt, amounted to GBP82 million, giving rise to negative goodwill of GBP4 million, which is credited to exceptional charges in 2006. \u001d  Net debt at Dec. 31, 2006 was GBP1,915 million - a reduction of GBP221 million compared to the position at Dec. 31, 2005. The decrease was attributable to: a net cash inflow of GBP169m; favourable exchange rate movements reducing net debt by GBP63 million on Gallaher's euro and U.S. dollar denominated financial liabilities; IAS 39 fair value adjustments of GBP7m; and, the inclusion of CITA's borrowings on acquisition of GBP18 million. \u001d  The Group's average net debt during the year was GBP2,024 million (2005: GBP2,077 million). \u001d  In March 2006, the Group re-paid a GBP100 million European medium-term note using internal cash flow. \u001d  In October 2006, the Group repaid a EUR750 million bond using the proceeds of a EUR500 million bond issued in October 2006 and internal cash flow. \u001d  The Group continues to comply with all borrowing obligations, and financial covenants have been satisfied with a 12-month EBITDA interest cover at 6.5 times and a net debt multiple of 2.4 times at Dec. 31, 2006. \u001d  The weighted average maturity of committed debt at the end of 2006 was 4.4 years (2005 year-end: 3.7 years). \u001d  The Group's debt ratings from Moody's Investor Service Limited and Standard & Poor's remain unchanged at Baa3 with stable outlook and BBB with stable outlook respectively. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:27 ET (07:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"16acf53855265eba7204149a1a731067","symR":["PDN.AU","PDN.T","AU000000PDN8"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Paladin Resources Ltd.: Media Briefing Notes","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PDN.AU","PDN.T","AU000000PDN8"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF","XDJGI","XISL","XORD"],"Story":"\u001d  PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 03/02/07 -- \u001d   Paladin Resources Ltd (TSX: PDN)(ASX: PDN) (\"Paladin\") has noted the rapid Reject Recommendation which has been announced by the Summit Resources Limited (\"Summit\") Board today. \u001d  Paladin is of the view that its Bidders Statement adequately explains the offer and arguments for Summit shareholders to accept the offer. However, in the light of several of the assertions made by Summit today, we felt it necessary to release a number of observations by Paladin Chairman, Rick Crabb: \u001d  - \"Summit has suggested that 'Paladin shareholders are exposed to more downside than upside risk'. We would suggest that Summit shareholders reviewing our offer place more weight on the research and recommendations of respected investment banks that cover Paladin - these include UBS, RBC, Dundee, BBY, ABN Amro and Deutsche Bank - than on comments from Summit's Board until they are prepared to support those comments with fact based research.\"; \u001d  - \"In relation to Summit's expected revaluation of its shares post the potential Federal ALP policy change in late April 07, we remind Summit shareholders that Paladin has offered a 34% premium (at date of announcement) to the recent trading prices of Summit. Furthermore, that trading was being undertaken by shareholders whom we assume had already formed their views on the likelihood of this change of policy\"; \u001d  - \"Summit has indicated that Paladin will stop the litigation if it gets control of Summit. This is false. We have clearly stated that if we own 100% of Summit post the offer, we will not continue to Sue ourselves. However, if we own less than 100% post the offer, then the non-Paladin, independent Directors of Summit will have responsibility and authority for management of the litigation\"; \u001d  - \"Summit has warned shareholders that they may face capital gains tax on the consideration they receive. This warning is relevant and we encourage Summit shareholders to review our comments on tax issues in the Bidders Statement and also to seek independent advice. It is our understanding that Summit's comments with respect to shareholders who have held stock for less than 12 months are factually incorrect\"; \u001d  - \"Paladin takes comfort from the fact that in the four short days post announcement of the bid, 7.7% of the Summit stock has been traded at prices broadly in line with the implied offer price at the time of trading. Clearly, at least 7.7% of the shareholders believed the implied offer price was more than adequate.\"; and \u001d  - \"Despite the Summit Board's reject recommendation, which was not unexpected, Paladin is resolved to move forward with its offer and looks forward to having that offer considered by Summit's shareholders\". \u001d  A.C.N. 061 681 098 \u001d     Contacts: Paladin Resources Ltd.

(Nasdaq: BIOM) (TSX: BRA) today announced that it is restating its United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") reconciliation note in its financial statements due to a recent interpretation by the United States regulatory authorities of the U.S. accounting rules contained in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\"SFAS\") 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which determines the current U.S. accounting treatment of the Company's share purchase warrants. \b \u001d  The Company reports in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (\"Canadian GAAP\") and provides note disclosure in its financial statements with respect to a reconciliation of Canadian GAAP to U.S. GAAP. Under Canadian GAAP, the Company's share purchase warrants are classified as equity and recorded at their fair value on issuance. The interpretation under U.S. GAAP requires that when a company's share purchase warrants have an exercise price denominated in a currency other than a company's functional currency, those share purchase warrants must be classified as liabilities at their fair value with any changes in fair value being included in the calculation of U.S. GAAP earnings. In these circumstances, a loss (gain) would be recorded by a company when the value of the share purchase warrants increases (decreases). \b \u001d  As a result of this interpretation, the Company will include a restatement of comparative figures in the U.S. GAAP note included in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. \b \u001d  The Company's previously reported financial results under Canadian GAAP remain unchanged. These are non-cash charges for U.S. GAAP purposes only that do not impact the Company's operations or cash flows. \b \u001d  This restatement only pertains to the Company's U.S. GAAP reconciliation note disclosure, due to mark-to-market losses/gains arising from the fair value of these share purchase warrants and the classification of the warrants as liabilities under U.S. GAAP. The effect of the restatement under U.S. GAAP is as follows: a decrease in net loss of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, a decrease in net loss of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase in net loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease in net loss of $4.7 million for the year ended 2005, an increase in liabilities of $0.5 million as at December 31, 2005 and a decrease in shareholders' equity of $0.5 million as at December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company will include in its U.S. GAAP note disclosure as a reconciling item a reduction of $4.4 million in losses related to the change in the fair value of share purchase warrants during the year. At the time that the Company's share purchase warrants are exercised, the value of the warrants will be reclassified to shareholders' equity within the Company's U.S. GAAP note. \b \u001d  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") has initiated a project to determine the accounting treatment for convertible debt with elements of foreign currency risk. This project is expected to provide further U.S. GAAP guidance in respect of accounting for share purchase warrants. \b \b    About Biomira \b \u001d  Biomira is a biotechnology company specializing in the development of innovative therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer. Biomira's goal is to develop and commercialize novel synthetic vaccines and targeted small molecules that have the potential to improve the lives and outcomes of cancer patients. \b \b    Forward Looking Statements \b \u001d  This release may contain forward-looking statements.

It now holds more than 95% of shares. It predicted a year ago that it would make about 6,000 job cuts and forecast synergies of around EUR700 million from 2009 onward. \u001d  Bayer explained Friday that half of the synergies will come from consolidation of processes and systems and the other half from \"adjustments to personnel requirements.\" \u001d  Bayer Friday said that of the 6,100 job cuts, 1,500 will be in Germany, where Schering employed around 7,000 people and Bayer has around 37,600. \u001d  The company Wednesday already said it would cut 950 jobs at Schering's former Berlin headquarters, which currently has a staff of around 6,000 people. \u001d  A further 160 jobs will be lost at the German Bayer site in Wuppertal Germany, and around 140 more at a former Schering site in Jena, Germany. \u001d  Bayer is to cut in total 3,150 jobs across Europe, including the job losses in Germany. \u001d  Additionally, 1,000 job cuts are planned in the U.S., 750 in Japan and the Asia Pacific region, and 1,200 in Latin America and Canada, Bayer said Friday. \u001d  Of the total 6,100 jobs to be eliminated, the largest tranche, or 2,850 jobs, will be in administrative positions. About 1,850 production jobs will be cut, and 1,400 are to go in research and development. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.bayer.com \u001d  -By Gangolf Schrimpf, Dow Jones Newswires; +49 69 29 725 500, gangolf.schrimpf@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:28 ET (11:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"18b9302a5ea314b1f7cd2975a927c791","symR":["BOY.LN","GB0006895626"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Bodycote Rejects Sulzer Possible Offer Of 325P Per Share","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BOY.LN","GB0006895626"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Bodycote International said Friday that it has rejected a cash offer from Sulzer of 325 pence per share. \u001d  The company said the Chairman, Chief Executive and Group Finance Director of Bodycote met with the Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Executive designate of Sulzer at their request on Feb. 12, 2007 and received a letter detailing their initial proposal following that meeting. \u001d  The Board believes that the unsolicited, conditional and unwelcome proposal as announced significantly undervalues the Group and its prospects and therefore has been rejected. \u001d  Bodycote said it firmly believes the current strategy of the Group and the proven record of its management will result in continued delivery of growth and excellent returns to shareholders.

At 0917 GMT, they had settled back to 1,122.5 pence, a 4% gain on the day in a broadly higher market. The shares had dropped by 7.5% between Monday's close and Thursday as a wider equity market selloff hit asset managers particularly hard. \u001d  The U.K. fund manager said net inflows from retail customers were GBP1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, putting retail net inflows for the year at GBP3.8 billion. \u001d  Institutional customers continued to pull money, withdrawing a net GBP1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and GBP8 billion for the full year. The withdrawals mainly came from poor-performing Japanese equity funds and  from U.K. balanced mandates. \u001d  Private banking net inflows contributed GBP400 million. \u001d  For the year, the company suffered a net outflow of GBP3.8 billion, though gains at its funds helped lift assets by nearly 5% from the previous year's GBP122.5 billion. \u001d  Chief Executive Michael Dobson said revenue in the institutional arm of the business grew 16% on the year despite the outflows, as fees on new institutional mandates were 31% higher than on the ones that were lost. \u001d  Dobson told a conference call that there may be further institutional outflows from the Japanese equities funds, which now manage about GBP8.5 billion after GBP4 billion was withdrawn last year. \u001d  But he said Schroders' new line of balanced mandates that include investments in alternative assets such as hedge funds and property is adding institutional clients at a pace of about one per week since launching in May. \u001d  Michael Long, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said the results show that Schroders retail business \"is back on track.\" He has an outperform rating on the shares. \u001d  \"The main concern is when the outflow from Japanese equities will start to slow down a bit,\" he said, though overall net institutional outflows were less than he had expected.   \"Schroders is well-placed for further growth, with a broadly diversified business by asset class, by region and by client type,\" the company said. \"Long term, we see significant further opportunities to grow organically in institutional, retail and high-net-worth channels, supplemented by complementary acquisitions which strengthen our business.\" \u001d  In 2006, Schroders acquired NewFinance Capital, a fund-of-hedge-funds business that now has GBP1.9 billion in assets, and Aareal Asset Management, a continental European property business with EUR1.9 billion under management for institutional clients. \u001d  Pretax profit from Schroders' asset management division was GBP219 million, up 26% from GBP173.8 million in 2005. The firm's private equity unit made GBP34.6 million, down from GBP40.3 million the year before, while private banking pretax profit grew to GBP26.9 million from GBP6 million. \u001d  The 2005 numbers don't include a GBP20.4 million gain last year from a discontinued contract. \u001d  Total revenue at the group was GBP976.2 million, up from GBP808 million the previous year. Net profit was GBP221.3 million, from GBP191.3 million in 2005. \u001d  \"All of the areas seem to have done slightly better than expectations and it's a very positive statement,\" said Geoff Miller, analyst at Bridgewell Securities, keeping an overweight rating on the shares. \u001d  \"Asset management continues to benefit from strong inflows into higher margin mandates and private banking at 9.2% of group profits is now making a meaningful contribution,\" he said. \u001d  The company said it plans to pay a 17.5-pence-a-share final dividend, adding to its 7.5-pence dividend for the first half and compared with 14.5 pence in the second half of 2005. The total dividend in 2005 was 21.5 pence a share. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.schroders.com \b \u001d  -By Margot Patrick, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9451; margot.patrick@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 04:25 ET (09:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1a9ea3dbf0e0d1d5fefb7f6eb3281054","symR":["Q","S","T","TWX","VG","VZ","US00206R1023","US8873171057","US92343V1044"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,0.9824649,0.9802415,0.9899649,0.9750958,0.9904057,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,0.9539078,1.022503,0.9744104,0.7969349,0.9904057,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"FCC Decision A Victory For Digital Phone Service Providers","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["Q","S","T","TWX","VG","VZ","US00206R1023","US8873171057","US92343V1044"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","CTS","FTS","ISV","MED","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTT","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \b   By Corey Boles \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  (This article was originally published Thursday) \b \u001d  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Rural telephone carriers must connect calls made by Voice Over Internet Protocol customers, the Federal Communications Commission ruled Thursday in a decision that marks the breaking down of one of the last barriers to VoIP fully competing with traditional phone carriers. \u001d  The FCC said that rural service providers in two states, Nebraska and South Carolina, must connect telephone calls made by customers of Time Warner Inc.'s (TWX) VoIP service. \u001d  Regulators in the two states argued that because the FCC hadn't deemed VoIP providers as telecom services, the local telephone companies didn't have to honor their phone calls. \u001d  \"This decision will enable Time Warner Cable to deploy its digital phone service in areas that until now have been denied the benefits of competition because of state decisions,\" said Mark Harrad, a spokesman for the company. \u001d  \"By increasing competition in the telephone sector, this action encourages the deployment of broadband facilities and ensures that consumers in all areas of the country reap the benefits of competition in the form of lower prices, innovative services and more choice,\" FCC Chairman Kevin Martin said in a statement. \u001d  The move by Martin to rule in favor of the cable industry in a dispute with telecom providers is a rare one. In a recent series of high-profile decisions, Martin sided with the telecom industry, provoking the ire of the cable industry. \u001d  The decision is limited in its scope because in most parts of the country, incumbent telephone companies already voluntarily connect VoIP customers' calls. \u001d  As a result of the decision, VoIP providers such as Time Warner will be able to offer truly national service. \u001d  Some VoIP companies, like Time Warner, contract their phone service to a third party provider. In Time Warner's case, Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) is the actual phone provider. Others such as Vonage Holdings Corp. (VG) offer phone service without the assistance of a traditional phone carrier. \u001d  -By Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6637; corey.boles@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:32 ET (12:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1aa2a3f3afb42f35c93ce652710ce2c4","symR":["MAN.XE","SCV-A.SK","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0005937007","DE0007664005","SE0000308272"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9673469,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,1.085714,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"VW, Unions In Informal Talks Over Future Of MAN AG - Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T06:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MAN.XE","SCV-A.SK","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0005937007","DE0007664005","SE0000308272"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","TRQ","XDAX","XDJGI","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Volkswagen AG (VOW.XE) and union representatives are apparently working to topple MAN AG (MAN.XE) Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson, according to Die Welt's Friday edition. \u001d  Top union representatives from VW and MAN have discussed the future of the company on an informal basis, while VW's chairman of the supervisory board, Ferdinand Piech is also said to have had talks with MAN union officials.

The euro faces selling pressure, government debt is seen holding firm and metals and oil are lower. \u001d  STOCKS: \u001d  European stocks are likely to start the session just about in positive territory, although the underlying reasons for this week's rout continue to grip the markets. \u001d  U.K. spreadbettor Cantor Index is calling the FTSE up 9 points at 6125, the CAC up 4 at 5462 but the DAX down 4 at 6636. \u001d  Stock markets continued their dramatic fall Thursday and strategists, bankers and investors say the selloff has further to run. \u001d  Tony Dolphin, director of economics and strategy at Henderson Global Investors, said European markets were overbought after an almost uninterrupted rise since mid-June 2006. \"This (correction) could get worse before things start to improve,\" he said. \u001d  Mislav Matejka, head of European equity strategy at J.P. Morgan, said most financial models have suggested that a correction resulting in a 10% fall in prices was needed to balance the situation. \u001d  \"At present, given the recent move in bond yields, a further 4% or 5% is needed to go from Tuesday's close before we get to neutral territory,\" he said, referring to the London FTSE 100. \u001d  Further falls could still be on the way for Europe, said Giles Watts, a trader at City Index. \u001d  \"At the moment the sentiment is too nervous and too jittery to suggest we've hit the bottom,\" Watts said. \u001d  A still skittish Wall Street closed modestly lower Thursday, having clawed its way back from an early-session plunge after upbeat manufacturing data allayed fears about a flagging U.S. economy. \u001d  \"The aftermath of Tuesday's major selloff will linger for the next couple of days. I don't think we're totally out of the woods yet,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at New York-based brokerage house Avalon Partners. \u001d  Friday is unlikely to bring much in a way of new economic information, except for a consumer sentiment report from the University of Michigan and a speech by St. Louis Federal Reserve President William Poole. Investors may look more at corporate data, especially in the technology sector, given Dell's poor preliminary earnings report released Thursday after the bell. \u001d  Shares of the computer maker fell 1.3 after it reported a drop in fiscal fourth-quarter profit and said its earnings and gross margins would be under pressure for several quarters as it implements restructuring efforts. \u001d  Asian stocks traded mixed Thursday, with Japan's Nikkei average declining for a fourth session in a row as Toyota Motor, Sony and other export-oriented issues lost ground after the yen touched a 2 1/2-month high against the dollar in U.S. trading. Shares in China rebounded on bargain-hunting. \u001d  FOREX: \u001d  The euro is weaker against the dollar, with pressure coming from the lower EUR/JPY cross. Receding euro-zone inflation and rebounding U.S. factory data are likely to tip the euro toward a bearish bias, dealers said. \u001d  On Thursday, yen strength remained the focus of currency markets, though the dollar garnered some much-needed support from U.S. manufacturing data that beat expectations. Investors continued to unwind their carry trades. \u001d  BONDS: \u001d  European government bond prices, backed by positive technicals, are set to hold steady but could extend gains from Thursday if flight-to-quality inflows from real money accounts continue to move away from equity markets. \u001d  U.S. Treasury prices were little changed Thursday, settling down in afternoon trading after a volatile morning marked by sharp shifts in stock, bond and other asset markets. \u001d  Rick Klingman, head of Treasurys trading at ABN Amro, said the rebound came after \"the market saw some strong data, and that should reinforce the confident note that Ben Bernanke tried to get across in (saying) that the underlying economy is fine despite the equity volatility.\" \u001d  Nonetheless, Klingman said there is \"still an underlying bid\" for Treasurys, with \"people concerned that this flight-to-quality move has got more room to run.\" \u001d   He said that for the time being, Treasury prices will continue to take their lead from U.S. equity markets. \u001d  Prices of Japan's government bonds traded little changed Friday, as the market ignored the latest labor data, which showed Japan's unemployment rate was steady at 4.0 percent in January. \u001d  Japan's core consumer price index posted its first flat reading in eight months in January, which may add to expectations the central bank could put off another interest rate increase until this summer. \u001d  ENERGY: \u001d  Oil prices fell 27 cents to $61.73 in Asian trading after rising on Thursday to $62, their highest level since late December as gasoline supply worries heightened. \u001d  \"There's a lot of focus on what's happening with Iran. Tensions over any possible sanctions are obviously positive for oil prices,\" said Andrew Harrington, an analyst with ANZ Global Natural Resources in Sydney. \u001d  METALS: \u001d  Spot gold bounced from lows, but still was down $4.65 at $659.30. Key technical support is put at $658, with buying expected under that level, traders said. \u001d  LME copper was $30 lower at $6,080 in sympathy with losses in other metals. Copper has to stay above $5,950 to avoid a technical selloff, dealers said. \u001d  CALENDAR: Friday, March 2, 2007 \bGMT                                                        Expected  Previous \b0700  GER          Retail Sales                             -1.7%MM   +2.6%MM \b0930  UK   Feb     CIPS PMI Report on Construction \b1000  EU   Jan     PPI                                      +0.1%MM   0.0%MM \b                                                            +3.0%YY   +4.1%YY \b1200  US           St Louis Fed Pres Poole speaks on \b                   energy prices and the US business cycle \b                   in Santiago, Chile \b1500  US   Feb     Reuters/Univ Mich Index, final           93.3      93.3 \bN/A   UK   4Q      Output & employment in the construction \b                   industry \bN/A   JPN  Jan     Provisional Labor Survey \b \u001d  -By Dennis Baker;

For the three-year period ending December 31, 2006, ATP achieved a three-year reserve replacement ratio of 459% from production of 93 Bcfe and 427 Bcfe in net reserve additions from all sources during the 2004 - 2006 period. Costs incurred for oil and gas expenditures for the same three-year period were $1.17 billion, which when divided by three-year reserve additions from all sources, results in three-year finding and development costs of $2.75 per Mcfe. \b \u001d  All reserves and hydrocarbons included in this release are shown net to ATP's working interest (\"W.I.\"). On March 5, ATP will make accessible copies of certification letters from its independent third-party reservoir engineers under the Investor Info-Annual/Quarterly Reports section of its website at www.atpog.com. \b \u001d  In addition to third-party proved and probable reserves, ATP estimates logged hydrocarbons for properties that have been recently acquired and for properties that have not yet been evaluated by its third-party reservoir engineers. For example, on August 3, 2006, management estimated 360 Bcfe of logged hydrocarbons not included in ATP's December 31, 2005 reserve report. At December 31, 2006, 297 Bcfe (+83%) of the 360 Bcfe were recognized as proved or probable reserves in the company's third-party engineering reports. \b \u001d  Recoverable hydrocarbons not yet recognized as proved and probable by third-party reservoir engineers include 22 Bcfe at Green Canyon 37 (currently in third-party reservoir engineers' possible reserves) and 38 Bcfe at Cheviot (management's estimate of additional recoverable hydrocarbons). In addition, 16 Bcfe at Garden Banks 388, 12 Bcfe at Ship Shoal 351 and 9 Bcfe at High Island 392 have not yet been evaluated by third parties.

At December 31, 2006, the pre-tax PV-10 of proved, probable and logged hydrocarbons of 1,161 Bcfe was $4.3 billion (strip prices at December 29, 2006). \b \u001d  Top Properties - Based on proved and probable reserves, ATP's top five properties are listed below. Collectively, the top five properties, all of which are operated by ATP, represent 77% of proved and probable reserves. The Gomez Hub (100% W.I.) and Tors Hub (85% W.I.) are currently producing with additional development planned in 2007. ATP plans major infrastructure development at its Telemark Hub (100% W.I) in 2007 with first production scheduled for late 2008. ATP expects to receive field development plan approval at Cheviot (100% W.I.) in mid-2007, at which time the company will finalize engineering and begin procurement. Development is scheduled for 2008 and 2009 with first production in late 2009. The Canyon Express Hub, which includes King's Peak (55% W.I.), is scheduled for development in 2008 and 2009. \b \b                                         December 31, 2006 \b                                                              Canyon \b                                      Telemark Gomez   Tors    Express \b                              Cheviot    Hub     Hub     Hub     Hub \b                              North   Gulf of  Gulf of North  Gulf of \b                                Sea    Mexico  Mexico    Sea   Mexico \b                              (Bcfe)   (Bcfe)  (Bcfe)  (Bcfe)  (Bcfe) \b                              ------- -------- ------- ------ -------- \bProved reserves as prepared \b by third-party engineers        181      135     117     65       31 \b \bProbable reserves as prepared \b by third-party engineers         69       57      40     42       43 \b                              ------- -------- ------- ------ -------- \bTotal proved & probable          249      192     157    107       73 \b                              ======= ======== ======= ====== ======== \b \u001d  ATP announced two major acquisitions in January 2007. The first acquisition was at ATP's Canyon Express Hub and included a 50% W.I. at Aconcagua, a 17% W.I. at Camden Hills and an increase to a 45% W.I. in the Canyon Express Pipeline. With King's Peak, ATP now has a working interest in six blocks in its Canyon Express Hub. The second acquisition was at ATP's Gomez Hub and included a 100% W.I. at Anduin and the potential to earn a 50% W.I. at Anduin West and a 25% W.I. at Gladden (following the successful completion of Anduin). ATP began drilling Anduin in January 2007. The drilling rig has encountered the productive reservoir and completion operations are underway. Anduin will be tied back to the ATP Innovator at Mississippi Canyon 711 and is scheduled to be placed on production in mid-2007. These recent acquisitions are not included in ATP's December 2006 reserve report. Management's current estimate of recoverable hydrocarbons is 47 Bcfe at Anduin and 13 Bcfe at Aconcagua. \b \b   About ATP Oil & Gas \b \u001d  ATP Oil & Gas is an international offshore oil and gas development and production company with operations in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea.

The average cost per unit was $15.21/boe for the three moths ended 2006 compared to $12.98/boe for the same period in 2005. Depreciation, depletion and accretion expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $65.3 million, an increase of 62% over the $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The average cost per unit was $14.96/boe for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 compared to $12.27/boe in the same period in 2005. Per unit costs have increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due the cost of property acquisitions completed in August 2005 and June 2006 coupled with higher industry exploitation and development costs. \b \bIncome and other taxes - For the three months ended 2006, the provision for income and other taxes was $3.0 million for an effective tax rate of 34%, as compared to $9.6 million with an effective tax rate of 37% for the same period in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the provision for income and other taxes was $4.2 million for an effective tax rate of 11%, as compared to $24.1 million for an effective tax rate of 38% for the same period in 2005. The income tax provision for 2006 includes an recovery of $9.6 million recognized in the second quarter due to federal and provincial income tax rate reductions and the repealing of the Large Corporations Tax. \b \bCapital expenditures - Capital expenditures were $39.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 primarily allocated to exploitation and development. For the year ended December 31, 2006, capital expenditures were $206.7 million consisting of exploitation and development spending of $120.7 million and $86.0 million of acquisitions, compared to $238.5 million incurred for the year ended December 31, 2005 with $65.9 exploitation and development spending and $172.6 million on acquisitions. 2006 acquisitions include an $81.7 million business acquisition in Northwest and West Central Saskatchewan in June 2006 (see note 1). The residual amount is comprised of minor property acquisitions carried out during 2006. \b \bFunds from operations and net income - For the three months ended December 31, 2006, funds from operations were $26.6 million ($0.54/share, basic), a 32% decrease over the $39.3 million ($0.81/share, basic) for the same period in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NuVista's funds from operations were $107.1 million ($2.20/share, basic), a 2% increase from $104.9 million ($2.40/share, basic) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2006 was $5.8 million ($0.12/share, basic) compared to $16.3 million ($0.34/share, basic) for the same period in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006 net income was $35.3 million ($0.72/share, basic) compared to $39.5 million ($0.90/share, basic) for the same period in 2005. The reduction in net income for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same periods in 2005 was primarily due to the same reasons that funds from operations were lower and higher depreciation, depletion and accretion expenses. \b \bLiquidity and capital resources - As at December 31, 2006, bank debt (including working capital) was $167.1 million, resulting in a debt to annualized fourth quarter funds from operations ratio of approximately 1.5 to 1.0. NuVista has approximately $22.7 million of unused bank borrowing capability based on its current line of credit of $180 million. These undrawn bank lines and funds from operations provide NuVista with the flexibility to fund our planned 2007 capital program. NuVista's capital program will continue to be monitored and, if required, adjusted based on the outlook for commodity prices and funds from operations. As at March 1, 2007, there were 49,027,358 common shares and 270,789 Class B Performance Shares outstanding. In addition, there were 3,743,545 stock options outstanding, with an average exercise price of $11.99/share. \b \bQuarterly financial information - The following table highlights NuVista's performance for the eight quarterly reporting periods from March 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006: \b \b \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                              2006 \b                       ---------------------------------------------------- \b                        December 31 September 30      June 30     March 31 \b                       ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------- \bProduction (boe/d)           12,612       12,577       11,357       11,303 \b($ thousands, except \b per share amounts) \bProduction revenue          $49,195      $47,530      $45,375      $50,540 \bNet income                  $ 5,765      $ 4,082      $15,986      $ 9,451 \bNet income per share: \b Basic                         0.12         0.08         0.33         0.20 \b Diluted                       0.12         0.08         0.32         0.19 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b                                              2005 \b                       ---------------------------------------------------- \b                        December 31 September 30      June 30     March 31 \b                       ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------- \bProduction (boe/d)           11,031        9,874        7,783        7,358 \b($ thousands, except \b per share amounts) \bProduction revenue          $63,315      $48,474      $30,626      $27,265 \bNet income                  $16,247      $11,339      $ 6,335      $ 5,585 \bNet income per share: \b Basic                         0.34         0.25         0.16         0.14 \b Diluted                       0.32         0.24         0.15         0.13 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b \bNuVista has seen growth in its production volumes over the prior eight quarter periods. During the four quarter reporting periods ended December 31, 2005, revenues and net income increased primarily due to increases in production and commodity prices. Since December 31, 2005, production growth continued but has not offset lower average realized commodity prices, resulting in lower revenues and net income. Net income during the three months ended June 30, 2006 increased due to a $9.6 million future income tax recovery relating to changes in tax rates. \b \bBUSINESS RISKS AND OUTLOOK \b \bNuVista continues to employ the same core philosophy in 2007 as we have in the past three and one half years. We have the team, the land base and the prospect generation ability to continue to create value for shareholders. We are poised for growth and well positioned to continue post strong operational and financial results for 2007 and beyond. \b \bFor 2007, NuVista's Board of Directors have approved a capital program of $160 million. The 2007 capital program is heavily weighted to our internally generated exploitation and development program. This capital program will see NuVista participating in approximately 140-160 wells, 40-45 of which are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2007. The portion of our capital program allocated to acquisitions may be expanded in 2007 if the acquisition market proves to be more favourable. \b \bNuVista is currently forecasting first quarter of 2007 production to increase throughout the period and average approximately 13,500 boe per day. NuVista's current guidance of 14,300 to 14,900 boe/d for 2007 with the implementation of our planned capital program remains unchanged. Based upon the current commodity price assumptions of US$8.00 per mmbtu Nymex for natural gas and US$62.00 for WTI, NuVista is forecasting funds from operations of $135 - 145 million for 2007 ($2.75/share to $2.95/share). \b \bNuVista will continue to focus on its core strategy of cost control and applying the expertise of its own technical staff to its current operating regions, through both the drilling and strategic acquisitions. The execution of these strategies will enable NuVista to continue to grow its production, cash flow and net income consistently and profitably. We remain unwavering in our commitment to enhance shareholder value over the long-term in a diligent and prudent manner by accessing the broad depth and expertise of our team. \b \bWe thank our loyal shareholders for your patience and confidence in 2006, and look forward to providing improved returns in 2007. \b \bOn Behalf of the Board of Directors \b \bAlex G.

Apart from the main activity index rising to 55.4 last month from an upwardly revised 53.2 in January, the output prices index also rose sharply. \u001d  \"What is alarming is the jump in inflation expectations with the output prices index rising to 57.6 from 54.8, marking the highest level reached since the series began in November 1999,\" said David Brown, chief European economist with Bear Stearns International in London. \u001d  \"This should be anathema as far as the Bank of England is concerned...This is the sort of strong number that could justify a Bank of England rate hike as early as next week,\" he added. \u001d  \"Overall, the data will bolster the case for a further tightening of policy,\" agreed Daragh Maher, senior foreign exchange strategist with Calyon in London. \u001d  He noted that the PMI output numbers came along with confirmation that M4 money supply growth was up at 13.0% in January, \"a level that is increasingly causing discomfort at the Bank of England.\" \u001d  Earlier this week, Nationwide Building Society also confirmed the ongoing uptrend in U.K. housing prices, a key factor helping to keep the consumer sector robust. Prices were up 10.2% in February, compared with a 9.3% rise on the year in January. \u001d  However, Bank of England Deputy Governor Rachel Lomax helped to puncture some of the more bullish expectations - both on interest rates and the pound - in a speech late Wednesday in which she said the recent decline in energy prices will ensure British inflation will decline later this year. \u001d  Alan Clarke, a U.K. economist with BNP Paribas, noted that similar sentiment was expressed in the bank's last inflation report but this helped to explain why Lomax has voted against the bank's last two rate hikes. \u001d  \"In other words, the message was that there are some near term (upside) risks but longer term inflation is expected to be slightly below target,\" Clarke said. \u001d  And that is not the only reason why counting on any significant sterling gains may prove a problem. \u001d  As expected, the latest retail sales survey from the Confederation of British Industry Thursday showed declining activity, with the main index falling to 19 from 30. \u001d  Also, despite the strength of the housing market, there are signs that mortgage applications have peaked. James Knightley, as U.K. economist with ING Financial Markets in London, noted that evidence of this came on Tuesday with British Bankers data showing that new mortgages approved for both house purchase and remortgaging remain in a downward trend. \u001d  The Bank of England confirmed the trend on Thursday with figures showing that net mortgage lending fell to GBP9.6 billion in January from GBP10.3 billion in December. The market had expected a much more gentle slide to GBP10.1 billion. \u001d  In the meantime, the decline in the U.S. economy isn't going to help the U.K. economy either. In a recent paper, Paul Dales, a U.K. economist with Capital Economics, said that manufacturing and the financial sector could be hardest hit. \u001d  \"But,\" he added, \"a U.S. slowdown could be bad news for everyone if it further unbalances the U.K. economy.\" \u001d  Simon Derrick, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York in London, is concerned about the pound's recent gains against the yen - driven both by interest rate expectations in the U.K. and market appetite for carry trades using the Japanese unit as the funding currency. \u001d  He notes that the pound is about 20% higher than its average price over the last decade. And, he added, this \"misalignment become ever more alarming\" when compared with the last two times GBP/JPY reached peaks in 1992 and 1998. In both cases, the level of yield support for the pound was substantially higher and the subsequent retreats in the spot prices were \"notoriously violent.\" \u001d  In September 1992, the pair fell 16% in four weeks while in October 1998 is lost 14% in one week. \u001d  Early Friday, the pound fell back to $1.9555 by 0745 GMT from $1.9601 late Thursday in New York, according to EBS. The decline came as the dollar staged a small rebound on calmer global financial markets. This allowed it to stabilize at Y117.58 compared with Y117.55 as the Shanghai Composite Index rallied back 1.3%. However, with Japan's Nikkei Index still ending 1.3% lower, there remain some concerns about how European and U.S. stocks will perform Friday. \u001d  The euro fell to $1.3178 from $1.3188 and slipped to Y154.90 from Y155.00. \b \u001d  Bloomberg TNI FRX POV \b   Reuters   USD/DJ \b   Thomson   P/1066 or P/1074 \u001d  (Nick Hastings has covered the foreign exchange markets and industry for over 15 years.

The two-week residential camps offer innovative programs which enhance middle school students' knowledge in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) while encouraging youth to stay in school and fostering leadership and citizenship. Each university will host one camp, except the University of Houston, which will be home to two camps. Together, the 20 camps will reach more than 1,000 students. \b \u001d  \"With similar goals to improve education and career opportunities for disadvantaged students, particularly in the math and science fields, ExxonMobil is proud to join with Dr. Harris in support of this incredible educational opportunity,\" said Rex Tillerson, chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil. \"Now, with 20 camps, the program is able to extend its reach nationwide, encouraging a diverse and talented group of young people to prepare for exciting opportunities in the STEM fields.\" \b \u001d  Studies have shown that the United States will face a critical shortage of engineers, scientists and other technically trained workers in the near future. To help address the nation's math and science crisis, ExxonMobil is committed to supporting programs and organizations that focus on improving math and science education from pre-school through higher education. The Company supports programs to increase the numbers of newly-graduating highly effective science and math teachers, provide professional development and training opportunities for teachers, and attract bright, talented students to pursue science and math-related disciplines in middle school, high school and college. \b \u001d  \"Last year we were struck by the number of qualified applicants for fewer than 100 slots in our two camps in Houston and Oklahoma,\" said Harris, veteran of two space shuttle missions and the first African-American to conduct a space walk. \"This year, with ExxonMobil's support, we will expand to universities and colleges across the country to give more talented students the opportunity to participate in the summer camp experience.\" \b \u001d  A unique aspect of the ExxonMobil Bernard Harris Summer Science Camp is that there is no fee for the campers. Instead, young people who are academically qualified, are recommended by their teachers, and are genuinely interested in math and science can be rewarded with the opportunity to attend these fun and educational camps. \b \u001d  During camp, the students will attend daily classes in natural science, engineering, mathematics and technology, and will be taught by the faculty of the participating universities and secondary classroom teachers. Activities include classroom study, experiments, individual/team/group projects, weekly field excursions and guest speakers who motivate the students into fulfilling their dreams. \b \u001d  For more information about campus activities, student eligibility and selection criteria, please visit the ExxonMobil Bernard Harris Summer Science Camp website at www.theharrisfoundation.org. \b \b   About ExxonMobil Foundation \b \u001d  ExxonMobil Foundation is the primary philanthropic arm of the Exxon Mobil Corporation in the United States. The Foundation and the Corporation engage in a range of philanthropic activities that advance education, health and science in the communities where ExxonMobil has significant operations. In the United States, ExxonMobil supports initiatives to improve math and science education at the K-12 and higher education levels.

The Fund does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used primarily to fix the value of estimated US dollar denominated revenue generated by operations located in Canada. As at December 31, 2006, the Fund had outstanding contracts to purchase Canadian $60,000 over a period from January 2007 to April 2009, at an average rate of 1.1350. An unrealized loss of $675 on these contracts has been recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings. The Fund entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate on $65,000 of its variable rate term debt at 6.49% interest rate swap is considered highly effective. Based on the fair value of the interest rate swap contract, an unrealized loss of $625 has been recorded at December 31, 2006. \b \bCAPITAL RESOURCES \b \bThe Fund has cash on hand at December 31, 2006 of $8,796. The Partnership has an available credit facility of $25,000 that was undrawn at year-end. Subsequent to year-end, a $5,000 letter of credit was issued related to the CSLP contract awarded in December 2006. The letter of credit reduces availability under the credit facility. \b \bThe Partnership has a drawn term facility in the amount of $86,000 that matures March 16, 2010. The term facility has a variable interest rate but the Partnership has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixes the interest rate on $65,000 of the term debt. \b \bThe Fund has budgeted maintenance capital expenditures of $7,000 for the 2007 fiscal year. The increase in maintenance capital expenditures over the average amounts reflected in the Prospectus is directly related to plans to substantially upgrade or replace the capital assets supporting specific solutions contracted with clients. \b \bIn addition, the Fund has budgeted growth capital expenditures of $7,100 and other implementation costs of $2,400 related to the new contract announcements in December 2006. \b \bThe Fund expects to generate cash from operating activities in excess of distributions at current distribution levels and the planned maintenance capital expenditures. Cash generated in excess of distributions and maintenance capital expenditures will be used to assist in financing growth capital expenditures and implementation costs. \b \bThe Fund expects to use its credit facility during the coming year as the timing of cash inflows are not expected to fully match cash outflows for capital expenditures and implementation costs. \b \bCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \b \bThe preparation of consolidated financial statements, in conformity with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. These estimates are based on management's assessment of available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management has identified service fee revenue, goodwill and intangible asset valuation, amortization of intangible assets, accounts receivable allowances and accounting for income taxes as critical accounting estimates. \b \bService fee revenue for registrations is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated term of the registration. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:46 ET (11:46 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"287fc245f2d9fe8d5b8f412977e1a840","symR":["BA","GR","US0970231058","US3823881061"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9998851,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.027807,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Boeing On Cusp Of Restarting C-17 Line Shutdown Early Steps","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BA","GR","US0970231058","US3823881061"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Rebecca Christie \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  (This article was originally published Thursday) \b \u001d  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Boeing Co. (BA) is on the cusp of restarting early steps to shut down its C-17 cargo jet production line, since the Pentagon did not meet a March 1 deadline for committing to new orders, according to analysts and others following the program. \u001d  Last month, Boeing said it needed a new commitment or else it would start laying off suppliers. Now the company has scheduled a Friday afternoon call with reporters to discuss the production line's future. Earlier Friday, it is set to meet with employees. \u001d  This points toward a repeat of the supplier cutbacks Boeing made last August. Boeing stopped work on some of its long-lead items, but work resumed once Congress added 10 planes into the Air Force budget. \u001d  If Boeing makes a similar move Friday, it will ratchet up tension between the company and the government. Air Force leaders would like the C-17 production line to stay open, although they do not yet have a defined plan for buying more planes. \u001d  Current orders put Boeing on track to close the line in mid-2009. But each plane requires about 34 months of lead time to make its way through the supply chain. \u001d  So far, the Air Force has asked Congress for just two extra planes, in an \"unfunded priority\" list submitted recently. But in the long run, some service officials would like to buy many more C-17s so they can retire the Air Force's aging C-5 jumbo cargo jets. \u001d  \"The big question the Air Force is now putting to Boeing is whether it is willing to spend its own money in order to keep the C-17 line and supplier base intact with the understanding that the service will probably ask for many more planes in the future, starting in 2009,\" said Lexington Institute defense analyst Loren Thompson. \u001d  Boeing said Thursday that the company would answer questions about the production line during Friday's conference call. The call was billed as an \"update on Boeing's C-17 Globemaster III program\" in an advisory to reporters. \u001d  Goodrich Corp. (GR) and privately held Vought Aircraft Industries Inc. are two suppliers that would be first affected by any decision to shut down the supply chain. Last year, Vought said it was able to mitigate the effects of Boeing's work stoppage by shifting personnel to other C-17 parts that were still in the pipeline. \u001d  Boeing has been marketing the plane around the world. But non-U.S. customers like Canada and the U.K. typically buy only a few planes at a time, not enough to keep the line open. \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; rebecca.christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:36 ET (12:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"28ccb246da447d3f45f5bc347dae1335","symR":["RUKN.VX","SWCEY","CH0012332372"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UBS Upgrades Swiss Re To Buy From Neutral","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T05:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RUKN.VX","SWCEY","CH0012332372"],"IndustryCodes":["INS","INU","XDJGI","XSMI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:04 ET (05:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"28d791089bfdd9dd8e663e3dfe76ad9a","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","OHB.XE","DE0005936124","NL0000235190"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Airbus Site In Nordenham Back In Operation Sun Night -Union","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","OHB.XE","DE0005936124","NL0000235190"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","CMT","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XMDAX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:05 ET (12:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"28dc11207ecdc7ec79d6b726907d0882","symR":["LEND"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Accredited Home Lenders Files To Delay 10-K >LEND","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LEND"],"IndustryCodes":["MFN","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co.

The firm's paid-in capital is NT$96.68 billion. \u001d  \"But we still plan to adjust our capital in the best way for shareholders,\" he said. \u001d  Ho Chen said a capital reduction isn't on the agenda because of the large investment needed to build the firm's \"next generation network,\" as well as government opposition. \u001d  Under the next generation network plan, Chunghwa Telecom plans to spend more than NT$50 billion during the next five years to upgrade its fixed-line copper-wire network to fiber-optic cables, which will allow faster connection times and new services, such as high-definition television. \u001d  The government is concerned about the negative perception a capital reduction by a U.S.-listed Taiwan firm could create, Ho Chen said. \u001d  He said shareholders would need to approve any capital-adjustment plan at the annual general meeting in June, the agenda for which must be finalized by mid-April. \u001d  Separately, Ho Chen said Chunghwa Telecom's mobile and fixed-line data services and its enterprise business group would remain its main revenue-growth drivers this year. \u001d  \"We hope financial institutions will be our mainstream corporate clients,\" Ho Chen said. \u001d  In January, Chunghwa Telecom and Cathay Financial Holding Co.

Our strategy is to take vigorous action to meet these challenges while retaining our long-term focus on the growth opportunities for Rank,\" Burke said in a statement. \u001d  Underlying group operating profit before items from continuing operations - the key figure analysts track when assessing the group's trading performance - fell to GBP77.4 million for the year ended Dec. 31, compared with the analyst consensus of GBP78.5 million. Forecasts ranged broadly from GBP71.2 million to GBP93.2 million. \u001d  That compares with underlying group operating profit before items from continuing operations of GBP90.5 million for 2005. \u001d  Rank's gaming operations are made-up of Mecca Bingo hall chain, Grosvenor Casinos unit as well as the internet and telephone betting division Blue Square in the U.K.. The group also has 11 bingo clubs in Spain and two casinos in Belgium, according to its corporate website. \u001d  On Feb. 14, Rank said it plans to close nine Mecca Bingo clubs in England and Wales, in line with its strategy of improving the quality of its clubs portfolio ahead of the introduction of the smoking bans in England and Wales later this year. \u001d  At the end of last year, Rank announced the proposed sale of Hard Rock for $965 million to the Native American Semiannual tribe of Florida. At the time, Rank said the sale is expected to be completed on March 5. \u001d  Rank is hoping to bolster its gambling operations by bidding for a number of 17 new U.K. casino licenses, which include the country's first supercasino, following the passing of the Gambling Act 2005, CEO Burke said. \u001d  The bidding process is likely to require a significant level of investment, Rank cautioned. \u001d  Scotland's ban on smoking in enclosed public places, which was introduced in March 2006, contributed to a 15% fall in like-for-like revenue from the Scottish bingo clubs from the time of ban's introduction, Rank said. \u001d  Rank said the roll out of a partial ban in Spain, which only permits smoking in up to 30% of gaming areas, in September caused some disruption to its bingo clubs business Top Rank Espana. \u001d  Smoking bans will be introduced in Wales and England in April and July, respectively. \u001d  In 2006, total revenue from continuing operations rose 3.7% to GBP549.6 million from GBP529.8 million a year earlier. \u001d  Rank shares were down 4.50 pence, or 2.1%, at 213 pence in a higher U.K. market. Based on Thursday's closing share price of 218 pence, the stock has fallen around 9.1% over the past 12 months on concerns about the effect of the smoking bans on Rank's operations. \u001d  The company declared a final dividend of 4 pence, down sharply from 10.3 pence a year ago, taking the full year dividend to 6.0 pence. That compares to a full year dividend of 15 pence in 2005. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.rank.com \b \u001d  -By Lilly Vitorovich, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-0-207 842 9290; lilly.vitorovich@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2bc0e13ad903773506dca9a112f56aa6","symR":["003306836.LU","ABV","ABVC","AMBV4.BR","BUD","INB.BT","LQU","BE0003793107","BRAMBVACNPR1","LU0033068361","US0352291035"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9964686,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.039676,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Quilmes '06 Results Convince Hldrs To Seek Higher AmBev Bid","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["003306836.LU","ABV","ABVC","AMBV4.BR","BUD","INB.BT","LQU","BE0003793107","BRAMBVACNPR1","LU0033068361","US0352291035"],"IndustryCodes":["BVG","DST","XB20","XDJGI","XENX","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (This article was originally published Thursday) \b \b \u001d  By Serena Saitto \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  BUENOS AIRES (Dow Jones)--Argentine brewer Quilmes Industrial SA (LQU) reported Thursday better than projected 2006 annual results, further convincing a group of its minority investors to seek a higher price for their shares than that offered by Brazilian brewer AmBev (ABV). \u001d  AmBev, part of Belgian brewer group InBev (INB.BT), already owns 91.4% of Quilmes share capital. In November, it launched a tender offer to buy up the remaining shares at a price of $67.07 per American Depository Receipt. \u001d  Quilmes' 2006 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, grew 23% to $473 million, on a 22% annual sales growth to $1.2 billion. AmBev said earlier Thursday that Quilmes contributed to the 69% growth in its 2006 net profit, which reached $556 million. \u001d  Against this backdrop, Quilmes minority shareholders reiterated Thursday that they are very happy to own the stock. \u001d   \"We would tender only if AmBev offered a fair price, which we believe is significantly higher,\" said Amit Bhatiani, a portfolio manager at Duma Capital Partners, a New York-based fund which holds 1.1 million Class B shares in Luxembourg-based Quilmes. \u001d  Indeed, Quilmes 2006 EBITDA came well above the $407 million forecast made by Citigroup, AmBev's financial adviser in the tender offer. \u001d  Bhatiani's comments echo those made by other minority shareholders after AmBev extended Tuesday the bid period until March 16 to give shareholders - as they requested - time to review the company's 2006 year-end earnings. \u001d  Two other U.S. investment firms, Punch Card Capital and Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder Advisers LLC - which own 1.75 million and 1.3 million of Quilmes Class B shares, respectively - reiterated Thursday they don't intend to tender their shares. Based on the numbers they provided, the three shareholders have enough firepower to prevent the tender offer from succeeding. \u001d  During a conference call held Thursday to discuss the earnings results, an AmBev executive said the firm will wait until the current offer expires before taking any decisions. \u001d  \"The current offer is in progress, and it was just extended for 15 days so that shareholders could further analyze the offer,\" said Luiz Fernando Edmond, AmBev's director for Latin America. \"We are going to wait until the offer ends to decide what to do next.\" \u001d  The original tender period was meant to expire on Feb. 28, the day before Quilmes released its results. Through Feb. 26, only 1.9 million Class A and 1 million Class B shares had been tendered. AmBev said it will only complete the offer if more than 3.9 million Class B shares, equivalent to about 2 million of the firm's American Depository Receipts, are tendered. \u001d  This is also the threshold which Ambev needs, under Luxembourg Takeover Law, to squeeze out Quilmes minorities with an obligatory tender offer. \u001d  Fueled by Thursday's results, the minority shareholders now insist that AmBev increase the bid price, which they define as unfair. They said it was rubber-stamped by the Ambev-dominated Quilmes board without the review of an independent financial committee. \u001d  Despite the turmoil in global markets which sent most stocks lower Thursday, Quilmes' share price closed 1.6% higher at $71.65 - well above Ambev's offer price. The shares are up 8% over the last three months. \u001d  Furthermore, Punch Card Capital's portfolio manager Norbert Lou found in the company's results further evidence of what the shareholders call Quilmes' poor corporate governance. \u001d  \"The board must have known these results for at least a few weeks, and instead of entering into negotiations with AmBev to get a better bid price, they recommended minority shareholders to tender, and tried to withhold the results release until the offer closed,\" said Lou. \u001d  Duma Capital's Bhatiani noted that if AmBev's parent company, InBev, wants to merge with U.S. giant Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. (BUD) - as indicated by unconfirmed reports - it would be better to solve this issue first. \u001d  \"A merger with Anheuser-Busch would likely make the InBev franchise (including AmBev and Quilmes) more valuable, so it makes sense for AmBev to take care of this squeeze-out first,\" said Bathiani. \b \u001d  -By Serena Saitto, Dow Jones Newswires; 5411-4311-3125; serena.saitto@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:31 ET (12:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2c1cb9dee0d6cc673fa302cb4601e4b5","symR":["WSTF"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"H.I.G.

That easily beat the average expectation of four analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires for a 2.3% drop. \u001d  Total sales for the year were up 7.1% to EUR6.1 billion, exceeding analysts' forecasts for a 6.9% rise. \u001d  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization or Ebitda rose 2.4% to EUR2.1 billion last year. However, the company said that excluding one-offs from 2005 and adjusted for new entities in 2006, group Ebitda decreased 4% to EUR2.1 billion. \u001d  \"In a highly competitive market, Belgacom has more than held its ground in 2006,\" the company said in a statement, crediting Belgacom's strong market position for delivering high-speed internet. \u001d  Still, the company predicted a rocky 2007, particularly for its mobile communications division Proximus. It said Proximus' Ebitda margin for 2007 could drop to 45%, citing \"intense competition and regulatory pressure\". \u001d  Dexia Bank analyst Rob Goyens said the \"disappointing outlook will take center stage and will lead to further downward revisions of estimates.\" \u001d  Goyens said he is keeping his reduce recommendation and EUR32.7 target price on the stock for now, but will likely lower the target price later Friday. \u001d  Focusing now on converging its various services to help capture more market share, Belgacom said it plans to reduce its workforce by roughly 1,500 people by 2011, on top of the collective deal the company reached in 2005. \u001d  Belgacom said its board of directors will in April propose an ordinary dividend of EUR552 million, which comes to EUR1.6 per share, on top of the interim dividend paid in December. \u001d  Belgacom shares rose sharply in the last quarter of 2006, reaching a peak of nearly EUR36 in January, driven by takeover speculation and relatively low valuation. But the stock, along with most other European incumbents, has taken a nosedive in recent weeks due to weak earnings expectations, and fear of the European Union's regulator pinch. \b \u001d  Company Web Sites: http://www.belgacom.com \b \u001d  -By Anne Jolis Dow Jones Newswires; +32 2 741 1488; anne.jolis@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:19 ET (08:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2d848f77feb6b3366528795abde3d9b9","symR":["1925.TO","6519.TO","DWAHY","JP3165770003","JP3505000004"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Japan's Daiwa House Launches Tender Offer For Eneserve -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1925.TO","6519.TO","DWAHY","JP3165770003","JP3505000004"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","HOM","HPR","X225","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Daiwa House said in a statement it will buy 14 million new shares to be issued by Eneserve for Y486 each. \u001d  Under its tender offer bid, Daiwa House said it expects to buy 7.55 million Eneserve shares.

This team is officially named the DCGS-A Industry Team, with Northrop Grumman acting as the system integrator. \u001d  The team successfully conducted several DCGS-A, Version 4, Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrations at Ft. Belvoir, Va.; Ft. Huachuca, Ariz.; and Northrop Grumman laboratory facilities in Baltimore from August through December 2006. These efforts resulted in a new model for moving battlefield data and intelligence in support of tactically deployed combat commanders. The system uses queried/access methodology, and is designed to operate within a distributed-operations, enterprise environment. \u001d  Participating systems included the Army's Joint STARS Common Ground System, the Joint STARS Work Station, the Human Domain Work Station, the Digital Terrain Support System, the Integrated Meteorological System, the V3 Joint Intelligence Operations Capability - Iraq (JIOC-I) work suites and selected components of the Navy's DCGS Multi-Intelligence Segment integrated with the DCGS Integration Backbone (DIB). \u001d  Data interchange within the PoC was achieved using a combination of a commercially available Enterprise Service Bus and the U.S. Department of Defense DIB.

oilseeds, corn, wheat - and lower crude oil prices. \u001d  Thursday, U.K.-based bioethanol developer Ensus Group told Dow Jones Newswires that it has pulled its planned initial public offering on the U.K.'s Alternative Investment Market, citing lack of investor interest. \u001d  Questions are also being raised about the strain biofuels are putting on the global food chain and the environmental benefits they offer. \b \u001d  Supermarkets Deny Responsibility \b \u001d  Some of the U.K.'s leading supermarkets reiterated that they had no evidence that they supplied contaminated gasoline to customers. \u001d  A statement from Tesco Thursday said: \"As soon as we were alerted to a potential problem we carried out extensive tests on current and past batches of unleaded fuel, including from some of the affected vehicles, and so far have not discovered any abnormalities or contamination whatsoever.\" \u001d  It added: \"Whilst we cannot currently trace any problem back to Tesco fuel we will of course continue to urgently work with our supplier to identify what might be behind it.\" \u001d  Its statement said the problems appear to be linked to retail outlets in the southeast served by a refinery in Essex, near London. \u001d  A spokesman for Tesco added: \"It is unfair to single out Greenergy as the supplier of the contaminated fuel. We have many suppliers.\" \u001d  He added a storage facility, which he didn't identify, supplied fuel to Tesco, Morrison's, Jet-branded fuel outlets, Total SA (TOT), Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

(0992.HK), the Chinese computer maker that bought IBM's PC business, said it would recall 205,000 lithium-ion laptop batteries made by Sanyo because they could overheat after being struck at a certain angle. \u001d  Analysts say this won't have a big financial effect on Sanyo, as laptop batteries are a minor business for the company and the recall is relatively limited. The stock market seemed to agree - the company's shares closed down 2.6% at Y184 Friday, not far off the 2.1% fall in the Topix index of electric appliance companies. \u001d  But the issue's drop highlights the fact that Sanyo's core battery operations, one of its few profitable businesses, can be a risky area. And it is more bad news for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and the other investors that last year invested Y300 billion to bail out the company. \u001d  On Friday, Japanese mobile carrier KDDI Corp. (9433.TO) said it would offer software upgrades and battery recalls for about 635,000 handsets as the Sanyo batteries in them could swell and lose their charge. A KDDI spokeswoman said the problems occurred in two phone models and were caused by a software glitch related to recharging capacity. \u001d  The struggling Osaka-based electronics maker is still completing a recall of about 1.3 million lithium-ion battery packs for mobile phones made by Mitsubishi Electric Corp. in use with domestic carrier NTT DoCoMo Inc. The companies are negotiating the costs of that recall, which may include restitution to Mitsubishi Electric for lost phone sales. \u001d  The latest recall also evokes memories of the massive ongoing recall of 9.6 million lithium-ion battery packs made by Sony Corp. for laptops sold globally by makers such as Lenovo, Apple Inc., and Dell Inc. Sony, which initially said the recall was limited and wouldn't have a big effect on its finances, will take a Y51 billion hit for its replacement program, which works out to about Y5,000 per battery. \u001d  Sanyo has said the laptop batteries being recalled are limited to certain models that overheat when struck in a specific way. It also makes laptop batteries for other firms in addition to Lenovo, though it doesn't publicize which companies. \u001d  If no further problems arise and Sanyo's costs are similar to Sony's, that would equal about Y1 billion. For this fiscal year, the company projects a group net loss of Y50 billion as it continues to suffer from competition and falling prices in its main product lines. \u001d  Sanyo is under pressure to quickly turn around its financial standing from Goldman and partner investors Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. The investors received preferred shares for their bailout last year, which can in March be converted to enough common shares to give them managerial control of the company. \u001d  Sanyo is also under investigation by authorities for its accounting practices and said earlier this week it may revise its earnings for the four fiscal years through March 2004. Local media have reported Japanese regulators won't file criminal complaints against the company. \b \b   -By Jay Alabaster, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; jay.alabaster@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Tomoko Hosaka \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:23 ET (08:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3a11be32c02f6063c5519c426b8afcbd","symR":["LSE.LN","GB00B0SWJX34"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"London Stock Exchange: Nasdaq Stk Market Holds 61.3M Shrs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LSE.LN","GB00B0SWJX34"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:37 ET (12:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3acc8b26867f1a1fc37d0817fb1d26d8","symR":["RNK.LN","GB0007240764"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Rank FY Underlying Grp Oper Pft -15%, 07 Trading OK","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RNK.LN","GB0007240764"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","RCS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Lilly Vitorovich \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--U.K. gambling company Rank Group PLC (RNK.LN) Friday reported a 15% drop in annual underlying group operating profit, hit by smoking bans in Scotland and Spain as well as higher rent. \u001d  Turning to the current trading year, Rank said it is \"satisfied with the overall trading performance of the group in the eight week period since the start of the year.\" \u001d  Chief Executive Ian Burke said during 2006 the company either agreed or completed asset sales totaling more than GBP1.1 billion, including the sales of Deluxe Film, Hard Rock and US Holidays operations. \u001d  As a result of the group's restructure, management have \"transformed Rank into a focused gaming business,\" Burke said. \u001d  \"We see long-term growth prospects in the U.K. gaming market and we believe that, with our integrated model of bingo, casino and betting with both retail and on-line distribution, we are well placed to benefit from the predicted increases in consumer spending on mainstream gaming. \u001d  \"In the short-term we recognize that our businesses face a number of challenges, most notably the smoking ban which will be effective across the whole of Britain from July this year. Our strategy is to take vigorous action to meet these challenges while retaining our long-term focus on the growth opportunities for Rank,\" Burke said in a statement. \u001d  Underlying group operating profit before items from continuing operations - the key figure analysts track when assessing the group's trading performance - fell to GBP77.4 million for the year ended Dec. 31, compared with the analyst consensus of GBP78.5 million. Forecasts ranged broadly from GBP71.2 million to GBP93.2 million. \u001d  That compares with underlying group operating profit before items from continuing operations of GBP90.5 million for 2005. \u001d  Rank's gaming operations are made-up of Mecca Bingo hall chain, Grosvenor Casinos unit as well as the internet and telephone betting division Blue Square in the U.K.. The group also has 11 bingo clubs in Spain and two casinos in Belgium, according to its corporate website. \u001d  On Feb. 14, Rank said it plans to close nine Mecca Bingo clubs in England and Wales, in line with its strategy of improving the quality of its clubs portfolio ahead of the introduction of the smoking bans in England and Wales on July 1. \u001d  At the end of last year, Rank announced the proposed sale of Hard Rock for $965 million to the Native American Semiannual tribe of Florida. At the time, Rank said the sale is expected to be completed on March 5. \u001d  The company declared a final dividend of 4 pence, down sharply from 10.3 pence a year ago. \u001d  Rank shares closed at 218 pence Thursday, valuing the company at GBP1.18 billion. The stock has fallen around 9.1% over the past 12 months.

Total income rose 9.5% to GBP 28 billion from GBP 25.57 billion. \u001d  The bank's cost-to-income ratio fell to 42.1% from 42.4%, though net interest margin also slipped, to 2.47% from 2.55%.

The division's growth also reflects the bank's growing strength in global debt capital markets and stronger results from its origination and structuring business, RBS said. \u001d  Alex Potter, an analyst at Collins Stewart in London, said the division's profit was about GBP 200 million ahead of expectations, adding the quality of the result was also strong, as it was due to fees rather than volatile trading profits. \u001d  The retail-markets division's operating profit rose 5% to GBP 2.65 billion as the bank sharpened its focus on savings and investing and further reduced its exposure in the direct loans market. The move away from loans meant arrears in the second half of the year were flat compared to the first half, though total bad-debt charges for the year rose 10% from 2005 to GBP 1.88 billion. \u001d  In its U.S. Citizens division, RBS said operating profit rose 2% to $2.92 billion. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:32 ET (05:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3c0f48386d242f9c5da913ecf90077a1","symR":["0016.HK","005280.SE","051910.SE","KDV.YY","SUHJY","HK0016000132","KR7005280003","KR7051910008"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9871245,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9914163,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ASIA G3 BOND OUTLOOK: Pusan Goes Ahead But Others Cautious","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T08:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0016.HK","005280.SE","051910.SE","KDV.YY","SUHJY","HK0016000132","KR7005280003","KR7051910008"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","CHC","CHM","REA","RED","XATI","XDJGI","XHSG","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \b   By Ditas Lopez \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--The plunge in global equity and bond prices earlier this week is sending some would-be Asian borrowers back to the drawing board to reassess their fund-raising plans, which looks set to slow the primary deal flow in the coming weeks. \u001d  But not everyone is deterred. Pusan Bank, for one, is pushing ahead with its plan to sell its debut international bond next week. \u001d  The South Korean bank will kick off roadshows for a US$200 million Lower Tier 2 bond in Singapore on Monday, proceed to Hong Kong on Tuesday and wrap up marketing in London Wednesday. The bank still aims to price the debt following the roadshows, according to a person familiar with the deal. \u001d  The bank has tapped JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG to help sell its subordinated note, which is due 2017 and callable in five years. \u001d  Pusan Bank is the dominant bank in Busan, South Korea's second-largest city. The bank had total assets of KRW22.8 trillion (US$24.2 billion) at the end of 2006 and total capital adequacy ratio of 11.09%, of which 3% was Tier 2. \u001d  Earlier this year, the bank said it expects its CAR to rise to 11.41% by the end of this year and its net profit to increase 28% from KRW184 billion last year. \u001d  Moody's Investors Service rates the proposed issue at Baa3 while Fitch Ratings has assigned it a ranking of BBB. \u001d  No South Korean bank has sold a subordinated bond this year meaning there are no direct comparables in Pusan's home country. Last year, Shinhan Bank, rated one notch higher than Pusan, sold a subordinated bond callable in 2011. That was last quoted at a spread of around 108 basis points over U.S. Treasurys. \u001d  Details of the roadshows for Pusan Bank's bond offering emerged even as Asian U.S. dollar bonds were suffering from a global market fallout. \u001d  The latest jitters, sparked by worries the government in Beijing would make further efforts to slow the booming Chinese economy, came after a sustained rally in Asian bonds in the last few years. \u001d  But since the market rout on Wednesday, bids have started to creep back into Asia's bond markets. \u001d  \"Market volatility is nothing new, we just haven't seen it for a while. Issuers who are prepared to approach the market with realistic pricing targets can get deals done. Investors remain in buy mode,\" said Mark Leahy, head of Asian syndicate at Deutsche Bank AG. \b \b   KDB Assessing Market Conditions \b \u001d  Others, though, are taking a more cautious view than Pusan Bank. \u001d  Korean Development Bank, which just last week said it could announce mandates for an offshore bond in the week starting Mar. 12, said it continues to watch market conditions. \u001d  \"I can say nothing is fixed yet,\" said Injoo Kim, head of funding at the Seoul-based bank. \"As you know, the market is not in a good condition. The bank is assessing the market and doing the internal process of finding out its funding requirement,\" he said. \u001d  KDB is looking to raise the equivalent of at least US$500 million from the offshore market within the first quarter. \u001d  Other names keen to tap the offshore debt market in March also include South Korea's largest chemical manufacturer LG Chem Ltd. \u001d  LG Chem is looking to raise US$100 million through a dual-tranche loan-style floating-rate note, according to a person familiar with the deal. The deal is equally split between maturities of 2.5- and 3.5 years, the person said. \u001d  The proceeds from the sale, expected to take place around mid-March, will be used to refinance existing debt. \u001d  ING, in charge of the fund-raising, has invited a few other banks to help arrange the transaction and will announce their names in the coming week. \u001d  While bankers don't doubt that the region's borrowers can raise funds in the international bond market, some question whether coming to the market at this time will yield optimum results for either borrowers or investors. \u001d  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., Hong Kong's largest property developer in terms of market capitalization, late Thursday sold a US$300 million 10-year bond at 83 basis points over U.S. Treasurys - in line with the announced guidance. \u001d  Some market participants, however, said Sun Hung Kai Properties could have priced the bond at a spread around 10 basis points tighter had it sold the paper last week. \u001d  There are no official data on subscriptions for the offering but people not involved in the transaction said there was talk that the order book stood at around US$350 million just hours before the pricing. \u001d  \"I don't think it's a question of whether borrowers can borrow because they definitely can.

Return on capital employed reached 20.3% in 2006, up from 18.5% in 2005. \u001d  The strong result was mainly spurred by a turnaround in France and the U.S., the company's two key markets. \u001d  Adecco was able to boost full-year sales in France by 8% to EUR6.8 billion and improve its gross margin by 10 basis points. \u001d  In the U.S., sales rose 1% to EUR3.7 billion while the gross margin improved by 110 basis points. \u001d  Adecco also said the it will propose a dividend of CHF1.20 per share for 2006, up from CHF 1.00 in 2005. \b \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.adecco.com \b \u001d  -By Goran Mijuk, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 80 47; goran.mijuk@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 01:26 ET (06:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3cc4b0eaf95b0fdd7c3ab7e54b12ce6c","symR":["ATPG"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": ATP Ends 2006 With Record Reserves -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T05:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ATPG"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Certain statements included in this news release are \"forward-looking statements\" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The more than 400 Angels outfits in this sale will be the largest such collection to ever come on the European auction market. \u001d  While certain iconic film outfits -- Audrey Hepburn's dress from \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" or Judy Garland's outfit from \"The Wizard of Oz\" -- have fetched astronomical prices, many pieces of film history are relative bargains. Some can be had for as little as GBP 100. \u001d  Among the stars represented in the Angels sale -- by their costumes, at least -- will be Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan, Richard Burton, Robert De Niro, Alain Delon, Errol Flynn, Ava Gardner, Mel Gibson, Alec Guinness, Peter Ustinov, Catherine Zeta Jones, Halle Berry, Andie MacDowell, Madonna, Kevin Costner, Meryl Streep and Harrison Ford. \u001d  The outfits were featured in such films as \"Cleopatra\" (1963), \"Thunderball\" (1965), \"Star Wars\" (1977), \"Death on the Nile\" (1978), \"Out of Africa\" (1985), \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" (1991), \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" (1994), \"Braveheart\" (1995), \"Goldeneye\" (1996), \"Evita\" (1996) and \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" (1997). \u001d  Angels supplied its first Academy Award-winning costumes for Laurence Olivier's version of \"Henry V\" in 1946; up until this year, it had worked on another 26 Oscar-winning films. Among this year's crop of Oscar nominees, Angels supplied costuming for \"The Queen\" and for \"Marie Antoinette\" (which won in the Best Achievement in Costume Design category). Angels makes its costumes for hire and then rents them to the filmmakers. After shooting is completed they are returned to the firm, which retains ownership. \u001d  \"It hurts a bit to part with iconic costumes that have helped to make cinema history,\" says chairman Tim Angel, whose family has run the firm for five generations. But, he adds, it made business sense to sell pieces that were costing too much in insurance premiums. \u001d  Despite such everyday pressures, Mr. Angel says he loves the costume business. \"I loved history at school and I was lucky enough to be in a family business that allowed me to live history,\" he says. \u001d  A growing number of collectors and fans who want to own a piece of film history are driving the costume market, says Bonhams specialist Adrian Cowdry. \"Movies are the art form of the 20th century,\" says Mr. Cowdry, who privately collects items related to James Bond. If he had his pick of the Angels auction, Mr. Cowdry said he would love to buy -- \"if only I could afford it\" -- Sean Connery's dinner jacket of black wool, with satin collar, cuffs and buttons from the film \"Thunderball\" (estimate: GBP 30,000-GBP 40,000). \u001d  The costumes of film icons can fetch very high prices. In 1999, Christie's New York sold for $1.27 million the dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in 1962 when she sang \"Happy Birthday\" to President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden. In 2005, Bonhams sold the gingham dress worn by Ms. Garland in \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) for GBP 140,000. At Christie's in London last December, the iconic black dress designed by Hubert de Givenchy for Ms. Hepburn in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" (1961) fetched GBP 467,200. However, such prices are the peak of the market. Most pieces are significantly lower. \u001d  Here are some of the diverse costumes featured in the Angels sale, where estimates range from GBP 100 to GBP 60,000. \u001d  A number of pieces worn by Pierce Brosnan as James Bond are included. From \"Goldeneye\" comes a three-piece, grey wool suit designed by Brioni with shirt and tie (estimate: GBP 8,000-GBP 10,000); a cream linen Brioni suit with a Turnbull & Asser sea-island blue cotton shirt from the same film (GBP 8,000-GBP 10,000); and a green quilted ski suit from \"The World is Not Enough\" from 1997 (estimate: GBP 6,000-GBP 8,000). \u001d  Also among the costumes from the Bond films is a pair of camouflage combat trousers worn by Halle Berry in \"Die Another Day\" (2002) estimated at GBP 800-GBP 1,000. \u001d  From \"Star Wars\" comes an imperial commander's uniform estimated at GBP 8,000-GBP 10,000. \"Star Wars\" also provides the top lot of the sale in the full-length brown cloak with hood worn by Alec Guinness as Obi Wan Kenobi in the first film of the series (GBP 50,000-GBP 60,000). \u001d  Andie MacDowell was a hit in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" From that film comes her wide-brimmed black hat of woven straw with large black taffeta bow estimated at a very modest GBP 150-GBP 200. Also estimated at that price is Ms. MacDowell's chiffon blouse, beaded bra and satin trousers from the same film. \u001d  Jewelry highlights include a number of artificial and paste items worn by Ms. Zeta Jones in the 1990 film \"1001 Nights\" (also known in the U.K. as \"Scheherazade\") estimated together at GBP 300-GBP 400; and an artificial jewelled crucifix and ring worn by Mr. De Niro in the 1986 film \"The Mission\" (estimate: GBP 150-GBP 200). \u001d  The elaborate robe worn by Richard Burton as Henry VIII in \"Anne of a Thousand Days\" (1969), the tale of the king's relationship with his ill-fated Queen Anne Boleyn, is estimated at GBP 500-GBP 700. Sean Connery's outfit as Richard the Lion Heart in \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" (1991) is expected to fetch GBP 4,000-GBP 5,000 -- as is the costume worn by Mel Gibson as William Wallace in the Scottish saga \"Braveheart\" (1995). \u001d  --- \u001d  Angels Star Collection of Film \u001d  & TV Costumes. \u001d  Bonhams, Montpelier Street, Knightsbridge, London \u001d  March 6, 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. \u001d  Presale viewings: March 3 and 4, \u001d  11 a.m.-3 p.m.; March 5, 9 a.m.-7 p.m. \u001d  44-20-7447-7447 \u001d  www.bonhams.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:30 ET (05:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3d3de50bf4c18b7f84036276af2f0ca8","symR":["CIZN"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9986364],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Citizens Holding Company Announces Cash Dividend of $.18 Per Share","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CIZN"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK"],"Story":"\bPHILADELPHIA, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 02, 2007-- \u001d  Citizens Holding Company (NASDAQ: CIZN) announced today that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.18 per share payable March 30, to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2007. \b \u001d  \"The first quarter 2007 dividend that we are announcing today of $0.18 per share is an increase of 5.9% over the $0.17 per share paid in the first quarter of 2006,\" said Greg L.

This belief was parallel to the illusion in the U.S. that the economy there was holding up well, despite the malaise in the housing sector. \u001d  These responses were understandable reactions against previous undue pessimism. Indeed, the U.S. housing downturn is still far from triggering recession but it hasn't left the U.S. economy unscathed. The truth of the situation lies between those extremes. Similarly in Europe, the VAT hike has not cut short the economic upswing but it is unrealistic to suppose it is having only negligible impact on German consumer spending. If it were, it would be the first example in history of a major hike in indirect taxes having no effect on the timing of consumer spending flows. \u001d  The view that German consumers were taking the VAT rate increase in their stride was based largely on rather subdued consumer spending data for 2006Q4. It was widely assumed these figures showed there had been very little preemptive spending ahead of the tax hike. It seemed to follow there would be hardly a ripple in spending after the tax rate was raised. \u001d  This analysis left out of account the fact that some areas of consumer spending were certainly displaying unusual strength in the fourth quarter of last year. New registrations of passenger cars, for example, were 11% higher than in 2005Q4, with a year-on-year increase in December alone of 17%. Also, the argument was logically flawed. \u001d  Consumer spending could have been subdued in 2006Q4 despite preemptive buying; this would have been the case if underlying expenditure had been very weak. This, in fact, is now the most likely hypothesis. The Bundesbank's estimate of a 9.7% monthly slide in overall retail sales in January suggests that underlying consumer demand is appreciably lower than most forecasters have believed. If this is so, the growth outlook in Germany and, by extension, in the euro zone is less bright than the markets have assumed. As we warned a week ago (see No 2686), the upward trend in revisions to German and euro zone growth forecasts is over. Current GDP projections for 2007 are probably now too high. \u001d  To be sure, the German retail sales data are notoriously unreliable as a guide to aggregate consumer spending. Even so, the fall in retail sales recorded for January is so steep that it is hardly plausible to explain it away entirely as the product of shortcomings in the statistics. There is no arguing with the reported 11% year-on-year slump in new car registrations in January, which, incidentally, was followed by a 15% collapse in February. \u001d  These numbers are likely to increase the political pressure on the ECB to refrain from further tightening of monetary policy. However, Mr Trichet and his colleagues have consistently maintained they would look through any weakness in demand associated with the German VAT hike. They would, instead, rely on broader trends in the euro zone economy for a policy lead. They are likely to argue that, though the markets and politicians may be dismayed at the latest figures, nothing has happened so far that is out of line with the central bank's expectations. \u001d  The ECB is unlikely to see weaker German consumption data as an obstacle to the further withdrawal of monetary accommodation. Its focus will remain on medium-term inflation risks. \u001d  At the Ecofin meeting this week, some ministers were saying they saw no signs of inflation picking up in the euro zone economy. Clearly, they aren't devotees of the business surveys. The February purchasing managers' report for the euro zone included an index number for manufacturers' output prices which, since the series began in 2002, had only been topped by January's reading.   They must also be closing their ears to the pay claims that trade unions are lodging in Germany and elsewhere in the euro zone. \u001d  The belief that there are no significant inflation pressures may well rest on the recent tendency for CPI inflation to undershoot expectations. The simplistic view is that the ECB must have done enough to achieve its anti-inflation objective. But the pleasant surprises regarding CPI seem chiefly to have reflected the lagged impact of the slide in oil prices, which now seems to have halted if not reversed. The annual increase in the euro zone's CPI (ex energy) measure has pushed up from 1.4% in February last year to 1.9% in January this year.  If unprocessed food is also left out of account (apparently the ECB's favoured core definition), the upswing has been from 1.3% to 1.8%. \u001d  A continuation of these trends in core inflation, combined with firm energy prices, would eventually take headline CPI well above 2.0%. In fact, the ECB probably fears something even worse. Should pay settlements start to rise, non-energy prices could accelerate upwards. The ECB would probably argue that its limited success so far in keeping core inflation in check has depended on the general expectation that it will deliver at least two more 25 bps rate increases. If it were to relent in its drive to normalise interest rates, inflation expectations might creep higher.  There are likely to be more disappointments to come on euro zone growth. However, the ECB has envisaged the zone's GDP growing by as little as 1.7% this year. \u001d  Though markets will expect the ECB to have second thoughts about tightening further after next week's virtually certain rate hike, the Governing Council consensus is likely to favour a sterner course. \b \u001d  -By Stephen Lewis: (+44) 20 7190 7193; sjlewis@insinger.com \u001d  (Stephen Lewis is chief economist at Insinger de Beaufort Ltd., London, independent brokers specializing in institutional business.) \u001d  Opinions expressed are those of the author, and not of Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  This column is published for information only, and it neither constitutes, nor is to be construed as, an offer to buy or sell investments.

(NYSE: TYL) has been awarded Schools Interoperability Framework (SIF) Certification for the latest release of the Tyler Education Management Solution (TEMS), an advanced Student Information System for the K-12 school market.  This certification acknowledges Tyler's continued dedication to helping schools get the most out of their software investment and follows the certification of Tyler's MUNIS(R) Enterprise Resource Planning system last year. \b \u001d  The SIF Certification Program is an initiative of the Schools Interoperability Framework Association (SIFA), a collaborative association comprised of school districts, states, the U.S. Department of Education, and other pre K-12 organizations.  SIFA promotes standards that allow school districts to easily share information from multiple software systems.  In short, SIF translates data between different systems so that changes to information in one are reflected in all others. \b \u001d  \"Our goal is to enhance the teaching and learning environment,\" said SIFA Project Strategist, Laurie Collins.  \"Many schools, districts and states have cited that they not only see a monetary benefit from implementing SIF, but they also gain efficiencies and data quality that is more valuable and harder to quantify.\" \b \u001d  Currently used in 48 states and four countries, this interoperability has led to measurable cost savings by reducing staff time spent on data entry and re-entry.  It also eliminates the need for cumbersome software customizations that can cost school districts thousands of dollars. \b \u001d  Similar to email applications, SIF makes information available to a number of access points, and encodes data in a way that is vendor neutral and platform independent.  Tying all of this information together is a relatively simple process.  Integration software utility tools act as a liaison between applications and the school district's central server.  However, software companies must align their applications with SIF standards to facilitate the interoperability.  That's exactly what Tyler Technologies has done. \b \u001d  \"SIF Certified vendors have gone through rigorous levels of testing,\" said Collins.  \"Schools, districts and states gain assurance that in selecting SIF Certified vendors they have a greater chance of succeeding in gaining the interoperability they desire.\" \b \u001d  SIF standards also play a critical role in the education reform principles of No Child Left Behind.  The standards help improve accountability and reporting by providing a means to consolidate information effectively.  In doing so, some districts have seen increases in government funding that can be directly attributed to use of SIF Certified applications. \b \u001d  \"School districts and states are being held to a higher degree of accountability for the education of our youth,\" said Collins.  \"By using data interoperability standards they can assure the data that they are using to produce the accountability reports are accurate, timely and convey the true status of education.\" \b \u001d  As the desire for data interoperability continues to grow in education, SIF Certified solutions are becoming more widely sought after. \b \u001d  \"School districts often have limited dollars to spend on technology and staffing,\" said Tyler Technologies President and CEO, John Marr, Jr.  \"Using SIF Certified solutions like TEMS and MUNIS(R) allows them put the time and money they save into improving other areas of education.\" \b \u001d  Based in Dallas, Tyler Technologies is a leading provider of end-to-end information management solutions and services for local governments.

(Nasdaq: IDIX) announced today that SEBIVO(R) (telbivudine) has received approval from the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) as a once-a-day treatment, taken orally with or without food, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB).  CHB remains a significant global health care concern, particularly in China where it affects more than 100 million people(1-3) - representing about one-third of those infected worldwide.(2) SEBIVO is expected to be available in China in April. \b \u001d  \"The Chinese approval of telbivudine is positive news for the many CHB patients in China,\" said Dr. Calvin Q. Pan, MD, Director, Clinical Research/Hepatology, Mount Sinai Services at Elmhurst Hospital in New York City.  \"As a physician who treats many CHB patients in the U.S., it is good to know that the patients in China will also have access to this new treatment option. Now, Chinese patients may also benefit from telbivudine's ability to provide early viral suppression, a primary goal of treatment.\" \b \u001d  Telbivudine received regulatory approval in the United States from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2006 for the treatment of CHB in adult patients with evidence of viral replication and active liver disease. Telbivudine is called TYZEKA in the United States and is called SEBIVO in all other countries. The approval of SEBIVO in China follows earlier approvals in Canada, Australia, Switzerland and several countries in Asia and Latin America. SEBIVO also recently received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's (EMEA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommending approval by the European Commission. \b \u001d  Worldwide regulatory submissions have been based primarily on one-year data from the GLOBE study, the largest worldwide registration trial including hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative patients with CHB, and the first to include patients from China. The study results demonstrated that telbivudine provided potent viral suppression and high rates of PCR- negativity after one year.  An additional Chinese phase III trial, involving 332 adult Chinese patients with CHB, corroborated these findings and supplemented the filing in China. \b \b    About the GLOBE Study \b \u001d  Data from the worldwide phase III clinical trial, known as the GLOBE study, compared telbivudine to lamivudine, a commonly used antiviral therapy \bfor the treatment of CHB, in 1,367 patients.   In the GLOBE study, 60 and 40 percent of HBeAg-positive patients and 88 and 71 percent of HBeAg-negative patients achieved undetectable levels of HBV DNA (PCR-negativity) with telbivudine and lamivudine, respectively, at 52 weeks.  Additionally, patients who achieved undetectable HBV DNA levels at 24 weeks were more likely to undergo e-antigen seroconversion, PCR-negativity, normalize ALT, and minimize resistance at one year. \b \u001d  The primary efficacy endpoint of the GLOBE study was therapeutic response at one year, a composite endpoint coupling viral suppression (serum HBV DNA suppression below 100,000 copies/mL) with either improved liver disease markers (ALT normalization) or loss of detectable HBeAg. In HBeAg-positive patients, therapeutic response was 75% (n=345/458) among patients treated with telbivudine and 67% (n=310/463) for those patients treated with lamivudine, while the response for HBeAg-negative patients was 75% (n=167/222) vs. 77% (n=173/224), respectively. \b \u001d  In the GLOBE study, telbivudine was generally well tolerated with most adverse experiences classified as mild or moderate in severity. Frequently occurring adverse events (> 5%) for telbivudine v. lamivudine, respectively, were upper respiratory tract infection (14% v. 13%), fatigue and malaise (12% v. 11%), abdominal pain (12% v. 13%), nasopharyngitis (11% v. 10%), headache (11% v. 14%), blood CPK increased (9% v. 7%), cough (7% v. 6%),  nausea and vomiting (7% v. 6%), influenza and influenza-like symptoms (7% v. 8%), post- procedural pain (7% v. 6%), diarrhea and loose stools (7% v. 5%) and pharyngolaryngeal pain (5% v. 4%). Please see Important Safety Information. \b \b    Idenix/Novartis collaboration \b \u001d  Idenix and Novartis Pharma AG are co-promoting TYZEKA/SEBIVO, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and co-developing valtorcitabine, a second hepatitis B compound, and valopicitabine, a hepatitis C compound, under a development and commercialization arrangement established in May 2003.  Under this agreement, Novartis and Idenix will co-promote TYZEKA/SEBIVO and, if approved, valtorcitabine and valopicitabine in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. Novartis has the exclusive right to commercialize TYZEKA/SEBIVO, valtorcitabine and valopicitabine in the rest of the world. \b \b    Important Information about Telbivudine \b \u001d  The following information about telbivudine is adapted from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approved product label.  It is anticipated that similar language related to the product's indication and important safety information will pertain to the product in global labeling. \b \u001d  Telbivudine is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adult patients with evidence of viral replication and either evidence of persistent elevations in serum aminotransferases (ALT or AST) or histologically active disease.  This indication is based on virologic, serologic, biochemical and histologic responses after one year of treatment in nucleoside-treatment-na&#239;ve adult patients with HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B with compensated liver disease. Full prescribing information is available at www.tyzeka.com. \b \b \b    Important Safety Information about Telbivudine \b    -- Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal \b       cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or \b       in combination with antiretrovirals. \b    -- Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in \b       patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including \b       telbivudine. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both \b       clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in \b       patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, \b       resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. \b    -- Cases of myopathy have been reported with telbivudine use several weeks \b       to months after starting therapy. Myopathy has also been reported with \b       some other drugs in this class. Physicians considering concomitant \b       treatment with these or other agents associated with myopathy should \b       weigh carefully the potential benefits and risks and should monitor and \b       advise patients to report any signs or symptoms of unexplained muscle \b       pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly during periods of upward \b       dosage titration. Telbivudine therapy should be interrupted if myopathy \b       is suspected, and discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed. \b    -- Because telbivudine is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, co- \b       administration of telbivudine with drugs that affect renal function may \b       alter plasma concentrations of telbivudine and/or the co-administered \b       drug. Dose interval adjustment is recommended in patients with \b       creatinine clearance < 50mL/min including those with ESRD on \b       hemodialysis.  For patients on hemodialyis, telbivudine should be \b       administered after hemodialysis. \b    -- The safety and efficacy of telbivudine in liver transplant recipients \b       are unknown. If telbivudine treatment is determined to be necessary for \b       a liver transplant recipient who has received or is receiving an \b       immunosuppressant that may affect renal function, such as cyclosporine \b       or tacrolimus, renal function should be monitored both before and \b       during treatment with telbivudine. \b    -- Patients should be advised that treatment with telbivudine has not been \b       shown to reduce the risk of transmission of HBV to others through \b       sexual contact or blood contamination. \b    -- Safety and effectiveness of telbivudine in pediatric patients under the \b       age of 16 years have not been established. \b    -- Creatine kinase (CK) elevations were more frequent among subjects on \b       telbivudine treatment.  Grade 3/4 CK elevations occurred in 9% of \b       telbivudine-treated patients and 3% of lamivudine-treated patients. \b    -- The optimal duration of treatment with telbivudine has not been \b       established.  The relationship of initial treatment response to \b       outcomes such as hepatocellular carcinoma and decompensated cirrhosis \b       are unknown. \b \b    About Idenix \b \u001d  Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., headquartered in Cambridge, MA, is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral and other infectious diseases.

(NBR) said an internal review found it had misdated past stock-option grants, including some awarded on two dates when the recipients included its chief executive, Eugene Isenberg, one of the most highly compensated executives in history. \u001d  The contract oil-drilling company said options were wrongly dated as far back as 1991, and that it recorded a pretax charge of $51.6 million, or 13 cents per diluted share, in the 2006 fourth quarter, to account for understating past compensation expense for the wrongly dated options. The company said the review \"made no finding of fraud or intentional wrongdoing.\" \u001d  Nabors, officially registered in Bermuda but managed from headquarters in Houston, becomes the latest company to acknowledge options-related troubles amid a broad federal inquiry into whether companies improperly enriched their executives by retroactively granting stock options at low points. \u001d  Yesterday's disclosures marked an about-face for Nabors, which late last year said it had examined its options-granting practices and found no problems. A pattern of fortunately timed grants to Mr. Isenberg was a focus of a page one article in The Wall Street Journal in December, which noted that, of 11 new option grants to Mr. Isenberg between 1991 and 2002, two were dated at quarterly lows for Nabors's stock price and five more at monthly lows. \u001d  The Securities and Exchange Commission began an informal probe of Nabors's options-granting practices following the article's publication. \u001d  In yesterday's regulatory filing, Nabors said the internal review identified certain option awards in which the company had used an \"incorrect 'measurement date.' \" The company said it misdated awards to top executives on four occasions between 1991 and 1997. \u001d  On Dec. 4, 1995, a monthly low in Nabors's stock, Mr. Isenberg received two million options, adjusted for a later stock split. Two others also received options with that date. Nabors says some options granted then should have been recorded as awarded on Jan. 8, 1996, and others on Jan. 18, 1996. Nabors's stock was between 9% and 15% higher on those dates. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:00 ET (05:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"46f494afaa19ac7b1748524a85a3ecf0","symR":["RIV"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Riviera Hldgs 4Q Rev $46.5M Vs $46.2M, +0.6% >RIV","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RIV"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"47037de49ebee0b1520bd6dc188b1d98","symR":["NHHC"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Lawndale Cap: Premier Proposal Was Superior","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NHHC"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:11 ET (11:11 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"47d25186e58f30c2ca7db99d4e860d48","symR":["SXC.T","SXCI","CA8719292044"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": SXC Health Solutions Announces Multi-Year Contract Renewal With MemberHealth","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SXC.T","SXCI","CA8719292044"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"- SXC to provide suite of PBM claims processing solutions to support Medicare Part D - \b \b \u001d  LOMBARD, IL, March 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - SXC Health Solutions, Inc.

The consent solicitation process is scheduled to close March 9 and the consent of 50.1% of bondholders is needed to allow the amendments to go through, the person familar with the situation said. \u001d  -By Kate Haywood, Dow Jones Newswires, +44 (0) 7842 9315, kathryn.haywood@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:05 ET (11:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"490ed395699a481f10b857a998eef257","symR":["NIN.YY"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"NIBC: Intention To Prepare For An IPO In Coming Months","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NIN.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:09 ET (07:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4918f1d180d0c585847db2e263d2ddce","symR":["GLPG.BT","BE0003818359"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Galapagos announces 2006 full year results","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GLPG.BT","BE0003818359"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC"],"Story":"\u001d  MECHELEN, BELGIUM -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 03/02/07 -- \b \b \b*  Revenues more than tripled to EUR 35.2 M \b*  Year-end cash position of EUR 51.5 M \b*  R&D spend increased from EUR 8.9 M in 2005 to EUR 15.9 M \b*  Net loss per share increased from EUR 0.73 in 2005 to EUR 0.84 \b*  Established and progressed turn-key osteoarthritis alliance \b   with GlaxoSmithKline \b*  Created biotech leader in bone and joint disease through \b   acquisition of ProSkelia \b*  Built  top-tier service division with acquisitions of \b   Inpharmatica and DPI assets \b \b      Webcast audio conference presentation 9.30 CET at www.glpg.com \b \b    Mechelen, Belgium;  2 March  2007  - Galapagos  NV (Euronext  &  LSE: GLPG), an integrated drug discovery company, announces its full  year results for 2006 and provides market guidance for 2007. \b \b    In 2006,  Galapagos  succeeded  in  tripling  the  revenue  base  and accelerating the product pipeline towards the clinic.  An active  M&A strategy as  well as  organic growth  contributed to  these  results, creating a drug  discovery company well  balanced between  profitable services and  a  strong \bproduct  pipeline.    Galapagos  made  major progress in  the  bone  and  joint programs  and  signed  a  turn-key alliance with GlaxoSmithKline in osteoarthritis.  The acquisition  of ProSkelia added a  number of  advanced bone disease  programs to  our portfolio as well as valuable expertise.  To fund the progression  of the combined  development  programs  towards and into  the  clinical testing  phase,  the  Company  raised  EUR 42  million  in two  private placements in 2006.  The  BioFocus DPI service division was  expanded through \b two   acquisitions  (the   assets  of   Discovery   Partners International and Inpharmatica), to  become a world-leading  provider of drug discovery services. \b \b    Key figures 2006 \b \b    (EUR   millions, except net loss per share) \b \u001d  Note: The drug discovery operations of Discovery Partners International Inc were acquired 6 July 2006.

The acquisitions  made in 2006  will solidify \bthe division's  top tier  position and  the combined  entity should secure \bcontinued growth,\"  stated Onno van  de Stolpe, CEO  of Galapagos.  \"In our \binternal  drug discovery, we made great  progress in all  of  our therapeutic \bprograms.    The alliance  with  GSK  in osteoarthritis has  enabled  us  to \b gear up  this  program  for  the delivery of clinical candidates.  By \bacquiring ProSkelia, we obtained a number  of bone  programs based  on clinically \bvalidated  targets, derisking our portfolio and increasing the chances of having \bmultipleprograms in  the clinic  in 2008.     This year  we intend  to  fully \bcapitalize on the combined synergies of the acquisitions completed in 2006, \bplacing us in prime position to become one of Europe's  leading biotechs.\" \b \b    \"The  major  steps  taken  in  2006  have  transformed  the   Company financially \b for   2007,\"  said   David  Smith,   Galapagos'  CFO. \"Accordingly, we anticipate that  Group revenues in  2007 will be  in the range of EUR 54-58 million.  Furthermore, with a significant step up in  R&D  investment  to support  progression  of  our  clinical  and pre-clinical programs in  2007, we  expect that full  year cash  burn will be EUR 20 million.\" \b \b    Operational overview \b \b    Drug discovery division \b \b    In our rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  program, lead compounds have  shown good pharmacokinetic  properties  and  efficacy  in  relevant  animal models of  the \bdisease.    These  molecules  also  show  substantial protection against  bone  loss in  the  industry standard  RA  animal models.  The compounds target  a proprietary kinase protein that  was identified  using  the  Galapagos' \bSilenceSelect  target   discovery platform.  Based on these encouraging results, Galapagos  anticipates initiation of pre-clinical studies in  2007, with the potential of  a candidate drug entering clinical Phase I in 2008. \b \b    On 7 June 2006, Galapagos and GlaxoSmithKline's Center of  Excellence for External Drug Discovery announced  a turn-key drug discovery  and development alliance  in osteoarthritis  (OA) worth  EUR 137 million  in upfront, milestone,  and  equity  payments  and  up  to  double-digit royalties on  commercial products. Galapagos  will build  upon  its existing OA program to deliver drug candidates from target through to clinical Phase IIa  proof of  concept. This  alliance validated  the Company's target discovery  platform as  well as  our drug  discovery capabilities.  In this program, Galapagos reported the achievement of Proof of Principle  with compounds against  its proprietary \btargets,showing ex vivo protection of  bovine cartilage explants.   Galapagos has several series of compounds in hit-to-lead and lead  optimization that have potential to deliver  novel therapeutics for the  treatment of OA. \b \u001d  With the  acquisition of  ProSkelia on  22 December  2006,  Galapagos enhanced its product portfolio with the addition of three programs in bone diseases (two for osteoporosis and one for bone metastasis), and one in cachexia (muscle atrophy and weight loss).  The combined  drug discovery portfolio  will contribute  to  Galapagos' goal  of  having multiple clinical programs in bone and  joint diseases by the end  of 2008.   The transaction  with ProSkelia also included  an  exclusive license option to oestradiol glucoside (E2G), a product for treatment of 'hot flashes', a  menopausal symptom.   Galapagos has started  the preparations to initiate a Phase IIb clinical trial for this compoundin Q4  of 2007.   In  addition to  its programs,  the acquisition  of ProSkelia contributes capabilities and  facilities that will  greatly accelerate the Galapagos programs in bone and joint diseases. \b \b    BioFocus DPI division \b \b    Galapagos acquired  Inpharmatica and  the operational  activities  of Discovery Partners  International as  part of  its strategy  to  make BioFocus \bDPI  a worldwide  leader in  drug discovery  services.   The appeal of  this synergistic  offering has  been validated  through  a number of  recent deals in  which  a combination  of  services  were included,  like  the \brecently   announced  collaboration  with   the University  of  Bristol  that  combines  Inpharmatica's  Admensa  and BioFocus DPI's medicinal chemistry expertise. \b \b    BioFocus DPI  continues  to  be  successful  in  securing  multi-year contracts such  as  the  three-year target  discovery  alliance  with Arthrogen, the three-year exclusive  library contract with Roche  and the extension of its long term collaboration with Amgen into 2008. \b \b    BioFocus DPI  also expanded  its solid  relationship with  non-profit organizations by initiating a multi-year drug discovery collaboration with OneWorld Health,  entering a new  EUR 2.4 million target  discovery alliance with the  ALS Association, and extending the  collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. \b \b    In addition to  these previously announced  service deals,  Galapagos also announces  today  that  BioFocus  DPI  has  extended  its  drug discovery agreement with Eli Lilly  and Company (NYSE: LLY) until  the end of 2007. Total contract extension value is expected to exceed EUR 1 million. \b \b    Details of the financial results \b \b    Revenue \b \u001d  Galapagos' revenues for the full year 2006 more than tripled to EUR 35.2 million (2005: EUR 11.2 million). Of these revenues, EUR 31.0 million were generated by BioFocus DPI.  The Drug Discovery division contributed EUR 4.2 million to Group revenues. \b \b    Results \b \b    BioFocus DPI contributed approximately EUR 3.4 million to the result  of the Group on a  segment basis in  2006.

Balances of non-financial companies in Spain are 10% in deficit, compared with a surplus of 2% in Germany and the U.K. \u001d  Metrovacesa finds itself in the same boat. At the end of 2006, its book-gearing was 153%. While its Ebit, before asset revaluation, covered interest 2.7X, this could deteriorate rapidly should profitability slip. After all, interest expenses rose 37% in 2006 to EUR359 million. \u001d  The fortunes of Spain's real-estate and construction companies are arguably central to the outlook for the Spanish economy in 2007 given the fears the construction boom that has underpinned the country's growth is at an end. \u001d  The Bank of Spain has warned about the dangerous levels of debt taken on by developers and construction companies, and thinks Spanish property may be 40% overvalued. \u001d  Rising ECB rates have pushed up the cost of that debt for companies but are yet to have their full impact on Spanish households. They aren't as indebted as in Ireland or the U.K., but because almost all Spanish mortgages are variable, adjusted only every 6 months, there's a lagged effect of last year's ECB rate rises which might crimp discretionary spending through 2007. \u001d  As it is, falling residential rents, slowing house price growth, amid an overhang of new housing, look ominous for the Spanish economy. Analysts at Merrill Lynch are among those worried overbuilding might hit asset values hard and feed through to the banks, a large proportion of whose loans are to the construction industry. \u001d  With the interest expenses of non-financial Spanish companies rising, the \"normalization\" of credit conditions might squeeze Spanish construction and real estate companies particularly hard, quite apart from the wider economy. \u001d  That's why the near tripling of Metrovacesa's net profit in 2006, which included an upward revaluation of property assets, may prove to be a trailing indicator. \b \u001d  (Martin Fluck joined Dow Jones Newswires in 2006.

They also say that abiding by the new regulation will be costly. \u001d  Wendy's posted a disclaimer stating that it could not provide calorie information to its New York City customers because of the regulation. \u001d  \"We fully support the intent of this regulation,\" the disclaimer states, \"however, since most of our food is made to order, there isn't enough room on our existing menu boards to comply with the regulation.\" \u001d  The Times reported that although Wendy's was the only major restaurant chain to publicly announce its actions, the Board of Health said in a statement that it appeared some other food outlets were following suit. \u001d  New York City health officials would not say which restaurants appeared to have pulled calorie information, but a review of some fast food company Web sites found about six whose nutrition information sections were down last night.

The special dividend will be financed by a recapitalization of the Company's balance sheet through $4.8 billion in new senior secured credit facilities. \b \u001d  \"Dean Foods is an organization with strong momentum as reflected in our 2006 results and positive outlook for 2007,\" said Gregg Engles, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Over the past several years we've consolidated the industry and developed a leading market position through significant strategic acquisitions and investments in building out our branded portfolio. With this platform in place, we are now entering the next phase of our evolution. Over the next few years, we will be focused primarily on leveraging our scale to drive internal growth through maximizing productivity and efficiencies across our business.\" \b \u001d  Engles continued, \"Given our internal focus, our strong cash flows, and the incredible liquidity and flexibility of today's debt capital markets, the appropriate finance decision for Dean Foods today is to increase our exposure to the debt markets and return equity capital to shareholders, while enabling them to continue to participate in the Company's future performance and growth.\" \b \u001d  The special dividend declared by Dean Foods' Board of Directors is payable on April 2, 2007, to shareholders of record as of March 27, 2007. The dividend is subject to the completion of the Company's new senior secured credit facilities. Dean Foods common stock will start trading on an ex-dividend basis beginning on April 3, 2007, the day after the payment date, in accordance with NYSE rules. Shareholders who sell their shares prior to or on the payment date of April 2, 2007 will also be selling their right to receive the special cash dividend. Shareholders are advised to contact their financial advisor before selling their shares. \b \u001d  The total aggregate size of the dividend will depend upon the number of shares outstanding on the March 27, 2007 record date. The Company will distribute $15.00 per share to shareholders as of the record date. As of February 23, 2007, Dean Foods had 128.95 million shares outstanding, which would result in a total dividend of $1.93 billion. \b \u001d  \"Given our financial and business characteristics, Dean Foods is ideally positioned to take advantage of current attractive credit market conditions to recapitalize our balance sheet and lower our total cost of capital,\" said Jack Callahan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"After a thorough analysis, we have targeted an initial leverage level that we believe is a prudent and efficient use of our balance sheet while preserving flexibility to meet our capital needs and growth objectives, including pursuing highly compelling tuck-in acquisitions.\" \b \u001d  For U.S. federal income tax purposes, shareholders will receive a Form 1099-DIV in early 2008 to notify them of the division between the dividend and non-dividend portions of the special dividend. The process of determining these amounts, which entails a comprehensive review and analysis of the Company's history, is well underway. Shareholders are encouraged to consult with their own tax and financial advisors regarding the implications of this special distribution. \b \u001d  The $4.8 billion fully underwritten financing package is being arranged by JPMorgan Securities, Bank of America Securities LLC, and Wachovia Capital Markets. Completion of the facility, which will replace the Company's current facility, is subject to customary closing conditions. The new facility is currently planned to consist of a combination of a $1.5 billion 5-year senior secured revolving credit facility, a $1.5 billion 5-year senior secured term loan A, and a $1.8 billion 7-year senior secured term loan B.  The Company will also be replacing its existing receivables facility with a new secured $500 million facility. The Company's publicly traded notes will remain outstanding without modification. \b \u001d  As previously announced, on November 29, 2006, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program of up to $300 million, of which approximately $220 million remains. As a result of the recapitalization and one-time cash dividend distribution, the Company does not anticipate making additional stock repurchases in the near term. \b \u001d  Banc of America Securities LLC is acting as financial advisor to Dean Foods in this transaction. \b \b    Forward Outlook \b \u001d  \"For the first quarter, which will conclude before the recapitalization becomes effective, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of between $0.44 and $0.46,\" said Callahan. \"For the full year 2007, we continue to expect operating profit growth of around 7%, consistent with our previous guidance. However, with the increase in interest expense we are taking on for the remainder of the year, we now expect full year adjusted earnings of between $1.72 and $1.78 per share for 2007, depending, in part, on the finalization of the new capital structure.\" The adjustments to the earnings per share calculation exclude the net impact of facility closing costs, reorganizations, non-recurring charges and discontinued operations. \b \b    Conference Call & Webcast \b \u001d  The Company will be conducting a conference call today at 9.00 a.m. ET to discuss the details of the special cash dividend and recapitalization.

It's a good move, but its value to the whole group will be marginal. \u001d  On the acquisition front, potentially lucrative emerging markets are costly to enter these days - Vodafone paid a full price at the very least for India's Hutch Essar - so DT may have to look closer to home. \u001d  Bouygues' wireless business in France and Hellenic Telecoms are names that come up, but at least in the case of Bouygues Telecom, there are doubts about the eagerness of its current owners to sell. \u001d  As for the U.S., DT's current balance sheet - over 2X net debt - wouldn't support the hefty investment that expanding aggressively there would require. \u001d  Even if DT identifies good acquisition targets, generating returns well over its cost of capital won't be easy. \u001d  DT says its aftertax cost of capital in Germany is 8%. But there are no targets there. The further away it moves away from home, the fewer synergies it will get, so the cost of capital will only rise. \u001d  As for a new brand, DT does have T-Mobile's reputation to exploit more fully, particularly when students in Germany are known to generate ARPU of EUR135, high by European standards. But success here, assuming it comes, will hardly transform DT's fortunes. \u001d  That said, Obermann's choices are limited. T-Mobile Germany's services revenues fell 7.8% in the fourth quarter, as competitors like Vodafone took market share. \u001d  Revenue growth and Ebidta margins have declined at T-Mobile USA where many suspect DT lacks scale. \u001d  Obermann could make a difference more quickly by unlocking the value tied up in DT's fixed assets, particularly real estate worth around EUR5 billion. \u001d  But the X factor at the operators remains the degree to which management can squeeze out even more costs across DT's operations than it has already announced. \u001d  DT's revenue per employee, at EUR200,000, is less than its European peers, as are its Ebitda margins. They've slipped from 35% to 31% in the last three years.

financial results\" said Peter Brunelle, CEO of Inscape Corporation. \"Sales reached their highest level in five quarters, representing good sequential growth versus the second quarter and even stronger growth relative to prior year third quarter results. Operationally, we continue to transition the business to be competitive with the reality of a strong Canadian dollar relative to the US currency. Through a combination of continuous improvement activities and higher sales volume, our gross margins reached their highest level in several quarters. The work continues on expanding our market access through the addition of dealers and independent rep groups, on developing new products and on improving operations to allow us to consistently deliver positive results. Based on current order levels, we expect that sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 will be well above the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and in line with the third quarter of 2007\" said Mr. Brunelle. \b \bOperating Performance \b \bSales in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 were 13.7% higher than the same quarter of fiscal 2006. Year-to-date sales for the nine-month period were 4.1% lower than the same period of fiscal 2006 mainly as a result of unfavourable U.S. currency conversion rate. Gross margin as a percentage of sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was 27.1% compared to 24.3% for the same quarter of fiscal 2006. Improvement in production costs and favourable overhead absorption due to higher sales volume resulted in higher gross margin. This improvement was mitigated by unfavourable impacts of a weaker U.S. dollar. Year-to-date gross margin percentage of 26.2% was ahead of the 23.9% of the previous year. The increase in margin was a net result of improved production costs and slightly lower discounts during the nine-month period, offset by unfavourable U.S. dollar conversion. \b \bSG&A expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 were $0.3 million lower than the same quarter of fiscal 2006 due to lower corporate overheads. On a year-to-date basis, SG&A expenses were $1.6 million less than the year before. The decrease was a result of lower variable selling expenses and a decline in showroom related amortization expenses. \b \bThe third quarter of fiscal 2007 had a net income of $0.6 million compared to a net loss of $0.8 million in the same quarter of prior year due to significant improvement in gross margin and lower SG&A expenses. Based on a lease agreement signed with a sub-tenant of the vacated New York showroom, the Company recorded a recovery in the quarter of after-tax restructuring costs of $0.09 million as an adjustment to the original estimated costs of closing the showroom in fiscal 2005. Year-to-date earnings were improved from a net loss of $1.5 million in fiscal 2006 (which included after-tax restructuring costs of $0.3 million) to a net income of $1.0 million in fiscal 2007 due to improvement in gross margin percentage, lower SG&A expenses and favourable changes to our restructuring costs. \b \bOperations during the nine-month period generated cash of $3.6 million. As at January 31, 2007 the Company maintained a strong financial position with no debt while cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totalled $20.7 million, an increase of $3.7 million from the balance as at April 30, 2006. \b \bConference Call \b \bInscape will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. on Friday, March 2, 2007, to discuss the Company's third quarter and nine months results and to provide additional outlook on the next quarter.

Free cash flow decreased 19.8% to $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 from $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The decrease was primarily attributable to a one-time receipt of approximately $1.2 million in cash in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the result of a transaction where the Company agreed to relocate its Fort Collins KTRR-FM antenna to its Fort Collins KUAD-FM tower. Excluding the $1.2 million from the 2005 results, free cash flow increased 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005.  Additionally, for both the fourth quarter of 2006 and the full year 2006, free cash flow was negatively impacted by increased interest rates and increased borrowings related to stock buybacks. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, free cash flow decreased 18.9% to $11.9 million in 2006 from $14.7 million in 2005. The Company believes that free cash flow is a liquidity measure that helps investors evaluate the ability of the Company to generate excess cash flow for investing and financing uses.

Total capital expenditures in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006 were approximately $0.4 million. \b \b    Share Buyback Update \b \u001d  On July 29, 2005, Regent's Board of Directors authorized a $20 million share repurchase program. For the full-year 2006, the Company purchased approximately 3.6 million shares for approximately $17.2 million, including commissions.  In addition to the repurchased shares, a warrant to purchase 650,000 shares, 55,000 stock options and 10,000 restricted shares were surrendered to the Company.  During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. \b \b    Outlook \b \u001d  Regent has adopted a policy to provide guidance to investors regarding our financial prospects.  The following statements are based on current expectations.  These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.  Regent undertakes no obligation to update these statements. \b \u001d  Regent projects first quarter 2007 reported consolidated net broadcast revenues and station operating income of approximately $21.7 to $22.0 million and $5.4 to $5.6 million, respectively. Regent expects a loss per share of approximately $0.04 per share.

The Company expects capital expenditures for the first quarter to be approximately $1.2 million, including approximately $0.4 million related to the conversion of stations to digital technology. \b \b    Teleconference \b \u001d  The Company will host a teleconference to discuss its fourth quarter and full year results on Friday, March 2nd at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Much like the country's corporate-governance code, it will be implemented on a \"comply or explain\" basis -- meaning firms will have to publish financial information in line with the code or explain why they have not. \u001d  The industry's trade body described the initiative as an effort to improve the sector's transparency. But it's also seen as an attempt to forestall tougher regulatory steps under discussion by other EU governments. Germany in particular is pressing for tighter controls on private-equity companies, which some Berlin officials have described as \"locusts.\" \u001d  A meeting of European trade unions later this month in Paris will propose to German Chancellor Angela Merkel that this June's summit of the Group of Eight leading nations should ensure private-equity firms become more open and accountable. \u001d  Private equity has come under closer public scrutiny in the U.K. since four firms were reported to be mulling an GBP 11 billion ($21.6 billion) bid to take over J Sainsbury PLC, one of the country's biggest supermarket chains. Union leaders and some politicians have criticized what they see as the industry's secrecy and short-term outlook, which they say puts jobs at risk. \u001d  The head of the U.K.'s largest trade-union organization last month described private-equity participants as \"casino capitalists.\" \u001d  The U.K is the center for private equity in Europe, where volumes are soaring. The value of European private-equity buyouts rose to $240 billion last year, from $164 billion in 2005 and $119 billion in 2004, according to Dealogic, a data-tracking firm. \u001d  Ed Balls, economic secretary to the U.K. Treasury, said he was pleased the BVCA would be working \"to address levels of disclosure in the private-equity industry.\" The government has opposed stiffer EU laws and given broad support to the private-equity industry. \u001d  The BVCA statement was backed by several leading private-equity firms, including Apax Partners, Blackstone Group, KKR Financial Corp. -- an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. -- and CVC Capital Partners Ltd. \u001d  In the statement, the BVCA said rapid growth in the size and scope of private-equity activity in recent years had \"not necessarily\" been matched by increased disclosure. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:32 ET (05:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"574744714356c4a1304dd20771e0c842","symR":["SFLK"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Saflink Announces Sale Of Biometric Middleware Technologies>SFLK","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SFLK"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"58f8f8cbe8e41f03f84a8108228fda3d","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","NL0000235190"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Airbus' French Unions Call Half-Day Strike For Tuesday","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T09:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","NL0000235190"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XMDAX"],"Story":"\u001d  PARIS (AP)--Airbus' French trade unions confirmed Friday they are calling a half-day strike Tuesday to protest a restructuring plan that could cost 10,000 jobs. \u001d  Unions want staff to halt work Tuesday from 9:30 AM to 2:30 PM (0830-1330 GMT) and said similar action is expected in Germany. \u001d  The unions said a further Europe-wide strike call is expected in mid-March at Airbus parent, the European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.

Rivals have moved into NAND flash to minimize the impact of price volatility in the DRAM segment. \u001d  But with more entrants in recent years, including Intel Corp. through a joint venture with Micron, the NAND flash memory industry has also been hit by oversupply, leading to sharp price declines. \u001d  The average spot price of the benchmark DRAM chip has skidded about 30% so far this year, according to Taiwan-based DRAMeXchange, an online chip clearinghouse. The average spot price of a four-gigabit NAND flash-memory chip has plunged nearly 40% so far this year. \u001d  Tillner said Qimonda plans to focus on producing DRAM chips and will diversify within its DRAM portfolio to produce graphic DRAM chips, widely used in game consoles. These chips typically fetch higher average selling prices than commodity DRAM. \u001d  On the outlook for the DRAM market, Tillner said demand remains weak but he expects a pickup by the summertime as more consumers adopt Microsoft Corp.'s newest operating system, Windows Vista. \u001d  Vista, which became available to consumers late January, requires more DRAM content in PCs to operate efficiently. \u001d  \"There is a high level of capex in the (DRAM) market but we are viewing this as in line with the demand. Looking at this year's outlook, it won't be as tight as last year.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). All financial information provided in this MD&A is also in accordance with Canadian GAAP unless otherwise noted. All dollar amounts referred to are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. All dollar amounts are in thousand of dollars, except per unit amounts. \b \bDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS \b \bResolve Business Outsourcing Income Fund was established on February 12, 2006. On March 17, 2006 the Fund completed an initial public offering of units and through Resolve Business Outsourcing Limited Partnership (the \"Partnership\") acquired two businesses, Resolve Corporation and CSRS Holdings, Ltd. for cash and a 29.5% interest in the Partnership. The interests of the prior shareholders of Resolve Corporation and CSRS Holdings, Ltd. in the Partnership may be exchanged for units of the Fund pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement. \b \bThe Partnership has integrated the business operations of Resolve Corporation and CSRS Holdings, Ltd. The integrated operations are collectively referred to as \"Resolve\" or the \"Business\". \b \bResolve operates in one business segment - business process outsourcing (\"BPO\"). The Business provides customized BPO solutions primarily to large businesses and governments in North America. Resolve's BPO solution portfolio includes Finance and Administrative solutions (\"F&A\"), Customer Relationship Management solutions (\"CRM\") and Supply Chain Management solutions (\"SCM\"). The solutions for customers may include two or more portfolio solutions as part of the overall BPO solution. \b \bOVERVIEW \b \bThe Fund completed its initial public offering of units on March 17, 2006 and concurrently completed the acquisitions of Resolve Corporation and CSRS Holdings, Ltd. The balance of the year was focused on integrating the acquired businesses, restructuring certain parts of the senior management team to assist with the integration of the businesses, and to ensure the Fund was meeting or exceeding the requirements and expectations of being a reporting issuer. It was also vitally important for management to remain focused during this period of transition on the Business to ensure a solid platform existed to pursue the Fund's growth objectives. \b \bThe first year of operation of the Fund was a successful year. Financial results comparable to the pro forma financial results reflected in the Prospectus were achieved. Distributions declared matched the pro forma distributions outlined in the Prospectus dated March 9, 2006 (the \"Prospectus\"). \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:46 ET (11:46 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5c2582d0869fccbb0a6b61cf0ab45d1e","symR":["SXT.T","CA8301311087"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Sixty Split Corp.

(Nasdaq: IDIX), a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of human viral and other infectious diseases, today reported unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, Idenix's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $186.4 million. \b \u001d  For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006, Idenix reported total revenues of $15.3 million, compared with total revenues of $18.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Total revenues consist of reimbursement by Novartis of Idenix expenses incurred in connection with the development of Idenix's product and product candidates, TYZEKA(R) (telbivudine) and valtorcitabine for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and valopicitabine (NM283) for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV); the amortization of the up-front fees received by Idenix in connection with Novartis' license of TYZEKA, valtorcitabine and valopicitabine; and product sales of TYZEKA in the United States.  Idenix reported a net loss of $23.6 million, or a loss of $0.42 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006, compared to a net loss of $14.4 million, or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005. \b \u001d  For the year ended December 31, 2006, Idenix reported total revenues of $67.4 million, compared with total revenues of $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Idenix reported total operating expenses of $153.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with total operating expenses of $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The company reported a net loss of $75.1 million, or a loss of $1.34 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with a net loss of $50.8 million, or a loss of $1.03 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. \b \b    Business Highlights \b \u001d  \"In 2006, Idenix continued to evolve from a research and development organization to a company with comprehensive antiviral discovery programs, significant development expertise and commercialization capabilities, culminating with the U.S. approval and launch of our first product, TYZEKA, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B,\" said Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, Ph.D., chairman and chief executive officer of Idenix.  \"As we advance our hepatitis C product candidate, valopicitabine, in clinical development, we are also actively working to expand our pipeline with complementary HCV drug candidates and novel anti-HIV agents. We are committed to providing better treatment options for patients with viral diseases, building on the foundation that we established in 2006.\" \b \u001d  Major developments realized over the past twelve months are detailed below. \b \b \b     - In 2006, TYZEKA (telbivudine) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug \b       Administration (FDA) as a new treatment for patients with chronic \b       hepatitis B. TYZEKA has been shown to effectively suppress replication \b       of the hepatitis B virus.(1) Telbivudine, called SEBIVO(R) \b       (telbivudine) outside the U.S., received regulatory approval in China \b       and was recommended for approval in the European Union by the European \b       Medicines Agency's (EMEA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human \b       Use (CHMP) in the first quarter of 2007. To date, TYZEKA/SEBIVO has \b       been approved in more than 10 countries and is under review with \b       additional regulatory authorities worldwide. \b     - We continued to make progress in our hepatitis C program, determining \b       the best valopicitabine dosing regimen to advance in clinical \b       development in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients and \b       initiating a new phase I/II trial to assess the use of valopicitabine \b       in combination with ribavirin. We also worked to expand our HCV program \b       through organic discovery and collaborative research and development; \b       our comprehensive HCV discovery efforts are focused on discovering \b       next-generation drug candidates in each of the major classes of small \b       molecules. \b     - Our HIV discovery program generated the filing of exploratory \b       Investigational New Drug (IND) applications for two non-nucleoside \b       reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) compounds. The initial micro- \b       dosing (phase 0) study is now complete and we have selected the drug \b       candidate that will be moved into full clinical testing based on its \b       overall profile. \b \b    2007 Financial Guidance \b \u001d  The company expects to end 2007 with between $100 million and $110 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Included within this guidance are $20 million in regulatory approval milestone payments related to TYZEKA/SEBIVO that the company anticipates receiving from Novartis Pharma AG. \b \b    Conference Call Information \b \u001d  Idenix will hold a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. ET.

Idenix's current focus is on the treatment of infections caused by hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV. For further information about Idenix, please refer to http://www.idenix.com. \b \b    About TYZEKA \b \u001d  TYZEKA 600mg tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adult patients with evidence of viral replication and either evidence of persistent elevations in serum aminotransferases (ALT or AST) or histologically active disease. This indication is based on virologic, serologic, biochemical and histologic responses after one year of treatment in nucleoside-treatment-naive adult patients with HBeAg-positive and HBeAg- negative chronic hepatitis B with compensated liver disease. \b \b \b    Important Safety Information About TYZEKA (telbivudine) \b \b     - Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal \b       cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or \b       in combination with antiretrovirals. \b     - Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in \b       patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including \b       telbivudine. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both \b       clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in \b       patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, \b       resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. \b     - Cases of myopathy have been reported with telbivudine use several weeks \b       to months after starting therapy.  Myopathy has also been reported with \b       some other drugs in this class. Physicians considering concomitant \b       treatment with these or other agents associated with myopathy should \b       weigh carefully the potential benefits and risks and should monitor and \b       advise patients to report any signs or symptoms of unexplained muscle \b       pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly during periods of upward \b       dosage titration. Telbivudine therapy should be interrupted if myopathy \b       is suspected, and discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed. \b     - Because telbivudine is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, co- \b       administration of telbivudine with drugs that affect renal function may \b       alter plasma concentrations of telbivudine and/or the coadministered \b       drug. Dose interval adjustment is recommended in patients with \b       creatinine clearance <50mL/min. \b     - The safety and efficacy of telbivudine in liver transplant recipients \b       are unknown. If telbivudine treatment is determined to be necessary for \b       a liver transplant recipient who has received or is receiving an \b       immunosuppressant that may affect renal function, such as cyclosporine \b       or tacrolimus, renal function should be monitored both before and \b       during treatment with telbivudine. \b     - Patients should be advised that treatment with telbivudine has not been \b       shown to reduce the risk of transmission of HBV to others through \b       sexual contact or blood contamination. \b     - Safety and effectiveness of telbivudine in pediatric patients under the \b       age of 16 years have not been established. \b     - Frequently occurring adverse events (>5%) in clinical studies were \b       upper respiratory tract infection (14%), fatigue and malaise (12%), \b       abdominal pain (12%), nasopharyngitis (11%), headache (11%), blood CPK \b       increased (9%), cough (7%), nausea and vomiting (7%), influenza and \b       influenza-like symptoms (7%), post-procedural pain (7%), diarrhea and \b       loose stools (7%), and pharyngolaryngeal pain (5%). \b     - Creatine kinase (CK) elevations were more frequent among subjects on \b       telbivudine treatment.

That run-up has made Jones's valuation expand to levels that would give most investors gas, but the company is in the midst of a big-time national rollout of canned soda, and in the soda business, cans are king. \u001d  Jones, with it's roughly $300 million market cap and close to $40 million in annual sales, has built a fanatically loyal customer base since 1995, with brands such as Green Apple soda, Cherry White organic tea and WhoopAss energy drink. The Seattle company sells its bottled products at retailers such as Starbucks (SBUX), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Barnes & Noble (BKS). As for the cans, that soda was only available at Target (TGT). \u001d  But Jones's two-year contract selling cans exclusively at Target expired Dec. 31. In anticipation of that, last September the company inked a distribution deal with National Beverage (FIZ)  --  an agreement intended to transform Jones into a truly national player. That move, along with the company's announcement at a January investment conference that it had signed up 25% of the retailer canned-soda market (up from Target's 2% share), got the stock fizzing. Investors saw their stakes pop 89% in the last year to $12.31 a share as of Wednesday's close. By comparison, the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 index gained 9% over the same period. \u001d  Eschewing the industry-standard sweetener of high-fructose corn syrup to go with its hip, all-natural image, in January Jones rolled out its 12-ounce cans of Jones Pure Cane soda with the tag line, \"Corn is for cars, sugar is for soda.\" But there's much more to the story than a cute line. \"There's about a $70 billion market for soda out there, and the vast majority of it is sold in cans,\" says James Maher, an analyst with ThinkEquity Partners, the San Francisco investment bank. \u001d  Jones will report fourth-quarter earnings on March 8, and of more interest, reveal the list of retailers the company has signed up to sell its cans. Investor anticipation of which retail names will be carrying the soda has given the quarterly report an \"Oscar-esque\" feel, says Maher. And sure, it's probably hard for investors not to pray, \"Let there be Wal-Mart.\" \u001d  And perhaps there will be Wal-Mart (WMT), giving the stock a further boost. Perhaps there will be some disappointment, creating a buying opportunity. Either way it shouldn't matter much; observers say Jones is a long-term play, whether you're comfortable with the valuation or not. And by most traditional measures, the stock looks filthy rich. Its forward price/earnings multiple stands at around 95 and its price-to-earnings growth, or PEG, ratio stands at about 3.2, or more than twice that of the S&P 500. Alton Stump, an analyst with Longbow Research, an independent research firm based in, yes, Independence, Ohio, says he sees growth opportunities aplenty, but rates shares at Neutral on valuation. \u001d  But there's a compelling case to be made for the business fundamentals and quality of management that observers say trump the seemingly gaseous valuation. \"We've always said this is a long-term opportunity on a company that's evolving and changing its business model,\" says Nicole Miller Regan, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, the Minneapolis investment bank. She has an Outperform rating on the stock. \"It's a high-quality, high-growth opportunity and it's never been cheap. It may never look exactly 'cheap,' and that's for a reason. You have to look beyond the traditional multiples for valuation and consider the long-term opportunity.\" \u001d  The deal with National Beverage for canned soda distribution is the crux of the long-term opportunity. For one thing, Jones is able to add capacity without having to build it. It also affords much higher margin opportunities than bottling soda in-house. Bottles carry a gross margin of about 35%; cans closer to 45%. \"The average selling price per case and the margins they give to retailers are substantially higher than the national and private-label brands,\" says Peter Niedland, lead manager of the NS Small Cap Growth fund (NSIPX), which got into the stock in the $8-to-$9 range. \"By owning the stock we clearly think there's upside left in the story.\" \u001d  Going from the $500 million niche premium-soda market to the $70 billion canned carbonated beverage market naturally creates tremendous top-line potential. Perhaps more important, Jones sells at a higher price point than Coca-Cola (KO), Pepsi (PEP) or store brands, and that's something retailers love. \"Coke and Pepsi, generally one or the other, has a sale product at any time you go into the supermarket,\" says Maher. \"They are heavily, heavily promotional. So if you go with the Joneses, they are much less promotional, and for the same square footage retailers get much larger gross margin dollars.\" \u001d  As for management, Peter Van Stolk, founder, chairman and chief executive, gets praise for his youthful dynamism  -- he's 43 -- as does the way Jones has set itself up for future growth. \"I like the fact that they've got guys like Scott Bedbury on the board, who's the former head of marketing at Starbucks and advertising at Nike (NKE), where he launched the 'Just Do It' campaign,\" says NS Small Cap Growth's Niedland. \"I feel like the company has positioned itself from an operational standpoint to surprise Wall Street in a positive direction. And they've built a management team and infrastructure since they decided to go into this can market that will allow them to really accelerate growth from here.\" \u001d  Some investors are betting that Jones will be the next Hansen Natural (HANS)  --  the best-performing stock of the past 10 years, according to The Wall Street Journal. But the parallels aren't really that close, in some ways to Jones's advantage. Hansen had huge, explosive growth on essentially one energy drink brand, Monster Energy, Longbow's Stump points out. The Jones story is predicated on its wide portfolio of premium sodas. \u001d  \"Jones Soda is in a category of its own,\" says Piper Jaffray's Regan. \"First, it truly is a lifestyle brand. Two, it's a portfolio of branded products. That's really important. Jones Soda won't be a win on one thing. Jones Soda's a win because it has an entire portfolio of branded products. And that's what makes it a great long-term investment opportunity.\" \u001d  For more information and analysis of companies and mutual funds, visit SmartMoney.com at http://www.smartmoney.com/ \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:35 ET (12:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"66217b425116f9e1cfc686cfeb6fea4b","symR":["XRM"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9296375],"ret5":[0.8667377],"Headline":"Xerium Tech Cut To Underperform From Neutral At Baird","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["XRM"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:03 ET (07:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"665e18fa511337d5bba8ce2741da9e43","symR":["KMX"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9698],"ret5":[1.0164],"Headline":"CarMax Initiated At Neutral At Credit Suisse","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KMX"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:21 ET (11:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"66fefee558076307bad1eff639b62d90","symR":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[1.002585,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.046316,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Royal Bank Of Canada 1Q Net C$1.14/Shr Vs C$0.89","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:33 ET (12:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6725131f617dad467e13833f44b97a61","symR":["0011.HK","HSNGY","HK0011000095"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"HK Hang Seng Bank's 2006 Net Pft Likely Rose 5% To HK$11.9B","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T05:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0011.HK","HSNGY","HK0011000095"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XHSG"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Amy Or \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  HONG KONG (Dow Jones)--Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (0011.HK), Hong Kong's third-largest lender by assets, will likely post a healthy set of results for 2006 on robust growth in its core lending business, and analysts are forecasting stronger results ahead due to an expansion of its China business. \u001d  The bank, in which HSBC Holdings PLC (HBC) holds 62%, will disclose its full-year results after the stock market closes at 0830 GMT Monday. \u001d  Hang Seng Bank is expected to report a 5% rise in net profit to HK$11.9 billion from HK$11.4 billion a year earlier, according to the average forecast in a survey of 19 analysts by Thomson Financial. \u001d  The bank's lending business was robust owing to an expansion of interest margins to 2.40% from 2.19%, according to estimates by JPMorgan Securities (Asia). The bank was helped by the high levels of liquidity in the local banking system, which kept borrowing costs among banks low, while its benchmark commercial lending rate stayed at 7.75%. \u001d  The performance of Hang Seng Bank's non-lending business is less predictable, however, and may well have hurt its profit margin, analysts said. JPMorgan said that while stock brokerage and wealth management income likely performed well, reflecting bullish stock markets in the past year, this was likely offset by higher operating expenses, including staff costs. \u001d  For this year and the next few years, analysts are looking beyond Hong Kong, where the bank operates 80 branches, to China.

Return on capital employed reached 20.3% in 2006, up from 18.5% in 2005. \u001d  \"This is a good set of results and is a confirmation that the company is on track to achieve its targets\", said Scott Weldon, analyst at Bank Vontobel. \u001d  The strong result was mainly spurred by a turnaround in France and the U.S., the company's two key markets. \u001d  Adecco was able to boost full-year sales in France by 8% to EUR6.8 billion and improve its gross margin by 10 basis points. \u001d  In the U.S., sales rose 1% to EUR3.7 billion while the gross margin improved by 110 basis points. \u001d  Adecco also said the it will propose a dividend of CHF1.20 per share for 2006, up from CHF 1.00 in 2005. \b \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.adecco.com \b \u001d  -By Goran Mijuk, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 80 47; goran.mijuk@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:43 ET (07:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"674b3ad62de42717976a7ff5f1d32d48","symR":["OLN"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9739027],"ret5":[0.9620403],"Headline":"Olin Corp CEO 2006 Total Pay Valued At $4.59M >OLN","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OLN"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Olin Corp.

(BSX) said in a regulatory filing late Thursday that the tally of lawsuits related to 2005 issues with Guidant heart-rhythm devices has grown to more than 1,175 cases. \u001d  The Natick, Mass., medical-device company also joined rival St. Jude Medical Inc. (STJ) in reporting that it has received a statement from a French antitrust enforcement body alleging an act of industry collusion, in 2001, among implantable defibrillator makers. \u001d  Boston Scientific disclosed its latest legal challenges in its 10-K annual report for 2006, filed with the SEC. The report also showed that Medinol Ltd., an Israeli device firm Boston Scientific has had legal scrapes with before, has launched a new activity against the company in Germany. \u001d  Boston Scientifics said it's now facing more than 1,100 individual lawsuits and about 75 class action suits linked to the Guidant implantable defibrillator troubles in 2005. The number of cases has grown from a combined tally of about 842 cases in November, when Boston Scientific made its third-quarter report with the SEC. \u001d  Guidant was already facing hundreds of lawsuits related to recalled devices when Boston Scientific acquired the company for about $27 billion in April last. Boston Scientific repeated in Thursday's filing, as it's said previously, that most claimants are suing for medical monitoring and anxiety and not physical injury. \u001d  Most cases are pending in federal court, and federal cases have been consolidated under \"multi-district litigation\" rules and moved to a U.S. District Court in Minnesota. The first federal court trial is scheduled for July 16 this year, Boston Scientific said. \u001d  The company said in Thursday's filing that, as of the end of 2006, it has accrued $485 million \"for legal matters that are probable and estimable.\" \u001d  That's up $101 million from the total as of Sept. 30, and up $450 million from the amount at the end of 2005. The funds primarily represent accrued legal defense costs related to assumed Guidant litigation and product liability claims. \u001d  St. Jude said in its 10-K report Wednesday that it had received a \"statement of objections\" from the French Conseil de la Concurrence that involved St. Jude and \"the four other main suppliers of ICDs,\" or defibrillators, in France. St. Jude didn't identify the other companies. \u001d  Boston Scientific reported on Thursday that it, too, has received a statement from the French regulator, and also said it involved \"the four other main suppliers of ICDs in France.\" \u001d  The statements alleged that the defibrillator makers in 2001 collectively refrained from responding to a tender for devices from a group of 17 University Hospital Centers in France, St. Jude and Boston Scientific said. Both companies said they are evaluating the matter. \u001d  If the allegations are upheld, it's most likely that St. Jude's French subsidiary would be liable to pay a civil fine, St. Jude said. The company said it was too early in the process to estimate the likely amount of a fine. \u001d  The Conseil de la Concurrence is one of the bodies responsible for enforcement of antitrust and competition law in France, the companies said. \u001d  -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:34 ET (12:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"67ba28125d9e9fae1599c5223ec18247","symR":["OI"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9949023],"ret5":[1.028887],"Headline":"OI European Group To Use Proceeds To Repay Borrowings>OI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OI"],"IndustryCodes":["CTR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:31 ET (07:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"67d03e933388a348098e7dc75bfd3df6","symR":["PWR"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9682752],"ret5":[1.070152],"Headline":": Officers of Quanta Services to Report the Withholding of Shares","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PWR"],"IndustryCodes":["CON","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  HOUSTON, March 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Quanta Services, Inc.

The main contributing factor to the planned increase of the net  loss was an increase in research  and development costs from EUR 8.9  million to EUR 15.9 million.  The method  of measuring R&D expenditure has  been changed in  order to  better reflect  the \btrue  nature of  the  costs involved,  following   the   ProSkelia  acquisition \b  and   increased importance of our R&D spend within the group.  Galapagos now includesindirect costs such as premises  costs, support staff and other  site related costs; these costs would previously have been shown in G&A. Therefore, the comparatives for  2005 and 2004  have been updated  to reflect  these \bchanges.     Before  implementing  the  change,   the investment in R&D would have been EUR 12.1 million in 2006, in line with guidance. \b \b    Cash flow and cash position \b \b    Galapagos' cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 51.5 million on  31 December 2006 up from  EUR 23.6 million at the end of 2005. \b \b    Through private placements on 19 September 2006 (EUR 11 million) and  22 December 2006 (EUR 31  million), Galapagos raised  EUR 40.3 million net \bofcosts.    After  making  an  estimate  for  the  cash  acquired  with Inpharmatica, for which  shares are  to be issued,  and removing  the purchase price of the acquisition of the DPI assets of EUR 4.3  million, the full year cash burn was EUR 11.9 million. \b \b    Outlook 2007 \b \b    Galapagos anticipates growth in revenues from milestones in its  Drug Discovery division  and  an  increase in  sales  from  BioFocus  DPI, resulting in a full-year revenue guidance between EUR 54 - 58 million in 2007.  R&D expenditure will increase to approximately EUR 33 million  as a result of initiating clinical Phase IIb trials of the E2G  compound in  Q4  2007, \bprogressing  its  RA  and  OP  drug  candidates   into preclinical studies, \band advancing   its other  R&D programs in  bone and joint diseases.   The R&D  expenditure will be  partly offset  by anticipated milestones from its alliance  partners.  We believe  this investment in R&D  will create  the shareholder  value expected  from entering  the  clinic  with  multiple \bprograms  in  2008.    Through continued cost control, full year cash burn in \b2007 should be limited to EUR 20 million. \b \b \b Consolidated Financial Statements 2006 \b \b    The  electronic   version   of  Galapagos'   Consolidated   Financial Statements \b 2006      is     now      available     online      at www.glpg.com/investor/financial_reports.htm.

Direct cost related to providing the BPO solution to the travel customers in 2005 was $7,675 ($6,076 prorated for 9 1/2 months). Therefore, the change in direct costs is substantially related to the disposition of the travel customers. \b \bAs noted above under Revenue, contracts have various contract lengths and maturities. In response to the competitive revenue pressure and the desire to maximize earnings during the term of a contract, the Business is constantly seeking ways to reduce costs or to benefit from economies of scale for a specific solution. Direct costs are higher and gross profits tend to be lower during the start up of a new solution. Conversely gross profits tend to be maximized during the later stages of a contract. Initial direct costs are lower on subsequent applications of a new solution. \b \bOperating Expenses \b \bOperating expenses include selling, general and administrative costs. Operating expenses decreased by $1,124 for the period of operation in 2006 over the prorated pro forma operating expenses for 2005. The travel business accounted for an immaterial portion of the decline. Costs related to being a reporting issuer were substantially greater than the prorated pro forma expense provided for in the Prospectus. Corporate governance materials had to be created, processes had to be established to meet regulatory requirements and, as a result there was a greater reliance during the initial period on outside advisors and legal counsel to assist in establishing the framework. However, the increased costs related to being a reporting issuer were more than offset by reductions in other operating expenses throughout the Business. \b \bDepreciation and Amortization \b \bDepreciation and amortization increased $2,586 for the period of operation in 2006 over the prorated pro forma 2005 period. The change is a result of increased annual amortization of the intangible assets over the preliminary estimate made at the time the pro forma financial statements were prepared. Subsequent to the acquisitions on March 17, 2006, the Partnership engaged a valuation firm to assist in valuing the underlying net assets acquired and the estimated useful lives on the acquired intangibles. \b \bInterest Expense \b \bInterest expense for the 2006 period of operation is consistent with the prorated pro forma interest expense for 2005. \b \bNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations \b \bOn May 1, 2006, the Business sold certain assets and customer contracts related to travel industry fulfillment. The gross proceeds were $3,000. The Partnership recorded a pre-tax and pre non-controlling interest gain on disposal of $2,129. The net gain on disposal of $961 was reduced by a net loss from discontinued operations to the date of disposal of $254. \b \bNet Earnings \b \bNet earnings increased $3,543 for the 2006 period over the prorated pro forma 2005 period. The 2005 prorated pro forma net earnings included the travel business disposed of in 2006 and a gain realized on settlement of a long-term contract of $5,744. The 2006 net earnings included a gain on disposition of the travel business. In addition, the basis of amortization of intangibles differs from the preliminary approach used in the pro forma. This resulted in increased amortization and lower earnings. \b \bDistributable Cash \b \bEffective as of August 2006, the Canadian Securities Administrators (\"CSA\") recommends that distributable cash be calculated by reference to cash flows from operating activities as reflected in the statement of cash flows after deducting maintenance capital expenditures for the same period. As a result, the distributable cash as presented in the Prospectus is not directly comparable to the method recommended by the CSA. No pro forma statement of cash flows was prepared for inclusion in the Prospectus and therefore a revised calculation under the new basis cannot be made. The differences in the two approaches are certain working capital changes that were excluded under the previous approach to calculating distributable cash. \b \bAlthough the two methods of calculating distributable cash are not directly comparable, they have been presented for information purposes. The Fund's distributable cash based on the new definition is $1,148 less than the prorated pro forma distributable cash as reflected in the Prospectus. If distributable cash was calculated for the period from March 17, 2006 to December 31, 2006 on the same basis as was used in the Prospectus, it would have been $29,783 or $2,269 higher than the new recommended approach for 2006 and $1,121 higher than the prorated pro forma amount for 2005. Therefore the Fund was able to meet its distributable cash objective for 2006 as set out in the Prospectus. \b \bFOURTH QUARTER \b \bAs a result of the Fund completing its initial public offering and the acquisitions on March 17, 2006, no quarterly financial information is available for the fourth quarter of 2005. The comments below compare the fourth quarter of 2006 to the prior two quarters of 2006. \b \bResults of Operations \b \bFourth quarter revenue of $65,315 was $3,117 less than the third quarter and $3,832 less than the second quarter. The decline in revenue is a result of expected text book distribution and vehicle registration declines due to seasonality that were partially offset by holiday season program increases in other areas of the business. Direct costs in the fourth quarter were reduced over the prior two quarters with the reduction in revenue. A significant component of direct costs is people costs and these could not be scaled back at the same rate as the reduction in revenue for the quarter. Operating expenses increased $1,975 over the third quarter and $401 over the second quarter. The primary components of the increase are compensation costs related to new senior level employees, commissions related to new customer contracts, termination costs related to former employees, timing of health claims at the US operations and other costs related to the first year as a public entity. Depreciation, amortization and interest expense for the fourth quarter are similar to the prior two quarters. Due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the United States dollar at December 31, 2006, the Fund recorded unrealized losses on its outstanding foreign exchange contracts in the amount of $1,890 during the quarter. The negative impact of foreign exchange on the fourth quarter earnings before income taxes compared to the third quarter was $1,627 and compared to the second quarter was $4,374. As a result of the seasonality in revenue, an increase in operating costs during the quarter and the unrealized loss on the foreign exchange contracts, a net loss for the three month period occurred. \b \bDistributable Cash \b \bCash provided by operating activities during the fourth quarter was impacted by changes in working capital during the quarter and the lower earnings. Net cash generated by operating activities during the fourth quarter was $4,779, down from $17,048 in the third quarter and $7,143 in the second quarter. Changes in working capital represented the largest component of the cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, maintenance capital expenditures of $2,631 were acquired compared to approximately $1,000 in each of the prior two quarters. The increased maintenance capital expenditures represent a catch up from prior quarters. \b \bSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS \b \b \bConsolidated Statement of Earnings \b \b                       For the \b                        period      Three      Three \b                      March 17,    months     months     Three     15-day \b                       2006 to      ended      ended    months     period \b                      December   December  September     ended      ended \b                            31,        31,        30,  June 30,  March 31, \b                          2006       2006       2006      2006       2006 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                             $          $          $         $          $ \b \bRevenue                214,754     65,315     68,432    69,147     11,860 \bDirect costs           151,052     46,760     47,274    49,381      7,636 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bGross profit            63,702     18,555     21,158    19,766      4,224 \bOperating expenses      42,184     14,105     12,130    13,704      2,244 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bOperating profit        21,518      4,450      9,028     6,062      1,980 \bDepreciation \b and amortization       24,442      7,722      7,735     7,733      1,252 \bInterest expense         4,053      1,226      1,449     1,162        217 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bEarnings (loss) \b before the following:  (6,977)    (4,498)      (156)   (2,833)       511 \bMark-to-market \b on derivatives            675      1,890        263    (2,484)     1,006 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bEarnings (loss) \b before income taxes    (7,652)    (6,388)      (419)     (349)      (495) \bProvision for \b (recovery of) \b income taxes          (12,924)    (3,386)     3,098    (6,039)      (401) \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bEarnings (loss) \b before non-controlling \b interest                5,272     (3,002)     2,679     5,690        (94) \bNon-controlling \b interest                1,345       (819)       513     1,680        (29) \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bNet earnings (loss) from \b continuing operations   3,927     (2,183)     2,166     4,010        (65) \bNet earnings from \b discontinued operations   707          -

Excluding the non-cash gain, net profit met analyst views but disappointed investors which had hoped for a more bullish outlook. \u001d   At 1105 GMT, shares of Adecco were down 3.1%, or CHF2.55, to CHF78.55 in an overall firmer market. \u001d  In the fourth quarter, net profit jumped 23% to EUR212 million from EUR171 million, also beating bottom line views, while revenue increased 8% to EUR5.28 billion from EUR4.89 billion. \u001d  \"We are well on track to reach our long-term goals of 7% to 9% annual revenue growth, as well as an operating margin of over 5% and a return on capital employed of above 25% by 2009,\" said Chief Executive Dieter Scheiff. \u001d  In 2006, sales rose 12% to EUR20.42 billion from EUR18.30 billion in 2005, while the operation margin improved to 4% from an earlier 3.4%. Return on capital employed reached 20.3% in 2006, up from 18.5% in 2005. \u001d  Scheiff also flagged more bolt-on acquisitions in markets such as Europe and Asia and said Adecco has around EUR1.5 billion at a hand as last year's performance also strengthened the balance sheet. \u001d  In 2006, Adecco's cash position surged 87% to EUR875 million from EUR468 million while shareholders' equity rose 16% to EUR2.46 billion from EUR2.12 billion. \u001d  Adecco, which was formed in 1996 through the merger of Switzerland's Adia and France's Ecco, has been on an aggressive buying spree in recent years. \u001d  Before acquiring Germany's DIS in 2006, Adecco bought U.S.-based Staffwise Legal, Spain-based Humangroup and France's Altedia in 2005, which followed earlier buys such as Sydelis in France and PeopleOne in India. These acquisitions cost Adecco more than EUR1 billion. \u001d   Meanwhile, Scheiff said the company would continue to focus on organic growth as well and attempt to boost its professional staffing business, amid which the company attempts to increasingly place specialized employees rather than blue-collar workers. \u001d  For that reason, the company last year aligned its six new divisions along employment groups such as engineering or information technology, mainly aimed at improving the company's margins. \u001d  The revamp already bore fruit in key markets such as the U.S. and France, where Adecco in the past struggled with weak growth rates and declining profitability. \u001d  Adecco was able to boost full-year sales in France by 8% to EUR6.8 billion and improve its gross margin by 10 basis points. In the U.S., sales rose 1% to EUR3.7 billion while the gross margin improved by 110 basis points. Adecco only details gross margins changes by geography. \u001d  Analysts generally welcomed Adecco's figures and also applauded the dividend increase to CHF1.2 per share from a previous CHF1 a share. \u001d  \"This is a good set of results and is a confirmation that the company is on track to achieve its targets\", said Scott Weldon, analyst at Bank Vontobel, who rates the stock at market outperform. They attributed the share price drop to the fact that Adecco wasn't able to positively surprise investors. \b \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.adecco.com \b \u001d  -By Goran Mijuk, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 80 47; goran.mijuk@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:03 ET (12:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6c58cb516b651b9260a16c5582a846a2","symR":["MDT"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9989827],"ret5":[1.002035],"Headline":"FDA Panel Rejects Medtronic Heart-Failure Device >MDT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MDT"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Jennifer Corbett Dooren \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  (This article was originally published Thursday) \b \u001d  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--A U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel Thursday rejected a first-of-a-kind device by Medtronic Inc. (MDT) designed to monitor the condition of heart-failure patients, saying there wasn't enough evidence that the device really helped patients. \u001d  The panel of outside medical experts voted 9 to 2 in recommending that the FDA not approve the device. \u001d  The device, known as a hemodynamic monitor, is designed to measure the heart's pressure, rate and body temperature to determine if fluid is building up. The idea is to allow doctors to monitor and detect worsening heart failure more quickly and to prevent hospitalizations. Doctors typically manage fluid buildup from heart failure with a variety of drugs. \u001d  However, the clinical study of 274 patients who had the so-called Chronicle Implantable Hemodynamic Monitor implanted showed it didn't meet a goal of a statistically significant reduction in hospitalizations and other events. \u001d  \"I so want this to work,\" said John Teerlink, a panel member and director of the heart-failure clinic at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco. But, he said, \"I don't believe it represents a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness at this time.\" \u001d  Teerlink and many other panel members said while they are intrigued about the data that could be generated by the device, the possible benefits of earlier intervention by doctors didn't outweigh the risk of surgery to implant the device. The panel did agree with the FDA, however, that the device itself is safe. \u001d  The FDA usually follows its panel's advice, but is not required to do so. \u001d  \"This is our first shot,\" David Steinhaus, Medtronic's vice president and medical director told the panel. \"This is just like the early stage of defibrillators where we didn't know who would benefit.\" After the meeting, he said the company would work with the FDA to \"define the appropriate path for approval.\" \u001d  Indeed, many panel members encouraged the company to continue studying the device, and some said the FDA should consider approving it for use in a narrow group of patients. \u001d  \"I'm concerned about letting this device go down,\" said Eugene Blackstone, a panel member and heart surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, explaining that having data generated from the device could be useful for doctors in making treatment decisions. \u001d  While the study failed to reach its main goal it did show a trend toward a reduction in hospitalizations and other events among patients with the monitor compared to a control group of patients in which doctors weren't looking at data generated from the monitor. \u001d  Also, when patients were divided into moderately ill and severely ill groups as measured by a heart-failure class, it showed a statistically significant reduction in so-called event rates of 36% for those in heart failure Class III. However, there was an increase in event rates for the sickest patients, or those with Class IV heart failure. \u001d  Medtronic has incorporated the hemodynamic monitor into one of the company's heart defibrillators and has started conducting a clinical study of the device. \u001d  Shares of Medtronic closed at $50.15, down 21 cents, or 0.4%, on volume of 12.1 million, compared with average daily volume of 5.2 million. In recent late trading, shares were down to $49.70. \u001d  -By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9294; jennifer.corbett@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:33 ET (12:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6d06c69f499f1b261958b8bdb16fcf6f","symR":["BRLC"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Syntax-Brillian Launches Home Theater-Focused Olevia(TM) HDTV in Taiwan","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BRLC"],"IndustryCodes":["CSE","ENT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b       Debut of Olevia(TM) in Taiwan Marks First Step of Further \u001d     Expansion in the Asia-Pacific Region for Popular HDTV Brand \bTAIPEI, Taiwan--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 02, 2007-- \u001d  Syntax-Brillian Corporation (Nasdaq:BRLC), one of North America's fastest growing digital entertainment companies, announced today the launch of its popular, award-winning Olevia(TM) brand of LCD HDTVs in Taiwan at a VIP event in Taipei, Taiwan. \b \u001d  The televisions, which feature new high-end designs and innovative technology, are exclusive to the Taiwanese market and will be available only through Kolin-Denon pro-AV and custom home theater installation channels in Taiwan. \b \u001d  Beginning in March 2007, consumers in Taiwan will be able to enjoy Olevia(TM) LCD HDTVs in sizes ranging from 32\" to 65\". \b \u001d  Each HDTV features full 1080p high-definition resolution and striking piano black or pearl white lacquer finish, a feature exclusive to Olevia(TM) Taiwan HDTVs in the Olevia(TM) line.

(CHE), which operates hospices and the Roto-Rooter plumbing service, has rehabilitated its ailing stock price by easing concerns about its problems with Medicare reimbursement limits. \u001d  After an October low, Chemed shares have risen 55%, largely on better-than-expected fourth-quarter results reported last week. \u001d  Chemed's recent stock price of $46 remains far below the 52-week high of $61.91, however, a sign that Wall Street is waiting for more proof that the company is controlling Medicare billing caps, which have posed problems for other hospice operators, as well. \u001d  Chemed, based in Cincinnati, offers care to terminally ill patients through Vitas Healthcare, the nation's largest hospice-care provider, with programs in 15 states and Washington, D.C. When patients stay for longer periods and their care exceeds Medicare caps, hospices can take a hit to the bottom line as they provide services without full reimbursement. \u001d  Chemed President and Chief Executive Kevin McNamara acknowledges that the company needs to continually demonstrate that Medicare billing limitations can be managed and admits it isn't going to be easy. \u001d  \"Medicare cap will remain a component of our overall cost structure that will be difficult to predict quarter to quarter,\" McNamara said on the company's earnings conference call last week. \u001d  Chemed's struggles with Medicare reimbursement limits surfaced last July and cut the company's stock price in half by early October. The market reaction last year was based not on raw numbers but on the fear that Chemed's Medicare cap problems would become much worse before getting better, Chief Financial Officer David Williams said in an interview. \u001d  In response, Chemed exited the money-losing Phoenix market and focused on drawing new admissions from long-term acute-care facilities, which generally refer sicker patients who have shorter stays in hospices. The result was a fourth-quarter report and 2007 forecast that showed investors that the Medicare billing cap \"is a very manageable expense,\" Williams said. \u001d  Now, Wall Street wants to know if Chemed can continue that strategy in 2007. \u001d  \"We were pleased with Chemed results, but we believe an efficient market has already corrected for the earnings surprise, leading us to maintain our hold rating,\" Stifel Nicolaus analyst Eric T. Gommel said. Stifel expects to seek or receive investment-banking compensation from Chemed in the next three months. \b \b   Stock In Line With Peers \b \u001d  Chemed shares trade at about 19 times 2007 earnings estimates, according to Factset, similar to nursing-home operator Manor Care Inc. (HCR), which also provides hospice services, but slightly below the multiple of Vitas' largest for-profit pure hospice competitor, Odyssey HealthCare Inc. (ODSY), which trades at 20 times earnings estimates. \u001d  Chemed shares plunged last year when the company repeatedly lowered its 2006 earnings expectations, citing hospice billings that exceeded Medicare reimbursement limits in some markets. \u001d  In September, Chemed said Vitas Healthcare would exit the Phoenix market, where the billings had been especially high because the mix of terminally ill patients was weighted heavily to those with longer stays. Chemed said the majority of its hospice programs have a relatively short length of stay for patients, which should minimize the effect of cap problems. \u001d  Meanwhile, besides managing Medicare reimbursement caps, Vitas has focused on generating new admissions and managing labor, Stifel's Gommel said. \u001d  \"The company showed success on all three fronts, driving the better (fourth-quarter) results. Hospice results also benefited from a recovery in hospital occupancy in Vitas' core Florida markets,\" Gommel said in a note. \u001d  Vitas' revenue increased nearly 12% in the fourth quarter to $186 million and was eroded by a relatively modest $700,000 from billing limits. The caps reduced the company's net income - which totaled $17.6 million in the quarter - by only $400,000. \u001d  Chemed predicts Medicare billings will exceed limits by $10 million this year, which actually is higher than the 2006 figure but probably lower than what analysts estimated, Williams said. Vitas' continuing operations exceeded billing caps by $4 million last year. If the company hadn't left Arizona, the excess would have been close to $10 million, Williams said. \u001d  Two Vitas hospice programs are at the cap now, and the company is closely monitoring three others. CIBC World Markets analyst Michael Wiederhorn said Chemed's moves have set it up nicely. \u001d  \"Vitas remains well-positioned to deal with the cap, and could eventually benefit from the worsening situation in the industry should it lead to a shakeout,\" Wiederhorn said. CIBC indicated no recent investment-banking relationship with Chemed. \u001d  Moody's Investors Service affirmed Chemed's debt ratings this week with a stable outlook, citing a moderate leverage position, stable free cash flow and leading market positions, while acknowledging the company's acquisitive nature and reliance on Medicare reimbursement for Vitas' revenue. \u001d  Moody's noted the stability of Roto-Rooter and the likelihood of growing demand for hospice care, and said the risk from Medicare caps is mitigated by the government's support for hospice benefits. \u001d  Sales at Roto-Rooter - about one-third of Chemed's business - increased 8.2% in the fourth quarter, as that business also exceeded expectations. Chemed executives continue to dismiss the idea of a Roto-Rooter spinoff anytime soon, saying the nation's largest plumbing and drain-cleaning service is a valuable part of the company that can help Vitas to expand and Chemed to refinance its debt. \u001d   \"We're watching it,\" McNamara told analysts, \"but we haven't moved any closer to thinking that's a good idea.\" \u001d   (Dinah Wisenberg Brin covers the health-care industry for Dow Jones Newswires.) \u001d  -By Dinah Wisenberg Brin, Dow Jones Newswires; 215-656-8285; dinah.brin@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:31 ET (12:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6f067356631dfe568b9ec25e0af8af8e","symR":["2412.TW","CHT","TW0002412004"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,0.992228,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,0.9953368,-0.00099],"Headline":"Chunghwa Telecom Chmn: Will Decide On Capital Adjustment Apr","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T06:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["2412.TW","CHT","TW0002412004"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XISL","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 01:26 ET (06:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6fb54bc7aa0b600bf19072e951e041c8","symR":["CWT.UN.T","CA1312532056"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Calloway Real Estate Investment Trust: Fourth Quarter And Year End Results>CWT.DB.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CWT.UN.T","CA1312532056"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  TORONTO, March 1 /CNW/ - Calloway Real Estate Investment Trust (TSX:CWT.UN) is pleased to report its results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. \b \b \b    << \b    Highlights of the Quarter \b \b    -   Portfolio occupancy maintained at 99% level. \b    -   Committed to $57.1 million in mezzanine financing of which advanced \b        $8.0 million was funded. \b    -   Completed the acquisition of 100% freehold and leasehold interests in \b        14 retail properties in the seventh major transaction with \b        SmartCentres, comprising 1.3 million square feet of leaseable area \b        and 1.5 million square feet of future development, for \b        $383.4 million. \b    -   Internalized property management for $14.4 million. \b    -   Issued $250 million of unsecured senior debentures at 5.37% due \b        October 12, 2016. \b    -   Issued 7,680,000 trust units for $29.30 per unit for gross proceeds \b        of $225 million and net proceeds of $216 million. \b    -   Expanded existing centres by an additional 136,545 square feet of \b        leaseable area at a cost of $31.4 million. \b    >> \b \b \bAs at December 31, 2006, Calloway's portfolio consists of 18.4 million square feet of built gross leaseable area and an ownership interest in 122 properties.

The purchase price was satisfied by the assumption of existing debt of $173.4 million, the issuance of 789,444 Class B Series 2 LP Units and 34,130 Class D Series 2 LP Units for $24.1 million and the balance in cash. \b \bEffective December 31, 2006, Calloway internalized property management for the majority of its portfolio, at a cost of $14.4 million payable to SmartCentres, the previous manager. \b \bCalloway completed the issuance of $250 million of ten-year unsecured senior debentures at 5.37%, due on October 12, 2016. During the quarter, Calloway also completed the issuance of 7,680,000 trust units for $29.30 per unit for gross proceeds of $225 million. The net proceeds to Calloway, after deducting the underwriters' fee, were $216 million. The proceeds of these offerings were used by Calloway to pay down outstanding credit facilities, to finance subsequent acquisitions and development activities and for general trust purposes. \b \bDuring the quarter, with respect to currently owned centres, the Trust expanded its portfolio by 136,545 square feet of leaseable area at an investment of $31.4 million, of which 76,200 square feet at a cost of $14.5 million was internally developed by Calloway and 60,345 square feet at a cost of $16.9 million was developed under existing agreements with SmartCentres. The Trust issued 271,088 REIT units and 69,044 Class \"B\" units to Mr. Mitchell Goldhar for $5.3 million, in addition to cash, to finance these acquisitions. \b \bIn addition, the Trust committed a total of $57.1 million mezzanine financing to SmartCentres and advanced $8.0 million. The mortgage has an eight year term at a 7.25% interest rate and includes an option entitling the Trust to acquire a 50% interest in the property upon substantial completion, at an agreed upon formula. \b \bAcquisitions and expansion and development activities during the quarter contributed to a 9.6% increase in revenues of $82.3 million over the previous quarter of $75.1 million, and a 23.2% increase in revenues over the same period in 2005 of $66.7 million. A non recurring expenditure of $14.4 million relating to the acquisition and internalization of the property management business that has been expensed contributed to a net loss of $7.1 million. Net income from continuing operations before this one-time expense was $7.3 million, a decrease of $0.1 million over the third quarter because of additional interest expenses from the issuance of the unsecured debentures. \b \bAdjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\"), which is a non-GAAP measure commonly used by REITs as an estimate of cash flow, totaled $32.9 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 5.8% over third quarter 2006 and an increase of 29.3% over fourth quarter 2005. On a diluted basis, AFFO per unit of $0.39 for the quarter increased 0.8% over third quarter 2006 and 0.4% over fourth quarter 2005, remaining relatively flat due to the short term dilution from both the debt and equity issuances. AFFO for 2006 increased to $1.56 per unit from $1.44 per unit in 2005, an increase of 8.3%. The Trust distributed $1.47 per unit in 2006 compared to $1.37 per unit in 2005. This equates to a payout ratio of 94.2% in 2006 compared to 95.0% in the prior year. \b \bOccupancy rates continued their upward trend, with end of period rate of 99.3% compared with 99.0% at third quarter and 99.2% at December 31, 2005. \b \bDuring the year, Calloway's real estate assets grew from $2.4 billion in 2005 to $3.3 billion, an increase of 35.7% and equity increased from $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion, a growth of 41.1%. Rental revenues increased 52.9% from $196.7 million to 300.7 million. Net income for 2006 (which was also adversely affected by the one-time expense of $14.4 million relating to the internalization of property management) was $20.8 million, a decrease from $26.8 million in 2005. Before the one-time expense, net income was $35.2 million, representing a 31.5% growth. \b \bCalloway will hold a conference call on Monday, March 5, 2007 at 1:00 pm eastern time.

Analysts had projected full-year sales of EUR12.3 billion. \u001d  Linde's guidance for full year 2006 was to grow sales and earnings before interest and taxation, or Ebit, on comparable levels. \u001d  Linde Friday didn't disclose its Ebit figure for the full year, but said earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, for the full year more than doubled to EUR3.83 billion from EUR1.71 billion. \u001d  The German group also said it plans to pay a 2006 dividend of EUR1.50, up from EUR1.40 dividend paid for 2005. \u001d  DZ Bank analyst Norbert Barth, who will stick to his buy rating, said the results given so far are slighlty better than his expectations. \u001d  Another analyst, who asked to remain nameless, said the Linde sales figures were better than he had anticipated. \u001d   At 1015 GMT Linde shares were up EUR1.2 or 1.5% higher at EUR76.04 in a slightly lower German market. \u001d  The most important one-time effect on Linde's figures was the sale of its material forklifts unit Kion to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners for around EUR4 billion in November 2006. \u001d  Media reports put Linde's book gain for that transaction at between EUR1.2 billion and EUR2 billion. Linde has not publicly disclosed this figure. \u001d  To satisfy anti-trust demands in connection with its BOC takeover, Linde last December agreed to sell its 45 percent holding in the joint venture Japan Air Gases, Tokyo, to French competitor Air Liquide. \u001d  Before taxes, after deduction of debt and pensions, Linde said it received approximately EUR590 million. \u001d  In late November, Linde sold its U.S. bulk business to industrial gases rival Airgas Inc. (ARG) at a price of $495 million. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.linde.com \b \u001d  - By Gangolf Schrimpf, Dow Jones Newswires, + 49 69 29 725 500, gangolf.schrimpf@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 05:23 ET (10:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7233af3b666ced265156f4c4fb278ad2","symR":["IAP.LN","GB0033872168"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EBS Sets New $268B Daily Forex Volume Record March 1","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T08:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IAP.LN","GB0033872168"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","SCR","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--EBS, the foreign exchange trading platform owned by interdealer broker ICAP PLC (IAP.LN), said Friday it reached a record $268 billion daily trading volume Thursday, up from $266 billion Feb. 27. \u001d  The volume record was achieved on 135,818 deals, EBS said.

(NOC) weather satellite program that Air Force officials say is one of their biggest ongoing concerns. \u001d  Many Defense Department space systems have struggled with major cost overruns and delays in recent years. After a series of restructurings, the Air Force is comfortable with the new path laid out for missile warning, communications and navigation satellites, Air Force Under Secretary Ronald Sega said recently. \u001d  But the jury is still out on the weather system, known as NPOESS, or the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System. The Defense Department's most recent report on weapons costs lists a price tag of nearly $14 billion, but the Air Force said Thursday that the program's updated cost estimate is around $11.5 billion. \u001d  Sega said the Air Force has \"worked its way through\" most of the other programs, except for NPOESS. \u001d  \"I would reserve judgments on where exactly we are. I'm watching it hard,\" Sega said of the weather satellites, in an interview on the sidelines of a mid-February Aviation Week defense conference. \u001d  NPOESS is in the midst of a major restructuring prompted by its cost growth, which was big enough to trigger congressional review. First launch is not now expected until 2012, although a test project could launch by fiscal year 2009. \u001d  Lawmakers have railed against the prospect of further delays. Existing U.S. weather satellites are near the end of their projected lifespan. This means that if anything goes wrong, the U.S. could be without essential weather data for years until NPOESS is ready. \u001d  Program managers held a big meeting last week to study a particularly difficult Raytheon Co. (RTN) sensor, which will provide about 60% of the climate data collected by the new system. At that meeting, managers closed out most of the major design issues identified with the sensor, program officials said. \u001d  The one remaining major issue on that sensor involves \"crosstalk\" that interferes with optical sensor equipment. It's still an area of concern, although efforts are underway to resolve it. \u001d  Sega said the sensor prognosis should be clearer by the end of March. \u001d  Senior officials will keep close tabs on the program in the meantime, however, such as Friday's scheduled meeting of the NPOESS executive committee. NPOESS is a joint effort of the Pentagon, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; rebecca.christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:34 ET (12:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"73058932dfb00f4641ccf6c5a7075e0e","symR":["RIV"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Riviera Reports Record Results for -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RIV"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b        Rooms                            6,498    6,323    27,185      27,133 \b        Food and beverage                5,515    5,657    24,224      24,645 \b        Entertainment                    1,675    2,724     9,536      13,214 \b        Other                              300      639     1,437       2,906 \b      Other operating expenses \b        General and administrative       9,351    9,233    39,485      38,211 \b        Mergers, acquisitions and \b         development costs, net            159      311     1,318         (65) \b        Sarbanes-Oxley Act expenses        262      591       820       1,233 \b        Equity-based compensation          224      421       813       1,627 \b        Asset impairment                     3      579        19         777 \b         Depreciation and amortization   3,237    3,570    12,691      14,065 \b           Total costs and expenses     41,725   43,464   175,528     179,838 \b    INCOME FROM OPERATIONS               4,744    2,705    25,416      22,389 \b      Interest expense, net             (6,345)  (6,566)  (25,751)    (26,388) \b    NET LOSS                           $(1,601) $(3,861)    $(335)    $(3,999) \b    Shares Outstanding \b    Basic                               12,170   11,914    12,134      11,833 \b    Diluted                             12,170   11,914    12,134      11,833 \b    Net loss per common share \b    Basic                               $(0.13)  $(0.32)   $(0.03)     $(0.34) \b    Diluted                             $(0.13)  $(0.32)   $(0.03)     $(0.34) \b \b \b \bSOURCE  Riviera Holdings Corporation \b \u001d    /CONTACT: Mark Lefever, Treasurer and CFO of Riviera Holdings Corporation, +1-702-794-9527, or fax, +1-702-794-9442, mlefever@theriviera.com; or Investor Relations, Betsy Truax of Skorpus Consulting, +1-208-241-3704, or fax, +1-208-232-5317, betsytruax_hartman@msn.com, for Riviera Holdings Corporation \b    /Web site: http://www.rivierahotel.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"7372e67fbc70abc2e0c8cba2e12a64e7","symR":["GE","US3696041033"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9908231,-0.00099],"ret5":[0.9776312,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(3/2) EPA Seeks Sharp Cut In Diesel Pollution","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T05:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GE","US3696041033"],"IndustryCodes":["IDD","MAR","RAI","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By John J. Fialka and Kathryn Kranhold \u001d  WASHINGTON -- Continuing a seven-year crackdown on diesel-engine pollution, the Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to all but eliminate the soot and smog-related emissions of locomotive engines and similar diesel engines used in ships. \u001d  EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson is expected to announce the proposal today in Newark, N.J., an industrial area plagued by the kind of pollution problems the new rules are intended to minimize. \u001d  \"EPA is on track to make that black puff of diesel smoke go the way of the steam engine,\" said Mr. Johnson, who estimated the health benefits will be 20 times the estimated $2 billion to $4 billion cost of implementing the reductions. \u001d  But General Electric Co., the nation's largest locomotive maker -- and currently involved in an advertising campaign touting the ecological benefits of its new locomotives and some of its other products -- has told EPA officials in private meetings that the new rule is \"unlikely to be achieved\" even with some scientific breakthroughs. \u001d  Patrick Jarvis, a spokesman for GE's transportation business, declined to comment on the EPA's plan, saying GE didn't know what was in it. He said GE would review the ruling and offer its comment to the EPA. \"We'll be focused on a balanced approach that achieves aggressive\" emissions reduction and fuel-reduction savings, Mr. Jarvis said. \u001d  The rule would require that nitrogen-oxide emissions from the most modern locomotives, such as General Electric's Evolution model, be reduced more than 75%. \u001d  Another locomotive maker along with diesel-engine makers and catalyst manufacturers have told the EPA they believe they can meet the new specifications, which will require the installation of special catalytic converters, similar to those used on big diesel-powered trucks, to remove nitrogen oxides that cause smog. \u001d  The proposal, which Mr. Johnson said he hopes will take effect by the end of this year, will require most existing locomotives to meet new engine emissions standards when they are overhauled, beginning next year. A second phase of the rule, starting in 2009, will apply new standards to newly manufactured engines. \u001d  Starting in 2014, the rule will require owners of diesel-powered ships that cause pollution in U.S. ports to install the smog-reducing catalytic converters. \u001d  The proposal is the last step in a campaign by EPA to sharply reduce diesel-related pollution. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:00 ET (05:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"73a4befa529c8ad0f6eb569e5af06253","symR":["BPP.LN","CART.LN","GB0000698414","GB00B05K7697","BPP.LN","CART.LN","GB0000698414","GB00B05K7697"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Carter & Carter: Gets Schroder Undertaking","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T08:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BPP.LN","CART.LN","GB0000698414","GB00B05K7697"],"IndustryCodes":["EAG","SVC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:11 ET (08:11 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"73acf93b791c4cb4b06ac00f6d2f9ca9","symR":["NCS"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9777553],"ret5":[0.9464105],"Headline":"NCI Building Systems Upped To Neutral From Reduce At UBS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T05:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NCS"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:30 ET (05:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"73f3ee798548d52532aa916a6d49c13a","symR":["38380.AE","NL0000383800"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Smit Rotterdam Tug Crew Strike Suspended - Union -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T10:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["38380.AE","NL0000383800"],"IndustryCodes":["MAR"],"Story":"\u001d  The union said that if Smit doesn't neet its demands next week, the crews will resume the strike. \u001d  Smit wasn't immediately available for comment. \u001d  On an average day, 85 ships enter and leave the port of Rotterdam, the largest in Europe. \u001d  Smit has a market share of around 70% in the harbor.

Ahmed, Chief Executive of Pakistani industrial conglomerate Associated Group. \u001d  Associated Group, 80% owned by Ahmed's family, is already a large supplier of liquid petroleum gas in Pakistan and looks likely to be the first to deliver a new LNG terminal. It is close to finalizing an agreement with U.S.-based LNG trading and shipping company Excelerate Energy for the construction of a terminal at Port Qasim, near Karachi. \u001d  \"There is lots of demand for natural gas and new sources are very difficult to come by. Pipelines from Iran, Qatar or Turkmenistan are five to seven years away. The government needs solutions tomorrow morning,\" said Ahmed in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires Thursday. \u001d  According to information on the web site of Sui Southern Gas Co. Ltd (SSGC.KA), one of Pakistan's largest gas transmission and distribution companies, gas demand is expected to rise by 130% from 27.1 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2005 to 62.5 mboe by 2020. Pakistan's indigenous gas production covered this demand in 2005, but by 2020 is projected to be 20.7 mboe, just a third of expected demand by that date. \u001d  The $100 million terminal, which aims to import 3.2 million tons of LNG per year, will not break ground until March. But Ahmed and Excelerate Chief Executive Kathleen Eisbrenner are confident it will be operational no later than April 2008. \u001d  Excelerate achieved a similar timeframe for its LNG import terminal in Teesside in the northeast of England. The Teesside terminal, which was commissioned last week, went from site selection to operation in a little over a year. \u001d  \"We want to duplicate what Excelerate has done at Teesside,\" Ahmed said. \"Our objective is to try and get the project here on the fast track because there are problems with gas availability and power generation in Pakistan.\" \u001d  Pakistan has another LNG project in the works, led by Sui Southern Gas Co. Ltd (SSGC.KA), the country's gas transmission and distribution company. \u001d  SSGC has invited bids from companies including units of Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA), BP PLC (BP) and AES Corp. (AES) to help it build and run the $400 million Mashal LNG terminal, also near Karachi. The contract for Mashal should be awarded in the second half of this year and is planned to start operations in 2011. \u001d  The Associated Group terminal can be built faster and at lower cost because the systems required to convert the liquid gas stored at minus 126 degrees Celsius to high pressure gas at a temperature of around 40C are carried on board Excelerate's ship. There is no need for costly LNG storage tanks and regassification equipment to be built onshore. \u001d  Excelerate said its regassification ships are more expensive than standard LNG tankers, costing around $35 million more to build. \u001d  The Port Qasim terminal's jetty will be located in swampland close to the main shipping channel into the port. The jetty will be designed to permanently accommodate one of Excelerate's three regassification tankers, possibly the Excelsior. Standard LNG tankers will moor alongside and discharge their cargo into the Excelerate vessel, which will deliver gas into Pakistan's national network at a peak rate of 400 million cubic feet per day. \u001d  The project will also have a facility to extract liquid petroleum gas - a more valuable product with more than twice the energy content - from the LNG and sell it in Pakistan. \u001d  Excelerate will take 25% of the equity in the project, Ahmed said, and Associated Group, along with other unnamed partners, will take the rest. \u001d  U.S. company Mustang Engineering will oversee construction of the project. \u001d  Although Associated Group aims to supply Pakistan's power generation sector, Ahmed said the cost of LNG cannot compete with existing supplies of pipeline gas. It will however be 20% to 30% cheaper than residual fuel oil for power generation. \"We want to target a niche market,\" Ahmed said. \u001d  Associated Group does not have long-term contracts in place for supply of LNG cargoes, Ahmed said. \"Once we have the facility in place, gradually we will enter into long-term contracts,\" he said. \u001d  Ahmed said they will find the cargoes they need on the spot market, which he expects to grow from 5% to 15% of all LNG traded globally within the next few years. He said Excelerate, which has bought 26 spot cargoes in the last 20 months, will help Associated Group fill its capacity. \u001d  This may not be a simple task. Many industry observers expect the spot market for LNG cargoes in the Asia-Pacific region to be particularly tight in the next few years, as demand outstrips the available capacity for liquefying gas. Some terminals without long-term contracts to guarantee their supply are expected to struggle to fill their specified capacity. \u001d  Neither does Associated Group have contracts for the purchase of its gas from utilities within Pakistan. \"We are deliberately going slow and want to tie up loose ends before signing contracts,\" Ahmed said. The company has letters of intent from SSGC and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd., together with other interested parties, he said. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.agroup.com.pk \u001d  -By James Herron, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9317; james.herron@dowjones.com (Oliver Klaus in Dubai contributed to this story). \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:16 ET (11:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"75579631f4b9e1ca9d44c6f040ab9460","symR":["XMSR"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": The XM Customer Promise: XM Reaffirms Customer Commitment During Merger Approval Process","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["XMSR"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XNQ1","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  WASHINGTON, March 2 /PRNewswire/ -- XM Satellite Radio, which recently joined Sirius in announcing plans to merge to form the nation's premier audio entertainment service, today put a stake in the ground to remain focused on existing consumers and prospective subscribers by announcing the XM Customer Promise.

Regent's management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors, as discussed in more detail below, regarding Regent's financial condition and results of operations and liquidity; however, these measures should not be considered as an alternative to net broadcast revenue, operating loss, net loss, or cash provided by operating activities as an indicator of Regent's performance or liquidity. \b \b    Station operating income \b \u001d  Fourth quarter 2006 station operating income increased 52.1% to $9.7 million from $6.4 million in the same period in 2005.

Same station operating income increased 7.1% to $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.  The Company believes that a same station presentation is important to investors as it provides a measure of performance of radio stations that were owned and operated by Regent in the fourth quarter of 2005 as well as the current quarter and eliminates the effect of acquisitions and dispositions on comparability. Additionally, the Company has excluded barter in this comparison as barter customarily results in volatility between quarters, although differences over the full year are not material.

(NASDAQ:SUMT), the largest provider of talent and learning solutions (http://www.sumtotalsystems.com/lp/pr/Talent-Management-Solutions. html), announced that researchers at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System have purchased ResultsOnDemand(TM) to underpin a study designed to evaluate the best way to deliver learning to hundreds of substance abuse counselors. ResultsOnDemand (http://www.sumtotalsystems.com/products/results.html) is SumTotal's subscription model for analyzing employee performance (http://www.sumtotalsystems.com/lp/pr/epm.html) and delivering learning over the Internet. (Due to its length, the first URL in this paragraph may need to be copied/pasted into your Internet browser's address field. Remove the extra space if one exists.) \b \u001d  SumTotal's software will give the Palo Alto, Calif.-based researchers the framework and technology to control how counselors in the study learn about new treatment approaches. Their study, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), evaluates how best to use technology-based training to help practicing substance abuse counselors learn about cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is an evidence-based treatment that is known to be effective, but is not currently in widespread use in the community. \b \u001d  \"We're not trying to prove -- with our study -- that online training has merits over classroom training,\" said Steven W. Villafranca, research health science specialist at the Palo Alto Health Care System and Stanford University School of Medicine. \"We already know that online training can be as effective as face-to-face workshops. Instead, we want to know what is the best possible way to deliver online training to counselors so that they achieve the most beneficial outcomes for their clients. For example: do counselors learn and retain more when they have the ability to select the training content that they feel is most relevant to their clinical practice, or do they learn best by following a traditional step-by-step process of instruction?\" \b \u001d  The Palo Alto research team will use the SumTotal platform to launch two different versions of an online CBT course. The researchers will monitor two groups as they progress through the experiment. One set of participants will have the freedom to choose the online instruction they want, in the order they want. The other group will follow a rigidly prescribed order of online learning. Technology from WebEx, which integrates with SumTotal's platform, will allow the research team to provide all participants with supervision in small groups. At the end of the study, the researchers will rely on SumTotal's software to analyze not only what counselors learned but also how they learned. \b \u001d  \"The SumTotal system will show us important ways to combine learning technologies to achieve the best outcomes for counselors and their clients,\" said Kenneth R. Weingardt, associate director of the Palo Alto Health Care System's Program Evaluation and Resource Center and the study's Principal Investigator. \"This may be the first time a learning management system has been used to empirically compare different pedagogical approaches.\" \b \u001d  \"We liked the price of ResultsOnDemand,\" added Villafranca. \"We wanted a top-rated solution in place quickly for several hundred users, and it was important to have integration with WebEx. So we chose SumTotal.\" \b \b   About SumTotal Systems, Inc. \b \u001d  SumTotal Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:SUMT) is the largest provider of talent and learning solutions.

Specifically, Realogy announced two significant marketing agreements to have more than 500,000 affiliate real estate listings appear on both Google(TM), the world's largest search engine site, and Trulia a leading real estate vertical search engine. All property listings that currently reside on the CENTURY 21(R), Coldwell Banker(R), and ERA(R) brand Web sites will be uploaded to the Google(TM) and Trulia.com search engines making it easier than ever for buyers to find the home of their dreams, while providing sellers with outstanding marketing exposure. Realogy's strategic move represents one of the largest distribution of property listings to major online search engines at one time. \b \u001d  \"Our brand Web sites are some of the most highly trafficked and comprehensive sites in real estate today,\" said Richard A. Smith, vice chairman and president of Realogy Corporation. \"Our announced distributed listing strategy follows an intense study of the advantages of the broad distribution of our listing inventory. This serves as a milestone in our strategy to maximize the advantages of the Web for the benefit of our franchisees, our operating company and our customers.\" \b \u001d  The listings distribution strategy will significantly broaden exposure for Realogy brand listings as well as those featured by Company-owned brokerages operated by Realogy's subsidiary, NRT Incorporated. The listings distribution initiative aligns effective marketing strategy with online consumer behavior. More than 58 percent of all Internet searches on \"real estate\" and related terms are conducted on Google(TM) and its search partner sites*, while over 375 million unique global users conduct searches on Google.com each month**. \b \u001d  \"For the buyer, viewing listings online is just part of the equation,\" said Alex Perriello, president and chief executive officer of the Realogy Franchise Group. \"From the Google and Trulia Web sites, consumers will be linked to the brand sites where they can learn more about individual properties, communities and the home buying process. Home sellers will naturally benefit from the additional marketing exposure for their properties.\" \b \u001d  The increased traffic is also expected to benefit Realogy's broker and sales associate networks of 320,000 members who stand ready to assist consumers in their local searches. As more listing distribution channels are adopted, lead traffic to Realogy's broker networks is expected to increase as well. As an example, in a pilot study with Trulia in 2006, 15 percent of ERA.com's search engine traffic originated from the Trulia.com site. Currently, Realogy's brand Web sites receive over one million visitors a week. \b \u001d  Launched in 2005, Trulia offers consumers a highly intuitive user interface that simplifies searches and leads to click-throughs to the complete property information on broker and agent sites. Trulia.com is one of the fastest growing sites in the real estate category, reporting 25 percent month-over-month growth over the last six months. The Trulia site refers over two million buyer visits to external listing sites each month and seventy percent of Trulia users surveyed indicated that they were looking to buy a home in the next 12 months. \b \u001d  Realogy will continue to expand its listings distribution strategy by seeking out appropriate alliances and Internet channels to promote properties that appeal to particular lifestyles and niche markets. The first of these agreements includes LandandFarm.com, which caters to buyers and sellers of country properties including farms, ranches and hunting retreats. Select Realogy brand listings will post to this site when they meet the specific criteria of the market segment and audience demographic. \b \u001d  \"The Internet empowers consumers to get information from a vast array of sources that appeal to their particular needs and interests,\" said Perriello. \"Our strategy meets consumer needs head on, while offering a level of unparalleled service in marketing homes for our affiliates' clientele.\" \b \b   * Source: comScore, November 2006 \b \b   ** Source: comScore, December 2006 \b \b   About Realogy \b \u001d  Realogy Corporation (NYSE: H), the world's largest real estate franchisor, has a diversified business model that also includes real estate brokerage, relocation and title services.

Adopting SAP solutions based on the SAP NetWeaver(R) platform is part of Stonebridge's enterprise-wide initiative to automate all of its business processes, including financial and human capital administration, compliance reporting and real estate management. \b \b    (Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20050310/SFTH009LOGO-a) \b \u001d  Stonebridge Companies develops and manages hotel properties across the western United States. It holds franchise licenses with Hilton Hotels, Marriott International, InterContinental Hotels Group, Starwood Hotel and Resorts, Carlson Hotels and Choice Hotels International. Before selecting SAP solutions, Stonebridge managed its business processes on paper, which was time consuming and error prone. With representatives from more than 40 properties sending in reports, invoices and other documents, employees were burdened by paperwork that needed to be physically compiled and delivered, entered manually into computer programs and stored in filing cabinets. Stonebridge Companies' decision to implement a state-of-the-art enterprise resource planning (ERP) system will enable the company to move all of its business processes and data online, and become a modern, paperless environment. \b \u001d  \"We turned to SAP over other vendors because they gave us a clear, simple path to digitize our business and place information in the hands of employees across the company,\" said Navin Dimond, president and CEO, Stonebridge Companies. \"SAP gives us a dependable, trusted IT infrastructure and innovative solutions that fit our industry's requirements -- and help us better align IT and business objectives. In the hospitality industry, fiscal oversight and accountability to our investors is critical, which means we must be able to accurately predict how well our properties will perform. SAP will enable us to improve our service to shareholders, consumers and business partners.\" \b \u001d  The company also plans to deploy Duet software, a solution that allows people to interact with SAP business processes and data through Microsoft Office applications. Because Duet only requires end users' familiarity with Microsoft Office, the solution will be simple for employees to use and reduce training costs for the organization. With the simplicity in Duet, all employees -- regardless of their technical skills -- can easily access critical business information and activities. Duet will help move Stonebridge into the digital age by leveraging a user-friendly environment that is familiar to anyone who uses Office regularly. \b \u001d  A leader in the highly competitive hotel industry, Stonebridge expects to double in size over the next several years, and SAP will provide the IT backbone for the organization as it expands. A key factor in Stonebridge's selection process was the SAP ecosystem, which provides both vertical expertise and support for sustaining rapid growth of its mid-market customers. In partnership with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a leading provider of IT services for the travel and hospitality industry, SAP can address industry-specific challenges for Stonebridge while offering the company a solid foundation for future growth. TCS will customize the SAP solutions for the hospitality industry and establish a system to measure key performance indicators such as cost by room, revenue per room and revenue forecasting. \b \u001d  \"SAP ERP 2005 combined with Duet gives Stonebridge the user productivity required to ensure real business results,\" said Bill McDermott, president and CEO, SAP Americas. \"Our ecosystem approach combined with innovative technology will enable Stonebridge to better serve its clients and to enhance its return on investment.\" \b \u001d  \"We believe technology has a strong role to play in helping travel and hospitality companies increase efficiency, manage risk and build new business models,\" said Srini Krishnaswamy, practice head, Tata Consultancy Services. \"Stonebridge Companies is a true visionary in the hospitality industry. Together with SAP, Tata Consultancy Services can offer growing companies like Stonebridge the domain expertise to stay ahead of the competition.\" \b \b    About SAP \b \u001d  SAP is the world's leading provider of business software*. Today, more than 38,000 customers in more than 120 countries run SAP(R) applications -- from distinct solutions addressing the needs of small businesses and midsize companies to suite offerings for global organizations.

For example, energy prices have been volatile in recent years which has adversely impacted PRT's operating margins and may continue to do so. The Company typically prices its products under annual sales contracts, and is generally not able to revise its sales prices in the short term to offset commodity price volatility. To reduce this risk, PRT purchases energy from a variety of regulated and non-regulated sources, which diversifies the timing and effect of short-term changes in commodity prices. The Company also enters into forward purchase contracts for future energy requirements where management considers it advantageous to do so. \b \bForeign Exchange \b \bThe Fund enters into seedling growing contracts in both Canadian and US dollars. Exchange rates have been, and may continue to be, volatile and, as stated above, the Company typically prices its products under annual sales contracts, and is generally not able to revise its sales prices in the short term to offset exchange rate volatility. To reduce this risk, PRT has established a US based production facility, and is financing the purchase of that facility with US dollar denominated debt, in order to provide some offsetting exchange rate exposure against the US dollar revenue stream. PRT may also enter into forward currency exchange contracts to further hedge exposure on net US dollar cash flows. \b \bIndustry Risk \b \bThe business of PRT is highly dependent on the forest industry in Canada. While the Company is not materially dependent on any one customer, regional markets may be impacted by changes in global markets and government regulations and by more consolidated buying decisions by larger customers. PRT has taken steps to diversify its operations across a wider variety of customers and Provincial/State jurisdictions, in order to reduce such short term impacts. \b \bInterest Rates \b \bThe Company intends to use term debt financing to fund earnings-enhancing capital expenditures in the current low interest rate environment. Interest rate risk is managed by fixing term debt rates for varying terms using interest rate swaps. Working capital loans are short term in nature and represent a relatively small portion of the cost of total borrowings. Accordingly, PRT does not hedge interest rate risk on this debt. \b \bEnvironmental \b \bThe production of forest seedlings has limited impact on the environment. Seedlings are grown in controlled greenhouses or in defined open compounds. To manage any potential environmental risks, PRT has established an Environmental Management System (EMS). The EMS consists of an environmental policy, codes of conduct, periodic site audits, employee training and awareness, environmental monitoring, emergency prevention and response procedures, and periodic reporting. \b \bIncome Trust Taxation \b \bOn October 31, 2006 the Canadian Federal Government announced proposed plans to apply a tax on publicly traded income trusts, such as the Fund. For existing income trusts, the government is proposing a four-year transition period, until the 2011 taxation year, before the tax would be applicable. The proposals also outline certain provisions to limit the \"undue expansion\" of income trusts during the transition period, If the Fund were to exceed these limits the consequence would be a loss of the grandfathered tax status during the transition period. \b \bAt the time that the tax is applied, the Fund will be subject to entity level taxation which will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution and may result in lower distributions being made to unitholders. The proposed rate of taxation is 31.5% on certain receipts by the trust. Distributions by the trust that are made from such taxed receipts would be treated as eligible Canadian dividend income by unitholders who are Canadian individual taxpayers, Assuming such unitholders are subject to the highest marginal rate of federal and provincial income tax, they would receive an after-tax return from their now reduced distribution of income approximately equal to the after-tax return if pre-tax income of the income trust had been distributed directly to the investor and taxed in the hand of the investor. However, reduced distributions will be an absolute cost to other types of investors including pension funds, Registered Retirement Savings Plans and non-residents who would not benefit from characterization of the distribution as dividends. \b \bNo assurance can be given that the Fund will be able to maintain its current grandfathered status until January 1, 2011, or that the proposals will be enacted substantially as outlined. \b \bDisclosure Controls and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting \b \bThe Fund has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that any material information is properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported to the Board of Trustees and the Audit Committee. PRT's chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO) have evaluated and are satisfied with the effectiveness, at the reasonable assurance level, of these disclosure controls and procedures for the period ending December 31, 2006. \b \bThe Fund has established internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), and the CEO and CFO confirm that there were no changes in these controls that occurred during the interim period ended December 31, 2006 which materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's ICFR. \b \bOutlook \b \bThe market outlook for 2007 is somewhat weaker as a result of a temporary slowdown in the demand for seedlings. This is due to three main factors: \b \b1. A temporary and unexpected decline in BC market seedling demand. Recent legislative changes to forest tenure policies have resulted in changes in tenure for up to 20% of the provincial crown forest lands, and management believes this may have caused a delay in reforestation activity on some of the affected wood lots. \b \b2. In addition, some customers may be electing to defer silviculture spending as a response to the slowdown in lumber exports due to a commensurate slowdown in the US housing market. \b \b3. A reduction of order volumes due to price increases for 2007 contracts, that were implemented to partially offset increased energy and other production costs. \b \bNew seedling volumes are expected to total approximately 205 million trees, representing approximately 2.2 million seedling blocks of production. This is 13% below the block volume in 2006. However, we expect somewhat higher average block revenues, due to the effect of seedling price increases and changes in product mix. This is expected to partially offset the impact of reduced volumes. \b \bSilviculture spending deferrals from the factors mentioned are likely to be temporary, and management expects demand to return to historical levels in subsequent years. This view is supported by the growing reforestation backlog created by mountain pine beetle devastation in BC. \b \bProduction margins are expected to remain stable, with the impact of lower volumes largely offset by the anticipated benefits of lower energy costs, higher selling prices, and planned efficiency improvements. Selling general and administrative expenses are expected to be slightly higher, due to increased regulatory compliance, systems development, and R&D costs. Interest costs in 2007 should be similar to 2006, as the current year capital program is expected to be modest, excluding any potential impact from new acquisitions. \b \bIn February 2007, we announced our intention to close our Nevada nursery, to improve crop reliability and economies of scale. Since establishing this nursery, we have developed the expertise to grow similar crops outdoors at other PRT locations, with less risk. This closure is not expected to have a significant impact on 2007 earnings. \b \bWith lower volumes, operating earnings will come under some pressure, but distributable cash is expected to remain above PRT's base distribution level, and therefore distributions are expected to remain stable. \b \bIn the mid-term, the underlying fundamentals for the forest seedling industry remain sound, but will vary regionally. In BC, forest damage from the mountain pine beetle and past forest fires, as well as silviculture spending deferrals, have creating a growing backlog in reforestation which will support future demand. On the other hand, the Ontario forest industry continues to restructure in the face of significant economic challenges. On a national level, the long-term demand for seedlings has remained remarkably stable. To take advantage of this, PRT has positioned itself as a market leader in a number of key markets to help reduce the impact of regional market fluctuations, and our past marketing results have benefited from this diversity. We expect this will continue to be the case in the future. \b \bOur current group of 15 nursery locations gives us the scope and capabilities to service a forest industry that is characterized by ever more consolidation. We continue to execute on our strategy to gradually become less energy dependent, and to adopt new growing technologies that can lead to more cost-effective seedling production. \b \bWe remain optimistic about our long-term prospects, including our opportunity to achieve further cash flow improvements from past acquisitions, and to further consolidate our fragmented seedling industry. We also continue to see opportunities to take our expertise to new market areas, where we can create value for our customers and unitholders alike. \b \bOn behalf of the Trustees and Management \b \b \bColin A.C.

Very high volume and very low volatility can exist simultaneously since a large number of trades doesn't preclude a slow, steady rise or fall in prices. Extremely active stock trading relative to the size of an economy can mean a number of things - the entry of new participants, an abundance of liquidity or perhaps just a \"fast-money\" ethos. \u001d  \"Any spike in turnover tells you there's a surge in traders versus investors,\" said Alan Newman, editor of stock market newsletter Crosscurrents. \"That means the market has entered a very speculative phase and value is not a factor.\" \u001d  Newman points to prior periods of very high turnover, with ominous peaks in 1929 and 2000, two of the most painful years in stock market history. Turnover on the three major U.S. stock exchanges last year was $35.4 trillion, equal to about 206% of market capitalization and just shy of the all-time record of 220% set in 1929, the year of the crash. As a percentage of gross domestic product, stock turnover was 263%, short of the record 328% seen in 2000 during the height of the tech boom but well above the average of about 40% seen from 1930-1995, said Newman. \u001d  The typical historical pattern of investment manias throughout the centuries has involved a lot of new players, such as day traders circa 1999 or Florida condo flippers circa 2005 who represent the dumb money needed to produce the spectacular gains that precede the popping of any bubble. The situation now is somewhat different and more complex, though. The arrival of new players who are more likely to ignore valuations in a bull market and more prone to cut and run in a downturn would normally increase volatility, not decrease it, while just the opposite had been the case until Tuesday. What's more, much of the cash washing through the market is institutional rather than retail, in large part from hedge funds that often seek market neutral strategies. \u001d  Dawn Bennett, president of adivsory firm Bennett Financial Group, says that even mutual funds have changed their trading strategies in the past five years, with most institutional investors looking to earn many small gains through nimble trading rather than hitting home runs. The increased use of stop orders as well as computerized algorithms for order flow might be suppressing short-term volatility. The strategy of going for lots of singles rather than home runs has been successful in the past five years or so, according to Bennett. \u001d  \"The ones that don't have turnover are the ones who are lagging,\" she said. \u001d  Bennett contrasts \"smart money\" with \"fast money.\" Both may be outperforming a buy and hold strategy at the moment, but those taking concentrated short-term directional bets rather than employing risk management are courting disaster. \u001d  \"Whenever you invest like that, you're going to get your clock cleaned eventually,\" she said. \u001d  The reasons for turnover being so high may be to some extent structural - much lower transaction costs and the popularity of index funds that need to constantly rebalanced, for example - but Newman said these explain only a small part of the increase in trading. \u001d  In fact, effective turnover may be far higher than what Newman's statistics show. A survey by Bank of America of fund managers showed that 60% had used computer algorithms in 2006 to access so-called \"dark pools\" of liquidity, a way to conduct private, off-exchange transactions. Only 32.5% had reported doing so the previous year. The boom in exchange traded funds, which have grown at a compound annual rate of 43% over the past six years, certainly has played a role in boosting exchange volume. Just the two most popular funds, the NASDAQ 100 Trust (QQQQ) and the Standard & Poor's Depository Receipts (SPY) had turnover of $3.7 trillion in 2006, or over 10% of all stock market volume. \u001d  With all of these technological and economic changes, is it relevant to compare turnover figures from 2007 with those from the ticker tape machine era? If risk management rather than speculation is the main driver of the increase in trading, then is high turnover a valid risk indicator? \u001d  Newman's contention that high turnover is a sign of a frothy market appears convincing even in 2007, but the reasons may be different. Even if much of the turnover is coming from supposedly risk-neutral hedge funds, trading stocks remains a zero-sum game. A rapidly increasing number of players can't earn decent returns while simultaneously passing off their risk, since returns are finite. The big increase in trading appears to be playing a role in suppressing volatility, encouraging greater risk-taking and setting the market up for more nasty shocks like Tuesday. \u001d  In other words, much of today's \"smart money\" may really be good, old-fashioned \"fast money\" without realizing it. \b \u001d  (Spencer Jakab, a columnist who provides insightful and unique takes on the stock market, previously wrote about the energy market.) \b \u001d  -By Spencer Jakab, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2429; spencer.jakab@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7dfb728f3265cb8526eb0bbc5044213a","symR":["HHGP"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Hudson Highland Group To Change Timing Of Previously Disclosed Charges In 2006 Form 10-K>HHGP","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T13:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HHGP"],"IndustryCodes":["EAG","SVC","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 08:01 ET (13:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7eca913f4552181f58296c4bb5426718","symR":["METH"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Methode Electronics Latest 3Q EPS Cut 5c By Charge >METH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["METH"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:02 ET (11:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7fbe84758c9a6e6e8a8c39d75759049c","symR":["ERIC","ERIC-B.SK","SE0000108656","ERIC","ERIC-B.SK","SE0000108656"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9902074,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9902074,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.00432,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.00432,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Ericsson Chosen As Solution Provider For Greek Digital City","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T10:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ERIC","ERIC-B.SK","SE0000108656"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XST5","XSTX","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 05:01 ET (10:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7fd9442babf49a801a24af950b313833","symR":["TXU","US8731681081"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"TXU Files To Delay 10K, Cites Recent Buyout >TXU","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TXU","US8731681081"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  TXU Corp.

As a result of this decision, we will narrow our focus in operations and achieve greater efficiencies in the long term by transferring these lines to our high volume manufacturing facility in Shenzhen, China, and our advanced manufacturing facility in Fort Collins, Colorado.\" \b \u001d  Mr. Betz continued, \"This is a difficult decision for the Company, given our talented workforce in Stolberg.  The transition will impact approximately 65 employees over the course of the next several months.  The Stolberg team has been a dedicated group of employees, committed to meeting our critical objectives, and we thank them for their hard work.\" \b \u001d  Advanced Energy acquired the Stolberg location through the acquisition of Dressler HF Technik GmbH in March 2002.  Since that time, the location has continued design, manufacturing and support for the Dressler(R) RF power product line, including the Cesar(R) power generator, which is sold primarily to semiconductor capital equipment and solar cell manufacturing customers. Other Dressler RF products manufactured in Stolberg include the VarioMatch(TM) matching network, the HPG(TM) high power generator, and the LPPA linear amplifier.  The site currently contributes approximately 5% of the Company's total annual revenue. \b \u001d  The Company will file an amended report on Form 8-K under Item 2.05 within four business days after it makes a determination of the anticipated restructuring charges related to the Stolberg facility closure. \b \b    About Advanced Energy \b \u001d  Advanced Energy is a global leader in the development and support of technologies critical to high-technology, high-growth manufacturing processes used in the production of semiconductors, flat panel displays, data storage products, solar cells, architectural glass, and other advanced product applications. \b \u001d  Leveraging a diverse product portfolio and technology leadership, Advanced Energy creates solutions that maximize process impact, improve productivity and lower the cost of ownership for its customers.

(NYSE: MYL) announced today the pricing of its concurrent public offerings for a total gross proceeds of $993.6 million (or $1.1 billion assuming the full exercise of underwriters' over-allotments).  The offerings consist of $550 million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due 2012 and \b22.75 million shares of common stock.   Mylan has granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of notes and up to an additional 3,412,500 shares of common stock, in each case, to cover over-allotments.  The shareholders initially anticipated to sell shares of Mylan common stock in the offering have elected not to participate at this time. \b \u001d  The notes are being offered to the public at par and will accrue interest at 1.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears.  The notes will be convertible by holders at an initial conversion rate of 44.5931 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances), which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $22.43 per share.  The shares of common stock were priced at $19.50 per share. \b \u001d  These offerings are being conducted as separate public offerings by means of separate prospectus supplements and are not contingent on each other. Mylan expects to close the transactions on March 7, 2007. \b \u001d  Mylan intends to use the net proceeds of the offerings for general corporate purposes, including the expansion of its global operations.  Mylan is continually evaluating, and may pursue, various acquisitions, licensing and other strategic opportunities, including those that may be material to its results of operations and financial position. To reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the notes, Mylan also intends to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offerings, including the over-allotments if exercised, to enter into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with counterparties which will be affiliates of the underwriters. As part of their hedging activity, these counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Mylan's common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes, and expect to enter into and unwind derivative transactions and purchase and sell shares of Mylan's common stock after this period. \b \u001d  The joint book-running managers for the convertible notes and common stock offerings are Merrill Lynch & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. Co-managers for the common stock offering include Citigroup, ABN AMRO Rothschild LLC, BNY Capital Markets, Inc., HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, NatCity Investments, Inc., PNC Capital Markets LLC, and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  Co-managers for the notes offering include Citigroup, ABN AMRO Rothschild LLC, BNY Capital Markets, Inc., HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, NatCity Investments, Inc., PNC Capital Markets LLC, RBS Greenwich Capital, and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \b \u001d  Copies of the preliminary prospectus related to the offerings may obtained from Merrill Lynch & Co., 4 World Financial Center, New York, NY 10080, Attention: Prospectus Department or from J.P.

Gazprom last year signed asset-swap deals with Germany's BASF AG (BSF) and Italy's Eni SpA (E) - deals that Putin hailed as models for other E.U. nations. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:49 ET (12:49 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"895fd8aff5735538407cbd0b013735cb","symR":["BBC.YY","GOOG"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,1.005175],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.009916],"Headline":"BBC Is Publicly-Funded U.K. Broadcaster","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BBC.YY","GOOG"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","BRD","ISV","MED","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:32 ET (11:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8989bb2836c5047855944e670ccd19eb","symR":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[1.002585,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.046316,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Royal Bank Of Canada Boosts Common Share Dividend>RY","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:31 ET (12:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"89c7d3f17061e0a7b866a839f2d1c22e","symR":["7201.TO","7203.TO","7267.TO","BRKA","BRKB","BSC","DCX","DCX.XE","F","GM","GOOG","HMC","MSFT","NSANY","RDSA","RDSA.LN","RDSB","RDSB.LN","TM","UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483","DE0007100000","GB00B03MLX29","GB00B03MM408","JP3633400001","JP3672400003","JP3854600008","US3704421052","US5949181045"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9986825,0.9941215,1.005175,1.012835,0.9924352,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9908591,0.9866897,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.006588,0.9964076,1.009916,0.9980469,0.962536,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.012859,0.9683665,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"=WSJ.COM/The Morning Brief: Deficiencies In US Health Care","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T13:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["7201.TO","7203.TO","7267.TO","BRKA","BRKB","BSC","DCX","DCX.XE","F","GM","GOOG","HMC","MSFT","NSANY","RDSA","RDSA.LN","RDSB","RDSB.LN","TM","UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483","DE0007100000","GB00B03MLX29","GB00B03MM408","JP3633400001","JP3672400003","JP3854600008","US3704421052","US5949181045"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","BAN","BNK","INS","INU","ISV","OIL","SCR","SOF","X225","XAEX","XATI","XDAX","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSMI","XSP5","XST5","XSTF","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \b   By Joseph Schuman \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE \b \u001d  BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Deficiencies of the U.S. health care system have been a dominant political issue for decades, even if they were overshadowed by national security in the years following 9/11. Each week of early 2007 seems to bring new evidence that health care will again be a defining issue in the presidential races of 2008. \u001d  Proposals for universal insurance coverage have recently proliferated across corporate America and among local governments, and now a new poll suggests a majority of Americans also back such ideas and are even willing to pay higher taxes to fund them. The survey, conducted for the New York Times and CBS, found Iraq to be the overarching political issue but that access to affordable health care outranks immigration, tax cuts and the promotion of \"traditional values\" on the public's domestic agenda. A majority of respondents favored a federal guarantee of health insurance for every American, and the survey found what the Times calls a striking willingness to pay as much as $500 in additional taxes a year and to forgo future tax cuts. \"But the same divisions that doomed the last effort at creating universal health insurance, under the Clinton administration, are still apparent,\" the Times adds. \"Americans remain divided, largely along party lines, over whether the government should require everyone to participate in a national health care plan, and over whether the government would do a better job than the private insurance industry in providing coverage.\" \u001d  Still, the recent support from big business - long worried about the liabilities of employee health costs - may help channel this popular concern into more workable or at least debatable policy options. And there is no shortage of studies to back advocates for change. One of the latest, from the health-care advocacy group Families USA, indicates that \"hospitalized children who lack health insurance are twice as likely to die from their injuries as those with insurance,\" USA Today reports. That report, which shows how uninsured children receive less expensive treatments and are discharged earlier, was sent this week to congressional committees looking into how the country might help its 47 million uninsured people, which include 9 million children. \u001d  Adding to the funding quandaries, Science reports that the National Cancer Institute's demand for deep cuts in clinical trials is hitting trials for cancer-ridden children particularly hard. The NCI, part of the National Institutes for Health, has sought 10% cost reductions from the groups that run large-scale cancer trials, which puts at risk 95 trials and reduces the patient slots by 3,000, Science says. While only 3% of adults with cancer enroll in such trials, more than 50% of children do. William Woods, a member of the Children's Oncology Group's scientific council and president of the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, tells the magazine: \"We had to play Solomon and try to figure out which kids would we affect the least.\" \b \b   A Timely Arrest In Pakistan \b \u001d  American doubts about Pakistan's cooperation in antiterror efforts have been growing for years, even if they weren't formally voiced by the Bush administration. This week, apparently on the same day Vice President Dick Cheney conveyed White House concerns to Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, Pakistani authorities arrested the former defense minister of the Taliban in the city of Quetta. This despite repeated denials from Pakistani officials that the Taliban - and al Qaeda - were staging operations in Afghanistan from Pakistan. A U.S. official tells the Los Angeles Times that Mullah Obaidullah Akhund had access to the highest levels of the Taliban. And a government official tells the New York Times that \"he's a big fish, but nobody around here thinks this will deal a permanent blow to the operations of the Taliban.\" \u001d  Newsweek's Michael Hirsh views the Cheney trip to Pakistan as tacit acknowledgment that the administration's past declarations of \"excellent\" progress in Afghanistan were faulty, at a time when the Taliban is clearly growing as a threat there. And he groups this turnaround with the White House's recent reversals of refusals to join talks that include Iran and Syria and to talk with North Korea before it gave up its nuclear arms. \"The Bush administration has grown enamored of making what I would call \"nonconcession concessions,\" he writes. \"President George W. Bush and his senior aides are correcting course big time - and implicitly admitting previous errors - without any acknowledgment that they are doing so.\" On Thursday, officials told the Washington Post that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has named as her counselor Eliot A. Cohen, an outspoken critic of the postwar occupation of Iraq and a prominent writer on national-security strategy. \b \b   Greed, The Oyster Bar And Alleged Insider Trading \b \u001d  The more insider trading changes, the more it stays the same, or so it would appear from the details of federal charges unveiled Thursday against 13 people that involve four big Wall Street firms, a handful of hedge funds and the legendary Oyster Bar restaurant in Midtown Manhattan. That was the location of a 2001 meeting where a UBS research executive who owed $25,000 to a Bear Stearns hedge-fund manager agreed to share early information about potentially market-moving stock analysis, as The Wall Street Journal reports. Authorities say the two men used disposable cellphones and coded text messaging in an effort to avoid detection, the Los Angeles Times adds, and the scheme allegedly widened to include a separate plot at Morgan Stanley. \u001d  Linda Thomsen, the Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement chief, called the scheme one of the most \"pervasive Wall Street insider trading rings since the days of Ivan Boesky and Dennis Levine,\" as the New York Times reports. The two friends who allegedly started the plot each had their own network of tippees, whose connections were said to earn an ill-gotten $15 million and were mapped out on a poster board by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Michael Garcia. \"Clearly,\" he said, \"greed is at work.\" \b \b   Also Of Note  \b \u001d  Washington Post: The commander of Walter Reed Army Medical Center was fired after the Army said it had lost trust and confidence in his leadership in the wake of a scandal over outpatient treatment of wounded troops, including some who were kept in squalid conditions at the Washington hospital complex. But the interim reappointment of former Walter Reed commander Lt. Gen. Kevin C. Kiley to replace Maj. Gen. George W. Weightman surprised some Defense Department officials because soldiers, their families and veterans' advocates have complained that he had long been aware of problems and did nothing to improve outpatient care. \u001d  The Hill: A House Judiciary subcommittee approved the first in what is expected to be an avalanche of subpoenas to Bush administration officials that will likely explore corruption and mismanagement allegations on everything from pre-war Iraq intelligence to the mishandling of the response to Hurricane Katrina. The first round of subpoenas concern the recent controversial firings of seven U.S. attorneys, some of whom were pursuing public corruption cases against Republican members of Congress. \u001d  Detroit Free Press: General Motors Corp.

It said some SIFMA members already have decided to make the switch for corporate meetings held in 2007. \u001d  Broker voting on behalf of customers has come under scrutiny by the New York Stock Exchange, whose rules have long allowed it in certain cases.  An NYSE working group recommended ending the practice, starting in 2008, which the NYSE submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission in October.  The SEC has yet to act on the plan. \u001d  SIFMA's letter said the NYSE working group \"has informed us that it has no objection to the members of SIFMA moving forward with this change,\" and that the working group \"will be interested in hearing about the brokers' experience with proportional voting.\" \u001d  Christaan Brackman, a spokesman for the NYSE, whose parent is NYSE Inc. (NYX), declined to comment. Larry Sonsini, chair of the Palo Alto law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, who heads the NYSE working group, wasn't available to comment. \u001d  Current NYSE rules permit brokers to cast votes on behalf of shareholders for routine matters, including uncontested elections for directors, provided the shareholder hasn't acted 10 days before the corporate annual meeting. The NYSE's proposal to eliminate the practice has drawn criticism from the mutual fund industry and others who say it will be costly and make it harder to obtain quorums for annual meetings. \u001d  In a Jan. 16, letter to SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, American Business Conference president John Endean called on securities regulators to urge the NYSE to go back to the drawing board. \u001d  \"A simpler, economical and proven alternative is readily at hand, namely proportional voting, on a broker-by-broker basis, of uninstructed shares,\" wrote Endean. \u001d  Proportional voting, also known as \"mirror\" or \"echo\" voting, eliminates the need to distinguish between routine and non-routine matters. Under such an approach, brokers vote uninstructed shares in the same proportion as shares for which they have instructions. The NYSE working group considered the approach but ultimately opted to recommend an outright ban on broker voting of uninstructed shares. \u001d  Charles Schwab & Co. (SCH) already has instituted a proportional voting system and SIFMA suggested other brokers consider doing the same.  It said Automatic Data Processing Inc., which provides vote-tabulation services, is familiar with the steps needed for such voting and will advise brokerage firms looking to make the change. \u001d  Advocates of proportional voting say it is relatively simple, if done on a broker-by-broker basis, and fairer, because votes are cast based on the position taken by other shareholders, who may not always side with management's stance.  Critics worry that it can be subject to manipulation by shareholder advocates who may skew votes at an individual brokerage firm.  An alternative approach avoids that by having brokers vote uninstructed customer shares based on the proportion of shares voted across all brokerage firms, rather than on an individual firm basis.  Industry-wide proportional voting is more complicated, however, and the SIFMA didn't recommend it. \u001d  Broker voting occurs because most shares are held on behalf of customers at brokerage firms.  While institutional investors typically vote their shares, retail investors often do not.  One advantage of the practice is that it makes it easier for companies to obtain a quorum of shares needed to conduct and vote at annual meetings. \b \u001d  -By Judith Burns, Dow Jones Newswires, 202-862-6692; Judith.Burns@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:32 ET (12:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"89f15f74fe6ae2dd29142ccc8f73662e","symR":["TXU","US8731681081"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"TXU Files To Delay 10K >TXU","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TXU","US8731681081"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:07 ET (11:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8a1a551c718422b9d624d6c99b3fbd66","symR":["MYL"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Mylan Labs Offering $550M Sr Conv Notes Due 2012 >MYL","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MYL"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:01 ET (12:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8a2d611bdf0d469705f96f2cdc151514","symR":["ANZ","ANZ.AU","MBL.AU","AU000000ANZ3","AU000000MBL3"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Australian Bank Sector Rosy, Macquarie Ups Guidance","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T05:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ANZ","ANZ.AU","MBL.AU","AU000000ANZ3","AU000000MBL3"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","SCR","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA","XORD"],"Story":"\b \b   (Adds analyst comments, background, closing share price) \b \b   By Rebecca Thurlow \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd. (MBL.AU) Friday said it expects annual profit to rise at least 50%, citing good market conditions and transaction levels. \u001d  One of the nation's big four banks, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ), also revealed it had exceptionally strong revenue growth at the start of fiscal 2007, and is on track to meet annual estimates. \u001d  Macquarie Bank deputy managing director Richard Sheppard said the investment bank now expects second half earnings to be above the A$638 million first half result, a turnaround from less than a month ago when its predicted profit in the final six months to March 31 would be slightly down. \u001d  Last year, Macquarie's earnings rose 13% to A$916 million, marking its 14th straight record profit. With an operational strategy now being mimicked by bigger rivals like Goldman Sachs, Macquarie Bank combs the globe for assets exposed to limited competition such as airports, toll roads and utilities, and sells them in initial public offerings or bundles them into managed funds. \u001d  \"The deal flow is extremely strong at the moment and they are just riding that wave,\" said Carlos Castillo, an analyst at Commonwealth Securities. \u001d  \"The amount of fees they are getting for these deals at the moment is quite lucrative,\" Castillo said, noting there are plenty of deals in the pipeline to help prop up future earnings. \u001d  Macquarie and U.S. buyout giant Texas Pacific Group are leading a A$11 billion takeover bid for Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd that is being reviewed by the government but which Thursday won a green light from the competition regulator. \u001d  A A$2.65 billion initial public share offer unveiled by Salt Lake City-based drilling services company Boart Longyear Ltd. Thursday will also provide windfall gains for Macquarie and other investors. \u001d  Macquarie Bank shares rose 1.7% to end at A$81.35, valuing the group at A$20.6 billion. \u001d  Eric Betts, an equity strategist at Nomura Australia, said analysts will probably boost their earnings forecast by a few percentage points. \u001d  \"It's pretty positive. They have got a lot in the pipeline and obviously markets have been up until now pretty strong and that provides them with a tail wind,\" he said. \u001d  ANZ said its revenue growth has been particularly strong in the first four months of its financial year and the bank is in line to meet its own expectations for the full year ended Sept. 30. \u001d  It said revenue growth for the four months to the end of January was toward the upper end of the 7% to 10% target range, while expense growth was toward the upper end of the  5% to 7% target. \u001d  \"I'm pleased to say that ANZ is in pretty good shape for the first period of the 2007 year,\" chief executive John McFarlane told analysts. \u001d  \"For the first four months of the year, we have had the strongest revenue growth in history. The task now is to make sure we continue that for the rest of the year.\" \u001d  Johan Vanderlugt, an analysts at Daiwa Securities, said there were no surprises in the trading update and affirmed his outperform rating and A$32.50 price target. \"Among the four large banks, we prefer ANZ, as it has a track record of strong top-line performance and is enjoying strong earnings momentum in mortgages and consumer finance,\" said Vanderlugt in a research note. ANZ shares fell 1.1%. \u001d  ANZ's profit surged 16% in the fiscal 2006 to a record  A$3.69 billion, driven by stronger retail lending as it rolled out new branches and hired more staff. \b \u001d  -By Rebecca Thurlow, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2959; rebecca.thurlow@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Ian Pemberton \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:24 ET (05:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8a45c26b430f7c1c9aec4a6afc255954","symR":["IDIX"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"IdenixPharm 4Q Losses 42c/Shr Vs 27c>IDIX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IDIX"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8ac8ac8fe6bc2b964410d8dfd5c0f090","symR":["APP.LN","IMP.JO","IMPUY","GB0031664823","ZAE000083648"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,0.937037,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,1.012963,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"OFT Considering Impala Platinum, African Platinum Merger","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["APP.LN","IMP.JO","IMPUY","GB0031664823","ZAE000083648"],"IndustryCodes":["PCS","PPM","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The Office of Fair Trading is considering whether the anticipated acquisition by Impala Platinum Holdings Limited of African Platinum plc will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002. \u001d  Should it be found to be a relevant merger situation, the OFT will further consider whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services that warrants reference to the Competition Commission for investigation and report.

(\"NuVista\") is pleased to report to shareholders its financial and operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2006. NuVista has now completed three and one half years of operations and considering the volatility in the industry environment, the Board of Directors and management are very pleased with the results, accomplishments and corresponding value created to date. The results of the fourth quarter of 2006 represent the fourteenth consecutive quarter of continuous profitable growth for NuVista since its creation on July 2, 2003. During 2006, NuVista's profitability was impacted by lower natural gas prices but we remained focused on our disciplined approach to business, continued to increase production volumes, improved our ability to generate new drilling prospects, and we have put plans in place to deliver significant organic growth in 2007. \b \b2006 was a challenging business environment for natural gas weighted junior producers in Western Canada with record costs for acquisitions, rising cost pressures within the industry, the delayed onset of winter drilling, scarcity of equipment early in the year, and declining natural gas prices following the warmest winter in 100 years. Despite a late start to our drilling program, NuVista managed to rise above these challenges, successfully implementing our planned capital program. In 2006, NuVista conducted an active drilling program of 159 wells comprised of 103 gas, 28 oil and 28 abandoned wells. In addition, we added a new core area in West Central Saskatchewan and expanded our talented team of employees, significantly reducing our dependence on the technical service agreement with Bonavista Petroleum Ltd. (\"Bonavista\"). \b \bNuVista's production for the three months ended December 31, 2006 averaged 12,612 boe/d and was slightly lower than anticipated due to the delayed tiein of new production. NuVista's exit production rate of approximately 13,300 boe/d was reduced by the curtailment of two new high deliverability wells at third party facilities (300 boe/d) and an unusually high level of downtime (400 boe/d). In late January, production at one of the shut-in wells was restored adding 200 boe/d net to NuVista. NuVista's current production is approximately 13,500 boe/d and is 83% weighted to natural gas. The curtailment of the two wells continues but plans are currently underway to tie one well into a second facility and to conduct facility modifications for the second well. Both wells are expected to be flowing at capability prior to the end of March 2007, adding 300-500 boe/d net to NuVista. \b \bOther significant highlights for NuVista in 2006 include: \b \b- Increased year over year production by 33% to 11,962 boe/d, from 9,024 boe/d in 2005. NuVista's current production level is approximately 13,500 boe/d. \b \b- Increased undeveloped land by 39% to approximately 597,000 net acres, compared to 428,000 net acres at the end of 2005, providing NuVista with over 250 near ready drilling prospects, the largest inventory in our history. NuVista's technical teams are currently adding 175 new prospects each year to inventory; \b \b- Added over 4,000 kilometers of 2D and 230 square kilometers of 3D seismic to further enhance the prospectivity of NuVista's undeveloped land; \b \b- Increased proved plus probable reserves to 33.4 mmboes; a 24% increase on both a gross and per share basis; \b \b- Achieved proved plus probable finding and development costs of $20.00/boe (including changes in future capital and after technical revisions) in a highly competitive environment with increased industry costs; \b \b- Completed a significant acquisition of properties in West Central Saskatchewan creating a new core area and improving our ability to organically generate new drilling opportunities; and \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:38 ET (11:38 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"8ffea7e618cf63315d9996ab90b2a999","symR":["OI"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9949023],"ret5":[1.028887],"Headline":"Owens-Illinois Subsidiary To Offer EUR300M Of Sr Notes","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OI"],"IndustryCodes":["CTR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  OI European Group B.V., a subsidiary of Owens-Illinois Inc.

In addition, since 2000, energy prices have risen substantially, resulting in increased costs of production over this period. In 2003, the Fund incurred foreign exchange losses on its US dollar seedling contracts, which impacted earnings for the period by $456,000. In 2002, the Fund retired its term debt from the proceeds of a $15 million equity offering, and in the process incurred a loss on cancellation of interest rate swaps of $472,000. In 2004 the Fund incurred site consolidation costs of $453,000 to close and relocate nursery sites, and in 2005 the Fund recorded a gain on sale of a closed nursery site of $548,000. Over the Fund's operating history there have been no adjustments to earnings for discontinued operations or extraordinary items. \b \bSummary of Quarterly Results \b \bFigures below are presented in $000's, except for per trust unit figures. \b \b \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                                2005 \b                        --------------------------------------------------- \b                                                                    January \b                                                                         to \b                                                                   December \b                          1st Q      2nd Q     3rd Q       4th Q         31 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bOperating Results \bRevenues                $ 8,838    $13,738   $ 6,361     $13,160    $42,097 \b \bNet earnings            $ 1,345    $ 2,741   $   356     $ 1,566    $ 6,008 \bPer Unit(1)             $  0.18    $  0.36   $  0.05     $  0.20    $  0.79 \bDistributable cash      $ 1,216    $ 3,718   $   105     $ 2,417    $ 7,456 \bPer Unit                $  0.16    $  0.49   $  0.01     $  0.32    $  0.98 \b \bDistributions declared  $ 1,660    $ 1,660   $ 1,661     $ 1,805    $ 6,786 \bPer Unit                $  0.22    $  0.22   $  0.22     $  0.22    $  0.88 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                                2006 \b                        --------------------------------------------------- \b                                                                    January \b                                                                         to \b                                                                   December \b                          1st Q      2nd Q     3rd Q       4th Q         31 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bOperating Results \bRevenues                $12,808    $17,767   $ 8,804     $12,195    $51,574 \b \bNet earnings            $ 1,697    $ 3,298   $   294     $ 2,076    $ 7,365 \bPer Unit(1)             $  0.18    $  0.34   $  0.03     $  0.22    $  0.77 \bDistributable cash      $ 2,203    $ 4,619   $    90     $ 2,187    $ 9,099 \bPer Unit                $  0.23    $  0.48   $  0.01     $  0.23    $  0.95 \b \bDistributions declared  $ 2,407    $ 2,158   $ 2,159     $ 2,160    $ 8,884 \bPer Unit                $  0.25    $  0.23   $  0.23     $  0.22    $  0.93 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \bNote 1: Basic and Fully Diluted \b \bThe above summarized financial data is presented in Canadian dollars, and \b has been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted \b accounting principles, with the exception of distributable cash amounts. \b Distributable Cash Flow is a term which does not have standardized meaning \b under Canadian generally accepted accounting principles, and may not be \b comparable to similar measures provided by other reporting entities. \b \b \bDiscussion of Quarterly Results: \b \bThe Fund's operating results are seasonal, driven by the varying levels of activity required throughout the seedling growing cycle, as well as the seasonal nature of silviculture services. Revenues and cash flow are affected by PRT's seedling crop cycles, crop mix, and by the seasonality of PRT's customers' planting season. PRT recognizes revenue under contracts on a percentage completion basis with costs incurred as a base. Revenue from non-contracted goods and services is recognized when the goods are delivered or the service has been substantially rendered. As such, fluctuations between quarters occur depending upon the activities in the quarter. Comparatively high cost activities, such as harvesting, typically occur in the second and fourth quarters, and accordingly these quarters normally reflect a higher proportion of annual revenues. Operating results in the fourth quarter of 2006 were lower than the same period of 2005 due to revenue timing shifts to the first and second quarters caused by crop mix changes. Operating results in the fourth quarter of 2005 were also impacted by the acquisition of Pelton Reforestation Ltd., and the capital structure in place during that quarter. Distributions declared in the first quarter period may include a \"top-up\" distribution declared from available distributable cash flow of the prior year. No such distribution was made in 2005, while $0.03 per unit was declared in the first quarter of 2006. \b \bRisks and Risk Management \b \bAgricultural \b \bThe Company's business involves the cultivation and growing of forest seedlings, an agricultural crop. As such, the business of PRT is subject to risks inherent in an agricultural business. To manage these risks, PRT grows its crop at multiple sites with diverse locations, with the majority of the crop grown in climate-controlled greenhouses. Trained growing personnel monitor the growing conditions with the aid of computerized environmental control, alarm and other management systems.

(OTC BB: BWEBF), a leading provider of software designed to mobilize business web applications, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. BackWeb also announced that Ken Holmes, the Company's Vice President Finance, has been promoted to Chief Financial Officer of the Company. \b \u001d  BackWeb reported Q4 2006 revenue of $1.3 million, an improvement over revenue of $720,000 in Q3 2006, though a decrease from revenue of $1.8 million in Q4 2005. New license sales in Q4 2006 exceeded those in Q3 2006 and in the year-ago quarter. Total license sales in Q4 2006 were $550,000, reflecting sales to Novartis Pharmaceuticals and other organizations. This compares to total license sales of $60,000 in Q3 2006 and $743,000 in the year-ago quarter. As anticipated, Q4 2006 included no revenue contribution from F-Secure Corporation, whereas during Q4 2005 the Company recognized revenue of $390,000 from this customer. Maintenance revenue continued to demonstrate healthy renewal trends as Q4 2006 maintenance revenue was $477,000, compared to $516,000 in Q3 2006 and $495,000 in Q4 2005. \b \u001d  The Company's total net expenses in Q4 2006 were approximately $1.5 million, a level below that originally anticipated at the time BackWeb provided preliminary results. The lower expense level reflected approximately $250,000 in favorable adjustments made as part of the Company's full-year 2006 audit process as well as a lower than anticipated level of expenses in the period. As a result of lower than expected total net expenses, in Q4 2006 BackWeb reported a lower than anticipated net loss of $204,000, or break-even on a per share basis, compared to a net loss of $1.6 million, or ($0.04) per share, in Q3 2006, and a net loss of $301,000, or ($0.01) per share, in Q4 2005. Non-cash stock-based compensation (FAS 123R) related expenses of approximately $100,000 were included in operating expenses for Q4 2006 and all other quarters during 2006, with no comparable expense reflected in the comparable 2005 periods. \b \u001d  BackWeb's CEO, Bill Heye, stated, \"We were pleased to close 2006 on a positive note in the fourth quarter. We were able to execute on sales while making the previously announced cuts that bring our expenses down to the $1.5 - $1.6 million per quarter range. This level of quarterly expense for 2007 allows us to continue our enterprise sales efforts, our new product development and our support for new platforms such as the recently launched Microsoft Windows Vista operating system.\" \b \u001d  Ken Holmes, BackWeb's CFO, commented, \"We're pleased that our Q4 2006 net loss came in better than the preliminary results we provided. This was principally due to a few favorable adjustments that resulted from our year-end audit and lower than expected operating expenses in the quarter. Given our cost reductions and spending discipline, as well as the $4.5 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2006, we believe BackWeb is sufficiently capitalized to execute on our business plan throughout 2007 and beyond.\" \b \u001d  Mr. Heye added, \"There is now an increased level of attention in the industry and business press being given to 'mobile enabling' or providing unplugged access to business web applications for mobile laptop users. Companies and users now expect their business web applications to provide them with a complete user experience that gives them flexibility to use their applications anytime during their mobile workday.

We have also become a charter member of the Salesforce.com AppExchange Incubator program in Silicon Valley, which gives us daily on-site access to Salesforce.com and its partners as we prepare to go live with our Salesforce.com partner offerings. We are actively involved in sales activities with other large enterprises and government agencies and are focused on the goal of driving BackWeb as quickly as possible to the goal of sustainable profitability. \b \u001d  \"It is also gratifying to report that our Board of Directors recently promoted Ken Holmes to the position of CFO. The appointment acknowledges his hard work and contributions across a variety of fronts over the past four years, the last two of which have been in the role of VP Finance. We look to Ken to play an important leadership role at the Company going forward and congratulate him on his accomplishments and dedication to BackWeb.\" \b \b   About BackWeb Technologies: \b \u001d  BackWeb (http://www.backweb.com) mobilizes critical web applications and content for mobile workforces and remote offices.

(AP)--Workers at Tyson Food Inc.'s (TSN) beef slaughter plant in Holcomb voted Thursday on a proposal to unionize the plant under the United Steelworkers union. \u001d  Results were not expected until early Friday morning, said union organizer Mark Pitt. The vote requires a simple majority to pass. \u001d  If organizers succeed, the union would represent 2,450 workers in Tyson's Holcomb plant. \u001d  Tyson is the world's largest processor of chicken, beef and pork - employing about 107,000 people at 300 facilities around the globe. The Holcomb plant, one of company's largest facilities, employs 3,100 workers. \u001d  Union leaders seized on the plant's injury rate as a rallying cry for their unionization efforts. Workers hoped bringing in the Steelworkers will help slow the production line to ease repetitive strain and other injuries - they claim at least one worker a day is hurt on the job. They also wanted better health insurance and retirement benefits. \u001d  Tyson contends the number of injuries at Holcomb seems high because the company encourages workers to report all injuries and it's one of Tyson's biggest plants. It said the rate of serious injuries is low, as seen by its lost time rate. \u001d  The company also pointed to its safety committee and noted every production line has at least one safety committee member and each worker is outfitted with $400 worth of protective equipment. \u001d  About 33,190 workers in 37 Tyson facilities worldwide are represented by unions, according to the company's most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 01:15 ET (06:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"934dea2f4cfe05bd56bb2dcec5d45c4c","symR":["RIO","TKA.XE","VALE5.BR","BRVALEACNPA3","DE0007500001"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9869652,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[0.9956389,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CVRD Raises Ore Price To ThyssenKrupp By 9.5% - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T06:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RIO","TKA.XE","VALE5.BR","BRVALEACNPA3","DE0007500001"],"IndustryCodes":["IDD","STL","XDAX","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Companhia Vale do Rio Doce's (RIO), the Brazilian iron ore producer, is charging German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA.XE) 9.5% more beginning April 1, according to Financial Times Deutschland's Friday edition.

(BOL) said late Thursday that it will delay filing its 2006 annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission by up to two months, and that it will issue preliminary results for the year weeks later than previously projected. \u001d  Bausch & Lomb has been held back from filing timely financial reports by accounting issues. The Rochester, N.Y., eye-care company was also hit hard last year by a permanent recall of its ReNu with MoistureLoc contact lens solution. Forecasts for 2006 suggest the solution issue will have a significant impact. \u001d  The company told the SEC, and said in a press release that it plans to file the 2006 10-K by April 30. The report was due on Thursday. \u001d  The company also said it plans to release \"certain preliminary and unaudited 2006 financial results and expectations for 2007 by mid-March.\" \u001d  The company had previously said that it planned to provide investors with 2006 details around the end of February. \u001d  Bausch & Lomb on Feb. 7 filed its long-awaited annual report for 2005, which included restatements that had the effect of reducing 2003 and 2004 earnings by a combined $25.2 million. \u001d  The company at the end of January said it expected to report sales for 2006 of $2.3 billion, which is down from a prior estimate that sales would land in the lower end of a $2.33 billion to $2.4 billion range. \u001d  The company also estimated that it earned about $74 million last year before income taxes and minority interest, within a projected range the company forecasted in August. That August forecast, though, was ratcheted down more than 75% from a prior outlook, due in part to the MoistureLoc solution issue. \u001d  Bausch & Lomb completely pulled MoistureLoc from the worldwide market last May after the product was associated with a fungal infection of the eye that can cause blindness. The company has said that the solution itself is safe, but that improper usage could compromise its fungus-fighting ability. \u001d  In the SEC filing Thursday, Bausch & Lomb said it has not yet completed its required assessment of the its internal control over financial reporting and control deficiencies. While several \"weaknesses\" were fixed last year, the company said it's likely to report \"one or more material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting for 2006 when it files for 2006.\" \u001d  The company has said that overdue quarterly reports to the SEC will follow the 2006 annual report. \u001d  The company has waivers from lenders under its credit agreement, and from debt holders, that give it until April 30 to file the 2006 report. If it's not filed by then, Bausch & Lomb said plans to seek additional waivers. \u001d  Bausch & Lomb shares closed trading Thursday at $51.31, down 95 cents, or 1.8%. \u001d  -By Jon Kamp; Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \u001d  (Tony Cooke contributed to this report.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:34 ET (12:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"949a4d305df97641ddcec38ed1596f87","symR":["NBR"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9876586],"ret5":[0.9986287],"Headline":"*WSJ: Nabors's Review Confirms Misdated Options Grants","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T05:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NBR"],"IndustryCodes":["DRL","OIE","OIL","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:00 ET (05:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"949f5829bc0669b00932b21501577192","symR":["CTXS"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9980835],"ret5":[0.9987223],"Headline":": Citrix Announces Delay in Filing its 2006 Form 10-K","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CTXS"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 02, 2007-- \u001d  Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today reported that it will delay the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and has filed a Form 12b-25 (Notification of Late Filing) with the Securities and Exchange Commission that extends the due date for its Form 10-K to March 16, 2007. The delay is necessary due to the ongoing status of the previously announced voluntary review of Citrix's historical stock option granting practices and related accounting. \b \u001d  Although the Audit Committee has reached no conclusions concerning the review, the investigation has thus far identified errors in connection with stock option grants issued by Citrix during the period from 1996 through 1998. The Audit Committee is continuing its evaluation of these and subsequent periods. Further, the independent review has found no evidence of any intentional wrongdoing by the Company's current executives. Until the voluntary review is completed, Citrix will not be able to file its Form 10-K. Citrix intends to file its Form 10-K as soon as practicable after the voluntary review is completed. \b \b   About Citrix \b \u001d  Citrix Systems, Inc.

Management has performed a goodwill impairment test and an assessment of the remaining life of its intangible assets as at December 31, 2006 and concluded there was no impairment of goodwill or change in the remaining life of its intangible assets. \b \bAccounts receivable allowances are determined using a combination of historical experience, current information and management's judgment. \b \bIncome taxes are calculated based on the expected treatment of transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements. In determining current and deferred components of income taxes, management interprets tax legislation and makes assumptions about the timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities. If management's interpretations differ from those of the tax authorities or if the timing of reversals are not as anticipated, the provision for income taxes could increase or decrease in future periods. \b \bNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \b \bEBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is not a recognized financial measure under Canadian GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. The Fund's definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other funds. The Fund defines EBITDA as earnings or loss before income taxes plus interest expense, amortization, depreciation and unrealized loss on mark-to-market derivative instruments and less unrealized gain on mark-to-market derivative instruments. Management believes EBITDA is a reasonable operating measure as it looks at earnings prior to certain significant non-cash expenses. \b \bDistributable Cash is not a recognized financial measure under Canadian GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Canadian open-ended trusts, such as the Fund, use distributable cash and distributable cash per unit as indicators of financial performance. Distributable cash and distributable cash per unit may differ from similar computations reported by other entities and, accordingly may not be comparable to similar distributable cash and distributable cash per unit reported by such entities. Management believes that distributable cash and distributable cash per unit are useful supplemental measures that may assist investors in assessing financial performance and cash generated by the Fund that is available to unitholders for distribution. \b \bRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS \b \bAs disclosed in the Prospectus, a director of the General Partner of the Partnership controls a company that owns the Burnaby, British Columbia property occupied by CSRS Holdings, Ltd. (\"CSRS\"). In addition, the director has an interest in a company that provides and purchases search and registration fee services to/from CSRS. For the period from March 17, 2006 to December 31, 2006 rent paid was approximately $564, search and registration service purchased was approximately $384 and search and registration service revenue was approximately $86. \b \bIn addition, as disclosed in the Prospectus, certain officers and a director of the General Partner of the Partnership hold a minority interest in three properties occupied by operations of Resolve Corporation. The rent paid during the period March 17, 2006 to December 31, 2006 was $656. \b \bOUTLOOK \b \bThe Fund enters 2007 with two significant new customer solutions to implement. These are large solutions and are illustrative of complex operational solutions the Business can pursue. Resolve has reorganized its sales and marketing activities and believes the realigned focus will provide additional opportunities to expand its existing client relationships and to secure new customers. \b \bThe Fund intends to pursue selective strategic acquisitions which will expand and enhance the existing operations of the Business. \b \bThe Fund expects to generate distributable cash in 2007 at a level equal to or greater than the annualized distributable cash generated in 2006. \b \bThe Fund's mid-term objective is to significantly grow revenue and earnings through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions. This will better position the Fund to consider alternatives as the date for implementation of the proposed tax on distributions by income trusts approaches. \b \bADDITIONAL INFORMATION \b \bDetails of the Fund's authorized and outstanding unit data are as follows: \b \bThe Fund may issue an unlimited number of ordinary trust units and an unlimited number of special voting units. Each ordinary unit is transferable and represents an equal undivided beneficial interest in any distribution from the Fund. Except for the right to vote, each special voting unit does not confer any other rights. \b \bAs a December 31, 2006, there were 23,125,750 ordinary trust units and 9,485,750 special voting units outstanding. \b \bAs at December 31, 2006, the 9,485,750 special voting unitholders also held 9,485,750 Class B LP units of the Partnership. The Class B LP units can be exchanged on a one-for-one basis, subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement. For each Class B LP unit exchanged, one special voting unit is cancelled. Assuming full conversion of the Class B LP units of the Partnership, the Fund will have 32,584,500 ordinary trust units outstanding and no special voting units. No Class B LP units have been converted and no new ordinary trust units have been issued between January 1, 2007 and the date of this press release. \b \bThe Fund will file its audited consolidated financial statements, with accompanying notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis thereon prior to March 31, 2007. \b \bAdditional information relating to the Fund is available on SEDAR as www.sedar.com. \b \b \bSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION \b \bCondensed Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Earnings \bFor the Year Ended December 31, 2005 \b \b                                                                  Prorated \b                                                                       for \b                             As                                      9 1/2 \b                      Presented Adjustments     Note Reclassified   months \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                              $           $                     $        $ \b \bRevenue                 282,486                           282,486  223,635 \bDirect costs            222,826     (25,445) (a), (b)     197,381  156,260 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bGross profit             59,660                            85,105   67,375 \bOperating expenses       48,768       5,937  (b), (c)      54,705   43,308 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bOperating profit         10,892                            30,400   24,067 \bDepreciation and \b amortization             8,275      19,333       (a)      27,608   21,856 \bInterest expense          5,160                             5,160    4,085 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bEarnings (loss) \bbefore the following:    (2,543)                           (2,368)  (1,875) \bOther income             (5,111)                           (5,111)  (4,046) \bRestructuring expense       242                               242      192 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bEarnings before \b income taxes             2,326                             2,501    1,980 \bProvision for income \b taxes                      331         175       (c)         506      401 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bEarnings before \b controlling interest     1,995                             1,995    1,579 \bNon-controlling \b interest                   617                               617      488 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bNet earnings from \bcontinuing operations     1,378                             1,378    1,091 \bNet earnings from \bdiscontinued \b operations                   -                                 -        - \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bNet earnings for the \b period                   1,378                             1,378    1,091 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \bEarnings per unit \bBasic                      0.06                              0.06     0.05 \bFully diluted              0.06                              0.06     0.05 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b \bThe following adjustments are being made to the pro forma consolidated statement of earnings presented in the Prospectus to enable comparison to consolidated financial statements of the Fund for the period March 17, 2006 to December 31, 2006: \b \b(a) Amortization of intangible assets of $19,333 included in direct costs has been reclassified to depreciation and amortization to conform to the Fund's presentation. \b \b(b) Certain management and support positions previously included as direct costs in the amount of $6,112 have been reclassified as operating expenses to conform to the Fund's presentation. \b \b(c) US withholding taxes reclassified to income taxes of $175.

But the country's standoff with the U.S. and its allies over its nuclear program, along with anti-western rhetoric from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, have intensified nervousness among foreign firms about investing there. \u001d  But a number of non-U.S. oil majors chose to ignore these pressures when they gathered in one of Vienna's top hotels last month to meet with senior Iranian oil officials. \u001d  \"You tell me a country where there aren't any problems when it comes to investing,\" said a senior Indian oil executive at the Austrian event. Iran is simply \"a different nature of...problem,\" he said. \u001d  Companies including China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (SNP), or Sinopec, Norway's Statoil ASA (STO), Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA), Italy's Eni SpA (E), Total SA (TOT), Russia's Lukoil (LKOH.RS) and Austria's OMV AG (OMV.VI) listened intently as Iranian oilofficials offered, in a polished and professional presentation, 17 oil blocks for development. \u001d  Foreign oil executives there were quick to defend their right to do business with Iran. OMV struck a defiant tone when asked by Dow Jones Newswires whether it might refrain from pushing forward with its operations in Iran to avoid possible sanctions by the U.S. \u001d  \"We are obeying all Austrian laws and European Union laws, (with Austria) being an E.U. member,\" said OMV head of exploration and production, Helmut Langanger. \u001d  Russia's Lukoil also made clear its intentions to do business in the Islamic Republic. \u001d  \"Lukoil is very serious about oil and gas projects in Iran and collaborating with the National Iranian Oil Company,\" said Lukoil Vice-President Andrey Kuzyaev. \u001d  Notable by its absence in Vienna was U.K. energy giant BP PLC (BP). With major oil and gas assets in the U.S., BP is all too aware of the kind of damage it could cause itself if it were to do business with Iran. \u001d  Iran has made no secret that it urgently needs to raise foreign capital if the country is to maintain its position as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' second-largest producer. \u001d  Iran has the capacity to pump just 4.3 million barrels a day, down from6 million b/d in the late 1970s, while Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, has capacity close to 11.5 million b/d. Many of Iran's oil fields are old, and output could decline more without foreign cash and technology. \u001d  Keen to quell foreign concerns that they are no longer welcome in Iran under President Ahmedinejad, urbane Iranian oil officials at the Vienna presentation announced that Iran's energy investment contracts, known as buybacks, have been revised so that companies can be involved in an energy project for 20 years, up from 6 or 7 years previously. \u001d  The buybacks, which skirt around a constitutional ban on foreign oil firms taking an equity stake in Iranian energy projects, allow oil majors to recoup their investments through oil and gas sales.Companies repeatedly complained in the past that the contract-term was too short. \u001d  One senior Iranian oil source said he realistically expects \"two or maybe three serious bids\" regardless of the political tensions. Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have escalated in recent months. Tehran's refusal to suspend its nuclear program has led to speculation that the U.S. could use force against to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Iran already faces limited international sanctions agreed by the U.N. Security Council in late 2006 because of its nuclear ambitions, that it claims are for peaceful purposes. \u001d  The U.S. also accuses Iran of supporting Shiite insurgency in neighboring Iraq. In a show of force, a second U.S. Navy aircraft carrier arrived in the Gulf region in recent days, where it hasn't had two carriers since the early days of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. \u001d  Yasser Elguindi, Senior Managing Director at Medley Global Advisors, a leading policy intelligence advisor to investment banks, asset managers and hedge funds, says foreign oil companies are choosing to ignore geopolitical tension because they need access to new oil and gas reserves for the longer term. \u001d  \"Iran isn't a good environment\" politically,and the interest from foreign companies is indicative of how badthings are elsewhere, Elguindi says. \u001d  Oil majors are finding it increasingly hard to secure  exploration dealsglobally. Investment terms are already restrictive in many countries that hold significant energy reserves. Venezuela and Russia are tightening their grip on national reserves and forcing foreign oil companies to surrender stakes in drilling ventures. \u001d  Forced to seek out new exploration possibilities, earlier this year, Shell chose to ignore geopolitics when it made the first step towards a multibillion dollar deal with Iran to help develop the country's huge South Pars gas field. Together with Spanish oil company Repsol YPF SA (REP), Shell in January signed a preliminary $10 billion agreement with the Iranian government to develop two phases of the field. \u001d  Industry sources say the project fits with the company's attempts to build reserves. U.S. authorities have already threatened to probe the deal that Shell officials say is at the feasibility stage. \u001d  How far Shell is willing to go in defying the U.S. is   unclear. Shell chief executive officer Jeroen van der Veer said to reporters in early February that a final decision poses \"quite a dilemma.\" He said at the time that Iran has some of the biggest hydrocarbon reserves in the world, but acknowledged that politics will play a part in whether the deal proceeds. Yet van der Veer has said privately that the company needs such deals to grow its reserves, a person in contact with van der Veer told Dow Jones. \u001d  Shell couldn't be reached for comment on its reserves requirements. \u001d  Thierry Desmarest, Chairman of Total, also told reporters this week in Paris, thathis company will continue talking with Iran on developing a gas project in the Persian Gulf unless there is an international ban on doing business with the country. \u001d  Desmarest, referring to a drilling project at another part of South Pars, said, \"We've made progress, but we haven't found all the solutions. Once we have, we'll evaluate the state of the relations between Iran and the international community.\" \u001d  The U.S. prohibits all international oil companies with interests in the U.S. from investing more than $20 million a year in Iran but so far has taken no action against firms that are in breach. \u001d  Industry sources say Iran will undoubtedly be able to secure concrete bids from major energy consumers such as  China and India and western companies will wait in the wings, preparing, until the politics have calmed. \u001d  -By Sally Jones, Dow Jones Newswires;

(BSX) said in a regulatory filing late Thursday that the tally of lawsuits related to 2005 issues with Guidant heart-rhythm devices has grown to more than 1,175 cases. \u001d  The Natick, Mass., medical-device company also joined rival St. Jude Medical Inc. (STJ) in reporting that it has received a statement from a French antitrust enforcement body alleging an act of collusion, in 2001, among implantable defibrillator makers. \u001d  Boston Scientific disclosed its latest legal challenges in its 10-K annual report for 2006, filed with the SEC. The report also showed that Medinol Ltd., an Israeli device firm Boston Scientific has had legal scrapes with before, has launched a new activity against the company in Germany. \u001d  Boston Scientific said it's now facing more than 1,100 individual lawsuits and about 75 class action suits linked to the Guidant implantable defibrillator troubles in 2005. The number of cases has grown from a combined tally of about 842 cases in November, when Boston Scientific made its third-quarter report with the SEC. \u001d  Guidant was already facing hundreds of lawsuits related to recalled devices when Boston Scientific acquired the company for about $27 billion in April last year. Boston Scientific repeated in Thursday's filing, as it's said previously, that most claimants are suing for medical monitoring and anxiety and not physical injury. \u001d  Most cases are pending in federal court, and federal cases have been consolidated under \"multi-district litigation\" rules and moved to a U.S. District Court in Minnesota. The first federal court trial is scheduled for July 16 this year, Boston Scientific said. \u001d  The company said in Thursday's filing that, as of the end of 2006, it has accrued $485 million \"for legal matters that are probable and estimable.\" \u001d  That's up $101 million from the total as of Sept. 30, and up $450 million from the amount at the end of 2005. The funds primarily represent accrued legal defense costs related to assumed Guidant litigation and product liability claims. \u001d  St. Jude said in its 10-K report Wednesday that it had received a \"statement of objections\" from the French Conseil de la Concurrence that involved St. Jude and \"the four other main suppliers of ICDs,\" or defibrillators, in France. St. Jude didn't identify the other companies. \u001d  Boston Scientific reported on Thursday that it, too, has received a statement from the French regulator, and also said it involved four other main suppliers. \u001d  The statements alleged that the defibrillator makers in 2001 collectively refrained from responding to a tender for devices from a group of 17 University Hospital Centers in France, St. Jude and Boston Scientific said. Both companies said they are evaluating the matter. \u001d  If the allegations are upheld, it's most likely that St. Jude's French subsidiary would be liable to pay a civil fine, St. Jude said. The company said it was too early in the process to estimate the likely amount of a fine. \u001d  The Conseil de la Concurrence is one of the bodies responsible for enforcement of antitrust and competition law in France, the companies said. \u001d  Separately, Boston Scientific said in the SEC filing that Medinol filed on Monday a \"vindication action\" against Boston Scientific in the German District Court of Munich, Germany. \u001d  \"The complaint alleges, and seeks a ruling, that Medinol be deemed the owner of one of our patients covering coronary stent designs,\" Boston Scientific said. \"We are in the process of evaluating this matter.\" \u001d  In another legal matter, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) filed a suit in September against both Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories Inc. (ABT) arguing that improper conduct led those companies to successfully woo Guidant away from a deal with J&J last year. J&J, which seeks at least $5.5 billion through the lawsuit, said Boston Scientific won only because Guidant leaked confidential information to Abbott to help arrange a deal. \u001d  Abbott bought Guidant's vascular business and Boston Scientific bought the rest. \u001d  Boston Scientific and Abbott have filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York seeking to dismiss J&J's complaint. According to Boston Scientific's filing Thursday, a hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on Wednesday. \u001d  \"The judge took the matter under advisement, and stayed discovery pending his decision on the motion,\" Boston Scientific said. \u001d  Shares of the company closed at $16.21 Thursday, down 10 cents. \u001d  -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:35 ET (12:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"99c820b655152f3d1312ad492cc15a00","symR":["BPP.LN","CART.LN","GB0000698414","GB00B05K7697"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Carter & Carter: Undertaking Is For Possible BPP Offer","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T08:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BPP.LN","CART.LN","GB0000698414","GB00B05K7697"],"IndustryCodes":["EAG","SVC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:12 ET (08:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9a131a472880ee159023bc4764cd2ac1","symR":["29064.AE","NYX","NL0000290641"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Euronext Feb Trading Volume Up 25% Year-On-Year","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["29064.AE","NYX","NL0000290641"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","SCR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:34 ET (07:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9a4486d6550b5b8be9a141204b0826c6","symR":["BOY.LN","GB0006895626"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Bodycote Rejects Sulzer Proposal","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BOY.LN","GB0006895626"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:52 ET (11:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9a9d29abd1ca55ce135d21cdaa322c2b","symR":["PMO.LN","GB0033560011"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Premier Oil Awarded New Exploration Licence Award","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T10:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PMO.LN","GB0033560011"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 05:42 ET (10:42 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9af8fb5f3a1bc69b89338b02b509cf2d","symR":["PRT.UN.T","CA6939461050"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": PRT Announces 2006 4Q Results, -8-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PRT.UN.T","CA6939461050"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","PLN"],"Story":"\bNotes to Financial Statements \b \b1. Significant Accounting policies \b \bThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the PRT Forest Regeneration Income Fund (The Fund) have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. The interim financial statements follow the same accounting policies and method of application as the most recent annual consolidated financial statements. As such, these statements should be read in conjunction with the Fund's most recent annual report. \b \bThe preparation of these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and the operating results for the interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. \b \bThe Company uses the temporal method of foreign currency translation to translate foreign currency denominated accounts and the accounts of its foreign subsidiary. Monetary items are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items and revenue and expense items are converted at the historical exchange rate in effect at the time the transaction occurred. The Fund records realized and unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses in the Statement of Earnings and Unitholders' Equity as \"Foreign exchange loss (gain)\", and identifies unrealized (gains) losses on the translation of non-cash monetary items as \"Unrealized loss (gain) on foreign exchange\" in the Statement of Cash Flows. \b \bIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the Fund's financial position as at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, as well as its results of operations and cash flow for the three months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. \b \b2. Seasonality of operating results \b \bRevenues and cash flow are affected by the Fund's subsidiary, Pacific Regeneration Technologies Inc.'s (\"PRT's\") seedling crop cycles and by the seasonality of PRT's customers' planting season. PRT recognizes revenue under contracts on a percentage completion basis with costs incurred as a base. Revenue from non-contracted goods and services is recognized when the goods are delivered or the service has been substantially rendered.

Insert will apply its proprietary Cyclosert transport system to select second generation epothilones now in development at R&D. \b \u001d  Epothilones, despite their promise as potent anti-cancer drugs, have encountered clinical difficulties due to their toxic side effects in patients. Cyclosert is the first nanoparticle drug transport platform to be designed de novo and synthesized specifically to overcome limitations in existing technologies used for the systemic transport of therapeutics to targeted sites within the body.  Based on small cyclic repeating molecules of glucose called cyclodextrins, its application to these second generation epothilone drugs are expected to promote their ability to inhibit the growth of human cancer cells while remaining non-toxic and non-immunogenic at therapeutic doses.  In particular, the system is designed to keep the drugs non-toxic until they actually reach the targeted tumor cells where active drug is released in a controlled fashion. \b \u001d  \"This is a significant step for both Insert Therapeutics and cancer care delivery in general,\" said Edward Jacobs, Chief Executive Officer and President of Insert Therapeutics.  \"We hope this collaboration will allow a broader range of cancer patients to realize a potentially greater therapeutic effect from potent cancer drugs that may otherwise have been too toxic for them to receive.\" \b \u001d  \"We are excited about this strategic partnership with R&D-Biopharmaceuticals,\" said R. Bruce Stewart, Chairman of Arrowhead.  \"We expect to continue to enhance the overall effectiveness of cancer treatment with other therapeutic candidates in the future.\" \b \u001d  \"The combination of the Cyclosert technology has already demonstrated impressive effectiveness with other cytotoxics,\" Wolfgang Richter, Managing Director of R&D-Biopharmaceuticals added.  \"The collaboration with Insert Therapeutics is expected to fully leverage the potential of the new second generation epothilones.\" \b \u001d  Epothilones are naturally occurring microtubule depolymerisation inhibitors, which stop the growth of human cancer cells in vitro at nano or even subnanomolar concentrations.  Their attractive preclinical profile has made epothilones important lead structures in the search for improved cytotoxic anticancer drugs.  R&D will use its proprietary know-how to synthesize novel and proprietary epothilone derivates, whose pharmaceutical profile will be evaluated in the relevant testing systems.  Promising candidates showing the best profile will be considered for full preclinical development. \b \u001d  First generation epothilones are in clinical development by numerous pharmaceutical companies.  Among the aims of second generation epothilone development is to optimize them for biological selectivity, stability, and water solubility.  All of these properties have been shown to be effectively enhanced in other cytotoxic agents by use of the Cyclosert transport system. The combination of a second generation epothilone with Cyclosert should be highly competitive in this crowded field. \b \b    About Arrowhead Research Corporation \b \u001d  Arrowhead Research Corporation (http://www.arrowheadresearch.com) (Nasdaq: ARWR) is a publicly-traded nanotechnology company commercializing new technologies in the areas of life sciences, electronics, and energy.

(NOC) and United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit have won Pentagon permission to start a $700 million-plus engine project, Northrop Grumman officials said Thursday. \u001d  The two companies will put new engines on the Air Force's fleet of 19 Joint STARS aircraft, which use radar to track enemy targets on the ground. Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor for the Joint STARS fleet. \u001d  The engine program has been in the works for years, but stalled because of budget-related delays. On Wednesday, Northrop Grumman said it won a $12.5 million contract to kick off the project. \u001d  Once the engines are replaced, the fleet should be air-worthy for decades more, said Dave Nagy, Northrop Grumman's vice president for Joint STARS. The planes are based on Boeing Co. (BA) 707 passenger jets, the same aircraft used for the KC-135 tanker and other Air Force reconnaissance and surveillance planes. \u001d  \"This will eliminate the biggest maintenance issue and, over the life of the program, the new engines will pay for themselves in cost avoidance and fuel savings,\" Nagy said. \u001d  Nagy told reporters that the Joint STARS fleet also is primed for other upgrades that could extend its useful life. \u001d  For example, Northrop Grumman at one point was working with Rockwell Collins Corp. (COL) on a $100 million development effort to modernize the Joint STARS cockpits. But that program was shelved for budget reasons. \u001d  The Joint STARS planes also could provide a new home for a new radar system known as MP-RTIP, Nagy said. The radar was supposed to fly on the E-10 spy plane, but the Air Force has cut E-10 funding and now plans only a smaller version of the radar to fly on surveillance drones. \u001d  The Air Force says it needs to upgrade its surveillance fleet, but new tankers, fighters and communications satellites are higher priorities. \u001d  MP-RTIP stands for the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion program. The big version of the radar is part of the Air Force's unfunded priorities list. \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; rebecca.christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:35 ET (12:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9c6d9f1a2d60409530f79532fc4fa852","symR":["UTHR"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.988199],"ret5":[0.9885621],"Headline":"United Therapeutics Started At Overweight At Lehman Brothers","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T10:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UTHR"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 05:34 ET (10:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9d86db764c5d672673a957bf0b2388e6","symR":["GLH","GLH.LN","GB0003833695"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gallaher: Offer Relates To Cash Offer By JTI Mgmt Ltd","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GLH","GLH.LN","GB0003833695"],"IndustryCodes":["TOB","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:08 ET (07:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9e293fd9621bf7475d9d80595ea81e8e","symR":["WTS"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.970725],"ret5":[0.9953488],"Headline":"Watts Water Technologies Upgraded To Outperform At FBR","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T08:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WTS"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:02 ET (08:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9e2e8cc1e5796155bf4209d3246fcbd3","symR":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[1.002585,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.046316,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Royal Bank Of Canada To Redeem 6.75% Sub Debs Due June 4, 2012","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:32 ET (12:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9e318bf35c27336ebee25cf2b1bdf967","symR":["ANA.MC","ELE","ELE.MC","EN","ENEL.MI","EOA.XE","EON","GAS.MC","DE0007614406","ES0116870314","ES0125220311","ES0130670112","IT0003128367"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"E.ON: No CNMV, SEC Permission To Buy Endesa Shares -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ANA.MC","ELE","ELE.MC","EN","ENEL.MI","EOA.XE","EON","GAS.MC","DE0007614406","ES0116870314","ES0125220311","ES0130670112","IT0003128367"],"IndustryCodes":["CON","ELC","GAS","MUT","XDAX","XDJGI","XIBEX","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\u001d  E.ON didn't say whether or not it had asked the financial markets regulators for permission to acquire more Endesa shares.

We also present Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our credit facilities contain ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA. \b \u001d  Adjusted EBITDA is defined in our credit facilities as: (1) consolidated net income, as defined therein; plus (2) the following items, to the extent deducted from consolidated net income: (a) interest expense; (b) provision for income taxes; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) transaction expenses related to the IPO and the related debt refinancing and other limited expenses related to permitted securities offerings, investments and acquisitions incurred after the closing date of the IPO, to the extent not exceeding $5.0 million; (e) unrealized losses on financial derivatives recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 133; (f) non-cash stock-based compensation expense; (g) extraordinary or unusual losses (including extraordinary or unusual losses on permitted sales of assets and casualty events); (h) losses on sales of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and (i) all other non-cash charges that represent an accrual for which no cash is expected to be paid in the next twelve months; minus (3) the following items, to the extent any of them increases consolidated net income: (w) extraordinary or unusual gains (including extraordinary or unusual gains on permitted sales of assets and casualty events); (x) gains on asset disposals not in the ordinary course; (y) unrealized gains on financial derivatives recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 133; and (z) all other non-cash income (including the non-cash portion of any RTFC patronage capital allocation). If our Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our credit facilities that are based on Adjusted EBITDA, including our fixed charge coverage and total leverage ratio covenants, may be violated and could cause, among other things, a default or mandatory prepayment under our credit facilities, or result in our inability to pay dividends. \b \u001d  We believe that net income is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted EBITDA under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for consolidated statement of operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a complete measure of an entity's profitability because it does not include costs and expenses identified above; nor is Adjusted EBITDA a complete net cash flow measure because it does not include reductions for cash payments for an entity's obligation to service its debt, fund its working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay its income taxes and dividends. \b \b    CONTACT: Iowa Telecommunications Services, Inc., Newton \b             Investor Relations: \b             Craig Knock, Chief Financial Officer, 641-787-2089 \b             or \b             Media Relations: \b             Julie White, 641-787-2040 \b             Director, Corporate Communications \b             Julie.White@iowatelecom.com \b             or \b             Corporate Communications, Inc. \b             Investor Relations: \b             Kevin Inda, 407-566-1180 \b             Kevin.Inda@cci-ir.com \b \b    SOURCE: Iowa Telecommunications Services, Inc. \bCopyright Business Wire 2007 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:00 ET (11:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a15924dc5d2c45b7d7bd1994c03b448f","symR":["GLH","GLH.LN","GB0003833695"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gallaher FY Adj EPS 65.8p Vs 63.1p","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GLH","GLH.LN","GB0003833695"],"IndustryCodes":["TOB","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:03 ET (07:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a1d2f43555de84b2fa3948dc518a294e","symR":["BELG.BT","BE0003810273"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Belgacom FY Net Pft +1.5%, Rocky Outlook For Mobile","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BELG.BT","BE0003810273"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XB20","XDJGI","XENX","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (This updates an item published at 0617 GMT with analysts' predictions, company quote.) \b \u001d  By Anne Jolis \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Telecommunications company Belgacom SA (Belg.BT) Friday posted a stronger-than-forecast 1.5% rise in full-year net profit, but warned of a rocky outlook for 2007 driven by fierce competition and regulatory pressures. \u001d  Belgacom sees a sharp earnings downturn in its mobile communications unit Proximus for the current year. \u001d  Net profit came in at EUR973 million, up from EUR959 million the previous year, on strong ADSL high-speed Internet market share. That easily beat the average expectation of four analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires for a 2.3% drop. \u001d  Total sales for the year were up 7.1% to EUR6.1 billion, exceeding analysts' forecasts for a 6.9% rise. \u001d  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization or Ebitda rose 2.4% to EUR2.1 billion last year. However, the company said that excluding one-offs from 2005 and adjusted for new entities in 2006, group Ebitda decreased 4% to EUR2.1 billion. \u001d  \"In a highly competitive market, Belgacom has more than held its ground in 2006,\" the company said in a statement, crediting Belgacom's strong market position for delivering high-speed internet. \u001d  Still, the company predicted a rocky 2007, particularly for its mobile communications division Proximus. It said Proximus' Ebitda margin for 2007 could drop to 45%, citing \"intense competition and regulatory pressure\". \u001d  Belgacom said it plans to reduce its workforce by roughly 1,500 people by 2011, on top of the collective deal the company reached in 2005. \u001d  Belgacom said its board of directors will in April propose an ordinary dividend of EUR552 million, which comes to EUR1.6 per share, on top of the interim dividend paid in December. \b \u001d  Company Web Sites: http://www.belgacom.com \b \u001d  -By Anne Jolis Dow Jones Newswires; +32 2 741 1488; anne.jolis@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:41 ET (07:41 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a26966f14904e53658617937fcea05be","symR":["KNEBV.HE","FI0009013403"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Kone To Appeal The European Commission Decision","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KNEBV.HE","FI0009013403"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XDJGI","XHEX","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:00 ET (12:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a2ee25f62f359c91b0789c35911db795","symR":["RIV"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Riviera Hldgs 4Q Losses 13c/Shr Vs 32c>RIV","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RIV"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a325129ba17a0863ab64ed325b9629ae","symR":["000270.SE","KR7000270009"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"S Korea Kia Motors Feb Exports Dn 13% On Yr To 81,962 Units","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T05:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["000270.SE","KR7000270009"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:31 ET (05:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a348e595d154183716b38c5228f43c75","symR":["STO.AU","STOSY","AU000000STO6","STO.AU","STOSY","AU000000STO6"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Australia's Santos Hopes To Conclude US Asset Sale In 2 Mos","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T08:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["STO.AU","STOSY","AU000000STO6"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XISL","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:26 ET (08:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a3fc49bb428dcf14be8959e5f766b253","symR":["VVUS"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9848101],"ret5":[0.9949367],"Headline":"Vivus Inc. 4Q Losses 2c/Shr Vs 2c>VVUS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VVUS"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a590ec1b1a91f7f06f8ac49903daa79c","symR":["SXC.T","SXCI","CA8719292044"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"SXC Health Solutions Announces Multi-Year Pact Renewal With MemberHealth>SXC.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SXC.T","SXCI","CA8719292044"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:00 ET (12:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a5ccff4e7bee0d18f369c80c63a180b3","symR":["USU"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"CEO WELCH Surrenders 6,310 Of USEC INC >USU","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["USU"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: USEC INC \bSYMBOL: USU \b \bFILER: WELCH JOHN K \bTITLE: Chief Executive Officer \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b2/28/07            Surrender*                6,310      $14.19         $89,539 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 44,301 (Direct) \b \b  * - Insiders can surrender shares back to the company to pay taxes or cover \b      the cost of an option exercise. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

She said it was hard to go into great detail about the cause and effects until the U.K.'s Trading Standards Office released their test results later Friday. \u001d  Tesco PLC (TSCO.LN) has also begun to focus its own tests on silicon. In a statement released late Thursday the retailer said: \"Following advice from industry experts we have now started testing for silicon and other possible contaminants. We are also checking the levels at which any contaminant would start to cause engine problems. We hope to have results back soon.\" \u001d  The source of the contaminated gasoline has been traced back to Greenergy, a U.K. biofuels supplier which transported the gasoline from a Vopak storage facility in West Thurrock, Essex. Vopak, headquartered in the Netherlands, specializes in storing oil and chemical products. \u001d  A Vopak spokesman said: \"We are trying to work out what the cause of the contamination is and the trail that the gasoline has followed, but like everyone else we are awaiting the test results. It is far more complex than we originally thought but we feel that we are getting a bit closer to the answer.\" \u001d  Tesco, WM Morrisons PLC (MRW.LN), J Sainsburys PLC (JSAIY) and Asda, the U.K. arm of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), have all been named as selling contaminated gasoline. \u001d  Scientists say that when gasoline containing silicon burns, it forms silicon-dioxide which then forms a very thin sheet on the sensor in the exhaust of the vehicle. This probably gives a false signal to engine computer causing problems. \u001d  Spokesman Nick Vanderwell for the U.K. Petroleum Industry Association has recommended caution about jumping to conclusions. \"Silicon is only one of many possible contaminants. There are other possibilities (for contaminants) such as metals or lead for example.\" \u001d  Vanderwell also mentioned Harvest Energy Ltd. as having experienced problems with their fuel. Harvest Energy is one of the U.K.'s leading independent suppliers of road fuels and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blue Ocean Associates PLC, a U.K.-based oil trading group. \u001d  In a statement the company said: \"Harvest Energy has conducted extensive tests on fuel supplied to its customers in the south east. Harvest Energy has been unable to identify any problems with its fuel. We will continue these tests and work with our customers and others in the supply chain to discover where any problems may lie.\" \u001d  The spokesman at Vopak confirmed Harvest Energy stored fuel in its West Thurrock depot along with Greenergy. He said: \"We actually store fuel for many gasoline companies. It is rather unfair that Greenergy have been singled out for the contamination problems.\" \b \u001d  -By Rebecca Geach, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9262; rebeccageach@hotmail.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:50 ET (12:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a71f59859f22fabd3ed03dfe94d5e3a2","symR":["RGCI"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Regent Commun 4Q Losses $29.5M Vs $10.7M>RGCI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RGCI"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a7c75ea8dd9dcd3678d3eaba02a00a79","symR":["2412.TW","CHT","TW0002412004"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,0.992228,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,0.9953368,-0.00099],"Headline":"Chunghwa Telecom: Won't Do \"Conventional\" Capital Reduction","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T06:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["2412.TW","CHT","TW0002412004"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XISL","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 01:25 ET (06:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a8528f97741731a1616868f2fa1dd5bc","symR":["AHT.LN","GB0000536739"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Ashtead Grp: Christopher Cole Named Permanent Non-Exec Chmn","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AHT.LN","GB0000536739"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:19 ET (11:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a852fd3faa767dace29d602e088d3451","symR":["ADEN.VX","ADO","CH0012138605"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Adecco 4Q Net Pft At EUR212M, Up 23%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T06:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ADEN.VX","ADO","CH0012138605"],"IndustryCodes":["EAG","SVC","XDJGI","XNYA","XSMI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 01:03 ET (06:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a876a4190c7dacfce21830b52ca03c6e","symR":["GLBC"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder STT CROSSING LTD Disposes 3,300 Of GLOBAL CROSSING LTD >GLBC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GLBC"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: GLOBAL CROSSING LTD \bSYMBOL: GLBC \b \bFILER: STT CROSSING LTD \bTITLE: Beneficial Owner \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b2/27/07            Exercise-Dispose          3,300      $10.16         $33,528 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 12,783,145 (Direct) \b \b  * - Exercised 46 days after vesting and 6 years, 10 months before \b      expiration. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

As a percentage of revenues, SG&A costs declined to 18.4% from 19.8% last year, reflecting the impact of operating leverage with prior year acquisitions. Included in Selling, General and Administration costs is the management fee to PRT Management Inc (\"PMI\") for corporate management and administration. PMI is owned by current and former employees, officers and directors of PRT, and as such is a related party. Fees payable to PMI are determined based on reimbursement of PMI's actual costs without allowance for profit, and the terms of the agreement are disclosed in the notes to the Fund's financial statements. \b \bIn recent years the Fund expanded its business into the US, and had established nurseries in Oregon and Nevada to service customers in both markets. US sourced growing contracts currently exceed US growing capacity, resulting in a net foreign exchange exposure. To help further reduce this exposure, the company has created a natural currency hedge by financing US dollar assets with US dollar denominated debt. PRT may also use forward exchange contracts for this purpose. Accordingly, on net exposure the Company recorded a $25,000 exchange gain, mainly on the translation of US dollar debt. \b \bForeign currency exchange gains and losses may be realized or unrealized. The Fund records realized foreign exchange gains and losses on the translation of cash balances and settlements of monetary items, and records unrealized gains and losses on the translation of non-cash monetary balances. Only realized foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the determination of distributable cash flow. Management estimates for 2007 that the Fund's sensitivity to the Canadian/US dollar exchange rate is less than $0.005 in per unit distributable cash flow for every CA$0.01 change in relative value of the Canadian dollar. \b \bInterest expense for the year decreased by $0.2 million, primarily as a result of the retirement in December 2005 of borrowings made to finance nursery site acquisitions over the previous two years. These loans were repaid from the proceeds of a unit offering. In addition, the fund retired a further $2.5 million of term debt during 2005 from the proceeds of a property sale. \b \bDepreciation and amortization charges increased year-over-year due to the inclusion of results from the Pelton and Coldstream nursery sites for a full year. \b \bPRT has a 40% equity investment in a company involved in developing software for silviculture management by Forestry companies, and is using this software to electronically provide seedling contract information to its customers. The equity in loss of the investee is primarily created by amortization of intangible assets booked on the initial purchase, and therefore does not impact PRT's operating cash flow. \b \bEarnings in the prior period were boosted by a $0.5 million gain on the sale of the former Aldergrove nursery site. The proceeds of this sale were applied to reduce term debt during 2005. Gains of a similar extent were not incurred in the current period. \b \bPre-tax earnings in 2006 were $0.7 million higher, or $1.2 million higher excluding the impact of gains on sales of property, plant and equipment in each year. This improvement was mainly as a result of the contribution from acquisitions completed in 2005. \b \bThe Fund recorded a $0.9 million tax recovery for 2006, which was higher than the recovery in 2005 due to higher distributions to the Fund, the impact of reductions in future income tax rates, and recognition of tax assets not previously recorded. \b \bNet earnings for the year increased by nearly $1.4 million, but declined by $0.02 per Unit, to $0.77 per Unit on the greater number of units outstanding. Excluding the $0.04 per unit impact of the Aldergrove site disposal gain in 2005, per share earnings would have increased by $0.02 per unit. Operating contribution from the Pelton acquisition accounted for most of this improvement. \b \bThe Fund determines distributable cash flow as cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital items adjusted for seedling container depreciation, sustaining capital expenditures, long-term debt repayment, gains or losses on asset sales, and such other reserves as the board of PRT and the Trustees of the Fund may consider appropriate. Certain expense items which are incurred as part of earnings enhancing capital projects may be excluded from the determination of distributable cash flow if the overall project return meets internal investment hurdle rates to be eligible for funding from external sources, such as term debt or equity financing. The Fund considers distributable cash flow as defined to be a useful measure of the free cash flow from operations available for making unitholder distributions, as it is determined after providing for the maintenance and replacement of PRT's underlying asset base, as well as providing for the financing of expansionary project spending. \b \bThe Fund calculates distributable cash as follows: \b \b \bIn $000's except                     Three months ended         Year ended \b per unit amounts                           December 31        December 31 \b                                         2006      2005      2006     2005 \b                                     ------------------------------------- \bCash flow from \b operating activities                $ (2,689) $   (452) $ 13,063  $ 6,029 \bLess: changes in non-cash \b working capital items                 (5,533)   (3,562)    1,254   (3,583) \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                        2,844     3,110    11,809    9,612 \b \bCash flow adjustments: \bSeedling container depreciation          (436)     (406)   (1,547)  (1,159) \bRepayment of long term debt              (196)     (204)     (735)    (485) \bSustaining capital expenditures           (25)      (33)     (478)    (462) \bSustaining capital reserve                  -       (50)       50      (50) \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bDistributable cash                      2,187     2,417     9,099    7,456 \bSeasonal excess of cash flow \b to distributions declared, \b applied to working capital               (27)     (612)     (215)    (670) \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bDistributions declared               $  2,160  $  1,805  $  8,884  $ 6,786 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \bDistributable cash per unit          $   0.23  $   0.31  $   0.95  $  0.98 \b \bDistributions declared per unit      $   0.22  $   0.22  $   0.93  $  0.88 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b \bDistributable cash flow for the year was over $1.6 million higher than in 2005 as a consequence of improved cash flow from operations, which benefited from the combined impact of acquisitions and realized foreign exchange gains. In determining distributable cash in 2005, the Fund had allowed for an additional $50,000 in a sustaining capital reserve as a contingency against potential near term needs at the acquired Pelton nursery site. This reserve was utilized to partially fund current period sustaining capital spending. On a per unit basis, growth in distributable cash flow per unit was tempered by the higher number of units outstanding in 2006. Since the unit offering to refinance acquisitions was not done until the end of 2005, the Pelton acquisition had a disproportionately high per unit contribution last year. \b \bThree Months Ended December 31, 2006 compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2005 \b \bThe fourth quarter of 2005 included the operating results of PRT Pelton and PRT Coldstream, and accordingly is comparable in scale to the Company's operations in the fourth quarter of 2006. \b \bRevenues in the three month period decreased by $1.0 million relative to the same period last year. This was mainly caused by an increase in the relative mix of early season crops this year, which has the effect of shifting revenue recognition to earlier quarters. \b \bCosts of production were lower with the shift to earlier season crops, but increased as a percentage of revenues due to poor fall crop yields at two sites, and the timing of repairs and maintenance expenditures. \b \bOverhead costs were $0.2 million lower in the quarter, due to lower employee incentive compensation costs and the impact of capitalizing certain project development costs. \b \bFinancing costs decreased by $0.3 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis as PRT carried higher debt balances for most of the fourth quarter of 2005 related to borrowings to finance the Pelton and Coldstream nursery acquisitions. This debt was retired at the end of 2005 from the net proceeds of a $20,300,000 unit offering. \b \bDepreciation and amortization expenses were lower as a result of revisions to the preliminary estimated useful lives of assets acquired in the Pelton acquisition. \b \bThe Fund recorded a larger future income tax recovery in the quarter due to higher year-over-year tax deductible distribution payments made to Fund unitholders, the impact of reductions in future income tax rates and recognition of tax assets not previously recorded. \b \bNet earnings for the quarter increased by $0.5 million, due to the higher future income tax recovery provision, and but only increased by $0.02 per unit with the greater number of units outstanding. \b \bDistributable cash flow in the quarter decreased by $0.2 million on the shift in operating earnings to earlier quarters caused by the crop mix in 2006. On a per unit basis, distributable cash flow was $0.23 as compared to $0.31 in the fourth quarter of 2005, reflecting this shift as well as the greater number of units outstanding this year. \b \bLiquidity and Cash Flow \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:47 ET (11:47 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a99f135b62c3114a371f14f3c3b0b453","symR":["USU"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP NEUMANN Surrenders 1,850 Of USEC INC >USU","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["USU"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: USEC INC \bSYMBOL: USU \b \bFILER: NEUMANN E JOHN \bTITLE: Vice President \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b2/28/07            Surrender*                1,850      $14.19         $26,252 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 16,093 (Direct) \b \b  * - Insiders can surrender shares back to the company to pay taxes or cover \b      the cost of an option exercise. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

The centre can accommodate more than 300 new staff and forms a key part of a significant Research & Development (R&D) investment in the UK by Amgen. \b \u001d  Amgen's biotechnology medicines have already improved the lives of millions of patients worldwide suffering from cancer, kidney disease and other serious illnesses. As of the end of 2006, nearly 41,000 patients in 39 countries were enrolled in Amgen clinical trials. Uxbridge, together with Amgen's expanded Cambridge, UK facilities, will support the company's largest ever international clinical trial programme. In 2007, Amgen expects that approximately 55,000 patients will be enrolled in more than 250 clinical studies worldwide. More than half of those studies will be coordinated by UK-based R&D staff across 31 European countries. \b \u001d  Commenting on his opening of the European Development Centre in Uxbridge, the Prime Minister said, \"I am delighted that Amgen has chosen to locate its European Development Centre in the UK. The UK biotech industry is second only to the United States, and we lead Europe in this sector. Amgen's decision to locate here is another strong endorsement of our economy and our first-class research base. \b \u001d  \"This move will further strengthen our world leading capabilities in this area by providing highly skilled new jobs and delivering long term benefits for patients and for the National Health Service.\" \b \u001d  \"Uxbridge represents Amgen's largest R&D investment outside the United States,\" said Amgen's senior vice president and international chief medical officer, Willard Dere, M.D. \"This investment confirms the UK's position as a major worldwide scientific hub for the company. We chose London because of its excellent reputation for clinical research and pool of highly qualified and talented scientists.\" \b \u001d  Amgen's global R&D expansion is being driven by its robust pipeline. With over 45 molecules in development and an annual R&D budget of more than U.S. $3 billion, Amgen remains focused on the promise of meeting unmet medical needs for patients with serious illness. For example, Amgen recently won approval to market a new treatment for colorectal cancer in the U.S. In addition, Amgen is testing a potential treatment for a range of conditions including post-menopausal osteoporosis and cancer related bone disease. \b \u001d  \"Amgen's mission is to serve patients, and Uxbridge has a vital role to play in ensuring the company fulfills this mission,\" Dere said. \b \u001d  The official opening of the new facility by the Prime Minister demonstrates the UK Government's commitment to attracting more R&D investment with the aim of making the UK a world leader in biotechnology. \b \u001d  Jeremy Haigh, Ph.D., vice president and international chief operating officer, Research and Development, Amgen, said, \"The UK has a deserved reputation for scientific excellence and we are proud to be investing in the UK in this way. The talent is undoubtedly here, but it is vitally important that industry and Government work together to ensure that the supply of skills is responsive to the demands of the sector in the future.\" \b \b   About Amgen \b \u001d  Amgen discovers, develops and delivers innovative human therapeutics.

In 2004, we \b         entered into confidential discussions regarding a potential sale of \b         our company.   Discussions with one potential buyer, ended in 2005, \b         and we retained a $1 million fee paid to us by that party.  Such \b         amount is reflected in mergers, acquisitions and developments costs, \b         net, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005.  Adjusted EBITDA \b         is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because we believe \b         that it is 1) a widely used measure of operating performance in the \b         gaming industry, and 2) a principal basis for valuation of gaming \b         companies by certain investors.  We use property-level EBITDA \b         (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization \b         and corporate expense) as the primary measure of our business segment \b         properties' performance, including the evaluation of our operating \b         personnel.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative \b         to operating income, as an indicator of our operating performance, as \b         an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure \b         of liquidity, or as any other measure determined in accordance with \b         generally accepted accounting principles.  We have significant uses \b         of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments and \b         debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted \b         EBITDA.  Also, other gaming companies that report EBITDA or Adjusted \b         EBITDA may calculate it in a different manner than we do.  A \b         reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA is included in \b         the tables below in this release. \b \b    (2)  Adjusted EBITDA margins represent Adjusted EBITDA divided by Net \b         Revenues. \b \b \b \b    RIVIERA HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES \b    RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA: \b    (Amounts in thousands) \b \b                            Net      Interest \b                           Income     Income   Operating    Depre-    Asset \b                           (Loss)    & (Exp.)

Green Canyon 37, which is located in 1,800 feet of water, was originally drilled in 1996 and logged both gas and oil pay sands, but was not taken to development during a period of relatively low oil and gas prices. ATP acquired a 100% working interest in Garden Banks 388 and Garden Banks 187 at the Western Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale held August 16, 2006. Previous drilling at Garden Banks 388 encountered logged hydrocarbons. All of these properties are scheduled for development during the next three-year period. \b \b   2007 Gulf of Mexico Acquisitions \b \u001d  King's Peak/Canyon Express Hub -- On January 8, 2007, ATP expanded its King's Peak/Canyon Express Hub with the acquisition of a 50% working interest in MC 305 (\"Aconcagua\"), a 17% working interest in MC 348 (\"Camden Hills\"), and an additional 26% interest in the Canyon Express Pipeline Common System (\"Canyon Express\").

Block 49/12b is a high potential exploratory opportunity offsetting the company's Wenlock development. The exploratory well will be drilled from ATP's Wenlock platform, and if successful, will be immediately completed and placed on production. \b \b   Operations and Development \b \u001d  During 2006, ATP placed eight wells on production and achieved a 155% increase in production. Since the company's last operations update on January 10, 2007, ATP has placed three wells on production. January and February 2007 production averaged 172 MMcfe/d. ATP's current production is averaging approximately 210 MMcfe/d, and depending upon natural gas prices in the North Sea, ATP projects a first quarter exit rate of 200 to 250 MMcfe/d. One additional well is scheduled to commence production before the end of the first quarter 2007. By mid-2007, ATP intends to upgrade facilities capacity at MC 711 to approximately 200 MMcfe/d net as well as bring to production four additional wells in the Gulf of Mexico and U.K. North Sea. \b \b   Gulf of Mexico Deepwater \b \u001d  Gomez Hub (MC 711/667/668/754/755/800) -- ATP placed MC 711 on production on March 9, 2006. The property produced 21 Bcfe net through year-end 2006 from two wells located in the southern portion of the MC 711 block. The third well at Gomez, located in the northern portion of the MC 711 block, was completed during the third quarter 2006 and production commenced on March 1, 2007. Production from the third well will be gradually increased until total field production reaches 120 MMcfe/d net, the production capacity prior to upgrading the facilities. \b \u001d  ATP moved a drilling rig on location immediately following the acquisition of a 100% working interest in MC 755 (Anduin) on January 24, 2007. The drilling rig has encountered the productive reservoir and completion operations are underway. Anduin will be tied back to the ATP Innovator at MC 711 and is scheduled to be placed on production in mid-2007. The ATP Innovator is the company's first floating production system for its Hub concept in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea. The Hub concept provides ATP a competitive advantage within the area and allows the company to spread the costs of facilities over multiple properties. \b \u001d  Upon the successful completion of Anduin, ATP will also earn interests in two prospects: a 50% working interest in MC 754 and a 25% working interest in MC 800 (Gladden). Gladden is scheduled to be drilled later this year with MC 754 planned for 2008. As part of the purchase and sale agreement, ATP has agreed to process hydrocarbons from MC 754 and/or MC 800 starting in January 2009. \b \u001d  The next well planned for the Gomez Hub is the step out MC 667 #1 which will target possible gas-bearing sands at 11,500' true vertical depth and, if commercial, is scheduled to be placed on production in mid-2007. \b \u001d  Telemark Hub (MC 941/942 and Atwater Valley 63) -- Engineering and construction of a MinDOC system, ATP's second floating production facility, is underway with installation scheduled for mid-2008. The MinDOC hull design was selected over competing technologies because of higher variable load capacity and lower cost. Drilling will commence immediately after platform installation from a 2,000 hp platform rig. \b \u001d  Ladybug Hub (Garden Banks 409 and 410) -- Ladybug resumed production on February 13, 2007 from a new well drilled to an updip attic location and a previously behind pipe zone of an existing well. The field is currently producing 15 MMcfe/d net from two wells. \b \b   Gulf of Mexico Shelf \b \u001d  Development -- On the Gulf of Mexico Shelf during 2006, five wells were drilled, all of which were successful. Four of the wells located at West Cameron 663, High Island 74, South Marsh Island 233 and West Cameron 237 were completed and placed on production in 2006. The remaining well at South Timbalier 77 is expected to be placed on production in the first half of 2007. \b \u001d  South Timbalier (\"ST\") 77 -- The ST 77 exploratory well discovered commercial hydrocarbons at the 16,000' level. The well has been completed. The company is currently installing a platform and a 2-mile pipeline. First production is expected late first quarter 2007. ATP operates ST 77 with a 78% working interest. \b \u001d  Ship Shoal (\"SS\") 351 -- During the first quarter 2007, ATP completed the installation of a platform and commenced drilling the first of at least a two-well program. This property is scheduled for initial production in the second quarter 2007. ATP operates SS 351 with a 100% working interest. \b \b   North Sea \b \u001d  Tors (Kilmar & Garrow) -- The Garrow G1 well commenced production on February 20, 2007. The Tors field, including the Garrow G1 well and Kilmar K1 and K2 wells, is currently producing in excess of 50 MMcfe/d net. ATP intends to drill up to two more wells at its Tors field, including the third Kilmar well scheduled to spud in mid-2007. ATP operates the Tors field with an 85% working interest. \b \u001d  Wenlock -- The jacket and deck were installed in 2006. Installation of the 27-kilometer pipeline was completed in the first quarter 2007. The horizontal well is scheduled to spud in March 2007 and will target a 150-meter column of Rotliegend sandstone as well as an exploratory opportunity in an adjacent and upthrown fault block. First production is expected in the second quarter 2007. ATP operates Wenlock with a 100% working interest. \b \b   Capital Resources and Liquidity \b \u001d  The 2006 acquisitions along with the significant increase in proved reserves and proved developed reserves coupled with additional recoverable hydrocarbons identified by ATP and the increase in production allowed the company to complete three new financings in 2006. During the first quarter 2006, ATP issued $150.0 million of non-convertible perpetual preferred stock, which raised net proceeds of $145.5 million. The security did not have a stated maturity and accrued dividends at a rate of 12.5%. During the second quarter 2006, ATP amended and improved the terms of the company's Senior Secured Credit Facility by expanding it to $525.0 million and reducing the interest rate. Net of transaction costs, this amendment added $167.7 million in additional liquidity. \b \u001d  In the fourth quarter 2006, ATP redeemed all of its outstanding preferred shares by expanding the company's first lien term loan by $375.0 million, adding a new revolving credit facility of up to $50.0 million and adding a new second lien facility of $175.0 million. Subsequent to the closing, ATP had first lien debt of $898.7 million at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.5% with a maturity of April 14, 2010, an additional undrawn $50.0 million revolving credit facility with a rate of LIBOR plus 3.5% with a maturity of October 14, 2009, and a new second lien tranche of $175.0 million at a rate of LIBOR plus 4.75% with a maturity of October 14, 2010. The collateral package for these facilities is similar to the previous first lien facility. The new financing added $155.5 million in additional liquidity and reduced the overall cost of capital (preferred dividends plus interest) by approximately 200 basis points. \b \u001d  Cash flow from operating activities was $258.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $43.6 million in cash flow from operating activities for 2005. Cash flow from operating activities prior to changes in assets and liabilities (a non-GAAP measure frequently used by research analysts) was a record $266.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $67.9 million for the same period in 2005. A non-GAAP reconciliation is provided near the end of this press release. ATP had working capital at December 31, 2006 of $77.5 million, an increase of approximately $76.9 million from December 31, 2005. This increase is primarily attributable to fourth quarter 2006 financings discussed in the previous paragraph. \b \u001d  ATP had $182.6 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2006, compared to $65.6 million at December 31, 2005. Cash paid for acquisition and development activities for the year 2006 was $577.0 million, compared to $420.5 million in 2005. \b \b   2007 Operational and Financial Objectives \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:45 ET (08:45 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b5704e9a0d19af646fdfbd270119e3ac","symR":["34569.AE","MDIUY","MS.MI","IT0001063210","NL0000345692"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,0.9877863,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,0.9877863,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Mediaset Bd Member: Co Plans To Explain '06 Results To Mkt-2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["34569.AE","MDIUY","MS.MI","IT0001063210","NL0000345692"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","MOV","XDJGI","XMIB"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Mediaset Thursday said 2006 gross Italian advertising revenue was EUR2.85 billion, down from EUR2.96 billion in 2005. \u001d  That was below the company's previous forecast, which was for the 2006 number to be broadly in line with 2005. \u001d  The drop reflected the change in Mediaset's advertising bookings policy.

This was primarily due to invoicing and collection of 2005 year-end unbilled revenue balances, which were unusually high, and improved accounts receivable collections in the current year, partially offset by reductions in short-term accounts payable. Most of this additional cash was applied to reduce the operating line and make increased Unitholder distributions. \b \bCash distributions to Unitholders were $2.2 million higher than in 2005, due to the increase in the average number of units outstanding over the year, as well as a $0.05 increase in per unit distributions during 2006. Distributions declared during 2006 totalled $0.93 per unit, including a $0.03 \"top-up\" distribution from 2005 cash flow, as compared to $0.88 in 2005, which did not include a \"top-up\" distribution. Of this amount, $0.87 was designated as a return on capital and $0.06 as a return of capital for Canadian income tax purposes. As distributions declared from current year cash flow were less than the $0.95 per unit generated by operations in 2006, on February 27, 2007 the Fund declared an additional \"top up\" distribution of $0.03 per unit, funded from 2006 distributable cash flow. \b \bWith improved cash flow from operating activities, the Company was able to reduce its operating line balance by $0.8 million. PRT has up to $13,000,000 available under this facility, subject to certain margin requirements. At year-end, the full amount was available and $9.4 million had been drawn. \b \bDuring the year, PRT purchased property, plant and equipment totalling $2.6 million, a decrease of $0.5 million from the prior year (excluding acquisitions). The Company categorizes its capital purchases as follows: \b \b \b \b=---------------------------------------------------------- \bCapital Spending                           2006        2005 \b=---------------------------------------------------------- \b \bEarnings-enhancing capital projects $   539,274 $ 1,639,006 \b=---------------------------------------------------------- \bSustaining capital projects             478,067     461,818 \b=---------------------------------------------------------- \bSeedling containers                   1,549,522   1,014,824 \b=---------------------------------------------------------- \bTotal                               $ 2,566,863 $ 3,115,648 \b=---------------------------------------------------------- \b=---------------------------------------------------------- \b \b \bThe Fund determines its purchase breakdown between \"sustaining\" and \"earnings enhancing\" capital expenditures on a transaction by transaction basis. The consideration is whether the asset purchased replaces productive capacity which previously existed in PRT (\"sustaining\"), or whether the asset expenditure is being made to enhance future earnings, either through increased revenue potential or by lowering operating costs (\"earnings enhancing\"). Certain rate-of-return benchmarks are applied to the evaluation of earnings enhancing capital projects, and if these are not expected to be achieved then the Fund considers the expenditure to be sustaining. Sustaining capital expenditures are typically less than depreciation charges due to the long life nature of greenhouse assets, and the Company's strategy to improve returns on capital by moving production into lower capital cost growing facilities. \b \bSignificant earnings enhancing capital projects during the year included expansion of specialized growing facilities for clonal seedling production, expansion of outdoor growing compounds, and investments in energy-efficient heating systems. In the prior year, earnings-enhancing capital expenditures were mainly attributable to expansion of outdoor growing compounds, and various investments in cost-saving production automation equipment. \b \bSustaining capital spending is financed from operating cash flow, while the replacement of seedling containers is financed from cash reserves created specifically for this purpose from distributable cash. Earnings-enhancing capital is generally financed from draws against the Company's bank term debt facilities. Only earnings-enhancing investments are financed from the Company's term debt facilities. PRT has up to $22.3 million available under these facilities, subject to meeting certain covenants, of which $15.1 million remained available at year-end to finance expansionary capital spending. \b \b \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                                Payments Due by Period - $ \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bContractual Obligations      Total Less than     1 - 3     4 - 5     After \b                                      1 Year     years     years   5 years \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bLong Term Debt           7,177,770   904,589 2,530,269 3,425,969   316,943 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bOperating Leases         6,224,763   902,544 1,512,905 1,276,968 2,532,346 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bOther                      648,737   648,737         -         -         - \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \bTotal Contractual \b Obligations            14,051,270 2,455,870 4,043,174 4,702,937 2,849,289 \b \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b \bDuring the year the fund reduced $1.1 million of term debt through scheduled amortization payments. PRT's facilities are generally set up to amortize over a 10 year period, as forest seedling production facilities are typically long-life assets. In 2005, in addition to scheduled amortization, the company applied $2.5 million of the proceeds from the sale of its former Aldergrove, BC nursery site to reduce bank debt that year. In December 2005, the Fund issued 2,000,000 new Trust Units at an issue price of $10.15 per unit. The net proceeds of the offering were $18.9 million, and these were applied to partially retire term debt taken out to finance acquisitions and other capital expenditures. \b \bOver the past three years the Fund has completed the following acquisitions: \b \b- In July 2004, PRT completed an acquisition of H.N. Hybrid Nurseries Ltd., a forest seedling nursery in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia. This facility had a gross purchase price of $6.8 million inclusive of working capital, and was financed through a combination of equity placed with the vendor, term debt, and vendor financing. The vendor financing was refinanced with term debt in 2005. \b \b- In June 2005, PRT purchased Coldstream Nursery Ltd., an open compound forest seedling nursery in the Okanagan region of British Columbia. The acquisition was completed for a gross purchase price of $1.6 million inclusive of working capital, and was financed through a combination of term debt and vendor holdbacks. \b \b- In October 2005, PRT purchased Pelton Reforestation Ltd., a large forest seedling nursery located in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia. This nursery has approximately 40% of its production in open compounds, with the balance in greenhouse production. The acquisition was completed for a gross purchase price of $19.3 million inclusive of working capital and related costs, and was financed with term debt and operating debt. \b \bAll of the above transactions were consistent with the Fund's strategies to consolidate production in the forest seedling industry, and to invest in growing facilities in warmer climate areas to reduce heating costs. \b \bThree Months Ended December 31, 2006 compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2005 \b \bCash flow from operating activities was a $2.7 million deficit versus a deficit of $0.5 million in the prior year quarter, a decrease of $2.2 million. This was due to the higher short term trade payable balances in the previous year which supported cash flow in that period. \b \bDistributions per trust unit during the fourth quarter were higher, at $0.225 versus $0.219 in 2005. This change resulted from an increase in the base monthly distribution announced early in 2006. Total distributions were $0.5 million higher, related to the higher number of units outstanding this year. \b \bPRT incurred $0.2 million in capital spending in the quarter, as compared to $0.3 million in 2005. This was primarily related to completion of earnings enhancing capital projects. Part of this capital spending has been temporarily financed from the Fund's operating line, which will be refinanced with term debt in 2007. \b \bThe Pelton acquisition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 and consumed $17.8 million of cash resources, exclusive of cash included in the company at the closing date. \b \bThere were no term debt drawings during the quarter, but drawings in the prior year quarter totalled $18.4 million, primarily to finance the Pelton acquisition. This debt was retired with the proceeds of the 2,000,000 Unit offering in December, 2005. \b \bFinancial Position \b \bAt December 31, 2006, working capital was $3.4 million compared to $3.6 million at the end of 2005, a decrease of $0.2 million. This change was largely attributable to using short term sources to temporarily fund earnings-enhancing capital expenditures during the year, partially offset by the excess of current year distributable cash flow over distributions declared. The Fund's working capital position remains adequate relative to its operating needs. \b \bProperty, plant and equipment totaled $48.2 million at December 31, 2006, a decrease from the prior year due to depreciation charges exceeding capital spending. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:48 ET (11:48 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b65ea5e3d0b60be316ab21762ed5fe72","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","OHB.XE","DE0005936124","NL0000235190"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Airbus Site In Varel Back In Operation Monday -Works Council","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","OHB.XE","DE0005936124","NL0000235190"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","CMT","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XMDAX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:05 ET (12:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b6c16be95f867f33a4ad8980bf900948","symR":["NESN.VX","NSRGY","URC.PH","CH0012056047","PHY9297P1004"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,0.9801774,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.001565,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Nestle Waters Philippines Sells Assets, Brand To URC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T09:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NESN.VX","NSRGY","URC.PH","CH0012056047","PHY9297P1004"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI","XGTI","XSMI","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MANILA (Dow Jones)--Nestle Waters Philippines Friday said it has agreed to sell its manufacturing assets and one of its bottled water trademarks to Universal Robina Corp.

Funds tracked by HFR's HFRX Macro Index were down 3.1% Tuesday, making it their worst one-day performance since the index started in March 2003, and putting the index down 1.36% for 2007. \u001d  These kinds of funds take bets on broad economic trends through fixed income, currency, equity and commodity markets and are known for their volatile returns. \u001d  Ken Heinz, HFR's president, said systematic trading funds that use computer-generated signals to buy and sell securities were the worst performers in the macro set, while discretionary macro funds relying on their managers' decisions weren't as badly hit. \u001d  \"This is an environment where hedge fund managers have an opportunity to differentiate themselves and perform well under more-volatile conditions that haven't been there for the last year and even longer,\" Heinz said. \u001d  Market directional funds tracked by HFR for the HFRX index lost 2.6% Tuesday and are now up just 0.8% in 2007. Equity long/short funds that take both long and short positions in stocks lost 1.8% on the day, putting them flat on the month and up 1.5% for the year. \u001d  The HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index across all strategies is up 1.67% in 2007 after losing 1.37% Tuesday. Wednesday's numbers won't be released until Friday. \u001d  Meanwhile, the net asset value per share of MW TOPS Ltd. (TOPSE.AE), an investment company listed on Euronext Amsterdam that invests in equities strategies run by hedge-fund group Marshall Wace LLP, lost all of its February gains from the selloff in equities Tuesday and Wednesday. \u001d  NAV on its euro shares, which reflects the value of the company's underlying investments, was estimated at EUR10.09 Wednesday, the same level as on Jan. 31. NAV had been EUR10.31 on Monday. Shares in the company closed Thursday at EUR9.95, down 0.4% on the day. \u001d  London-based Marshall Wace is one of Europe's largest hedge-fund groups, with $11.5 billion under management. About $2.2 billion of that total is run on behalf of MW TOPS. About 60% of Marshall Wace's assets are invested in its TOPS trading system, which bases its decisions to buy or sell stocks on tips received from brokers. \u001d  Prime brokers, who help hedge funds finance their trades among other services, Thursday said they haven't taken any widespread measures to tighten lending criteria or increase margin requirements. \u001d  \"The kind of turbulence we've been seeing the last couple of days is not at a level of threatening any of the funds on our books. People need to remember we've had a very long run-up and this is a slight retrenchment so there is no reason to be unduly concerned,\" said a risk manager at a prime brokerage of a U.S. bank in London. \u001d  \"The last couple of days have shaken out people who were a little exuberant and they have taken risk off the table before they are put in a position where they have to do it. It is a useful fire drill for the banks to see how we handle stressful situations,\" he added. \b \u001d  -By Margot Patrick, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9451; margot.patrick@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:19 ET (08:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b7b2d9940a4e28250a94febfa8b7ca22","symR":["NVA.T","CA67072Q1046"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Nuvista Energy Ltd.

The exploitation and development program anticipates that NuVista will participate in 140-160 new wells. To date in 2007, NuVista had an active first quarter and is on track to participate in 40-45 wells. \b \bNuVista's current production guidance of between 14,300 to 14,900 boe/d for 2007 remains on track with the implementation of our planned capital program. Based upon the current commodity price assumptions of $US8.00 per mmbtu Nymex for natural gas and $US60 WTI for crude oil, NuVista is forecasting funds from operations of $135 million to $145 million for 2007. NuVista controls over 95% of our planned capital program and will monitor the capital program based upon acquisition opportunities and commodity prices. \b \bMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \b \bManagement's discussion and analysis (\"MD&A\") of financial conditions and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the interim consolidated financial statements for the three months and year ended December 31, 2006 and NuVista's audited consolidated financial statements and MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2005. The following MD&A of financial condition and results of operations was prepared at, and is dated, March 1, 2007. Our audited consolidated financial statements, current annual information form and other disclosure documents are filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, and other corporate documentation can be obtained from our website at www.nuvistaenergy.com. \b \bBasis of Presentation - The financial data presented below has been prepared in accordance with Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). The reporting and the measurement currency is the Canadian dollar. For the purpose of calculating unit costs, natural gas is converted to a barrel of oil equivalent (\"boe\") using six thousand cubic feet of natural gas equal to one barrel of oil unless otherwise stated. \b \bForward-Looking Statements - Certain information set forth in this document, including management's assessment of NuVista's future plans and operations, contains forward-looking statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond NuVista's control, including the impact of general economic conditions, industry conditions, volatility of commodity prices, currency fluctuations, imprecision of reserve estimates, environmental risks, competition from other industry participants, the lack of availability of qualified personnel or management and services, stock market volatility and ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources. Readers are cautioned that the assumptions used in the preparation of such information, although considered reasonable at the time of preparation, may prove to be imprecise and, as such, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. NuVista's actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements, or if any of them do so, what benefits that NuVista will derive therefrom. NuVista disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. \b \bNon-GAAP Measurements - Within Management's discussion and analysis, references are made to terms commonly used in the oil and gas industry. Management uses funds from operations to analyze operating performance and leverage. Funds from operations as presented does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by Canadian GAAP and therefore it may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities. Funds from operations as presented is not intended to represent operating cash flow or operating profits for the period nor should it be viewed as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities, net income or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with Canadian GAAP. All references to funds from operations throughout this report are based on cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital and abandonment expenditures. Funds from operations per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of net income per share. Total boe is calculated by multiplying the daily production by the number of days in the period. Management uses these terms to analyze operating performance and leverage. \b \bOperating activities - During the fourth quarter of 2006, NuVista participated in 48 wells with an average working interest of 77% operating 44 of these wells. The success rate of 79% in this drilling program resulted in 30 natural gas wells and 8 oil wells. For the year ended December 31, 2006, NuVista drilled 159 (126.2 net) wells, operating 143, resulting in 103 natural gas wells, 28 oil wells and 28 dry holes. NuVista has commenced its 2007 first quarter drilling program of 40 to 45 wells, participating in 24 wells. \b \bReserves - NuVista's 2006 year end total proved reserves were 24.4 mmboe or a 16% increase over the closing balance at year end 2005. NuVista's proved plus probable reserves increased by 24% to 33.4 mmboe when compared to the equivalent opening balance of 27.0 mmboe at year end 2005. Finding, development and acquisition costs in 2006, including an adjustment for future capital and after revisions, amounted to $27.60 per barrel of oil equivalent on a proved basis and $20.00 per barrel of oil equivalent on a proved plus probable basis. 2006 finding and development costs, on a proved plus probable basis, for exploitation and development activities were $17.85/boe and the cost of NuVista's strategic acquisition in Saskatchewan was $24.19/boe. The capital program for 2006 resulted in a funds from operations netback recycle ratio of 1.2:1 on a proved plus probable basis. NuVista's reserve life index based upon production at December 31, 2006 was 5.0 years on total proved reserves and 6.9 years for proved plus probable reserves. This compares with 5.0 years and 6.5 years respectively at December 31, 2005. All of NuVista's reserves as at December 31, 2006, were evaluated by NuVista's independent engineering consultants, GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd. \b \bThe following table outlines NuVista's finding, development and acquisition costs and recycle ratios for 2006 and from commencement of operations in July 2003: \b \b \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                      2006               Since July 2003 \b                         --------------------------  ---------------------- \b                                       Proved plus             Proved plus \b($/boe)                        Proved     Probable     Proved     Probable \b \bFinding, development and \b acquisition cost(1)            27.60        20.00      19.32        15.44 \bFinding and development \b costs(1)                       24.36        17.85      19.02        14.92 \bAcquisition costs               34.09        24.19      19.58        15.91 \b \bFinding, development and \b acquisition recycle ratio \b Field netback                    1.0          1.3 \b Funds from operations netback    0.9          1.2 \b \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b(1) Including changes in future capital expenditures. \b \b \bAdditional reserve disclosure tables, as required under NI 51-101, will be contained in the Annual Information Form to be filed on SEDAR on or before March 31, 2007.

At 0815 GMT Gallaher shares were down 1 pence, or 0.1%, at 1129 pence in a higher London market. Japan Tobacco's bid is pitched at 1140 pence a share. \u001d  Cigarette volumes grew 5.0% during the year, with the company's key strategic brands growing 9.7%. The strategic brands include Sobranie, Sovereign, Memphis, LD and Ronson.    The company said that strong performances from the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, markets, together with robust trading in its core U.K. and Irish markets, compensated for weak trading in other European markets, and increased investment elsewhere. \u001d  In the CIS, Ebita rose 25.7% to GBP85 million with an increase in operating costs partly offsetting rising sales. Volumes in the region rose 2.8%, with Gallaher gaining market share in Kazakhstan and Ukraine despite price increases across the region. \u001d  The uptrading to premium brands in the region continued with volumes of strategic brands growing 20.8%m, the company said. \u001d  Gallaher's U.K. volumes fell 3.4% in the period, though it grew its share of a declining market to 38.7% from 38.6%. Ebita in the U.K. grew 2.2% to GBP317 million. \u001d  The company described its performance in Europe as \"robust in spite of challenging conditions.\" Europe Ebita  rose 1.9% to GBP263 million, benefitting from price increases and lower operating costs. \u001d  Profit in the rest of the World divisions dropped to GBP27 million from GBP34 million, with an 18.9% fall in the second half as it suffered from challenging market conditions in Poland and increased sales and marketing investment. It was also hit by adverse phasing of trade sales in Sweden as customers had stocked up ahead of price increases. \u001d  The company's shareholders have a chance to vote on the Japan Tobacco offer on March 9 but there is little chance now of the bid failing. The takeover is expected to complete on April 18. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.gallaher-group.com \b \u001d  -By Michael Carolan, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9278; michael.carolan@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b7fddfa4ad22bf65c368c95c7d64837e","symR":["ROP"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9835632],"ret5":[0.9831853],"Headline":"Roper Industries Upped To Outperform From Mkt Perform At FBR","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T08:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ROP"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:04 ET (08:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b82ff52bae008c85b3ad9d1dd88dfe03","symR":["RWE.XE","RWEOY","DE0007037129"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,0.9756703,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,0.9915591,-0.00099],"Headline":"German Govt To Rule On RWE Biblis Plant Lifespan Within 2 Wks","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RWE.XE","RWEOY","DE0007037129"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","MUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BERLIN (Dow Jones)--The German environmental ministry had made its decision about RWE AG's (RWE.XE) application to extent the life span of its power plant Biblis A and will inform the utility about the outcome within the next two weeks, an environmental ministry spokesman said Friday. \u001d  \"We will inform the applicant (RWE) in the near term,\" said the ministry's spokesman, adding this will be probably within the next two weeks once the economics ministry and the chancellor have looked at its recommendation. \u001d  He declined to say what the ministry decided. \u001d  Earlier Friday, Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper said the environmental ministry decided against extending Biblis' life span.

The new M41T83 and M41T93 RTCs, in embedded-crystal packages, are pre-calibrated to plus or minus 5ppm, delivering a new level of accuracy to users of time-of-day clock and calendar devices. Using a one-time programmable (OTP) register, ST trims the internal load capacitance of the 32.768 kHz on-chip oscillator during factory test, ensuring that the parts are accurate to within 12 seconds per month. \b \u001d  Apart from the serial interfaces, these two new devices share the same specifications: the M41T83 includes a 400 kHz I2C interface, while the M41T93 uses a 10 MHz SPI bus, the world's first RTC to operate at this speed. The parts introduce a number of advanced timekeeping features including analog calibration, a programmable auto-reload counter/timer, and dual alarms. \b \u001d  In addition to the factory-programmed register, an additional analog calibration register is included which allows the user to override the factory calibration settings.  This can be beneficial to adjust for the ambient temperature or to compensate for the effects of stray capacitance on the board. This second register is also needed in applications using the crystal-less QFN16 package option. Oscillator adjustments appear immediately in the test output to give instantaneous feedback to the user. \b \u001d  The auto-reload counter/timer can be used with one of four user-selectable source clocks to generate timing waveforms and to provide periodic processor interrupts. The dual programmable alarms output on separate pins for applications requiring multiple alarm times. \b \u001d  Both devices include an on-board precision voltage reference which exactly defines the threshold for the automatic back-up switchover circuit. The RTCs' low 450nA backup current (typical) makes them suitable for capacitor-backed applications as well as for battery backup, and with ST's low-power process technology, accurate timekeeping is ensured down to 1.8V. A built-in battery monitor checks the back-up voltage and indicates when the battery should be replaced. \b \u001d  Other features include 12 bytes of NVRAM, and an oscillator-fail detection circuit which sets a bit if the oscillator drops more than three pulses, indicating that the back-up voltage might have fallen low enough to affect timekeeping -- a situation that might occur during brownout in capacitor-backed applications. A programmable square-wave generator and a watchdog are also included. \b \u001d  When Vcc fails and the device automatically switches to backup, it generates a Reset signal which is held for 200ms after power is restored. This Power-on Reset/Low-Voltage Detect function can save the designer from needing a separate Reset IC on the board. Three voltage levels are available for the switchover and reset thresholds (nominally 2.93V, 2.63V and 2.32V) which are specified in the part number when ordering. In addition to the pre-calibrated embedded crystal package, the M41T83 and M41T93 are also available in ST's space saving, low-cost 4mm x 4mm QFN16 package for use with an external crystal. \b \u001d  For cost-sensitive applications that nevertheless require mid-range real-time clock features, the low-cost M41T82 variant offers a reduced feature set of the M41T83. It eliminates the watchdog, square-wave generator and alarms, but retains the 400kHz I2C interface, analog user calibration, precision switchover reference, battery monitor, 12 bytes of NVRAM and reset output, and is supplied in a small footprint, low-cost 8-lead SOIC. \b \u001d  The M41T82, M41T83 and M41T93 are all sampling now with volume production slated for March 2007. The M41T82 is priced at $0.70 in volume. The M41T83/93 in the QFN package will start at $0.90, and the factory calibrated embedded crystal versions are $1.20 in volume. \b \b    Additional information is available at http://www.st.com/rtc \b \u001d  This press release is also available at http://www.st.com/stonline/stappl/press/news/year2007/p2088.htm ... with links to further information on the M41T82, M41T83 and M41T93 \b \b    About STMicroelectronics \b \u001d  STMicroelectronics is a global leader in developing and delivering semiconductor solutions across the spectrum of microelectronics applications.

Sebivo will be available in China from April. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, selling under the brand name Tyzeka in the U.S., in October last year. \u001d  As many as 350 million people worldwide are infected with the hepatitis B virus, of whom more than 100 million people live in China, where the virus is considered to be a leading cause of death, Novartis said. \u001d  \"Chronic hepatitis B is a major health problem in China, and through treatment, we aim to prevent the progression of the disease by getting the viral load to as low a level as possible,\" said Jidong Jia, Director of the Liver Research Center at the  Beijing Friendship Hospital, an investigator on two of the company-sponsored studies of Sebivo. \u001d  Analysts caution that treatment of hepatitis B isn't very widespread because only up to 15% of people infected with the virus develop chronic liver disease. What's more, cheap older treatments are available, although they often have more severe side effects than newer drugs, such as Sebivo. \u001d  \"The potential market is huge,\" said pharmaceutical analyst Denise Anderson in Zurich, who has a reduce rating on Novartis. \"However, the availability of cheap drugs as well as a number of recently-launched new products combined with the purchasing power for most Chinese will likely limit sales in that market.\" \u001d  She expects the drug to generate worldwide sales of $220 million by 2010. \u001d  At 0920 GMT, Novartis shares were up CHF0.25, or 0.4%, at CHF67.55, in line with the broader market. The stock has underperformed its sector so far this year, having fallen 4.2%, while the sector as a whole, as measured by the MSCI Pharmaceuticals, has declined 0.5%. \u001d  Sebivo is the first drug from Novartis' emerging portfolio of anti-infective drugs, which appears set to become an important new therapy area for the Swiss drugmaker, said Karl Heinz Koch, pharmaceutical analyst at Swiss private bank Vontobel. \u001d  He estimates that Sebivo will generate sales of around $164 million in 2011, but says that all of the company's investigational anti-infective drugs together could achieve sales of several billion dollars over time. \u001d  Novartis is developing treatments for hepatitis C - which is more severe than hepatitis B and more widespread in the cash-rich West - and antifungal drugs as well as antibiotics. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.novartis.com \u001d  -By Anita Greil, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 8044 ; anita.greil@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 04:29 ET (09:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"be575e077c2d0be8ff75f464819acd8a","symR":["CS","CSGN.VX","GS","JPM","NIN.YY","CH0012138530","US46625H1005"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9900744,-0.00099,0.9710226,0.9865117,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.010072,-0.00099,1.017172,0.9690807,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"NIBC To Seek Listing On Euronext, FY Net Pft +82%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CS","CSGN.VX","GS","JPM","NIN.YY","CH0012138530","US46625H1005"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","SCR","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSMI","XSP5","XST5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Nicolas Parasie \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--Merchant bank NIBC (NIN.YY) Friday said it will seek an initial public offering on Euronext Amsterdam in the coming months, as it reported a sharp rise in full-year net profit. \u001d  \"A listing will provide NIBC with strategic and financial flexibility to fund growth, both organically and through potential acquisitions, via permanent access to the capital markets,\" NIBC said in a statement. \u001d  The joint bookrunners will be ABN AMRO Rothschild (ABN), Goldman Sachs (GS), Credit Suisse (CS) and JPMorgan (JPM).

Sebivo will be available in China from April. \u001d  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, selling under the brand name Tyzeka in the U.S., in October last year. \u001d  As many as 350 million people worldwide are infected with the hepatitis B virus, of whom more than 100 million people live in China, where the virus is considered to be a leading cause of death, Novartis said. \u001d  \"Chronic hepatitis B is a major health problem in China, and through treatment, we aim to prevent the progression of the disease by getting the viral load to as low a level as possible,\" said Jidong Jia, Director of the Liver Research Center at the  Beijing Friendship Hospital, an investigator on two of the company-sponsored studies of Sebivo. \u001d  Analysts caution that treatment of hepatitis B isn't very widespread because only up to 15% of people infected with the virus develop chronic liver disease. What's more, cheap older treatments are available, although they often have more severe side effects than newer drugs, such as Sebivo. \u001d  \"The potential market is huge,\" said pharmaceutical analyst Denise Anderson in Zurich, who has a reduce rating on Novartis. \"However, the availability of cheap drugs as well as a number of recently-launched new products combined with the purchasing power for most Chinese will likely limit sales in that market.\" \u001d  She expects the drug to generate worldwide sales of $220 million by 2010. \u001d  Novartis is selling Sebivo jointly with Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. (IDIX) in the U.S. and several European countries. Novartis has the exclusive right to sell the drug in the rest of the world, including China. \u001d  At 0955 GMT, Novartis shares were up CHF0.05, or 0.1%, at CHF67.35, in line with the broader market. The stock has underperformed its sector so far this year, having fallen 4.2%, while the sector as a whole, as measured by the MSCI Pharmaceuticals, has declined 0.5%. \u001d  Sebivo is the first drug from Novartis' emerging portfolio of anti-infective drugs, which appears set to become an important new therapy area for the Swiss drugmaker, said Karl Heinz Koch, pharmaceutical analyst at Swiss private bank Vontobel. \u001d  He estimates that Sebivo will generate sales of around $164 million in 2011, but says that all of the company's investigational anti-infective drugs together could achieve sales of several billion dollars over time. \u001d  Novartis is developing treatments for hepatitis C - which is more severe than hepatitis B and more widespread in the cash-rich West - and antifungal drugs as well as antibiotics. \b \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.novartis.com \b \u001d  -By Anita Greil, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 8044 ; anita.greil@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 05:01 ET (10:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bfb2b06c7b48b1f4caaa41f624220638","symR":["METH"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Methode Electronics, Inc.

(Nasdaq:METH), a global manufacturer of electronic component and subsystem devices, today announced operating results for the quarter ended January 27, 2007, which is the third quarter of the 2007 fiscal year. \b \u001d  Methode reported third quarter fiscal 2007 net sales of $105.4 million, and net income of $4.7 million, or $0.13 per share. This compares with net sales of $95.1 million and net income of $2.8 million, or $0.08 per share in the third quarter of the 2006 fiscal year. In the first nine months of fiscal 2007, net sales were $317.5 million, compared to $305.3 million from the same period in the last fiscal year. Net income was $14.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2007, or $0.38 per share, compared to $12.8 million, or $0.35 per share in the 2006 fiscal year. \b \u001d  Included in the third quarter and first nine-months of fiscal 2007 is a $1.9 million charge both before and after taxes, or $0.05 per share, related to the cost of closing Methode's Scotland plant and transferring automotive manufacturing to its Malta facility. \b \u001d  The increase in net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2007 is primarily due to improved sales of power distribution products, fiber optic installations and automotive products in Europe and Asia. \b \u001d  For the third quarter of fiscal 2007, cost of products sold, as a percent of sales, decreased to 81.0 percent from 82.1 percent in the prior-year period. This primarily reflects improvement at Methode's Shanghai operation, which operated profitably, in the third quarter. \b \u001d  Cost of products sold, as a percent of sales, in the nine-month period of fiscal 2007 was 81.4 percent compared to 80.8 percent in the nine-month period of fiscal 2006. The increase is predominately due to automotive volume erosion due to production cutbacks and the unprofitable status in our Shanghai operations during the first half of the year. \b \u001d  For the third quarter of fiscal 2007, selling and administrative expense, as a percent of sales, was 12.2 percent, compared to 13.4 percent in last year's third quarter. Stock-based compensation costs for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were higher as more stock-based compensation was subject to variable accounting prior to adoption of FAS123R, and Methode's stock price increased during the quarter. \b \u001d  For the first nine months of fiscal 2007, selling and administrative expense, as a percent of sales was 12.6 percent compared to 13.6 percent last year. In the first nine months of fiscal 2007, stock based compensation costs were higher because an additional tranche of restricted stock awards was granted as Methode entered the third year of its restricted stock award program. In the first nine months of fiscal 2006, Methode reported a higher than normal selling and administrative expense, due to the bad debt provision of $3.2 million, $2.1 million net of tax, for receivables deemed impaired due to the bankruptcy of the U.S. subsidiaries of Delphi Corporation. \b \u001d  Donald W. Duda, President and Chief Executive Officer for Methode Electronics said, \"Solid business growth in our power distribution and fiber-optics products and automotive products in Europe and Asia helped offset continued erosion from our traditional Detroit automotive OEM customers.\" Mr. Duda continued, \"Last year we set a goal to reach profitability at our China operations and to resolve inefficiencies associated at our Scotland automotive plant. Today, I am pleased to say that each of Methode's businesses operating out of China was profitable in the third quarter. In addition, we transferred manufacturing from Scotland integrating production into our Malta facility, to realize improved operational efficiencies going forward.\" \b \u001d  On March 1, 2007, Methode announced the acquisition of TouchSensor Technologies for $65 million in cash and assumed liabilities. Methode will include TouchSensor's operations for the months of March and April in its 2007 fiscal year. Including TouchSensor, Methode expects to achieve fiscal year 2007 sales results between $430.0 million and $440.0 million. Fiscal year 2007 earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.55, which reflects an expected full-year $0.06 per share restructuring charge for the closure of Methode's Scotland facility and modest dilution from the TouchSensor acquisition. \b \b   Conference Call \b \u001d  As previously announced, the Company will conduct a conference call led by its President and Chief Executive Officer, Donald W. Duda, and Chief Financial Officer, Douglas A. Koman, on March 2, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time.

Our business is highly dependent upon three large automotive customers and specific makes and models of automobiles. The Company's results will be subject to many of the same risks that apply to the automotive, computer, telecommunication and appliance industries, such as general economic conditions, interest rates, consumer spending patterns and technological changes. Other factors, which may result in materially different results for future periods, include significant customer bankruptcy filings; restructuring, operational improvement and cost reduction programs currently under review by Methode; the current macroeconomic environment, including higher petroleum and copper prices affecting material and components used by Methode; potential manufacturing plant closures by automotive customers; potential strikes at automotive customers; and significant fluctuations in the demand for certain automobile models. In addition, market growth, operating costs, currency exchange rates and devaluations, delays in development, production and marketing of new products and other factors set forth from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, impact our business. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

Some factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include: the potential consequences of the findings announced on October 15, 2006 of the investigation by an Independent Committee of directors of our stock option programs (including the consequences of our determination that the Company's financial statements for the years ended 1994 to 2005, the interim periods contained therein, the quarter ended March 31, 2006 and all earnings and news releases, including for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006, and similar communications issued by the Company for such periods and the related reports of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm should not be relied upon, the consequences of the resulting restatement of our financial statements for those periods, and delays in filing our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the second and third quarters of 2006), related governmental reviews, including a formal investigation by the SEC, and review by the IRS, U.S. Congressional committees, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and Minnesota Attorney General, a related review by the Special Litigation Committee of the Company, and related shareholder derivative actions, shareholder demands and purported securities and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) class actions, the resolution of matters currently subject to an injunction issued by the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, a purported notice of acceleration with respect to certain of the Company's debt securities based upon an alleged event of default under the indenture governing such securities, and recent management and director changes, and the potential impact of each of these matters on our business, credit ratings and debt; increases in health care costs that are higher than we anticipated in establishing our premium rates, including increased consumption of or costs of medical services; heightened competition as a result of new entrants into our market, and consolidation of health care companies and suppliers; events that may negatively affect our contract with AARP; uncertainties regarding changes in Medicare, including coordination of information systems and accuracy of certain assumptions; funding risks with respect to revenues received from Medicare and Medicaid programs; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with increased litigation, legislative activity and government regulation and review of our industry; our ability to execute contracts on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, which could result in the loss of existing customers, difficulties in attracting new customers, difficulties in determining medical costs estimates and appropriate pricing, customer and physician and health care provider disputes, regulatory violations, increases in operating costs, or other adverse consequences; possible impairment of the value of our intangible assets if future results do not adequately support goodwill and intangible assets recorded for businesses that we acquire; potential noncompliance by our business associates with patient privacy data; misappropriation of our proprietary technology; and anticipated benefits of acquiring PacifiCare that may not be realized. \b \u001d  This list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. A further list and description of some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.

Wednesday's reaction to the previous day's carnage was underwhelming - the Dow Jones Industrials gained a mere 52.4 points, or 0.4%, after a 416-point plunge a day before - making it look more like a \"dead cat bounce\" than a confident recovery. The Dow then fell more than 200 points at the open Thursday before recovering in the wake of encouraging data from the Institute for Supply Management. \u001d  \"It's classic testing of the panic low. We could be setting up for a pretty big rebound,\" said Goepfert. \u001d  The tepid recovery Wednesday left plenty of uncertainty in the air though. \u001d  \"I think what happened in psychological terms is that everyone was caught out Tuesday (and) I guess the concern was that we didn't recoup all the losses,\" said Shamik Dhar, a director of Fathom Financial Consulting in London. \u001d  But Dhar said that, while some asset classes may fall out of favor for a longer time, there is justified optimism in developed market equities at the moment. Many traders and strategists believe that, if the flight from risky assets around the globe doesn't expose systemic weakness and if losses in the next few days aren't too steep, a wave of buying may ensue. \u001d  \"The U.S. economy - or perhaps more accurately, the U.S. stock market - has huge positive momentum right now,\" said a senior trader at a large New York hedge fund. \"If the stock market went down 10% from here, I think there will be massive buying - so that probably means the market will probably never get there.\" \u001d  Other strategists are waiting for a more attractive entry point and don't see it yet. Neil Cataldi, market intelligence analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, said a testing of the Dow's 200-day moving average, in the 11800- to 12000-point range, would be more convincing - and only if more scary news on the subprime front or rumors of hedge funds in trouble don't spur more selling. Buying above the 12200 level on the Dow with so much uncertainty is premature. \u001d  \"Right now, you're just catching a falling knife,\" he said. \"Maybe today was it - I don't know - but there could be another situation where it gaps lower.\" \u001d  Justin Walters, an analyst at research firm Birinyi Associates, is also unconvinced based on what he's seen so far. \u001d  \"Generally, we'd like to see the market stabilize a bit before we make a decision to go long or short,\" he said, noting that there's been no change in economic fundamentals over the past few days. \"It'll take some time to see what caused this move. We'll see in the next two or three months what's changed in the U.S. economy.\" \u001d  Fundamentals don't change in a matter of days, but the market shakeout, which coincided with a plunge in bond yields and weakness in the dollar, has had a big effect on expectations already. The Fed, which doesn't look to the stock market for cues on whether to ease or tighten monetary policy, was seen implementing two rate cuts by the end of this year with 98% odds based on futures prices. The odds last Thursday were close to zero. \u001d  (Spencer Jakab, a columnist who provides insightful and unique takes on the stock market, previously wrote about the energy market.) \u001d  -By Spencer Jakab, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2429; spencer.jakab@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:31 ET (12:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c5dfeb04dd1e95a5fddbb28f360cf253","symR":["BBC.YY","GOOG"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,1.005175],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.009916],"Headline":"British Broadcasting Corp Signs Partnership With YouTube-2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BBC.YY","GOOG"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","BRD","ISV","MED","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\u001d   The publicly funded U.K. broadcaster said it will offer branded \"channels\" on YouTube, the video-sharing Web site Google acquired in 2006, some of which will be funded by advertising. \u001d   The deal will create a channel called \"BBC Worldwide\" on YouTube which will show hit BBC shows including Top Gear, Spooks and the nature documentaries presented by David Attenborough. \u001d  It will also create a channel to be called \"BBC World,\" that will show news clips from the BBC's commercially operated international news channel of the same name. \u001d  In a third initiative, the corporation will also make clips from some current popular series such as Doctor Who and Life On Mars available. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:56 ET (11:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c65e775d2c2c53aca537ef9d1a2b4079","symR":["JDW.LN","JDWPY","GB0001638955"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"JD Wetherspoon 1H Turnover GBP438.4M Vs GBP406.3M >JDW.LN","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JDW.LN","JDWPY","GB0001638955"],"IndustryCodes":["RES","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:00 ET (07:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c6b9fc292c7156e48917c645928316fe","symR":["IDIX"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"IdenixPharm 4Q Losses $23.6M Vs $14.4M>IDIX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IDIX"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c7401b60ac97423a1e9cee9ab0a0a0d6","symR":["SDR.LN","GB0002405495"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Schroders Pretax Profit +26% On Higher Margins","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SDR.LN","GB0002405495"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","BNK","FIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Margot Patrick \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Schroders PLC (SDR.LN) reported a 26% rise in 2006 pretax profit Friday, driven by higher margin products, private banking revenues and gains from equity and bond markets that boosted its funds under management to GBP128.5 billion at Dec. 31. \u001d  Profit before tax rose to GBP290 million for the year, from GBP230.3 million in 2005, beating analysts' expectations of around GBP265 million. \u001d  The U.K. fund manager said net inflows from retail customers were GBP1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, putting retail net inflows for the year at GBP3.8 billion.

The withdrawals mainly came from poor-performing Japanese equity funds and U.K. balanced mandates. \u001d  For the year, the company suffered a net outflow of GBP6.4 billion, though gains at its funds helped lift assets by nearly 5% from last year's GBP122.5 billion. \u001d  \"Schroders is well placed for further growth, with a broadly diversified business by asset class, by region and by client type,\" the company said in a statement. \"Long term we see significant further opportunities to grow organically in institutional, retail and high net worth channels, supplemented by complementary acquisitions which strengthen our business.\" \u001d  In 2006, Schroders acquired NewFinance Capital, a fund-of-hedge-funds business that now has GBP1.9 billion in assets, and Aareal Asset Management, a continental European property business with EUR1.9 billion under management for institutional clients. \u001d  The company said it plans to pay a 17.5-pence-per-share final dividend, adding to its 7.5-pence dividend for the first half and compared to 14.5 pence in the second half of 2005. The total dividend in 2005 was 21.5 pence per share. \u001d  Schroders shares closed Thursday at 1,079 pence, down 1.8%, or 20 pence. The shares are down 3.3% since the start of the year, following a 7.5% drop in their value between Monday and Thursday as a wider equity market sell-off hit asset managers particularly hard. \b \u001d

March 1, 2007) - Napier Environmental Technologies Inc. (TSX:NIR) reports that the conditions, with respect to one of the major retailers contained within the Letter of Intent announced on February 5, 2007, have been met by both parties. The Licensing Agreement that will be entered into, pursuant to the Letter of Intent, guarantees Napier minimum royalty payments of US$500,000 per year in return for granting a major paint manufacturer exclusivity on specific products to be sold through one of the largest mass merchant retailers within the U.S.A., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, for a 12-year term. This agreement is structured to enable the Licensee the opportunity to expand their exclusive base to a second major retailer, such extension of the agreement to require further ratification by the licensee by June 30, 2007. Revenue and the respective cash proceeds pursuant to this agreement commenced on February 28, 2007. \b \bAbout Napier \b \bNapier is a Canadian company primarily engaged in the development, manufacture and distribution of a wide range of products utilizing environmentally advanced technology. The product lines include coating removal and wood restoration products for both the industrial/commercial market and the consumer/retail market. Napier is in the process of extending its product line by utilizing environmentally sound technology in the lawn and garden and household cleaning industries. \b \bThis release and referenced materials contain forward looking statements that are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in Napier's forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, risks related to going concern status of Napier, historical losses and cash flow, the future need for capital and uncertainty of additional financing being available, the potential dilution to shareholders, the volatility of the market price of the common shares, the historical lack of dividend payments, competition, dependence on key personnel, dependence on key customers, weather, seasonality and economic cycles, the availability of raw materials, the retail industry and the influence of economic conditions and consumer behavior, exchange rate fluctuations and conflicts of interest.

The withdrawals mainly came from poor-performing Japanese equity funds and U.K. balanced mandates. \u001d  Private banking net inflows contributed GBP400 million. \u001d  For the year, the company suffered a net outflow of GBP3.8 billion, though gains at its funds helped lift assets by nearly 5% from the previous year's GBP122.5 billion. \u001d  \"Schroders is well-placed for further growth, with a broadly diversified business by asset class, by region and by client type,\" the company said. \"Long term, we see significant further opportunities to grow organically in institutional, retail and high-net-worth channels, supplemented by complementary acquisitions which strengthen our business.\" \u001d  In 2006, Schroders acquired NewFinance Capital, a fund-of-hedge-funds business that now has GBP1.9 billion in assets, and Aareal Asset Management, a continental European property business with EUR1.9 billion under management for institutional clients. \u001d  Pretax profit from Schroders' asset management division was GBP219 million, up 26% from GBP173.8 million in 2005. The firm's private equity unit made GBP34.6 million, down from GBP40.3 million the year before, while private banking pretax profit grew to GBP26.9 million from GBP6 million. \u001d  The 2005 numbers don't include a GBP20.4 million gain last year from a discontinued contract. \u001d  Total revenue at the group was GBP976.2 million, up from GBP808 million the previous year. Net profit was GBP221.3 million, from GBP191.3 million in 2005. \u001d  \"All of the areas seem to have done slightly better than expectations and it's a very positive statement,\" said Geoff Miller, analyst at Bridgewell Securities, keeping an overweight rating on the shares. \u001d  \"Asset management continues to benefit from strong inflows into higher margin mandates and private banking at 9.2% of group profits is now making a meaningful contribution,\" he said. \u001d  The company said it plans to pay a 17.5-pence-a-share final dividend, adding to its 7.5-pence dividend for the first half and compared with 14.5 pence in the second half of 2005. The total dividend in 2005 was 21.5 pence a share. \u001d  Schroders shares closed Thursday at 1,079 pence, down 1.8%, or 20 pence.

The Fund's interim financial report is enclosed as part of this release. \b \bFor the year ended December 31, 2006, the Fund reported net earnings of $7,365,000 ($0.77 per unit) and distributable cash flow of $9,099,000 ($0.95 per unit), as compared to prior year earnings of $6,008,000 ($0.79 per unit) and distributable cash of $7,456,000 ($0.98 per unit). Net earnings and distributable cash increased year-over-year due to the full-year impact of acquisitions made in 2005, and higher order volumes. Partially offsetting the year-over-year improvement was a one-time gain on the sale of property in 2005. Per unit amounts declined due to the greater number of units outstanding this year. \b \bFor the three months ended December 31, 2006, the Fund reported net earnings of $2,076,000 ($0.22 per unit) and distributable cash flow of $2,187,000 ($0.23 per unit). These results were lower than the same period in 2005 due to the impact of crop mix shifts, which redistributed revenues to the first half of the year, and the timing of the Unit offering in 2005 to finance the Pelton acquisition. \b \bAnnual revenues increased by 22%, to $51,574,000, a record level for the Fund. This growth was driven by the acquisitions of the Pelton and Coldstream nurseries during 2005, as well as marginally higher order volumes in other nursery sites. \b \bMargins for the year decreased slightly as a result of a full year impact of the Pelton nursery, which has a higher cost structure. Other factors included higher energy costs and isolated crop yield problems. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher, largely on the annualized impact of the Pelton acquisition, but declined as a proportion of revenues. \b \bPresident and CEO, John Kitchen, commented, \"We are pleased to report another year of stable operating results, which confirms the direction we have been taking the company in recent years. We have demonstrated our ability to deliver reasonable returns to unitholders through tough industry cycles, while remaining committed to the execution of our longer-term strategic priorities. \b \b\"For 2007, markets appear to be temporarily weaker, and our challenge will be to execute to our full potential on our operating plan. Reliability and efficiency will remain as top priorities. By staying focused on these goals, we will continue to deliver the returns our unitholders have come to expect from PRT.\" \b \bSpecial Distribution \b \bThe Fund also announced today a special cash distribution of $0.03 per unit. The distribution will be payable on March 30, 2007 to unitholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2007. The \"top up\" distribution consists of taxable dividend income from additional distributable cash flow available from PRT's 2006 operating results. This will bring total distributions paid on account of the 2006 operating year to $0.93 per unit. \b \bAbout PRT \b \bPRT is the largest producer of container grown forest seedlings in North America, operating 15 nurseries located in Canada and the United States. Units of the Fund are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the trading symbol PRT.UN. \b \bConference Call and Taped Replay \b \bThe Fund will host an open conference call to further discuss these results, on Friday, March 2, 2007 at 2:00 p.m. (EST). The toll-free dial in phone number is 1-866-585-6398. To access a recording of this call at a later date, please dial 1-866-245-6755, Playback Conference ID # 435073. The recording will be made available until March 9, 2007. \b \bPRT will also web cast the conference call on the Internet, available from our web site at www.prtgroup.com. The web cast will also be archived and available for listening at a later date. \b \bManagement's Discussion and Analysis \b \bWe are pleased to present the 2006 fourth quarter report for the PRT Forest Regeneration Income Fund. This section presents management's view of the operating results, cash flows, financial position and business of the Fund, and its wholly owned operating subsidiary, Pacific Regeneration Technologies Inc. (\"PRT\"). \b \bThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations for future order volumes, pricing, operating costs and other expenditures; the future impact of acquisitions; the outlook for future energy prices; plans and opportunities for capital spending; and other statements contained in this discussion that are not historical fact. Words such as \"anticipate\", \"expect\", \"potential\", \"intends\", \"opportunity\", \"believes\", \"may\", \"will\" and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and actual events or results may differ materially. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, agricultural risks and crop yields, future commodity prices, exchange rate risks, the outlook for the forest industry, the risk that acquisitions may not be integrated as planned, the impact of proposed changes to income trust taxation, and other risks identified from time to time in the Fund's annual report, annual information return, prospectus, and other filing documents. These documents are available in electronic form at www.sedar.com, or by contacting the Fund directly. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update such information to reflect later events or developments, except as required by law. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. \b \bThis management's discussion and analysis has been prepared based on information available as at February 27, 2007. \b \bBetween 2000 and 2004, PRT experienced a challenging operating period of higher energy prices, market disruptions caused by the softwood lumber dispute, and other factors. By 2005 however, market conditions began to improve somewhat as silviculture spending returned to more normal levels, due in part to the continuing high rate of cut by forest industry customers to meet lumber demand, and by increased timber cutting in BC to salvage damaged timber. In 2006, a settlement was reached in the softwood lumber trade dispute, which removed some uncertainty from forestry markets. PRT was able to increase seedling order volumes in this environment, and supplemented this added business with two nursery acquisitions during 2005, which contributed to improved financial performance in 2005 and 2006. \b \bOperating Results \b \bFor the Year Ended December 31, 2006 \b \bRevenues for the year increased by $9.5 million from 2005, as a result of a full year's operating revenue contribution from PRT Pelton and PRT Coldstream, both of which were acquired part way through 2005. \b \bPRT measures production volumes in seedling blocks, which is a uniform measure of growing space represented by a standard Styroblock(TM) growing container. This measure is considered more meaningful than the number of trees since tree sizes vary widely between markets and customers, and tree prices vary accordingly. Revenues generated per seedling block tend to be more uniform, as the number of seedlings produced per block and price per tree will vary proportionately with the size of the seedling. \b \bExcluding the impact of acquisitions, contracted seedling block volumes at pre-acquisition nursery sites were slightly higher on a year-over-year basis in 2006, reflecting improved market conditions and reforestation activities related to damage caused by the mountain pine beetle in BC. Partially offsetting the increased block volumes were lower tree planting revenues relative to 2005, due to a change in the planting program of a key Ontario based customer. \b \bPRT's average realized seedling pricing in 2006 was lower than 2005, due to the impact of product mix changes. This included an increase in the proportion of lower priced outdoor compound production related to the acquisitions of Pelton and Coldstream late in 2005. PRT has a strategy to increase the ratio of outdoor compound production as a way to lower energy consumption. \b \bCosts of production rose as a percentage of revenue, to 60% from 57% in the prior year. This was attributable to the impact of a full year of operations with the Pelton nursery, which has a higher cost structure than other PRT sites, higher costs at the Hybrid nursery related to lower yields on certain crops, and higher greenhouse heating costs. \b \bGreenhouse heating costs increased in 2006, due to higher energy prices and modestly higher consumption. As a percentage of revenue, heating costs rose to approximately 5.7% from 5.2% in 2005. In 2006, PRT contracted forward approximately one half of its estimated annual gas needs to reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations, and this was done at prices roughly equivalent to those paid in 2005. However, there was an increase in early season crops in the 2006 seedling contract mix, which leads to earlier sowing and germination dates, resulting in increased consumption. For 2007, PRT has put forward buying contracts in place for over 50% of its anticipated needs, at prices slightly below those paid in 2006. With this forward buying program in place, management estimates that the Fund's sensitivity to natural gas price changes is approximately $0.01 in per unit distributable cash flow for every $1.00 per gigajoule change in the average annual cost of natural gas, and that a 10% change in consumption would impact distributable cash by approximately $0.025 per unit. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:47 ET (11:47 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cceb91d8638fb255efda6f766be77e0e","symR":["GSPBEX.RS","SSE.LN","SSEZY","GB0007908733","RU0007661625","GSPBEX.RS","SSE.LN","SSEZY","GB0007908733","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9896907,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9896907,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9879725,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9879725,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gazprom: We Have No Plans To Buy Scottish & Southern","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GSPBEX.RS","SSE.LN","SSEZY","GB0007908733","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","OIL","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:55 ET (12:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"cd0b755b3d5bbbb05720af7720b638de","symR":["DF","DF"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9923453,0.9923453],"ret5":[0.9757602,0.9757602],"Headline":"Dean Foods Plans Special Cash Div Of $15/Shr >DF","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DF"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:34 ET (12:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"cd2531469c0157d07784809d6ff2a7a5","symR":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[1.002585,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.046316,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Royal Bank Of Canada Reports -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b      Total assets                     $    34,835       83,741 \b      Securities                            11,982       31,193 \b      Consumer loans                         3,135       13,286 \b      Business and government loans          6,644       12,236 \b      Deposits                              22,083       50,734 \b      Risk-adjusted assets(3)               18,581       38,043 \b      Assets under management               14,600       29,200 \b      Assets under administration \b        - RBC                               35,400       75,200 \b        - RBC Dexia IS(4)                  157,000      311,900 \b    Common share information \b      Shares outstanding (000s) \b        - average basic                       (343)      (9,979) \b        - average diluted                     (779)     (11,293) \b        - end of period                     (4,940)     (15,033) \b      Dividends declared per share     $         -  $      0.08 \b      Dividend yield                      (30) bps       10 bps \b      Common share price (RY on TSX) \b       - close, end of period          $      4.80  $     10.06 \b      Market capitalization (TSX)            5,879       12,173 \b    ------------------------------------------------------------ \b    Period average USD equivalent \b     of C$1.00(5)                      $     (0.01) $     (0.00) \b    Period-end USD equivalent \b     of C$1.00                               (0.04)       (0.03) \b    ------------------------------------------------------------ \b    (1) Average common equity and Return on common equity are calculated \b        using month-end balances for the period. \b    (2) Net interest margin (NIM) is calculated as Net interest income \b        divided by Average assets.

For the year ended December 31, 2006 NuVista's average production 11,962 boe/d, comprised of 58.2 mmcf/d of natural gas and 2,264 bbls/d of oil and liquids, which represents a 33% increase over the same period in 2005. The 33% increase is primarily due to the success of the 2006 drilling program, the acquisition of Saskatchewan properties completed in June 2006, a full year of production from the northwest Saskatchewan properties purchased in August 2005 and was offset by normal production declines. Current production is approximately 13,500 boe/d with 300-500 boe/d being brought on production in early March with the removal of facility constraints on 2 wells. \b \bRevenues - Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2006 were $49.2 million, a 22% decrease from $63.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006, revenues were $192.6 million, a 14% increase from $169.7 million, for the same period in 2005. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were comprised of $151.1 million of natural gas revenue and $41.5 million of oil and liquids revenue. The increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 results from a 33% increase in production, partially offset by a 14% decrease in average realized commodity prices. The decrease in average realized commodity prices is made up of a 21% decrease in the natural gas price to $7.11/mcf from $9.02/mcf, offset by a 15% increase in the oil and liquids price to $50.25/bbl from $43.85/bbl. \b \bCommodity hedging - As part of our financial management strategy, NuVista has adopted a disciplined commodity-hedging program. The purpose of the hedging program is to reduce volatility in the financial results, protect acquisition economics and stabilize cash flow against the unpredictable commodity price environment. NuVista's Board of Directors has approved a hedging limit of 60% of forecast production, net of royalties, primarily using costless collars. Our strategy of using costless collars limits NuVista's exposure to downturns in commodity prices while allowing for participation in commodity price increases. In the fourth quarter of 2006, our hedging program resulted in a gain of $3.5 million primarily on natural gas contracts, as compared to a loss of $0.9 million in the same period in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the hedging program resulted in a gain of $11.9 million as compared to a loss of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The gain of $11.9 million for 2006 consisted of a $11.8 million gain on natural gas hedges and a $0.1 million gain on crude oil hedges. A summary of hedging contracts in place as at December 31, 2006 is included in note 5 of the Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. \b \bRoyalties - Royalties for the three months ended December 31, 2006 were $10.8 million, a decrease of 33% over the $16.3 million reported for the three months ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in royalties resulted from lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005. As a percentage of revenue, the average royalty rate for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 22% compared to 26% for the comparative period of 2005. Royalty rates by product for the fourth quarter of 2006 were 24% for natural gas and 13% for oil and liquids compared to 27% for natural gas and 16% for oil and liquids for the same period in 2005. The decrease in the natural gas royalty rate resulted primarily from hedging gains that are not included in the calculation of royalties. Royalties of $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 were 19% higher than the $40.3 million for the same period of 2005. The increase in royalties for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted primarily from revenues that were 14% higher compared to the same period of 2005. Royalty rates by product for the year ended December 31, 2006 were 28% for natural gas and 15% for oil and liquids compared to 26% for natural gas and 17% for oil and liquids for the same period in 2005. The increase in the average 2006 natural gas royalty rate was primarily due to higher royalties rates associated with increased Saskatchewan natural gas production, partially offset by the impact of hedging gains not included in the calculation of royalties. The decrease in the average 2006 oil and liquids royalty rate was primarily due the lower average quality crude oil produced which has a lower associated royalty rate. \b \bOperating - Operating expenses were $8.2 million ($7.09/boe) for the three months ended December 31, 2006, a 61% increase when compared to $5.1 million ($5.04/boe) for the three months ended December 31, 2005. This increase resulted from 14% higher production volumes and a 41% increase in per unit costs in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in per unit costs for the three months ended December 31, 2006 was due to higher electricity costs, the timing of property taxes, higher operating costs associated with the start-up of heavy oil production and overall cost pressures facing the oil and gas industry. Operating expenses were $25.8 million ($5.91/boe) for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $16.7 million (5.07/boe) for the same period in 2005, an increase of 54%. This increase resulted from 33% higher production volumes and a 17% increase in per unit costs in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in 2006 per unit costs resulted primarily from higher per unit costs in the three months ended December 31, 2006 and generally higher industry costs throughout 2006. For the three months December 31, 2006, natural gas operating expenses averaged $0.90/mcf and oil and liquids operating expenses were $14.57/bbl as compared to $0.74/mcf and $7.24/bbl respectively for the same period of 2005. For the year ended, December 31, 2006, natural gas operating expenses averaged $0.83/mcf and oil and liquids operating expenses were $9.89/bbl as compared to $0.72/mcf and $7.22/bbl respectively for the same period of 2005. Despite the increase in per unit operating costs, NuVista remains in the top quartile for oil and natural gas companies in its peer group. For 2007, NuVista's operating costs are expected to trend lower than the fourth quarter of 2006 and are forecasted to average approximately $6.00/boe. In particular, oil and liquid per unit operating costs are forecast to average $10.00/bbl in 2007. \b \bTransportation - Transportation costs were $500,000 ($0.43/boe) for the three months ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $895,000 ($0.88/boe) for the fourth quarter of 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006, transportation costs are lower due primarily to positive adjustments relating to the prior periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, transportation costs were $3.2 million ($0.73/boe) as compared to $3.1 million ($0.93/boe) for the same period in 2005. \b \bGeneral and administrative - For the three months ended December 31, 2006, general and administrative expenses were $1.2 million ($0.99/boe) net of overhead recoveries, as compared to $721,000 ($0.71/boe) for the three months ended December 31, 2005. This increase in costs in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulted primarily from the accrual of the year end bonuses and additional staff added in the accounting, land and administrative areas. For the year ended December 31, 2006, general and administrative expenses, net of overhead recoveries were $3.0 million ($0.69/boe) which represents an increase of 67% over the $1.8 million ($0.55/boe) for the year ended December 31, 2005. This increase is directly attributable to the higher production base in NuVista, hiring of NuVista's own staff as it reduced reliance on the Technical Services Agreement (the \"TSA\"), higher employee costs experienced throughout the energy industry and the allocation of higher overhead costs in accordance with the TSA. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Bonavista charged $2.3 million, as compared to $1.2 million in 2005, to NuVista for general and administrative services under the TSA. The TSA has allowed NuVista to operate with a low overhead cost structure until it attained the level of activity that required and could financially support its stand-alone general and administrative staff. As NuVista has achieved this level of operation in 2007, we will be reducing our reliance on the TSA and will be conducting most of our activities with our own staff. \b \bStock-based compensation - NuVista recorded a stock-based compensation charge of $246,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2006 compared to $389,000 for the same period in 2005. NuVista recorded a stock-based compensation charge of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2005. Stock-based compensation relates primarily to the granting of stock options. The increase in the expense in 2006 relates to stock options granted in the year and the increase in the cumulative number of stock options outstanding. \b \bInterest - For the three months ended December 31, 2006, interest expense was $1.9 million ($1.59/boe), up 122% from $834,000 ($0.82/boe) in the same period of 2005, due primarily to higher average debt levels in the fourth quarter of 2006 associated with the acquisition completed in June 2006. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $5.7 million ($1.30/boe) compared to $2.2 million ($0.68/boe) for the same period of 2005 due to higher average debt levels. Currently, NuVista's borrowing rate is 5.28%. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:38 ET (11:38 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cdd586edbf45d294233f2d14ac1b5a92","symR":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[1.002585,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.046316,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Royal Bank Of Canada Reports -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b       -  RBC Asset Management was the first fund company in Canada to \b          implement the new securities regulation requiring independent \b          oversight of mutual funds, continuing its leadership in the area of \b          fund governance. \b       -  RBC Insurance opened 3 new branches, bringing the total to 13. \b       -  RBC Capital Markets was named Top Dealmaker in 2006 (National \b          Post). \b       -  RBC Capital Markets led Canada Housing Trust's $8.1 billion bond \b          issue, which was the largest bond issue in Canadian history. \b \b    2.

The decline was due mainly to disposing of the Edah and Konmar formats. \u001d  A number of Super de Boer stores were also sold. Consumer sales at Super de Boer were almost the same in 2006 (EUR 2,049 million) as in 2005 (EUR 2,079 million). \u001d  Combined like-for-like consumer sales for Super de Boer, Edah and Konmar decreased by 0.2% compared with 2005. Super de Boer was a positive exception compared with the other Laurus formats. In 2006 a growth of 2.5% has been realised. \u001d  Super de Boer's market share in 2006 was 7.6% (2005: 8.0%). For Laurus as a whole these figures were 11.9% and 14.3%, respectively. \u001d  Consolidated revenues (net sales) were EUR 2.9 billion in 2006 (2005: EUR 3.2 billion). \u001d  Other than net sales related to the consumer sales of EUR 2.7 billion (2005: EUR 3.1 billion), these revenues also include sales related to the service level agreement with S&S Winkels. In addition rental income from real estate and ICT fees are comprised. \u001d  The consolidated gross margin decreased from 18.5% in 2005 to 15.7% in 2006. \u001d  This margin was adversely affected by: - A lower share of own store sales (own stores generate higher gross profit compared to the wholesale margin realised on franchisee sales); - The component of restructuring costs (EUR 31 million) allocated as cost of sales; - A positive effect in 2005 from the release of the pension provision (EUR 10 million) which was allocated to cost of sales. \u001d  Selling expenses decreased by approximately EUR 119 million, excluding special items. This decrease was a particular result of the disposal of stores and ending the depreciating assets held for sale. \u001d  The consolidated operating result for 2006 was EUR 30 million negative (2005: EUR 25 million negative). Besides the special items mentioned below, factors affecting the operating result were amongst others: - The sale and transfer of the loss-making Edah and Konmar activities, so that operating losses at these formats were no longer for the account of Laurus, had a positive effect of some EUR 40 million; - Ending depreciation of the assets of Edah and Konmar in accordance with IFRS 5 had a positive effect of EUR 19 million; - The improvement of operating profit Super de Boer by about EUR 10 million. \u001d  The operating loss in 2005 was affected by the release of a pension provision (EUR 65 million) and impairment losses on goodwill (EUR 11 million). \u001d  In 2006 Laurus recorded special items totalling EUR 17 million negative. The main items were: - Capital gain related to the disposal of the Edah and Konmar formats and of the distribution centres in Waddinxveen and Beilen of EUR 91 million; - The costs related to the restructuring in 2006 comprising cost of employee redundancies, the establishment of a provision for vacant buildings, the impairment of assets and the settlement of long-term supplier agreements for a total amount of EUR 128 million; - Repayment of a loan granted to CVC in connection with the sale of Laurus Spain. This loan had been fully provided for, consequently there was a positive effect of EUR 20 million. \u001d  Net interest charges were EUR 15 million compared with EUR 16 million for 2005. \u001d  At the balance sheet date, the outstanding net debt was reduced to EUR 78 million (2005: EUR 359 million). The reduction is the result of proceeds from the disposal of the Edah and Konmar formats and the distribution centres in Waddinxveen and Beilen. \u001d  After finalising its disposal programme, Laurus renewed its credit facilities. In this context, on 2 November 2006 Casino and the Banks granted Laurus a subordinated loan of EUR 50 million with a term of 3.5 years. This facility had been drawn in full by the end of the year. In addition Laurus entered into a credit agreement with the banks for a total facility of EUR 170 million, of which EUR 150 million has a term of 3 years and EUR 20 million has a term of 2 years. At the end of 2006, the outstanding balance on this facility was EUR 54 million. \u001d  The cash outflow from operating activities was EUR 124 million (2005: EUR 33 million outflow); - The cash inflow from investing activities was EUR 405 million, mainly as a result of the proceeds from disposing of the Edah and Konmar formats (2005: EUR 91 million outflow); - The cash outflow from financing activities was EUR 279 million as a result of the reduction in bank debt (2005: EUR 67 million inflow). \u001d  As a result of the loss in 2006, total shareholders' equity as at year-end 2006 decreased to EUR 41 million (2005: EUR 85 million). \u001d  Legal provisions and the provisions of the Articles of Association concerning profit appropriation prevent a dividend from being declared in respect of 2006. \u001d  2007 will be marked by the successful completion of the reorganisation of Laurus and deployment of all resources to make Super de Boer a strong, effective and financially sound organisation. As a result of this period of transformation, Laurus is expecting to make a further overall loss in 2007. It will, however, excluding unforeseen circumstances, be significantly less than in 2006. \u001d  Laurus expects to remain within the limits set in the financial covenants with the banks during the year. \u001d  Super de Boer is expecting consumer sales of some EUR 2 billion and a positive development of like-for-like sales in 2007. The sale of some 50 Super de Boer stores will, of course, involve a reduction in market share. Super de Boer is expected to report break even at EBIT level in 2007. About 20 Super de Boer stores will be modernised in 2007, involving capital expenditure of some EUR 20 million. Of this, about EUR 16 million will be used for the complete refurbishment of stores and about EUR 4 million for replacement capital expenditures. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.laurus.nl \b   \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:29 ET (07:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d1bb9f0cb863034b4a42590579b1cb05","symR":["BG.LN","BRG","GB0008762899"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"BG Group Plans To Invest $1B In India Over Next 5 Yrs -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T10:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BG.LN","BRG","GB0008762899"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Out of the $1 billion planned investment, BG Group intends to spend $950 million on exploration and production of oil and gas, Adamson said. \u001d  The remaining $50 million will be invested in distributing gas through pipelines within various cities in the country, the head of the Indian unit of BG Group said. \u001d  Earlier Friday, BG Exploration and Production India Ltd., the local exploration arm of BG, signed a contract for a 45% stake in a deep-water block off India's eastern coast. \u001d  India's state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp.

But a new consensus toward more disclosure is emerging among the industry's top brass. Blackstone Group's Stephen Schwarzman, Carlyle Group's David Rubenstein and Permira Advisers' Damon Buffini all agree the buyout business has to embrace openness. \u001d  But what exactly should LBO houses disclose -- and why should there be more disclosure? There are several constituencies that have a legitimate interest in the industry's activities: investors, employees in the companies they buy and the general public. \u001d  The latter group didn't matter much in the past because private equity was mostly involved in small companies. But now that it is involved in bigger companies and so many more deals, it has entered into the public consciousness. This has stirred up debates about public policy, including whether private-equity shops pillage acquired firms' assets and don't pay enough taxes. To address these public-interest questions private equity has to become, well, less private. This is not a matter of ethics but rather one of enlightened self-interest. \u001d  There are three things the industry should do: \u001d  First, firms should disclose industrial plans for the companies they buy. With small companies, they need only to communicate with their workers and investors. But with big companies like TXU or, potentially, British supermarket chain J Sainsbury, disclosure means public disclosure. \u001d  Second, they should reveal more about their deal financing. Employees have a legitimate concern that excess debt could undermine job security. Again, there has to be a differential approach between small and big companies -- with greater public disclosure needed for the big ones. \u001d  Finally, the industry should reveal more about how it makes money. Outsiders worry whether returns are really the result of smart decisions and hard work or the product of rising markets, leverage and favorable taxes. It won't come naturally for the industry to share this information. But if they are making good returns as a result of hard work, they have something to be proud of. If not, hiding in the shadows won't help. \b \u001d  M&S balks at Sainsbury \b \u001d  Has Britain's ultimate middle-class dream bitten the dust? \u001d  Marks & Spencer, the U.K. retailer, decided yesterday not to bid for rival J Sainsbury, just hours after M&S Chief Executive Stuart Rose hinted at such a move. But the group's vacillation shows it has mixed opinions on the merit of a deal. So Mr. Rose's apparent gaffe might be smarter than it seems. \u001d  On paper, a combination of the two retailers could be the best thing for M&S. With more than GBP 27 billion ($53 billion) of estimated sales this year, a combined entity would give M&S economies of scale in food and major expansion opportunities. It might also make it easier to find a successor to Mr. Rose, because a combined group would have formidable drawing power for retail talent. \u001d  But the execution risk is terrifying. M&S hasn't finished its own turnaround. It would be hard to run two such consumer brands together without logistical and branding nightmares, and the slightest slip-up would give rivals an opportunity to snatch away market share. Competition regulators, even if they eventually accepted a combination, would make it difficult. \u001d  Mr. Rose himself has another reason to hang back: His popularity, like Sainsbury's stock, is close to an all-time high. He's unlikely to want to round off his career at M&S with a potentially disastrous merger. \u001d  But that doesn't mean his hint at a bid wasn't shrewd. Mr. Rose is on the record as interested, and his board's statement says M&S can still wade in if another offer emerges, or if Sainsbury invites it to bid. That puts more pressure on the private-equity consortium studying Sainsbury to walk away. If it does, M&S can mull the merits of a merger at a far more leisurely pace. \b \u001d  Fixing Deutsche Telekom \b \u001d  Rene Obermann's chances of fixing Deutsche Telekom don't look promising. The German telecom operator's new boss inherited a weak hand, as fourth-quarter results show. Thanks mainly to troubles in the group's home market, underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, fell 13%, and they are expected to continue declining this year. Inherited problems aside, he has missed some tricks in his strategy for repairing the group. \u001d  Mr. Obermann, who disclosed details of his turnaround strategy Thursday, has ducked an opportunity to show he is the master of the group's biggest problem -- overstaffing. He has stuck by his predecessor's cost-cut targets and plans to transfer nearly 50,000 jobs to a separate business, T-Service. That looks unambitious when there is so much work to be done. \u001d  And Mr. Obermann may have put too much emphasis on mobile. It's easy to see why he feels mobile has a big part to play in Deutsche Telekom's recovery: It's his home turf, as he was promoted from head of the group's mobile division. What's more, it was the group's only division to increase Ebitda last year. But opening the door to foreign acquisitions, even in emerging markets, is unnerving, given the soaring price of assets and the group's history of destroying value through deals like VoiceStream. \u001d  Mr. Obermann may have quite a stack of cash to burn if one of the more promising pieces of his plan, raising money from unwanted assets, makes good. Credit Suisse estimates Deutsche Telekom could raise <euro>9 billion ($12 billion) from property and other asset sales alone, although the company has more modest ambitions. \u001d  Whatever the sum, Mr. Obermann should remember his long-suffering investors before he splurges his money on deals. Deutsche Telekom shares, which underperformed European peers by 20 percentage points last year, have continued to fall in 2007. At 5.9 times this year's Ebitda, according to Merrill Lynch, the shares trade at a 13% discount to peers. With Ebitda declining and the dividend kept on hold, investors don't have much incentive to start closing the gap. \u001d  -- Nicole Lee, Hugo Dixon, John Foley and Mike Verdin \u001d  --- \u001d  For more commentary, go to www.breakingviews.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:30 ET (05:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d5365ea408a01c138f523c4759080b28","symR":["PET.YY"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Malaysia's Petronas, Italy's FL Selenia In Distribution Pact","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T06:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PET.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  KUALA LUMPUR (AP)--Malaysia's state-owned oil-and-gas company Petroliam Nasional Bhd.

(SIRI) and XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. (XMSR) should be allowed to merge could affect the larger question of media consolidation in the U.S., according to FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell. \u001d  Speaking to reporters after an appearance at a forum hosted by the National Broadcasters Association, McDowell said that how the market is defined by authorities in analyzing the satellite radio merger question could prove significant to how competition in the overall audio media market is defined. \u001d  \"If we say that XM and Sirius shouldn't merge because there's not sufficient competition, does that mean there's not sufficient competition overall in audio? It depends on how you define the market,\" said McDowell. \u001d  The Republican commissioner said he wasn't taking a position on whether the merger should be approved at this early stage in the process, but said that conclusions could be drawn about the wider market. \u001d  Executives at Sirius and XM have argued that their merger should be allowed to proceed because they don't just compete with each other, but with all other forms of radio media. \u001d  The two companies are the only licensed satellite radio firms, and opponents say the merger would create a government-sanctioned monopoly. \u001d  McDowell said if the Department of Justice's antitrust unit, which would first have to approve the deal, and then the Federal Communications Commission were to decide there is a duopoly currently, then it could affect the agency's thinking on competition generally in the market. \u001d  The issue of media ownership is one that provokes considerable interest within Congress as lawmakers are keen to be seen as defending local television and radio stations. \u001d  \"The issue of media consolidation crosses partisan lines and has united members of both sides of the aisle in the past few years against attempts by the FCC to relax media ownership caps in a single market,\" said telecom analyst Jessica Zufolo of Medley Advisors, in a research note published Thursday. \u001d  The FCC is conducting a series of nationwide hearings into how the rules imposing caps on the number of radio and television stations that can be controlled by one company should be reformed. It still has at least three more hearings to hold and is not expected to come to any decisions until at least the end of the year. \u001d  -By Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6637; corey.boles@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:32 ET (12:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d5fdafbffcb47d653e52680773e30ace","symR":["BRW"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Bristol West Holdings, Inc.

(NYSE: BRW) announced today that BRW has agreed to be acquired by Farmers Group, Inc. (FGI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zurich Financial Services Group (Zurich).  Under the terms of the agreements, the holders of BRW common stock will receive $22.50 per share in cash for their shares, which represents a 38.8% premium above the March 1, 2007 closing price of $16.21.  The transaction is valued at $712 million, excluding the assumption of certain debt obligations of BRW pursuant to the acquisition, and exclusive of fees. \b \u001d  Commenting on the announcement, Mr. Jeffrey J. Dailey, Chief Executive Officer and President of BRW, said, \"We are delighted that Zurich and Farmers have recognized the strength of the company we have built over the last several years and see it as a way of enhancing Farmers' non-standard auto insurance business through their own highly successful distribution network. Bristol remains committed to its constituents, including our distribution network, and we look forward to joining the Zurich and Farmers family.\" \b \u001d  \"Adding Bristol's non-standard auto insurance business as an additional product line in the Farmers platform is a great fit and contributes to increase our reach,\" said FGI Chief Executive Officer Paul Hopkins. \"Their innovative product capabilities combined with Farmers distribution breadth and focus on operational excellence, will benefit the Exchanges, our customers, our agents and all Farmers stakeholders. This is another important step in expanding the product range offered by the Exchanges and sustaining the positive growth and profit trends we have created in the last few years.\" \b \u001d  The agreement allows BRW until March 31, 2007 (the \"go shop period end date\") to actively solicit other possible bidders and, thereafter, subject to certain conditions, to respond to unsolicited inquiries by other persons interested in acquiring the Company.  Should a superior offer be received and accepted, BRW may, subject to certain conditions (including payment of a termination fee), terminate the agreement with FGI.  In connection with such termination, the Company must pay a fee of $14 million to FGI, unless such termination is in connection with a proposal received after the go-shop period end date, in which case the Company must pay a fee of $21 million to FGI. \b \u001d  Investment partnerships formed at the direction of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. which holds approximately 42.18% of the stock of BRW have agreed to vote in favor of the merger. \b \u001d  BRW was advised by the investment banking firm of JPMorgan and the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.

Before making any voting decision, the Company's stockholders are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the merger carefully in its entirety when it becomes available because it will contain important information about the proposed transaction.

Richemont owns a bigger portion of 18.9%. \u001d  Richemont and Remgro aren't obliged to make a public bid for BAT even if their stake rises above 30%, a level that would normally trigger a public offer under U.K. laws. The partners said Thursday the London Takeover Panel has indicated it would free them from such an obligation. \u001d  Richemont and Remgro haven't taken part in BAT's ongoing share buyback and have thus increased their ownership. \u001d  A full takeover of BAT would be extremely costly given the cigarette giant's bourse valuation of more than GBP32 billion. \u001d  Richemont's large minority stake in BAT has historical reasons. In 1999, Richemont sold cigarette company Rothmans to BAT in exchange for BAT shares. \u001d  Johann Rupert, Executive Chairman of Richemont, has repeatedly said Richemont wants to hold on to the BAT stake.

(NYSE: IWA) today announced operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. Quarterly highlights for the Company include: \b \b   --  Operating revenues were $59.8 million. \b \b   --  Operating income was $15.4 million. \b \b   --  Net income was $3.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share. \b \b   --  Adjusted EBITDA (as defined herein) was $28.8 million. \b \u001d  \"We're very pleased with our financial and operating performance during both the fourth quarter and the year,\" said Alan L. Wells, Iowa Telecom chairman and chief executive officer. \"Our results were very strong, and were in line with our expectations for our rural telecommunications business. Operationally, sales of our DSL product were again outstanding as we added 5,000 new customers during the quarter. Our rate of access line loss was also in line with our expectations, as we experienced a decline of only 1,600 total lines during the fourth quarter, as compared to a decline of 2,000 access lines during the year ago quarter. We believe these results illustrate the positive impact that our bundled product offerings are having on our pace of access line losses. Our financial performance was also strong, with revenues for both the quarter and the year growing 2.8% and 1.1%, respectively, over the year ago periods. These increases are attributable to the success of our bundled product offerings, our DSL growth, and our expanded CPE and data business. \b \u001d  \"Our adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and for the year was $28.8 million and $124.3 million, respectively. As we've previously noted, in the fourth quarter we recognized a pension settlement charge associated with amendments to our pension plan, which lowered to approximately 40 the number of employees that continue to accrue pension benefits. While the $2.7 million charge we recorded was less than we originally estimated, it nonetheless negatively impacted our reported results for the quarter. In addition, during the fourth quarter our provision for income tax expense was $3.9 million, as compared to zero in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the effect of the pension plan costs and the income tax provision, our results for the quarter and year were consistent with past performance and were in line with our expectations. \b \u001d  \"While we recorded a provision for income tax expense of $12.3 million in 2006, the recorded tax expense had little impact on our cash flow, or more importantly, on our ability to pay our dividends to shareholders,\" Wells said. \"Despite the income tax charge for accounting purposes, both the continued utilization of our net operating loss carry forwards and our continued goodwill amortization for tax purposes serve to minimize our cash tax obligations. As a result of utilizing these tax attributes, our actual cash taxes paid in 2006 were only $964,000. As of December 31, 2006, our net operating loss carry forward balance was $185 million. \b \u001d  \"Our capital expenditures were $7.7 million for the fourth quarter and $28.1 million for 2006, which was on the low end of our guidance,\" Wells continued. \"Our cash interest expense for the year was $31.1 million, in line with our prior guidance. We expect cash interest expense to be between $30.0 million and $32.0 million in 2007. For 2007 we expect our capital expenditures to range between $25.0 million and $27.0 million, including approximately $2.0 million related to the purchase and move to our new headquarters location. \b \u001d  \"Overall, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and year,\" Wells concluded. \"We believe that during 2006 we strengthened our competitive and strategic position in our markets through several acquisitions. Our DSL subscribers grew by over 60% during the year, and we also were successful in slowing our rate of access line declines. We significantly enhanced our ability to meet the data needs of our business customers through the acquisition of Baker Communications. Looking ahead, we intend to continue to pursue opportunities to profitably grow our business, while at the same time returning a significant portion of our cash flow back to our shareholders in the form of dividends.\" \b \b   FINANCIAL DISCUSSION FOR FOURTH QUARTER 2006: \b \b   --  Operating Revenues were $59.8 million in the fourth quarter \b        compared to $58.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. \b        Network access services revenues decreased $1.3 million, or \b        4.9%, for the fourth quarter. The decrease in access services \b        revenue is primarily the result of a combination of a decrease \b        in access lines and an increase in cellular traffic for which \b        we receive lower rates of compensation. These decreases were \b        offset by a $3.2 million, or 39.6%, increase in other sales \b        and services. The revenue increase was primarily due to growth \b        of our CPE and data business. DSL and dial up Internet access \b        service revenues also increased $1.1 million, or 19.1%, due \b        primarily to customer growth. \b \b   --  Operating Costs and Expenses increased $5.1 million, or 13.0%, \b        in the fourth quarter of 2006 as compared to the fourth \b        quarter of 2005. Selling, general and administrative costs \b        increased $3.6 million, or 32.5%, for the fourth quarter, \b        primarily as a result of a $2.7 million pension settlement \b        charge related to amendments to our defined pension plans \b        compared to a similar $435,000 charge during the 2005 period. \b        Cost of service and sales increased $1.0 million, or 6.4%, \b        principally due to the growth of our CPE and data business. \b        Depreciation and amortization increased $482,000, or 4.0%, \b        during the fourth quarter compared to 2005. \b \b   --  Operating Income was $15.4 million in the fourth quarter of \b        2006 as compared to $18.9 million in the same period in 2005. \b        The decrease in operating income was primarily the result of \b        the $2.2 million increase in the pension settlement charge \b        related to amendments to our defined benefit pension plans. \b \b   --  Interest Expense for the fourth quarter increased $234,000, or \b        3.0%, to $8.1 million compared to $7.9 million in the same \b        period in 2005. The increase was the result of higher interest \b        rates on our variable rate debt and an increase in the rate on \b        our interest rate swap agreement. \b \b   --  Interest and Dividend Income decreased to $426,000 during the \b        fourth quarter, due primarily to higher RTFC dividend income \b        during 2005. \b \b   --  Earnings Before Income Taxes for the fourth quarter of 2006 \b        were $7.4 million compared to $11.6 million in the fourth \b        quarter of 2005. \b \b   --  Income Tax Expense for the fourth quarter was $3.9 million \b        compared to zero in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company \b        estimates that book income tax expense will be recorded at an \b        effective tax rate of approximately 41% in future periods. The \b        recorded book tax expense did not impact the cash taxes paid \b        during the quarter. The Company paid actual cash income taxes \b        for Alternative Minimum Taxes during the quarter of $310,000, \b        reflecting the continued utilization of net operating loss \b        carry forwards and continued goodwill amortization for tax \b        purposes. At the end of the quarter, the Company had a net \b        operating loss carry forward balance of approximately $185 \b        million. \b \b   --  Net Income was $3.5 million for the quarter compared to net \b        income of $11.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. \b \b   --  Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and \b        Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA as defined herein) was $28.8 \b        million for the fourth quarter of 2006 as compared with $31.9 \b        million in the same period in 2005. \b \b   --  Total Access Linesdecreased by 1,600 during the fourth quarter \b        of 2006 from the third quarter in 2006, as ILEC access lines \b        declined by 2,400 lines and CLEC lines increased by 800 lines. \b        Total access lines decreased by 1,600, or 0.6%, for the fourth \b        quarter of 2006 as compared to 2,000, or 0.8%, for the fourth \b        quarter in 2005. \b \b \b \b                Fourth Quarter 2006 Financial Summary \b                             (Unaudited) \b          (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) \b \b \b                            4th Quarter 4th Quarter      Change \b                                                    ----------------- \b                                  2006        2005   Amount   Percent \b                            ----------- ----------- --------- ------- \b \bRevenue                       $ 59,843    $ 58,226  $  1,617     2.8% \bOperating Income              $ 15,403    $ 18,901  $ (3,498)  -18.5% \bInterest Expense              $  8,131    $  7,897  $    234     3.0% \bEarnings Before Income \b Taxes                        $  7,432    $ 11,595  $ (4,163)  -35.9% \bNet Income                    $  3,497    $ 11,595  $ (8,098)  -69.8% \bBasic Earnings Per Share      $   0.11    $   0.37  $  (0.26)  -70.3% \bDiluted Earnings Per Share    $   0.11    $   0.36  $  (0.25)  -69.4% \b \bAdjusted EBITDA (1)           $ 28,768    $ 31,926  $ (3,158)   -9.9% \bCapital Expenditures          $  7,723    $  6,609  $  1,114    16.9% \bDividends Paid                $ 12,836    $ 12,666  $    170     1.3% \b \b(1) See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA under Explanation and \b Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Concepts at the end of the financial \b statements. \b \b                            4th Quarter 4th Quarter      Change \b                                                    ----------------- \bKey Operating Statistics          2006        2005   Amount   Percent \b                            ----------- ----------- --------- ------- \bTelephone Access Lines \b     ILEC Lines (1)            228,200     237,900    (9,700)   -4.1% \b     CLEC Lines (2)             23,800      20,800     3,000    14.4% \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:00 ET (11:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"de56c55c11a6042a8c8c27761ef5ba52","symR":["GLH","GLH.LN","GB0003833695"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gallaher FY EPS 61.4p Vs EPS 56.4p >GLH.LN","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GLH","GLH.LN","GB0003833695"],"IndustryCodes":["TOB","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:03 ET (07:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"dec7d7b6ff765615cafb6c214769ac28","symR":["BAY","BAY.XE","DE0005752000"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Bayer To Cut 6,100 Jobs Globally >BAY","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T09:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BAY","BAY.XE","DE0005752000"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XDAX","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 04:02 ET (09:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"df2e89e2ebdc5ddac8da75108e0380bc","symR":["5350.FR","DRTE","FR0000053506"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Dendrite Sees Combined Organization With Pro Forma Rev Over $1B >DRTE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T08:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5350.FR","DRTE","FR0000053506"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","TSX","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:41 ET (08:41 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"df50f1e3273decd250f17dcda77d24e4","symR":["BBC.YY","GOOG"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,1.005175],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.009916],"Headline":"British Broadcasting Corp.

In January 2007, ATP acquired additional blocks at its Gomez Hub and King's Peak/Canyon Express Hub. The Gomez Hub addition is expected to add proved undeveloped reserves, an interest in two adjacent blocks and a commitment to process up to a designated amount of production from these two blocks beginning in 2009. The blocks at the King's Peak/Canyon Express Hub included an increase in the company's ownership percentage in the Canyon Express Pipeline System and one producing property, which will add proved reserves. The technical evaluation of these properties is being refined and no reserves from these 2007 acquisitions were included in ATP's year-end 2006 reserve report. \b \u001d  During 2007, efforts will be spent completing and bringing to production at least two more wells at Gomez and Ship Shoal 351 and an additional well at South Timbalier 77. As noted earlier, the third well at Tors (the Garrow #1) and the two wells at Ladybug began producing during February 2007. \b \u001d  In addition to these developments, at December 31, 2006, ATP has projects with proved undeveloped reserves that are scheduled for 2007 development and production. The company also has scheduled for drilling or completion properties in which previous drilling into targeted reservoirs indicates the presence of commercially productive quantities of hydrocarbons, although these reservoirs did not meet the SEC definition of proved reserves at the end of 2006. For example, the previously discussed Ship Shoal 351 is a property that ATP believes has commercially productive hydrocarbons that are not included in the company's year-end 2006 reserve report. \b \u001d  The company has commenced engineering and design activities at its Cheviot property in the U.K. North Sea. Cheviot, ATP's largest property in terms of proved reserves, is a multi-year development with first production targeted in late 2009 or 2010. ATP has also begun engineering, procurement and construction at its Telemark Hub in the Gulf of Mexico. Installation of the floating drilling and production facility is planned for mid-2008 with first anticipated production in late 2008 or early 2009. Other potential developments for 2007 in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea are currently being evaluated. ATP believes its 2007 production will exceed that of 2006 as a result of the company's recent development programs and projects scheduled for development in 2007. \b \u001d  ATP's production may command lower realized oil and gas prices in 2007 than in recent years as a result of current strip prices compared to recent years. The company's 2007 contracted hedge prices are currently in excess of many of the 2007 strip prices which should provide a realized price in excess of the strip prices for those volumes covered by hedges, if prices do not increase. ATP's revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon many factors, particularly the company's production results and the price of oil and natural gas. To mitigate future price volatility, ATP may hedge additional production. \b \b   4th Quarter 2006 Conference Call \b \u001d  ATP Chairman and President T. Paul Bulmahn, Senior Vice President Gerald W. Schlief, Chief Operating Officer Leland E. Tate and Chief Financial Officer Albert L. Reese, Jr will host a live conference call on Friday, March 2 at 10:00 am central time to discuss the company's year-end results followed by a Q&A session. \b \b   4th Quarter and Year-end 2006 Conference Call \b \b   Date: Friday, March 2, 2007 \b \b   Time: 11:00 am ET; 10:00 am CT; 9:00 am MT and 8:00 am PT \b \u001d  ATP invites interested persons to listen to the Internet webcast on the company's website, www.atpog.com, linking through the Investor Info page and the Conference Calls link.

ATP cautions that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Some of the key factors which could cause actual results to vary from those ATP expects include changes in natural gas and oil prices, the timing of planned capital expenditures, availability of acquisitions, uncertainties in estimating proved reserves and forecasting production results, operational factors affecting the commencement or maintenance of producing wells, the condition of the capital markets generally, as well as ATP's ability to access them, and uncertainties regarding environmental regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting our business. More information about the risks and uncertainties relating to ATP's forward-looking statements are found in the company's SEC filings. \b \b                     CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS \b                            (In Thousands) \b \b                                             December 31, December 31, \b                                                 2006         2005 \b                                             ------------ ------------ \b                   Assets \b \bCurrent assets: \b  Cash and cash equivalents                  $   182,592  $    65,566 \b  Restricted cash                                 27,497       12,209 \b  Accounts receivable (net of allowances of \b   $409 and $367)                                105,030       83,571 \b  Deferred tax asset                               1,113            -

what I mean to say is that we would be buddies if we knew each other - began speaking at 7:00 a.m. EST in Santiago, Chile, on the topic of \"Energy Prices and the U.S. Business Cycle.\" (Go to news coverage on Dow Jones Newswires.) \u001d  Mr. Poole, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, speaks at a time when gasoline prices once again are causing consternation among millions of U.S. motorists who are incapable of thanking God that they don't live in Europe, where they could pay three to four times as much for their gasoline. \u001d  The price for regular unleaded at the gas station I follow in Jersey City has shot up about 36 cents a gallon, to $2.33, in the past four weeks or so. The experts say we are looking at another 30 cents a gallon by the end of April. \u001d  Forget the \"core inflation\" heresy spouted in public by our central bankers and leading economists. All of them know full well that spiking gasoline prices jack up almost everyone's cost of living and can divert billions of dollars that otherwise would have been spent at the mall, at car dealerships, and so on. \u001d  This time out, there is a difference that seems not to have occurred to those flying the warning flags over gasoline prices: \u001d  Markets usually do not respond much to events they've already responded to. In the previous run-up, the average price for regular unleaded topped out at $3.30 a gallon or so. On the whole, the economy responded admirably. \u001d  Unleaded gasoline prices will have to get a lot closer to $4.00 a gallon than they are now before we'll see any notable slowing down of the U.S. economic engine. \u001d  Ben Bernanke, the U.S.'s No. 1 central banker, is also on the stump today. The Fed Chairman will be out in California, where he will speak at the \"Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research Economic Summit on Globalization and Monetary Policy.\" I put quotation marks around the event so that you will know that this fulsome description is not mine. \u001d  Depending on which calendar you believe, Mr. Bernanke will begin to speak at 9:45 p.m. EST, or 11 p.m. EST. I trust the latter time. I believe that 9:45 p.m. (6:45 p.m., local time) is when the cocktail hour has ended and the serving of the Chicken Kiev with the Day-Glo orange cheese in the middle has begun. \u001d  Either way, all financial markets on the planet will be closed when Mr. Bernanke begins to speak. He will have to drop a bomb for financial markets to respond on Monday. If Benny drops a bomb, our own Mark Boslet will be there to tell you all about it. \b \u001d  Selling Their Souls Cheaply \b \u001d  Several things struck me about the news Thursday that 13 brokers and hedge fund managers cleared about $15 million in an insider trading scheme that went on for about six years. \u001d  1) Fifteen million dollars divided by 13 divided by six is a a puny average yearly take for selling one's soul while selling out one's clients and one's company. \u001d  2) Much of the insider stuff that was sold came from the research analysts at UBS. As wise people such as myself know, most Wall Street \"research,\" is piffle written in Martian, and it usually begins with a headline like, \"Cisco Systems Shares Cut to `Market Perform' from `Accumulate.\" \u001d  I can write more telling market \"research\" if given one hour and access to both Google and the Factiva News Retrieval system. \u001d  There is a big difference, however: Most Wall Street \"research notes\" move share prices almost immediately upon disclosure - albeit the movement is usually brief and signifies nothing. As The Wall Street Journal's account of the alleged scamming notes: \b \u001d  \"The SEC said Lyford Cay earned $10,000 from advance word of a UBS downgrade of insurer Allstate Corp. in December 2001 by selling borrowed shares and quickly buying them back at a profit of about $1 a share.\" \b \u001d  \"He was a day tripper, yeah/It took them so long to find out/But they found out.\" \b \u001d  3) Four of the 13 people indicted by the Feds have already pleaded guilty. Miscreants really ought to learn that it isn't wise to have accomplices when they rob banks. In return for lighter sentences, the four who pleaded guilty have to drop dimes on the other nine, who are going down and are advised to make the best deal that they can. \u001d  4) In more than 35 years in the financial news business, I am unaware of charges ever having been filed against the so-called ratings agencies or their people for leaking downgrades and upgrades, which, in general, are more substantive than Wall Street \"research notes.\" This is astounding and defies human nature. \u001d  5) All trading, including the licit variety, is insider trader. \u001d  The three firms whose employees were implicated Thursday expressed \"outrage,\" but they know as well as I do that the system is set up to benefit insiders. I know. I am one. I see press releases, news stories and other information before most people. Sometimes, I happen to see news stories before they even run on the wire. \u001d  What we do at Dow Jones, and at UBS, is based on honor. If we lack honor, then insider trading in the criminal sense is, like the mother and child reunion, only a motion away. \b \u001d  Mr. Mint \b \u001d  John Ruccolo, coinage adviser to M2M, e-mails to say that the new U.S. Presidents dollar coins were doomed from the start as a part-time replacement for paper dollars. And the U.S. Mint never intended that they should be. John checked out usmint.gov, where he found this: \b \u001d  \"Although the size, weight and metal composition of the new Presidential $1 Coin will be identical to that of the Sacagawea Golden Dollar, there are several unique features that make this coin distinctive.\" \b \u001d  Yeah, like \"In God We Trust\" engraved upon the rim, and not on the face. \u001d  John adds: \b \u001d  \"It's a better looking coin than the Sacagawea (how could it not be?) but it's too big, too close in size to a quarter, and everybody will collect them. Nobody will use them. Except for PATH and New Jersey Transit riders, once they run out of new-old-stock 1979 Susan B. Anthony's.\" \b \u001d  The Susie B's used to be a real pain for me when I rode the PATH subway system to and from work. \u001d  One-way fare on the PATH is $1.50. One day, I put $10 in a fare machine for a two-trip ticket and received seven Susie B's in change. I had to: \b \u001d  1) Sequester them on my person daily for use when and only when I would need to buy a seat on the PATH. \u001d  2) Take care not to give one to newsstand operators and other merchants who did not want them any more than I did. \u001d  3) Be on guard if I was reduced to paying for something with a Susie B. dollar that the merchant did not treat the coin as if it were a 25-cent piece. \b \u001d  (Jim Murphy, resident iconoclast at Dow Jones Newswires and veteran observer of global business trends, can be reached at (201) 938-2145 or by e-mail at Jim.Murphy@DowJones.Com) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e13e91024bc0ee58ec1a141a214721e0","symR":["NIN.YY"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"NIBC To Float Minority Stake In Amsterdam IPO","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T08:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NIN.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--Dutch merchant bank NIBC plans to list a minority stake in the company in an initial public offering, Chief Executive Michael Enthoven said during a conference call. \u001d  The Dutch bank earlier Friday said it plans to launch the IPO on Euronext Amsterdam in the coming months.

(Dow Jones)--Dell Inc. (DELL) shares fell modestly in late trading Thursday, after investors realized any turnaround at the troubled computer maker would be several quarters away. \u001d  \"It's been looking more and more like 2007 will be a transition year,\" said James Ragan, an analyst at Crowell Weedon and Co. Shareholders appear convinced the company will need a number of additional quarters before a potential turnaround takes hold, said Ragan, who doesn't own Dell shares and whose firm doesn't conduct banking for the manufacturer. \u001d  In a statement released after market close, the Round Rock, Texas, company said fourth-quarter earnings came to 30 cents on sales of $14.4 billion - both close to Wall Street's targets. Dell provided only an abbreviated financial statement because of ongoing investigations into its accounting and financial reporting. \u001d  In reacting to the quarter, Chief Executive Michael Dell described the performance as disappointing and said, \"we won't achieve our goals overnight.\" Dell took over the reins of the company he founded in January. \u001d  \"In the next several quarters the company expects that growth and margins will continue to be under pressure as it implements and refines\" efforts to strengthen its management and improve its operations, the statement said. \u001d  Investors responded to the news by sending Dell shares down 42 cents, or 1.8%, to $22.59 in late trading. \u001d  In its announcement, Dell said it got some breathing room from Nasdaq officials considering whether to delist its shares. Dell has a May 4 deadline to provide more information to the Listing and Hearing Review Council, as well as to file delinquent 10Q forms for the second and third quarters, and the 10K report for fiscal 2007. \u001d  The previous deadline for getting the forms to the Securities and Exchange Commission had been March 14. \u001d  Dell spokesman Dwayne Cox declined to comment on whether the company had a target date for the filings. \u001d  In fourth-quarter projections, analysts had expected $14.88 billion in sales and 29 cents of earnings, suggesting Dell was light on the revenue but ahead on earnings. \u001d  However, Dell's bottom line benefited from the company's decision not to pay full performance bonuses to employees.

That's up from $275.38 billion in December, and above the previous peak of $278.53 billion in March 2000, as the Nasdaq Composite Index was peaking. \u001d  When stock prices decline, investors can be exposed to margin calls, which require them to post additional collateral or have their brokers sell their securities to cover the debt. \u001d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average Tuesday suffered its worst one-day plunge since Sept. 11, 2001, had a muted rebound Wednesday and started low then recovered on Thursday. At online brokerage Scottrade Inc., that meant margin calls tripled this week from \"what had been very normal levels,\" a spokeswoman said. TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD), another e-brokerage, saw margin calls triple on Wednesday, a spokeswoman said; for the week, they're up about 60%. \u001d  Part of regulators' concern about margin debt stems from what they see as increased access to it by retail investors. \u001d  As the industry has simplified account-opening agreements to make them easier to read and understand, NYSE regulators said, brokerage firms have moved toward making access to margin accounts the default option, with customers having to affirmatively choose whether to opt-out, instead of choosing to opt-in. \u001d  At Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW), for example, brokerage account applications include margin borrowing as an account feature unless customers specifically say they don't want it, a spokeswoman said. In the documents section describing brokerage features, she said, \"it clearly states in bold face type: 'Margin borrowing is included unless you check this box.' \" She noted that margin debt at Schwab is less than 1% of the firms' total client assets. \u001d  NYSE Regulators said they are in \"fact-finding mode,\" trying to get a better sense of what firms' customer agreements and disclosures look like when it comes to margin transactions. \u001d  Although having a margin account doesn't necessarily mean a customer will use it, NYSE regulators are concerned that investors will be less likely to think about what it means to borrow on margin when they get a call from their financial advisors, who may recommend doing so. \u001d  \"The understanding between the broker and customer should be that (the broker will warn) 'Hey, you're going to overextend yourself,' \" said Thomas Drogan, examination director at NYSE Regulation, a unit of NYSE Group Inc. (NYX), speaking before the market's tumble this week. \"If the broker doesn't do that job and the customer doesn't review the account agreement carefully, they might not understand they've established a margin balance.\" \u001d  Some firms have retained the affirmative opt-in. At Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup Inc. (C), customers can answer yes or no about whether they want a margin account; directly below that spot, customers are directed to the document's disclosure section about margin debt. \u001d  Morgan Stanley (MS), too, includes a check-off box where clients applying for new accounts can say whether they want to open a margin account. When clients do open margin accounts and use them for the first time, the firm sends them a letter reminding them that they're paying interest and that they may be subject to margin calls. \u001d  \"We are comfortable with the controls we have in place to monitor and manage margin debt,\" said Christine Pollak, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman. \u001d  At the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees all brokerage firms, examiners routinely look at margin account disclosures and suitability. In light of climbing margin debt, the self-regulatory body is going to update its previous investor alerts on the subject. \u001d  \"I know some people I've spoken with have been very confused about whether they're purchasing on margin or not,\" said John Gannon, senior vice president of investor education. \"They don't understand whether they had made a purchase on margin and therefore weren't necessarily aware of the risks of margin trading.\" \u001d  For now, regulators are hoping their early warnings will prevent history from repeating itself. \u001d  \"What had happened in the stock market bubble was that many customers tried to leverage (their holdings),\" Drogan said. \"It helped increase gains for the moment in time, but we know what happened when the stock market crashed.\" \u001d  (Jaime Levy Pessin covers compliance and regulatory issues affecting financial advisors.) \u001d  -By Jaime Levy Pessin, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4546; jpessin@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:32 ET (12:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e24acd0dfc384e07cba692a19b931e9e","symR":["LEND"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Accredited Home Lenders Sees Filing 10-K By Mar 16","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LEND"],"IndustryCodes":["MFN","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:31 ET (11:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e2793e277ad05ffbc20a31038ba8b31b","symR":["PRT.UN.T","CA6939461050"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": PRT Announces 2006 4Q Results, -4-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PRT.UN.T","CA6939461050"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","PLN"],"Story":"\bIn conjunction with prior period acquisitions, the Fund has recorded intangibles related to the value of customer lists, leases and non-competition agreements. In addition, goodwill of $4.2 million was recognized related to the Pelton, Coldstream and Hybrid acquisitions, and $28.2 million of goodwill is recorded by the Fund related to its initial acquisition of PRT. The customer list intangibles are being amortized against income over 5 years, whereas leases are being amortized over 15 years, and non-competition agreements over periods from 5 to 10 years. Goodwill is subject to periodic impairment testing and will be written down if impairment is indicated. \b \bUnitholders' Equity at December 31, 2006 was $75.9 million, a decrease of $1.4 million since the end of 2005. This decline in equity was due to distributions declared exceeding net earnings for the period, partially offset by the 13,802 units issued under the provisions of PRT's Employee Share Purchase Plan. Distributable cash flow from the Fund is typically higher than reported earnings, since depreciation charges generally exceed the expenditures required for asset replacement, while asset maintenance expenditures are already included as a component of net income. Most greenhouse assets can be maintained in use indefinitely with a regular repair and maintenance program. \b \bOutstanding Unit Data \b \bThe Fund has one class of voting equity securities, of which 9,601,216 units are outstanding. Up to 560,572 units have been reserved for issuance under its Unit Option Plan, however to date no options have been granted. There are no other securities currently outstanding which may be converted into units of the Fund. \b \bFinancial Instruments \b \bPRT uses interest rate swap contracts to fix interest rates on its variable rate long-term debt. Payments and receipts under interest rate swaps are recognized as adjustments to interest expense in a manner that matches them to interest payments under floating rate financial liabilities. \b \bSwap terms are matched to the maturity of the underlying loan obligation. However, the Company could incur a gain or loss on the contract in the event the swap was cancelled before the scheduled maturity date. PRT periodically obtains mark-to-market valuations on its swap contracts. At December 31, 2006 the fair value of the Company's outstanding interest rate swaps approximated their carrying amount based on reference to current market interest rates. \b \bPRT may use foreign currency forward sales contracts to manage currency exposure on net US dollar cash flows (see discussion of Foreign Exchange Risks below). The terms of such contracts are designed to match the receipt of US dollars under seedling sales contracts. Outstanding foreign currency forward sales contracts are revalued on a mark-to-market basis at the end of each reporting period, and any resulting gains or losses are recorded in income during the period. At December 31, 2006 there were no foreign currency forward sales contracts outstanding. \b \bAccounting Policy Changes \b \bVariable Interest Entities \b \bEffective January 1, 2005, the Fund adopted the CICA's Accounting Guideline AcG-15, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Application of this guideline has required consolidation of PRT Management Inc. with the Fund's financial statements in 2005. Adoption of this policy had no significant impact on reported results for either period. \b \bFinancial Instruments \b \bThe CICA has issued three new Handbook Sections which will apply to the Fund as of January 1, 2007: Section 3855 \"Financial Instruments\", Section 3865 \"Hedges\" and Section 1530 \"Comprehensive Income\". Section 3855 prescribes when a financial instrument should be recognized on the balance sheet and at what amount. It also specifies how to present financial instrument gains and losses. Section 3865, which is optional, provides alternative treatments to Section 3855 for qualifying transactions that are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Section 1530 introduces new requirements for situations when certain gains and losses must be temporarily presented outside of net income in a new Statement of Comprehensive Income, which will be presented with equal prominence to the regular Income Statement. PRT has elected not to utilize hedge accounting on its existing derivative financial instruments (which are discussed below, under Interest Rate Risk and Foreign Exchange Risk). As a result, these instruments, which were previously not recognized on the balance sheet, will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, and gains and losses which were previously not recognized until the contracts were exercised will be recorded during each period. The Fund will adopt these new accounting standards commencing with its first quarter report in 2007, and the effect, if any, will be determined at that time. \b \bCritical Accounting Estimates \b \bRevenue Recognition \b \bPRT accounts for revenue under seedling contracts based on percentage completion contract accounting. Percentage completion is determined as the ratio of direct growing expenses incurred to total expected direct growing costs over the crop cycle. While most crops are completed by the end of the Fund's fiscal year, during interim periods management must make estimates of total expected direct growing costs for the fiscal year. In addition, total annual revenue under growing contracts is estimated based on expected annual crop yields. To increase the accuracy of these estimates, PRT has internal policies and procedures which require periodic revisions to cost forecasts and crop yield forecasts whenever a material variance is known or expected. The potential for errors in estimation is typically limited to interim periods, as in most instances final crop yields and costs are known by the end of the fiscal year. \b \bFuture Income Taxes \b \bIn accordance with CICA recommendations, the Fund recognizes future income tax assets when it is more likely than not that the future income tax assets will be realized. This assumption is based on management's best estimate of future circumstances and events. If these estimates and assumptions are changed in the future, the value of the future income tax assets could be reduced or increased, resulting in an income tax expense or recovery. The Fund re-evaluates its future income tax assets on a regular basis. \b \bImpairment of Goodwill \b \bGoodwill, which is the excess of the purchase price paid for an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, is not amortized but is assessed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. \b \b \bSelected Annual Information \bFigures are presented in $000's except number of Units and per Trust Unit \b amounts \b                        1998        1999       2000       2001       2002 \b \bOperating \b Statistics \bRevenues(1)           22,097      26,714     33,270     35,165     34,277 \b Revenue Growth \b  Rate (Year over \b  Year)                  8.6%       20.9%      24.5%       5.7%      -2.5% \b \bGross Margin \b percentage             49.8%       47.9%      43.2%      44.3%      42.4% \b \bOperating \b Income(2)             6,207       7,090      8,060      8,905      7,628 \b % of revenue           28.1%       26.5%      24.2%      25.3%      22.3% \b \bNet Earnings(1)        4,040       4,508      4,122      4,372      4,939 \b Basic and Fully \b  Diluted Earnings \b  per Unit        $     0.72  $     0.80 $     0.74 $     0.78 $     0.73 \b \bDistributable \b Cash Flow(2)          5,725       5,895      5,383      5,685      6,800 \b Distributable \b  Cash Flow per \b  Unit(2)         $     1.02  $     1.05 $     0.96 $     1.01 $     1.01 \b \bDistributions \b Declared per \b Unit(1)          $     1.02  $     0.88 $     1.05 $     0.96 $     1.01 \b \bReturn on \b Average Equity          7.9%        9.0%       8.4%       9.2%       9.3% \b \bDistributable \b Cash Flow Yield \b (on closing unit \b price)                 11.3%       12.0%      11.0%       9.1%      10.1% \b \bCapex Spending: \b Sustaining \b  Capital \b  (excludes \b  reserves)              228         276        540        419        462 \b   % of revenue          1.0%        1.0%       1.6%       1.2%       1.3% \b Earnings \b  enhancing            4,950       5,627      3,913      1,036        661 \b  Subtotal             5,178       5,903      4,453      1,455      1,123 \b Seedling \b  Containers             749         993        954      1,090        660 \b  Total                5,927       6,896      5,407      2,545      1,783 \b \b  Acquisitions             -       2,594        471          -          - \b \bMaintenance \b expenditures          1,636       1,865      2,082      2,489      2,475 \b Maintenance & \b  Sustaining \b  Capital \b  expenditures as \b  a percentage of \b  revenue                8.4%        8.0%       7.9%       8.3%       8.6% \b \bFinancial \b Position \bWorking Capital        2,211       1,135      1,343      1,523      4,737 \b \bInterest Bearing \b Debt Position \b Operating             2,882       4,231      7,096      6,993      4,615 \b Term (including \b  current portion)     4,968       8,070     11,838     11,502          - \b Total                 7,850      12,301     18,934     18,495      4,615 \b \bTerm Debt to \b Equity                0.098       0.161      0.247      0.246      0.000 \b \bTotal Assets          61,062      66,402     70,999     69,934     68,709 \b \bMarket \b Capitalization \b (based on \b closing unit \b price)               50,901      49,487     49,487     62,778     72,630 \b \bUnits \b Outstanding at \b End of Period     5,655,714   5,655,714  5,655,714  5,655,714  7,255,714 \b \bUnit Price Range \b High             $    10.25  $     9.90 $    10.20 $    11.45 $    11.26 \b Low(3)           $     8.00  $     8.25 $     7.00 $     8.50 $     9.51 \b Close - \b  December  31    $     9.00  $     8.75 $     8.75 $    11.10 $    10.01 \b Volume              834,339     874,126    877,194  1,276,590  2,086,315 \b \b \b                                    2003       2004       2005       2006 \b \bOperating \b Statistics \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:48 ET (11:48 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"e28012b091259cf37d8493819419d7fb","symR":["SSI"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9690918],"ret5":[1.018069],"Headline":": Stage Stores Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SSI"],"IndustryCodes":["RTS","SAP","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\bHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 02, 2007-- \u001d  Stage Stores, Inc.

That easily beat the average expectation of four analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires for a 2.3% drop. \u001d  Total sales for the year were up 7.1% to EUR6.1 billion, exceeding analysts' forecasts for a 6.9% rise. \u001d  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization or Ebitda rose 2.4% to EUR2.1 billion last year. However, the company said that excluding items from 2005 and adjusted for new entities in 2006, group Ebitda decreased 4% to EUR2.1 billion. \u001d  \"In a highly competitive market, Belgacom has more than held its ground in 2006,\" the company said, crediting Belgacom's strong market position for delivering high-speed Internet. \u001d  Still, the company predicted a rocky 2007, particularly for its mobile communications division Proximus. It said Proximus' Ebitda margin for 2007 could drop to 45%, citing \"intense competition and regulatory pressure\". \u001d  Dexia Bank analyst Rob Goyens said the \"disappointing outlook will take center stage and will lead to further downward revisions of estimates.\" \u001d  Goyens said he is keeping his reduce recommendation and EUR32.7 target price on the stock for now, but will likely lower the target price later Friday. \u001d  Focusing now on converging its various services to help capture more market share, Belgacom said it plans to reduce its workforce by roughly 1,500 people by 2011, on top of the collective deal the company reached in 2005. \u001d  Belgacom said its board will propose a ordinary dividend payout of EUR552 million at the annual meeting set April 11. The dividend comes to EUR1.60 a share, on top of the EUR0.29-a-share interim dividend paid in December. \u001d  Belgacom also said it will propose a cancellation of 23.75 million treasury shares at the April meeting. \u001d  Bank Degroof analyst Siddy Jobe warned, however, that the bad news over the company's mobile outlook \"overrules dividend and cancellation of shares.\" \u001d  Jobe added he will lower his EUR32.50 target price later Friday. He keeps his hold rating for now. \u001d  Belgacom shares rose sharply in the last quarter of 2006, reaching a peak of nearly EUR36 in January, driven by takeover speculation and relatively low valuation. But the stock, along with most other European incumbents, has taken a nosedive in recent weeks due to weak earnings expectations, and fear of the European Union's regulator pinch. \b \u001d  Company Web Sites: http://www.belgacom.com \b \u001d  -By Anne Jolis Dow Jones Newswires; +32 2 741 1488; anne.jolis@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 04:59 ET (09:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e4432f84df2419c0ef4f94a5e4f5a03e","symR":["IDIX"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": SEBIVO(R) (Telbivudine) Approved -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IDIX"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  This press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Bush's call for dramatically boosting its use in the next decade, but it's also raised an important question: how to transport it most efficiently. \u001d  While ethanol has been used as a fuel in the U.S. since the early 1900s, the concentration of its production in the corn-growing Midwest and the relatively small volumes involved have made railcars the most natural choice of long-haul transport since the Energy Act of 2005 and the introduction of the Renewable Fuels Standard, a federal mandate for the use of biofuels. \u001d  That contrasts with gasoline and diesel fuel, which have long been shipped through pipelines in far larger quantities. \u001d  Ethanol demand, largely a function of the Renewable Fuels Standard, will play a big role in determining the course of the fuel's transportation. Between Bush's call to increase the standard to 35 billion gallons of non-petroleum fuel by 2017 and proposed legislation that envisions a standard of as much as 60 billion gallons annually by 2030, ethanol is set to become more entrenched in the U.S. fuel complex. The prospect has fuel marketers and biofuel producers looking at the logistical challenges that have kept ethanol out of pipelines until now and thinking ahead. \u001d  The pipeline companies who serve fuel marketers have concerns about the operational and economic feasibility of shipping ethanol through pipelines. High on the list is \"stress-corrosion cracking,\" that has been observed in pipelines and storage tanks that contain ethanol. Fully understanding how the damage occurs and how to get around it requires substantial research, said Mike Mears, vice president at Magellan Midstream Partners. Magellan's pipeline system stretches from the Texas Gulf Coast to Minnesota near the biggest concentration of biorefineries in the country. \u001d  At a minimum, the industry is two to three years away from having answers on the technical issues, Mears said. He noted that the Pipeline Research Council International is conducting three research initiatives on ethanol transportation. \b \b    Economics Of Ethanol Pipelines Questioned \b \u001d  There are opportunities to move ethanol-blended gasoline in existing pipelines but they're limited. \"It makes sense only if a whole market has to use that blend,\" Mears said, referring to cleaner-burning gasoline required for use in the smoggiest urban areas of the country. However, no pipelines have so far wanted to risk integrity problems by running ethanol blends. Mears is also the current chairman of the Association of Oil Pipelines (AOPL). \u001d  There are also concerns about the economic viability of ethanol-only pipelines. It takes a lot of product to make dedicated pipelines work, said Shirley Neff, AOPL spokeswoman. \u001d  \"Most ethanol plants are small - comparable to an oil well rather than an oil field,\" Neff said. An expensive gathering process and distribution of plants over a wide area makes the aggregation of shipping volumes difficult and high-cost, she said. \"And of course, siting new pipelines is not an easy thing to do,\" Neff added. \u001d  In Mears' opinion, long-haul ethanol pipelines aren't economical under the current Renewable Fuel Standard. \"If it were to increase, the economics could change,\" but an expansion of the standard is by no means certain, Mears said. \u001d  According to the Renewable Fuels Standard, 4.7 billion gallons of renewable fuels must be used in 2007 and increase to 7.5 billion by 2012. Current U.S. gasoline consumption is about 382.2 million gallons a day, or 139.5 billion gallons annually. \u001d  There are other geographical reasons why pipelines aren't the most economical solution. The U.S. \"pipeline system originates in the Gulf Coast and goes north from there,\" said Matt Hartwig, spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, referring to rail, truck and barge transport. \"Ethanol producers would have to ship product down to the Gulf in order to put it into pipelines,\" \b \b     Rail Virtual Pipeline \b \u001d  In addition, the existing fuel pipeline system is filled near to capacity. That leaves rail transport. U.S. rail companies provide the long-haul piece of the \"virtual pipeline\" for ethanol and have increased transport efficiency by running unit trains composed of as many as 90 rail cars that hold 30,000 gallons each. \u001d  Ethanol shipments constitute less than 1% of all the freight hauled by rail in the U.S., but the volume of ethanol shipments is fast increasing. The total increased 2.7 times to 3.18 billion gallons between 2000 and 2006 and is expected to rise by about one third to 4.2 billion gallons by the end of 2007, according to data from the Association of American Railroads. \u001d  Rail companies such as CSX Corp. (CSX) expect to be able to handle a large increase in the Renewable Fuel Standard and relish the prospect of increasing what is now a very small part of their business. \u001d  If a new standard totaled 35 billion gallons and all of that were ethanol moving by rail, the increase in total carloadswould be less than 5%, according to Kyle Hancock, CSX vice president of industrial and agricultural products. \u001d  The ethanol transportation market is a small one for CSX but growing at double-digit rates, it's an emerging market with solid growth possibilities, Hancock said. \u001d  While the Southeast region from the Carolinas to Florida doesn't yet have the terminals to handle unit trains, it's a market \"poised to develop,\" he said. \u001d  Railroads could also increase their participation in the ethanol market at the other end by moving corn to ethanol production facilities, he added. \b \u001d  -By Beth Heinsohn; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4435; beth.heinsohn@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:32 ET (12:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e5d7d841902d92f1f540d73b9b55d1d8","symR":["ANA.MC","ELE","ELE.MC","EN","ENEL.MI","EOA.XE","EON","DE0007614406","ES0125220311","ES0130670112","IT0003128367"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Enel Has Another 4.5M Endesa Shares In Swaps","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ANA.MC","ELE","ELE.MC","EN","ENEL.MI","EOA.XE","EON","DE0007614406","ES0125220311","ES0130670112","IT0003128367"],"IndustryCodes":["CON","ELC","GAS","MUT","OIL","XDAX","XDJGI","XIBEX","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e66371df84c4cbbab3f9468d2fe16ec1","symR":["NET.WA","PLNETIA00014"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Poland's Netia Hldgs 4Q Loss Widens To PLN373M; Revs Shrink","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T06:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NET.WA","PLNETIA00014"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \b  WARSAW (Dow Jones)--Poland's largest alternative telephone operator, Netia Holdings SA (NET.WA), said Friday its consolidated losses widened in the fourth quarter on a shrinking core revenues and rising costs of wireless start-up venture. \u001d  Netia fourth quarter losses widenedto 373 million zlotys ($126.2 million) from a loss of PLN11.6 million in the year-earlier period. \u001d  For 2006, Netia posted a loss of PLN378.9 million compared to a net profit of PLN59 million in 2005. \u001d  The company's fourth quarter total revenues fell 11.7%, to PLN209.7 million, from PLN237.4 million. \u001d  Netia said its share of losses due to start-up costs of P4 recorded for the fourth quarter was PLN15.7 million, and PLN30.7 million in the full year. \u001d  P4, Poland's newest mobile plans to launch third-generation services under the universal mobile telecommunications system, or UMTS, in March 2007. \u001d  Thursday, Netia shares closed flat, at PLN4.50 on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. \u001d  The stock underpefromed over last year due to delayed launch of mobile services by P4. \u001d  Company Website: http://investor.netia.pl \b \u001d  -By Malgorzata Halaba, Dow Jones Newswires; +4822 622-2766; malgorzata.halaba@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 01:28 ET (06:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e6bdc7e38f48530b54de7ff2b4e4acd2","symR":["RBO.UN.T","CA76117K1057"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Resolve Business Outsourcing Income Fund Reports Fourth Quarter and Year-End Results","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RBO.UN.T","CA76117K1057"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC"],"Story":"\b   TORONTO, ONTARIO--(CCNMatthews - March 1, 2007) - \b \bAttention Business and Financial Editors: \b \bResolve Business Outsourcing Income Fund (the \"Fund\") (TSX:RBO.UN) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and the results for the nine and one-half months ended December 31, 2006.

(OTC Bulletin Board: RGBL), announced today that it has signed a Letter of Intent with the Australian Dept. of Defence to provide the Australian military with an Aquair unit for a formal three-month pilot program and potential deployment.  Aquair anticipates that the contract for the pilot program will produce revenue of approximately US$2 million. \b \u001d  During the three-day demonstration in Surfers Paradise Australia, Aquair, utilized its mobile Aquair unit to produce from the humid air and a brackish pond approximately 260 gallons per day of pure, drinkable water, a 30% increase over average production capacity of 200 gallons per day.  Normally, Aquair units extract water solely from the air.  However, during this trial, the Aquair unit was fitted with additional equipment so that it also could process brackish pond water into a potable water supply. \b \u001d  Australia's meager average annual rainfall of 465 mm (18.3 in.), high salinity levels and large geographic areas covered by solid rock without underlying water-holding sedimentary basins all contribute to readily available drinking water being in short supply in much of Australia. \b \u001d  \"Our mobile Aquair 'Air to Water' units will help provide a continuous supply of pure, safe water for the military wherever they go,\" said Louis Knickerbocker, Chairman & CEO of RG Global Lifestyles, the worldwide distributor of the atmospheric water generation units.  \"Where water supplies are contaminated or not readily available, Aquair reduces the need to rely on transported, bottled water -- freeing up resources for transporting other essential supplies to military personnel.\" \b \b    About Aquair and RG Global Lifestyles, Inc.: \b \u001d  Aquair, Inc. solely develops and distributes quality water products.

The redemption will occur on June 4. \u001d  Royal Bank of Canada earned C$1.49 billion or C$1.14 a share in its latest quarter, up from C$1.17 billion or 89 Canadian cents a year earlier. \u001d  The Thomson First Call mean estimate was for a first-quarter profit of 99 Canadian cents a share. \u001d  Return on equity was 27.3% versus 23.9%. \u001d  The bank's loan loss provisions jumped to C$162 million from C$47 million, primarily due to a C$50 million reversal of the general allowance in the year-earlier period and lower corporate recoveries this quarter. \u001d  Royal Bank said total revenue was up 15% to C$5.70 billion in the latest quarter as a result of solid growth in its wealth management and banking businesses. \u001d  The bank's dividend increase is effective with the dividend payable May 24 to shareholders of record on April 25. \u001d  -Judy McKinnon; 416-306-2100; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:54 ET (12:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e89945dd2bd3c328dfe1a8b7da2c0784","symR":["METH"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Methode Electronics, Inc.

The shares will be sold in Brazil and to institutional investors in the U.S. \u001d  The share sales were previously announced in November, when CVRD entered the controlling bloc of Usiminas' shareholders. The shares to be sold by CVRD do not represent the miner's position in the controlling group. \u001d  As part of the new shareholders' deals, CVRD agreed to reduce its stake in Usiminas by selling a portion of its shares to Nippon Steel, Votorantim Participacoes and Camargo Correa. The remaining shares would be sold in a public secondary offer. \u001d  In December 2005, CVRD said it was interested in joining the bloc in an effort to help define the flat-steel makers' future expansion plans. \u001d  CVRD holds a 12.4% stake in Usiminas, representing 5.9% of the controlling group's shares. Previ, which is outside the controlling bloc of shareholders, detains a 14.9% stake in Usiminas. \u001d  As of Nov. 24, Usiminas's controlling group of shareholders held 63.9% of the company's outstanding shares, or 71.7 million shares. The controlling group is lead by Nippon Usiminas, which represents a consortium of Japanese investors led by Nippon Steel Corp. (5401.TO) with a 24.7% stake. \u001d  Two local industrial conglomerates, Votorantim and Camargo Correa, are the second-largest participants in the controlling bloc with a combined 23.1% stake. The pension fund for Usiminas workers had a 10.1% stake. \u001d  The money raised from the sale of Usiminas shares would generate additional cash for CVRD to pay part of the bridge loan used to finance its $18 billion acquisition of Canadian nickel miner Inco Ltd. (N) in the fourth quarter of 2006. CVRD has already refinanced more than 80% of the $15.6 billion bridge loan. \b \u001d  -By Rogerio Jelmayer, Dow Jones Newswires; 5511-3145-1480; rogerio.jelmayer@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:39 ET (12:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ea6f8a32021c41fc0e8590f136187d3a","symR":["13021.FR","5730.FR","ABI.YY","DCX","DCX.XE","LGDDY","DE0007100000","FR0000130213","NL0000235190"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Qatari Minister: Premature To Talk About Qatar EADS Stake","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["13021.FR","5730.FR","ABI.YY","DCX","DCX.XE","LGDDY","DE0007100000","FR0000130213","NL0000235190"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","AUT","MED","PUB","XCA4","XDAX","XDJGI","XENX","XMDAX","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:44 ET (11:44 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ead180802835565e0d91d1597cc1a8b0","symR":["RWE.XE","RWEOY","DE0007037129"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,0.9756703,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,0.9915591,-0.00099],"Headline":"Govt To Rule On RWE Biblis Plant Lifespan Within 2 Wks -2","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RWE.XE","RWEOY","DE0007037129"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","MUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  The decision affects RWE's application to transfer 30 terrawatt-hours of generation capacity over to Biblis A from its Muelheim-Kaerlich nuclear plant.

E.On now finds itself with fewer strategic options for its cash. Its ambition to increase its heft faces a shrinking list of acquisition candidates, rising takeover premiums and meddlesome European politics. \u001d  The German company's share price has fallen nearly 10% in the past week amid no clear signs of a compelling \"Plan B\" if the Endesa takeover fails. The German bank WestLB published a research report on E.On under the heading \"Mission Impossible?\" as it lowered its recommendation on the stock following Enel's surprise move. \u001d  E.On declined to comment and hasn't said much publicly. It issued a brief statement Wednesday reiterating that it \"remains committed\" to acquiring Endesa. Its shares fell 1.5% to 97.63 euros Thursday on Germany's Xetra exchange. \u001d  E.On, of Dusseldorf, has banked heavily on acquiring Endesa to cement its position as Europe's largest power and natural-gas utility by revenue. Electricite de France SA, the continent's other leading utility, has a larger stock-market value. \u001d  Endesa would extend E.On's reach into faster-growing markets in southern Europe and South America. Until now, E.On has focused on Central Europe, the U.K., Nordic countries and the U.S. \u001d  Italy's Enel bought a 9.99% stake in Endesa late Tuesday. It secured rights to another 11.58% on Thursday through share-swap deals to boost its stake to 21.57%, pending Spanish regulatory approval. Enel's holdings, combined with a 21% stake held by Spain's Acciona SA, could make it all but impossible for E.On to secure control. \u001d  Under Spanish takeover laws, E.On also can't increase its current offer, which expires at the end of March. When that offer expires, the company is prohibited from making a new offer for six months unless another company makes a bid to acquire Endesa. \u001d  E.On may try to challenge the recent moves by Enel and Acciona in court, especially if there is any indication that the Italian and Spanish companies broke takeover rules by acting in concert to block the bid. But such a legal strategy is no sure thing and could drag out the dispute indefinitely. \"If it takes years, this could be more of a negative than a positive,\" says Susana Penarrubia Fraguas, a fund manager who focuses on utilities at Deutsche Asset Management, a unit of Deutsche Bank AG. (She declined to say whether the fund owns E.On shares.) \u001d  Some analysts and investors say E.On may also try to sit down with Enel and Acciona to win their support by offering to share some of Endesa's assets or other holdings. But such concessions could prove costly and are no sure thing, especially if Enel or Acciona are intent on gaining control themselves, they add. \u001d  At the same time, E.On's management has less room to maneuver if another company makes a takeover offer for Endesa and the German company can make a renewed bid. E.On's current offer of 38.75 euros a share, raised twice during the past year, is already 41% higher than its original bid of 27.50 euros in February 2006. \"Above 40 euros, I don't think many [E.On] investors would be happy with this takeover,\" said Stella Dombrowsky, a buy-side analyst in Zurich at the private bank Julius Baer. \u001d  But other acquisition targets also have become increasingly expensive after share prices of European utilities jumped by about a third in euro terms last year. Targets also have become increasingly scarce after E.On's bid for Endesa triggered a consolidation push in Europe's power sector. \u001d  Spain's Iberdrola SA recently agreed to a friendly takeover of Scottish Power PLC after E.On broke off talks with the U.K. utility in late 2005. Essent NV and Nuon NV of the Netherlands recently agreed to merge and France's Suez SA and Gaz de France SA are hoping to combine their businesses. \u001d  Governments still hold stakes in utilities in such countries as Italy, France, the Czech Republic and Finland, making takeovers even tougher as protectionist sentiment rises in Europe. Many politicians view utilities as strategic assets and want to keep them in the hands of national champions -- as has been the case in Spain, where the government set up frequent roadblocks in the past 12 months to slow down E.On's takeover bid for Endesa. \u001d  E.On's management has signaled it would like to tackle Russia's electricity market, enter Turkey and expand its small footprint in Italy. Analysts say E.On also could try to boost its exposure in the U.S. or pursue some companies on the privatization block in a handful of Eastern European countries. \u001d  But such investments could take a lot of time and likely involve lots of small steps instead of the quantum leap that Endesa represents. \"You're not going to be able to get a quick fix,\" said Christopher Kuplent, a utilities analyst in London with Credit Suisse. \u001d  In the near term, say analysts and investors, E.On might be confined to buying back its shares and increasing dividends in a bid to keep investors on board if the Endesa takeover falls through. \u001d  E.On reported revenue of 49.45 billion euros and net income of 2.63 billion euros in the first nine months of 2006. It had a net cash position of 1.04 billion euros and 12.5 billion euros in liquid funds at the end of September. \u001d  --- \u001d  Keith Johnson in Madrid contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:31 ET (05:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"edee07191636b007b25a34e546f4b987","symR":["HYSL"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Hyperion Solutions Cut To Neutral From Buy At First Albany","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T09:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HYSL"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 04:32 ET (09:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ee41b74fc56c5646b5a74a73993f072d","symR":["BRW"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Bristol West Holdings, Inc.

And on reflection that was the right thing to do. Because rather than undoing our analysis, if anything this week's events have served to highlight key issues that we want to draw investors' attention to. \u001d  It is with some irony that in the midst of the most turbulent week in financial markets in many months, perhaps years, we say that the central theme of our latest quarterly G4 forecast is an optimistic one. \u001d  Abstracting from this week's turbulence for a moment, lower oil prices play a large role in our thinking. We have interpreted the decline since mid 2006 as a positive supply shock, delivering stronger growth and lower inflation. Goldilocks, it seems, is back. \u001d  The major downside risks to the smooth running of the global payments system that have dogged financial markets in recent years, in the shape of a run on the dollar and a housing-led U.S. recession have receded, both in terms of their likely severity and in terms of the likelihood of their occurring. \u001d  It is not so much the actual change in asset prices that occurred this week that has got people worked up. All said and done, the net change in asset prices has been relatively small. But rather it is what it might portend. \u001d  As ever there are risks to this benign outlook, as this week has amply demonstrated. The major downside risk that we identified was an abrupt unwinding of the yen carry trade. \u001d  The yen today is perhaps the world's most undervalued currency. It recently hit a four-year low against the dollar and an all-time low against the euro. Its real trade-weighted value has fallen to its lowest level since at least 1985, the year of the Plaza Accord. \u001d  The Economist's Big Mac index suggests that the yen is some 40% undervalued against the euro. Our own modeling work suggests that it could be similarly undervalued against the dollar. Its weakness is of course linked to the increasingly ubiquitous carry trade. \u001d  At its simplest, the carry trade involves borrowing in yen at very low interest rates to buy higher-yielding assets, such as U.S. or New Zealand bonds. \u001d  This weakens the yen and strengthens other asset prices as investors sell the borrowed yen for other currencies. The existence of this carry trade is widely blamed for the surprising weakness of the yen, and the correspondingly surprising strength of other higher yielding assets. \u001d  To get an insight into the pervasive nature of the carry trade in today's financial system, Google \"yen carry trade.\" You will get more than 70,000 hits, many including a bloodcurdling warning of impending financial disaster. \u001d  It is rather easy to see the attractiveness of the yen carry trade by using a real world example. Take an investor who went short yen and reinvested in dollars, unhedged. Ignoring transactions costs, he would have earned a cumulative return of 37% between January 2000 and January 2007. \u001d  Nonetheless, this upsets economists. Their textbooks more or less rule out the profitable existence of the carry trade. \u001d  In theory, foreign exchange markets operate under uncovered interest parity. At its simplest, this states that the interest differential between two countries should equal the expected exchange rate change, and hence investors should be indifferent between holding any one of two currencies. Under UIP then, a country with high interest rates is compensating investors for the risk that its currency will depreciate, and vice versa. \u001d  There are two plausible explanations for this apparent anomaly. The first is the traditional appeal to the exchange rate risk premium, which could dominate interest rate differentials. \u001d  The second, and in our view more pertinent explanation, is that the distribution of likely outcomes for the yen-dollar exchange rate is heavily skewed. For example, investors might put a 90% probability on the yen-dollar exchange rate remaining unchanged over the next year, but would attach a 10% probability to the yen appreciating by 40%. \u001d  The UIP condition is not violated, but investors could still make a profit by borrowing in yen and lending in dollars nine times out of 10. \u001d  However there will always be that 10% risk of a reversal. And that was the key message from this week's turbulence. In all likelihood, the global payments system should avoid a major crunch, but there is a small but significant risk that it could all end in tears. \u001d  Hence even though Japanese interest rates will remain incredibly low by international standards in all but the most extreme scenarios, carry investors are nonetheless vulnerable to low probability, high impact events. That is why the carry trade has been compared to picking up nickels in front of a steamroller. \u001d  This is not an entirely new phenomenon. \u001d  It used to be known as the peso problem during much of the 1980s and 1990s, when the Mexican peso was the favored counterpart to the dollar as it consistently offered a positive interest rate differential. Until that is events like the 1984 Latin American debt crisis and the so-called Tequila crisis of 1995 wiped out most of the preceding years' gains. \u001d  There is of course a more recent historical precedent. \u001d  Many credit a rapid unwinding of the yen carry trade with a good deal of ensuing financial turmoil in the final few months of 1998. The combination of Russia's default, the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management and the Japanese government's attempt to recapitalise Japan's ailing banking system, proved too much for those betting on a permanently weak yen. \u001d  The yen rose by 12% in just 3 days between the Oct. 5 and Oct. 8, 1998, pushing U.S. 10-year yields up by 65 basis points. Many also credit the then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan with preventing a far more problematic credit crunch by swiftly cutting U.S. interest rates. \u001d  What is unclear is just how big the carry trade is. The problem is that these trades typically occur off-balance sheet via instruments like currency swaps, which makes its size very difficult to estimate. Estimates range from as little as $39 billion to $1 trillion. \u001d  But using 1998 as a guide, we find that depending on the size of the carry trade, an abrupt reversal could reduce U.S. growth by up to 1.4 percentage points. The ensuing financial market turmoil could of course outweigh the macroeconomic impact. \u001d  And in our view, the most likely trigger is rising yen volatility. \u001d  Of course there are risks to the upside, too. Principal among them is the risk posed by excess real money balances, which remain at close to multi-decade highs. \u001d  Again exceptionally low Japanese interest rates are a factor here, but European credit demand is also contributing. Despite tightening monetary conditions, euro area M3 growth shows no sign yet of easing. \u001d  The risk is that this monetary overhang begins to find its way through to higher nominal demand, and inflation in particular. \u001d  That could push already elevated inflation expectations up further, forcing even reluctant central banks to tighten monetary policy more than currently expected. \u001d  We attach a 52% chance to ECB rates reaching beyond 4% within the next year; and a 21% chance that U.S. rates reach 6%. \u001d  Despite this week's gyrations, we forecast that 2007 should be a bonanza year for equity markets. One of the key reasons for arguing this is valuations, which remain historically low. \u001d  Japan has the highest price-earnings ratio in our sample. But even that is only 20, roughly half what it was in the late 1980s or where it stood in 2000 for the Nasdaq. \u001d  By contrast, we expect this year to be another tough one for bonds. Valuations are high and despite lower oil prices, stronger global growth implies upward pressure on core inflation. \u001d  But beware those low probability, high impact events. \b \u001d  By Danny Gabay, 44-207-796-9561; danny.gabay@fathom-consulting.com \u001d  (Danny Gabay is director of Fathom Financial Consulting and was previously chief UK economist for JP Morgan Chase.) \u001d  Opinions expressed are those of the author, and not of Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  This column is published for information only, and it neither constitutes, nor is to be construed as, an offer to buy or sell investments.

The operating margin before property transactions, interest and tax increased to 10.5% (2006: 9.8%), with higher sales leading to improvements in this area. Net interest was covered 3.5 times (2006: 3.2 times) by operating profit. Total capital investment was GBP33.2 million.\" \u001d  \"Free cash flow, after capital investment of GBP10.5 million in existing pubs, GBP1.1 million in respect of share purchases under the Company's Share Incentive Plan and payments of tax and interest, declined to GBP25.6 million (2006: GBP28.6 million). This decline was due to higher operating profits off-set by higher expenditure on existing pubs, a higher tax charge, timing differences in respect of payments to trade creditors, resulting from the period ending later in the month than in the previous year and planned increases in inventory. This resulted in free cash flow per share of 17.0 pence (2006: 16.8 pence) before investment in new pubs, proceeds from pub disposals and dividend payments.  In the period under review, all our new pub capital expenditure was financed from free cash flow. In addition we purchased 7.8 million of our own shares for cancellation at a cost of GBP40.8 million, with a cash outflow of GBP37.3 million in the period. \" \u001d  \"The first half saw the opening of 8 new pubs with a full year target of approximately 20. We also completed the disposal of 3 pubs, which had previously been identified for sale, to end the half year with 662 pubs. As previously indicated, the rate of new pub openings is expected to increase to around 30 per annum from the new financial year. \" \u001d  \"For many years, the Company has paid a high percentage of its profits through bonuses and share incentives to all levels of employees. In the period under review, the company paid bonuses of GBP9.0 million to employees, 90% of which was paid to people working in our pubs. In addition, we purchased GBP1.1 million worth of Wetherspoon shares under the SIP Scheme; taking into account previous purchases made, this results in a total pool of shares held on behalf of employees worth GBP23 million. Pubs depend, above all, on high levels of service, and these profit and share schemes help us to achieve the highest level of average sales of any substantial pub company.\" \u001d  \"The Company continues to extend the scope and range of its products and services. Average sales per pub have expanded from approximately GBP500,000 per annum at the time of our flotation to an annualised rate of approximately GBP1.36 million per annum in the current year. During this time food sales have increased from about GBP500 per week to about GBP6,700 per week at the current time. Including drinks sales which accompany a meal, approximately 50% of our overall sales now relate to food. In addition, in the last couple of years, we have sought to increase coffee sales and are currently selling approximately 450,000 coffees per week. We have also extended our opening hours and are offering breakfasts and sell approximately 230,000 of these per week.\" \u001d  \"As regards our drinks offers, we are currently placing a strong emphasis on traditional ale sales and sell approximately 33 million pints of real ale per annum. Ale volumes are currently growing by around 5%. We have also introduced a number of products rarely available in British pubs including our top selling cider Kopparberg, the number one Swedish cider; Wetherspoon sells more Kopparberg than anyone in the world, including Sweden. Our fastest growing bottled beer range comes from Poland and we have also introduced a range of guest lagers on draught from around the world. This selection of bar products, combined with our substantial investment in new technology for keeping beer at the required temperature throughout the year, will help us to gain a commercial advantage in the future.\" \u001d  \"The Company now operates 61 non-smoking pubs outside Scotland, which have either been converted from 'smoking pubs' or have opened in the last couple of years as non-smoking pubs. The converted pubs showed substantial declines in sales and profits in the year following their conversion, but have shown encouraging like-for-like sales and profits growth, above the Company average, in the period under review. Scottish pubs, in which smoking was banned by legislation in March 2006, have performed at a better level than expected, with like-for-like sales increasing by 5% in the period under review, and with profits at the same level as the previous year.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:06 ET (07:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f44dac0674a4476c8bb9aa5a15b34f05","symR":["3893.TO","3941.TO","8053.TO","SSUMY","JP3404600003","JP3754300006","JP3981400009"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9607843,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.016807,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Sumitomo,Nippon Paper,Rengo:To Jointly Procure Raw Materials","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T06:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["3893.TO","3941.TO","8053.TO","SSUMY","JP3404600003","JP3754300006","JP3981400009"],"IndustryCodes":["CTR","DIB","PAP","SVC","X225","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 01:08 ET (06:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f5246a752fe71611b4573038707345a7","symR":["ADEN.VX","ADO","CH0012138605"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Adecco 06 Net Pft Was Expected At EUR540M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T06:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ADEN.VX","ADO","CH0012138605"],"IndustryCodes":["EAG","SVC","XDJGI","XNYA","XSMI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 01:03 ET (06:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f55dac4b5542eb0482dff01c81198519","symR":["SDR.LN","GB0002405495"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CORRECT: Schroders Net 2006 Outflow GBP3.8B Not GBP6.4B","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SDR.LN","GB0002405495"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","BNK","FIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  For the year, the company suffered a net outflow of GBP3.8 billion, though gains at its funds helped lift assets by nearly 5% from last year's GBP122.5 billion. \u001d  (\"UPDATE: Schroders Pretax Profit +26% On Higher Margins,\" published at 0735 GMT misstated the net outflow of assets in 2006.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:42 ET (07:42 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f56f4ddfcf83d993baf724ee02301b25","symR":["JDW.LN","JDWPY","GB0001638955"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"JD Wetherspoon Cautions On 2H Outlook","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T07:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JDW.LN","JDWPY","GB0001638955"],"IndustryCodes":["RES","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 02:00 ET (07:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f5fdc126685a5582c034c371608851b0","symR":["AH"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Armor Holdings, Inc.

A level below 100% means the company is profitable. \u001d  Zurich Financial said the closing of the transaction is subject to approval by Bristol West stockholders and regulatory approvals. \u001d  Meanwhile, Zurich Financial said that reference shareholder Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and its affiliates, which hold 42.18% in the U.S. group have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. \u001d  The completion date depends on SEC filings, and insurance regulatory approvals and clearance, as well as other factors, Zurich Financial said. \b \u001d  Company Web Sites: http://www.zurich.com \b \u001d  -By Goran Mijuk, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 80 47; goran.mijuk@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 01:46 ET (06:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f735f70655d285262e627ab7f9fdb513","symR":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[1.002585,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.046316,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Royal Bank Of Canada 1Q Loan Loss Pvsn C$162M Vs C$47M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:35 ET (12:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f7593c1f78efd7a2047c192ab79790b7","symR":["38380.AE","NL0000383800","38380.AE","NL0000383800","38380.AE","NL0000383800"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Smit Rotterdam Tug Crew Strike Temporarily Suspended -Union","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T09:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["38380.AE","NL0000383800"],"IndustryCodes":["MAR"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Corrected March 2, 2007 05:19 ET (10:19 GMT)\u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 04:55 ET (09:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f850e910bb84b5b76445c1bedf8be924","symR":["ATPG"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"ATP Oil & Gas 2006 Production Rose 155%, Reserves Replacement Ratio 315%>ATPG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T05:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ATPG"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:08 ET (05:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f8b4cbfa8606aaa6916f8e69e3e3e367","symR":["ACET"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9925094],"ret5":[1.013733],"Headline":": Aceto Announces Promotions at its Wholly Owned Subsidiary, Aceto Pharma Corp.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:59:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACET"],"IndustryCodes":["CHC","CHM","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bLAKE SUCCESS, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 02, 2007-- \u001d  Aceto Corporation (NASDAQ:ACET), a global leader in the sourcing, regulatory support, marketing and distribution of chemically derived pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals and crop protection products, today announced promotions at Aceto Pharma Corp, its wholly owned Human and Veterinary Pharmaceuticals company. \b \b   Those promoted were: \b \b   Brian Shapiro to Vice President - Human Pharmaceuticals \b \b   David Rimmler to Vice President - Veterinary Pharmaceuticals \b \b   David Petrocine to Vice President - Regulatory Affairs \b \u001d  Leonard S.

(GPS) said an internal strategic review has determined that its business has been hurt by poorly placed executives, too much corporate centralization and too much spending amid sluggish demand for its fashions. \u001d  \"Bottom line, we were not clear about who we were,\" Bob Fisher, Gap's chairman and interim chief executive, told analysts on a Thursday conference call. \"Our product and execution suffered and our financial results were unacceptable.\" \u001d  The San Francisco-based specialty apparel retailer launched a strategic review of its operations in January, shortly before ousting former President and CEO Paul Pressler, a former Walt Disney Co. (DIS) executive who won praise for ordering Gap's finances but who critics said knew little about fashion. Other Disney veterans hired by Pressler to senior positions at the Gap also have recently left the company. \u001d  \"We did not have the right leaders in the right positions, and we lost too much talent,\" Fisher said. \u001d  Fisher said the company's board is close to appointing an executive search firm to lead its search for a new chief executive. In response to an analyst's question, Fisher said he won't be a potential candidate. \u001d  A second major problem for Gap has been an overzealous effort to cut costs by centralizing its operations, Fisher said. While this strategy worked in areas like finance and information technology, \"it created bureaucracy and distractions\" elsewhere, he said. One misguided effort was to centralize the buying of merchandise from overseas manufacturers at its Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic brands. \u001d  \"Ultimately, this slowed us down,\" Fisher said. \"The brands were not able to make independent decisions based upon their own distinct product and merchandising strategies.\" \u001d  Gap said it also aims to rein in costs - particularly in marketing - which have risen too much given the retailer's disappointing sales. Nevertheless, the company said it expects to increase its square footage by 1% during its current fiscal year. It plans to open about 230 stores, mostly Old Navy locations, and close about 200 stores, mainly in the Gap brand. \u001d  Executives added on Thursday's conference call that the company aims to \"lock down the customer target and get the product right\" before it decides how it will \"right-size\" the Gap chain. While the company's capital spending budget will be higher this year, that's mainly driven by remodeling of older stores, executives said. \u001d  \"Over the course of the year, our new business leaders will evaluate their brand's store economics which could, of course, influence the number of future store openings and closings,\" Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said in a written statement given to Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  The statement was given in response to a Dow Jones Newswires article published Wednesday, which reported that Gap has failed to renew some of its leases in higher-rent shopping areas, prompting speculation that the company is looking to conserve cash amid sagging sales. \u001d  Marka Hansen, the newly named president of the North American Gap brand, said she aims to narrow the customer demographic that's being targeted by the chain. While Gap has pursued customers between 18 and 35, that's an overly broad range, Hansen said. When the company settles on its target, \"it clearly will not be the 18-year-old,\" she said. \u001d  While Gap's torrid growth in the late 1990s was fueled by the casualization of the workplace, Gap has since spurred imitators that have improved on its strategy of offering casual, stylish clothing. \u001d  \"I absolutely know that we're not the brand of 10 years ago,\" Hansen said. But she added that she thinks Gap can \"reclaim an authority position\" in \"things like denim, like clean bottoms, like being there for people who are either casual work or casual weekend.\" \u001d  Fisher said the company will focus this year on improving its products and stores, retaining and developing talent, and streamlining its organizational structure. Gap, which announced this week it will close its fledgling Forth & Towne women's clothing chain, said it expects to earn 76 cents to 86 cents a share for its current fiscal year, including a loss of four cents a share to close Forth & Towne. \u001d  On Thursday, Gap said net income for its fiscal fourth quarter plunged 35%, to $219 million, or 27 cents a share, from $337 million, or 39 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales for the quarter rose 2.3%, to $4.93 billion from $4.82 billion. \u001d  Gap shares in after-market trades recently were at $19.25, up 22 cents, or 1.1% from 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. \u001d  -By James Covert, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5360 \u001d  james.covert@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:33 ET (12:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f8f02c1ef8a029f5af7772df54eb5ad7","symR":["INTU"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9804258],"ret5":[0.9478022],"Headline":"Intuit Upped To Sector Outperformer From Performer By CIBC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["INTU"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:56 ET (11:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f92de194f4f4371133a5a3dbad2254b6","symR":["LSE.LN","GB00B0SWJX34","LSE.LN","NDAQ","GB00B0SWJX34"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9738053,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.979469,-0.00099],"Headline":"London Stock Exchange: Nasdaq Stock Market Holds 29.1%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LSE.LN","GB00B0SWJX34"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:36 ET (12:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f993a6713f5e691f5feb51a18dd22923","symR":["ALK"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9794677],"ret5":[0.9713561],"Headline":": Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan Introduces One-Way Awards Systemwide and Creates New 7,500-Mile Award for Travel Within State of Alaska","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T13:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ALK"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"First Major U.S. Airline to Offer Convenience of One-Way Awards \b \b \u001d  SEATTLE, March 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan has introduced one-way mileage awards for travel anywhere Alaska Airlines and sister carrier Horizon Air fly.

(UPS) last week postponed taking delivery of freighter versions of the plane. The only other two customers for the plane, FedEx Corp. (FDX) and International Lease Finance Corp., a unit of American International Group Inc. (AIG), canceled their orders last year. \u001d  EADS spokesman Michael Hauger told Dow Jones Newswires that Airbus remains committed to a freighter version of the A380, but \"there is a new development schedule.\" He said the company sees sales potential for 400 models of the A380 freight aircraft in the next 20 years. \u001d  UPS hasn't heard anything new from Airbus since the two companies made last week's announcement, UPS spokesman Norman Black said. He reiterated that UPS originally was scheduled to take its first delivery of the 10 A380 freighters in 2009, but that last fall Airbus advised the company that the date was slipping and the earliest UPS could get an aircraft was 2010. Last week, the delivery date was pushed back again, Black said. \u001d  UPS disclosed in its 10-K filing late Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the revised schedule specifies delivery dates between 2012 and 2013. \u001d  Airbus has been beset by problems with the A380, which will be the largest passenger plane in the world. Wiring problems have caused average delays in deliveries of the plane of two years and caused Airbus to slash profit forecasts as it pays out compensation for the delays to customers. \u001d  However, stopping work on a freighter version of the plane will take some of the pressure off the plane maker, allowing it to utilize the capacity for passenger versions of the plane. \u001d  The first passenger version of the A380 is set to fly with Singapore Airlines Ltd. (S55.SG) in October of this year. It currently has 166 orders for the plane in total. Earlier this month, Airbus chief operating officer for customers, John Leahy, said the plane maker expects to sell 20 more of the A380s this year. \u001d  However, compensation for existing customers for the delays is set to hit Airbus hard. \u001d  Thai Airways International PCL (THAI.TH) said earlier this month Airbus had offered it a discount of more than $10 million on each of four A330 aircraft as compensation for delays in the delivery of six A380s. Cash compensation of $28.08 million will be deducted from payments for the order, the airline said. The list price for an A330 is $140 million, but airlines typically negotiate discounts on the list prices. \u001d  Airbus Tuesday announced a restructuring plan aimed at counteracting some of the damage done by the A380 delays, as well as dollar weakness. It is seeking to generate annual cost savings of EUR2.1 billion by 2010 and generate cumulative additional cash flow of EUR5 billion from 2007 to 2010 by cutting 10,000 jobs over the next four years and possibly selling or closing several manufacturing plants. \u001d  -By Steve McGrath, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9284; steve.mcgrath@dowjones.com \u001d  (Desiree J.

Corporation (NASDAQ:ATPG) today announced annual and fourth quarter 2006 results which includes record revenues, record production, and record reserves. \b \b   2006 results include: \b \b   --  Increased production of 155% to a record 50.9 Bcfe and fourth \b        quarter production of 186% to 15.4 Bcfe; \b \b   --  Reported 636.9 Bcfe of proved reserves (+21%) and 213.8 Bcfe \b        of proved developed reserves (+67%) at year-end; \b \b   --  Replaced 315% of production, exceeding the company's target of \b        200%; \b \b   --  Realization of record annual and fourth quarter revenue of \b        $419.8 million and $132.9 million, respectively; \b \b   --  Realization of an annual and fourth quarter net loss available \b        to common shareholders of $39.3 million and $37.0 million, \b        respectively; \b \b   --  Commencement of first production at five new projects, \b        including Mississippi Canyon (\"MC\") 711 in the deepwater Gulf \b        of Mexico and Tors in the U.K. North Sea; and \b \b   --  Completion of three capital financings, the latest of which \b        eliminated the 13.5% and 12.5% dividend rates by redeeming all \b        of the company's preferred shares and reducing the cost of its \b        debt capital approximately 200 basis points. \b \b   Recent and year-to-date highlights include: \b \b   --  Acquisition of Aconcagua and Anduin in the deepwater Gulf of \b        Mexico in January 2007 -- not included in year-end 2006 proved \b        reserves; \b \b   --  Achievement of first production at Garrow on February 21, 2007 \b        -- Tors field currently producing in excess of 50 MMcfe/d net; \b \b   --  Resumed production at Garden Banks 409 (\"Ladybug\") on February \b        13, 2007; and \b \b   --  Initiated flow from the third well at MC 711 on March 1, 2007 \b        -- field production to increase above 120 MMcfe/d net in \b        March. \b \b   Results of Operations \b \u001d  Natural gas and oil production increased 155% to 50.9 Bcfe for 2006. Natural gas and oil production increased 186% to 15.4 Bcfe for the fourth quarter 2006 compared to the fourth quarter 2005. The increase in annual and fourth quarter 2006 production was primarily attributable to achieving first production at Mississippi Canyon 711 and Tors in the first quarter 2006 as well as restoring production in 2006 at certain properties impacted by hurricanes Rita and Katrina in 2005. \b \u001d  Commodity price realizations increased 11% from $7.36 per Mcfe for 2005 to $8.14 per Mcfe for 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to higher Gulf of Mexico natural gas and crude oil price realizations in the early part of 2006 offset by lower North Sea natural gas price realizations. Commodity price realizations decreased 11% from $9.27 per Mcfe for the fourth quarter 2005 to $8.26 per Mcfe for the fourth quarter 2006. The decrease reflected lower Gulf of Mexico and North Sea natural gas price realizations partially offset by higher crude oil price realizations. \b \u001d  Natural gas and oil revenues totaled $419.8 million for 2006 and $132.9 million for the fourth quarter 2006, compared to $146.7 million for 2005 and $49.9 million for the fourth quarter 2005. The increase in natural gas and oil revenues reflects increased production volumes and improved crude oil and natural gas price realizations in the Gulf of Mexico offset by lower natural gas price realizations in the North Sea. \b \u001d  Lease operating expense (LOE) per Mcfe was $1.42 for 2006 and $1.15 for the fourth quarter 2006, compared to $1.19 for 2005 and $1.53 for the fourth quarter 2005. The annual 2006 per Mcfe increase reflects the price spikes experienced for materials and labor in the Gulf of Mexico after the 2005 hurricanes. The fourth quarter 2006 decrease is primarily attributable to higher production volumes. \b \u001d  General and administrative expense (G&A) totaled $21.5 million for 2006 and $7.0 million for the fourth quarter 2006, compared to $24.3 for 2005 and $11.0 million for the fourth quarter 2005. The decrease in G&A was primarily due to the prior year inclusion of the ATP Employee Volvo Challenge and other compensation-related costs. \b \u001d  Depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) per Mcfe was $3.34 for 2006 and $3.52 for the fourth quarter 2006, compared to $3.22 for 2005 and $2.99 for the fourth quarter 2005. The increase in DD&A per Mcfe primarily reflects continued increases in offshore project costs. \b \u001d  ATP recorded a net loss available to common shareholders for 2006 of $39.3 million or $1.33 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss available to common shareholders for 2005 of $12.6 million or $0.43 per basic and diluted share. ATP recorded a net loss available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter 2006 of $37.0 million or $1.24 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter 2005 of $0.3 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share. \b \u001d  Net income available to common shareholders for 2006 was impacted by three non-cash items, including impairment of oil and gas properties of $19.5 million, a loss on abandonment of $9.6 million, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $28.1 million. Research analysts typically exclude these items from their published estimates. Accordingly, after adjusting for these items, ATP had net income available to common shareholders of $17.9 million or $0.60 and $0.59 per basic and diluted share. A non-GAAP reconciliation is provided near the end of this press release. \b \u001d  ATP's selected operating statistics and financial information, included within this press release, contain additional information on the company's activities for annual and fourth quarter 2006 as well as comparable periods in 2005. \b \b                                Three Months Ended     Year Ended \b                                   December 31,       December 31, \b                                -------------------------------------- \b                                  2006      2005     2006      2005 \b                                ------------------ ------------------- \bSelected Operating Statistics \b \bProduction \b  Natural gas (MMcf)               8,844    4,582    31,224    15,614 \b  Oil and condensate (MBbls)       1,091      133     3,273       717 \b  Natural gas equivalents \b   (MMcfe)                        15,392    5,377    50,860    19,914 \b    Gulf of Mexico (GOM, in \b     MMcfe)                       11,545    5,034    38,696    18,659 \b    North Sea (MMcfe)              3,846      343    12,164     1,255 \b \b \bAverage Prices (includes effect \b of cash flow hedges) \b  Natural gas (per Mcf)         $   8.29  $  9.64  $   7.50  $   7.46 \b    Natural gas (per Mcf) - GOM     7.90     9.20      7.59      7.31 \b    Natural gas (per Mcf) - N. \b     Sea                            8.80    15.06      7.35      9.17 \b  Oil and condensate (per Bbl)     49.28    43.03     54.25     41.92 \b  Natural gas, oil and \b   condensate (per Mcfe)            8.26     9.27      8.14      7.36 \b \bOther Expenses, per Mcfe \b  Lease operating expense (per \b   Mcfe)                        $   1.15  $  1.53  $   1.42  $   1.19 \b    Lease operating expense \b     (per Mcfe) - GOM               0.97     1.54      1.42      1.16 \b    Lease operating expense \b     (per Mcfe) - N.

The remaining three blocks were acquired at the 2006 Western and Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sales. Total cash acquisition costs in the Gulf of Mexico in 2006 were $34.4 million. \b \u001d  Telemark Hub -- ATP acquired a 100% working interest in Mississippi Canyon 941 and 942 and Atwater Valley 63, collectively called the Telemark Hub, in two separate private transactions in the second and third quarters 2006. The Telemark Hub contains proved and probable reserves as well as additional exploratory opportunities. As of December 31, 2006, the company had begun engineering and construction of a floating drilling and production facility for the Telemark Hub which is expected to be installed in mid-2008. ATP serves as operator of each of the blocks. \b \u001d  Ship Shoal 351 -- ATP increased its working interest from 50% to 100% at Ship Shoal 351. There are no proved reserves associated with this acquisition, although previous drilling has indicated the presence of recoverable hydrocarbons. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 03:45 ET (08:45 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"fd41df7bf7a130b9f227be331c8d45df","symR":["000270.SE","KR7000270009"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Kia Motors Feb Sales Dn 10.7% On Yr To 103,373 Units","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T05:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["000270.SE","KR7000270009"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 00:31 ET (05:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fd4944f2a8f3b7f66d9629472d5a4e15","symR":["IWA"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Iowa Telecom Reports Results for -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T11:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IWA"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\bTotal Telephone Access \b Lines                         252,000     258,700    (6,700)   -2.6% \b \bLong Distance Subscribers      146,600     142,800     3,800     2.7% \bDial-up Internet \b Subscribers                    31,500      41,700   (10,200)  -24.5% \bDSL Subscribers                 50,000      31,200    18,800    60.3% \b \b \b                            4th Quarter 3rd Quarter      Change \b                                                    ----------------- \bKey Operating Statistics          2006        2006   Amount   Percent \b                            ----------- ----------- --------- ------- \bTelephone Access Lines \b     ILEC Lines (1)            228,200     230,600    (2,400)   -1.0% \b     CLEC Lines (2)             23,800      23,000       800     3.5% \bTotal Telephone Access \b Lines                         252,000     253,600    (1,600)   -0.6% \b \bLong Distance Subscribers      146,600     145,900       700     0.5% \bDial-up Internet \b Subscribers                    31,500      33,700    (2,200)   -6.5% \bDSL Subscribers                 50,000      45,000     5,000    11.1% \b \b(1) Includes lines subscribed by our incumbent local exchange carrier \b retail customers and lines subscribed by our \"wholesale\" customers \b who are competing local exchange carriers.

The increase was primarily the result of an $8.6 \b        million, or 27.8% increase, in other services and sales \b        revenue. Specifically, the increase was due to a $5.8 million, \b        or 51.6%, increase in DSL Internet access revenue, as well as \b        from the growth of our CPE business as a result of our \b        acquisition of Baker Communications in August 2006. \b \b   --  Operating Costs and Expenses increased $2.0 million, or 1.3%, \b        to $156.4 million in 2006 as compared to 2005. Cost of service \b        and sales increased $2.4 million, or 3.8%, principally due our \b        acquisition of Baker Communications. Selling, general and \b        administrative expenses increased $434,000, or 1.0%, which \b        included a pension settlement charge increase of $1.5 million \b        and a $526,000 increase in non-cash equity-based compensation. \b        Also contributing to the increase in selling, general and \b        administrative expenses was a $2.0 million benefit in 2005 \b        resulting from the settlement of past access disputes. \b        Offsetting these increases was a $4.2 million gain on the sale \b        of eight exchanges during the period. Depreciation and \b        amortization decreased by $864,000, or 1.8%, for 2006 as \b        compared to 2005. \b \b   --  Operating Income increased to $77.7 million in 2006 compared \b        to $77.2 million in 2005. \b \b   --  Interest Expense increased $619,000, or 2.0%, in 2006 as \b        compared to 2005, principally as a result of higher interest \b        rates on our variable rate debt and the increase in the rate \b        on our interest rate swap agreement resulting from the \b        extension of the term in August 2005. \b \b   --  Interest and Dividend Income decreased $125,000, or 11.6%, in \b        2006, due primarily to higher RTFC dividend income in 2005. \b \b   --  Earnings Before Income Taxes for the year was $46.4 million, \b        and was in line with 2005. \b \b   --  Income Tax Expense for 2006 was $12.3 million compared to zero \b        in 2005. The Company paid actual cash income taxes in 2006 of \b        $964,000. \b \b   --  Net Income decreased to $34.0 million in 2006 from $46.4 \b        million 2005. The decrease was primarily the result of \b        non-cash book income tax expense of $12.3 million in 2006. \b \b   --  Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and \b        Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA as defined herein) was $124.3 \b        million for 2006 as compared with $127.9 million for 2005. The \b        decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of the \b        previously described pension settlement charges, and the \b        benefit of the one-time settlement of access disputes during \b        2005. \b \b   --  Total Access Linesdecreased by 6,700, or 2.6%, for 2006 as \b        compared to 2005. Incumbent local exchange carrier access \b        lines declined by 9,700 lines and CLEC lines increased by \b        3,000 lines from the end of 2005. During the year, 2,100 \b        access lines, 1,350 cable television subscribers, and \b        approximately 500 High Speed Internet subscribers were \b        acquired as the result of the acquisition of Montezuma Mutual \b        Telephone Company and 2,600 access lines and 300 DSL \b        subscribers in eight other exchanges were sold. \b \b \b \b                        2006 Financial Summary \b                             (Unaudited) \b           (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) \b \b \b                                                     Change \b                                           -------------------------- \b                           2006      2005   Amount       Percent \b                       --------- --------- --------- ---------------- \b \bRevenue                $234,085  $231,640  $  2,445              1.1% \bOperating Income       $ 77,679  $ 77,214  $    465              0.6% \bInterest Expense       $ 31,708  $ 31,089  $    619              2.0% \bEarnings Before Income \b Taxes                 $ 46,352  $ 46,390  $    (38)            -0.1% \bNet Income             $ 34,043  $ 46,390  $(12,347)           -26.6% \bBasic Earnings Per \b Share                 $   1.09  $   1.50  $  (0.41)           -27.3% \bDiluted Earnings Per \b Share                 $   1.06  $   1.46  $  (0.40)           -27.4% \b \bAdjusted EBITDA (1)    $124,317  $127,864  $ (3,547)            -2.8% \bCapital Expenditures   $ 28,122  $ 30,141  $ (2,019)            -6.7% \b \b(1) See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA under Explanation and \b Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Concepts at the end of the financial \b statements. \b \b   Investor Call \b \u001d  As previously announced, Iowa Telecom's management will hold a conference call to discuss the fourth quarter and year ended 2006 results on Friday, March 2, 2007, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time).

During 2006, the Fund sold certain net assets and travel customer contracts. Revenue recognized from the travel customer contracts was $8,671 in 2005 ($6,865 prorated for 9 1/2 months). Deferred revenue reflected in the financial statements of CSRS Holdings, Inc. at acquisition was revalued under purchase accounting to reflect the estimated cost of providing the remaining services under the registrations. As a result, approximately $1,800 of deferred revenue that would have been recognized as revenue in the 2006 fiscal period could not be recognized under purchase accounting. Revenue, excluding the travel revenue and prior to the deferred revenue purchase adjustment is comparable to the prorated period in 2005. \b \bA significant portion of the revenue earned by the Partnership is governed by contracts with customers. Contracts for more complicated BPO solutions tend to have longer terms while contracts for less complicated solutions tend to have shorter terms. The nature of BPO is that customers are continually looking for enhanced service and sometimes at a lower cost. This creates competitive and revenue pressure at the time of contract renewal. In addition, certain contracts are for programs that a customer will operate for a period of time and then abandon or replace with an alternate form of program that may not require a BPO solution. An example would be a retailer replacing a mail-in rebate program with an in-store rebate program. Revenue from certain solutions with some customers may decline during the life of the contract as the program nears maturity. Per transaction revenue may also decline on renewal as a result of competitive bidding pressure. The opposite also occurs as customers add enhancements to the current solutions being provided or because the per transaction volumes increase due to the success of the programs. Revenue for 2006 on an adjusted basis is comparable to the prorated pro forma revenue for 2005 but there is the addition of new business with new and existing clients offset by declining revenue with certain other clients. Revenue recognized from F&A solutions and CRM solutions increased period-over-period while revenue in the SCM solution area decreased period-over-period. The decline in SCM resulted from a number of factors including a customer who decided to restructure its distribution strategy, an \"off year\" in certain US states for text book replacements and the concurrent maturity of programs with several other customers. \b \bDirect Costs \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 06:46 ET (11:46 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"feed5ff4fb4b3c97e1dfb622b431caad","symR":["ORA","ORA"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9595436,0.9595436],"ret5":[0.9924793,0.9924793],"Headline":"Ormat Technologies Upped To Overweight From Neutral At HSBC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ORA"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 07:17 ET (12:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fef0955c0563a0dd1b14dcdf022a05df","symR":["NOK","NOK1V.HE","FI0009000681","NOK","NOK1V.HE","FI0009000681"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[0.9943236,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9943236,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.007569,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.007569,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Nokia Wins 3G Network Pact With RCS & RDS In Romania","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T10:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NOK","NOK1V.HE","FI0009000681"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI","XGTI","XHEX","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSTX","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 05:02 ET (10:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fef51356d2e1fe10a1c6745332b4d810","symR":["DAL","DALRQ","US2473611083"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Delta Air: 'On Track' To Emerge From Bankruptcy In Spring","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T13:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DAL","DALRQ","US2473611083"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 02, 2007 08:01 ET (13:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ff622dac67514125475fac6f52b1cb56","symR":["MYL"],"date":"2007-03-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Mylan Labs Prices Sr Conv Notes, Common Stock Offerings >MYL","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-02T12:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MYL"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Mylan Laboratories Inc.
