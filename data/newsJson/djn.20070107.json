(Dow Jones) One of if not the smallest cars here is the Smart car, a DaimlerChrysler (DCX) product that's been popular in Europe and will make its US debut in the 1Q08, being sold through United Auto Group (UAG). The little car - it's being displayed outside Cobo Hall maneuvering through and parking between limos and could almost fit in the bed of a Silverado - is being introduced at the \"right time,\" UAG CEO Roger Penske says. Penske wouldn't make a production estimate, but did say jokingly it would be in the \"double digits.\" Penske was asked how he would reply to potential customers worried about driving such a small car on US roads alongside all those big SUVs. He said the car is small, but it's high-tech and has a plethora of safety features. \"It's amazing how resilient it is because of the design.\" (PJV) \u001d  3:52 (Dow Jones) With all the high-tech, space-age know-how on display, it was an usual sight to see a man standing in the lobby of Cobo Hall next to one of the lowest tech vehicles around: a sled. A team of five barking, yelping huskies was attached to the sled, and they ran into the main hall and onto DaimlerChrysler's (DCX) exhibit space, which was covered in a sheet of ice, to kick off DCX's presentation. DCX introduced several new models with its 4matic drive - the general theme being 4matic can handle any terrain - and a few with its Bluetec, clean diesel engines. The dogs were followed by hockey players and ice skaters. \"I hope you didn't expect to see me on skates,\" CEO Dr. Dieter Zetsche said. (PJV) \u001d  3:25 (Dow Jones) GM CEO Rick Wagoner says the Chevy Volt electric car \"isn't about science projects.\" The auto maker has set aside hundreds of millions of dollars to get the electric car started, but Wagoner indicates the company will spend significantly more than $500M to make it a reality. Wagoner says the company needs to build more than the 1,000 or so electric cars the company did in its last electric car effort, the abandoned EV1 program, and adds their vision is clearer this time. Instead, GM would ideally like to build \"hundreds of thousands, (even) millions a year...this is an opportunity to deliver results.\" He concedes, however, there are question marks around the technology. \"Production time will depend on development of battery technology,\" he says. (JDS/PI) \u001d  2:16 (Dow Jones) GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz called it an \"inconvenient truth\" that his company has indeed started development of a new \"E-Flex\" vehicle, the Chevrolet Volt, which run on electricity as well as biodiesel, ethanol and, yes, gasoline. The Volt has a sporty look, WSJ.com observes, and Lutz noted an electric vehicle can also \"look good.\" The Volt can drive 40 miles before other fuels need to help recharge and Lutz emphasized that 78% of Americans live within 20 miles of work. He said if someone drove to work, ran nearby errands and charged the car every night, the owner would never have to buy gasoline for the lifetime of the vehicle, he said. For now, though, the Volt remains only an intriguing concept. (MS) \u001d  (http://blogs.wsj.com/autoshow/) \u001d  1:26 (Dow Jones) In the minutes leading up to Chrysler Group's big auto show press conference, there were giant loafs of bread flanking the stage. A kitchen counter was in the middle, as if on a cooking show. Irreverent slices of cartoon bread danced on a giant screen. \u001d  What was the theme for this revamped minivan unveiling event - the \"best thing since sliced bread\" or \"something's cooking at Chrysler\"? Nope. Instead, it was Chrysler Group's focus on its \"bread and butter\" vehicles. The DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) unit rolled out the latest versions of its Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country minivans, replete with a host of gadgets and options. Not listed: the wood paneling seen on the old Plymouth Voyager minivan, also rolled out as Chrysler touted it's long pioneering position in the vehicle segment. \u001d  Chrysler President Tom LaSorda was joined on stage by celebrity chef Bobby Flay, and the two made a couple of quick dishes that represent the Chrysler and Dodge brands - spicy pork loin with mango for Dodge and a smooth chocolate ganache cake for Chrysler. \u001d  When LaSorda took a turn icing the cake, Flay told the executive, \"I can tell you've spent a lot of time in the hot kitchen,\" to which LaSorda replied, \"The kitchen's been pretty hot lately, I'll tell you,\" a reference to Chrysler's tough 2006. (JDK, TKS) \u001d  1:08 (Dow Jones) Ford's (F) new leader, Alan Mulally, looked like a lifer in his appearance at the company's press conference. Driven out in a glistening new 500 sedan, Mulally was poised and energetic in discussing Ford's cars and prospects, sounding much like a man who's excited about what he's doing. After the event, North American head Mark Fields - who matched Mulally in the enthusiasm department - said he expects the auto maker's sales will be down slightly, with light vehicle sales of roughly 16.4M, as the US economy slows down. Fields expects GDP of 2%-2.5%, with a moderating job market and weak housing market. (PJV) \u001d  12:40 (Dow Jones) Was that a press conference or a rock concert? Ford's (F) flashy press conference featured deafening rock music, a light show and five giant video screens. Executives like Bill Ford Jr. and Mark Fields were driven onto the stage in glistening cars and greeted like guitar heroes. The music was so loud it drowned out the engine on Ford's concept muscle car, the Interceptor. Even Bill Gates was trotted out via satellite to talk about Ford and Microsoft's (MSFT) \"Sync\" project. 2006 was difficult, Bill Ford said, and 2007 will be pivotal, but the company's laid the foundation for a better Ford. (PJV) \u001d  11:05 (Dow Jones) Johnson Control (JCI) is trying to beef up the gadget-connection capability in cars, an issue in the spotlight at this year's North American International Auto Show with the Ford/Microsoft deal. JCI on Sunday unveiled its Mobile Device Gateway, which would allow drivers to use Bluetooth, USB and serial ports to plug in cell phones, MP3 players and other devices and use them as if they were factory-installed. JCI is working with automakers on making it available in 2010 and \"maybe even a little earlier,\" says Scott Wright, vice president of electronic sales and marketing. The system expands on JCI's current Bluetooth system. (TAK) \u001d  10:53 (Dow Jones) The media are descending on Detroit. The centennial North American auto show kicks off today, with a full slate of events and hoards of journalists jockeying for position. GM is building the early buzz, with its glitzy runway show last night and its fairly surprising sweep of the North American car and truck awards this morning. The company also has a noon press conference where it will unveil its latest concept car, the Chevy Volt, and talk about getting back into the electric car market - just as soon as it develops a new type of battery.

are culled from reporters covering the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The show kicked off Sunday with a series of media events.) \u001d  * * * \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--Ford Co.(F) CEO Alan Mulally, caught walking the floor of the Detroit Auto Show Sunday morning, said he's waiting to hear if his 87-year-old mother can make it to this year's show. The CEO regularly corresponds with his mother and she has taken to calling him her favorite \"car guy\" even though Mulally is better schooled in airplanes after a long career at Boeing Co. (BA). Mulally was hired in September and has never been to the Detroit event. When asked what he thinks of his first show, Mulally said he liked what he saw but is most excited for the Ford press conference later in the day. (John Stoll) \u001d  * * * \u001d  It was hard to tell if it was actual surprise or just corporate enthusiasm, but there was a joyful gasp that escaped from the attendees at the 2007 North American car of the year award when Saturn's Aura took the prize, besting the other finalists, Toyota's (TM) Camry and Honda Motor Corp.'s (HMC) Fit. Jill Lajdziak, general manager of General Motor's (GM) Saturn division, was positively beaming as she accepted the award. \u001d  \"Sometimes you just have to speak from the heart,\" she said at the podium. \"This car's been through a lot.\" But a lot of people believe in the brand and have worked hard on its revitalization. \"I'm absolutely proud of my people,\" she said. \"It's a great day for General Motors, a great day for Chevrolet, a great day for Saturn.\" \u001d  Lajdziak said later she wasn't surprised by the award, although she did say she was respectful of the competition. She said Saturn continues to \"turn heads\" with its revitalization. She wouldn't address sales projections, but she said Saturn would let the market tell it how it is doing.

To prove the point, Strigl, accompanied by two of Verizon's most senior executives, introduced new products that marry the phone, the Internet and television for consumers in ways not available from any other company. \b \u001d  Speaking on the eve of the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Strigl raised the curtain on two new products that move television to a new level: Verizon's next-generation groundbreaking FiOS TV and V CAST Mobile TV from Verizon Wireless. \b \u001d  Verizon, the premier global telecommunications and content-delivery company, today outlined the new services. Verizon Telecom introduced FiOS digital media new interactive program guide and a platform that offers the company's growing base of FiOS TV customers a myriad of multimedia applications linking television, the Internet, personal computers and phones. Both will be available in the first half of 2007. At the same time, Verizon Wireless raised the curtain on V CAST Mobile TV, unrivalled as the first true mobile TV service in the nation, which is expected to be available in the first quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  Strigl detailed the two-fold strategy behind these products, which crystallizes the changing nature of Verizon's consumer business. \"At Verizon, we build great networks and we offer great content. We have built the nation's most comprehensive all-digital broadband fiber network that reaches all the way into individual homes, while we offer the most reliable wireless voice and data network, period,\" he said. \b \u001d  Verizon FiOS, with unmatched quality and reliability, provides individual homes and businesses in 16 states with up to 50 megabits of Internet speed, and FiOS TV is already available in more than 200 cities in 10 states. Verizon Wireless' broadband network covers more than 200 million people, offering V CAST Video, V CAST Music and BroadbandAccess for high-speed laptop and PDA connectivity. \b \u001d  \"Our parallel networks of fiber and wireless create a delivery system for the high-bandwidth content of today, and will meet consumers' needs for years to come,\" Strigl noted. \b \u001d  Verizon's fiber and wireless broadband networks, and their superior reach, quality and speeds, provide the basis for advancing existing strong partnerships with technology companies such as QUALCOMM Incorporated, whose MediaFLO USA subsidiary supports V CAST Mobile TV. In addition, deep and extensive relationships with leading content providers, appearing on FiOS TV, on Verizon Online and in a variety of mobile platforms to package, format and program TV content, will combine to deliver the best overall TV experience in the industry. \b \u001d  Details about specific service offerings, including availability, pricing and programming, are expected to be available in the coming weeks. \b \b    About Verizon \b \u001d  Verizon Communications Inc.

Ford's (F) flashy press conference featured deafening rock music, a light show and five giant video screens. Executives like Bill Ford Jr. and Mark Fields were driven onto the stage in glistening cars and greeted like guitar heroes. The music was so loud it drowned out the engine on Ford's concept muscle car, the Interceptor. Even Bill Gates was trotted out via satellite to talk about Ford and Microsoft's (MSFT) \"Sync\" project. 2006 was difficult, Bill Ford said, and 2007 will be pivotal, but the company's laid the foundation for a better Ford. (PJV) \u001d  11:05 (Dow Jones) Johnson Control (JCI) is trying to beef up the gadget-connection capability in cars, an issue in the spotlight at this year's North American International Auto Show with the Ford/Microsoft deal. JCI on Sunday unveiled its Mobile Device Gateway, which would allow drivers to use Bluetooth, USB and serial ports to plug in cell phones, MP3 players and other devices and use them as if they were factory-installed. JCI is working with automakers on making it available in 2010 and \"maybe even a little earlier,\" says Scott Wright, vice president of electronic sales and marketing. The system expands on JCI's current Bluetooth system. (TAK) \u001d  10:53 (Dow Jones) The media are descending on Detroit. The centennial North American auto show kicks off today, with a full slate of events and hoards of journalists jockeying for position. GM is building the early buzz, with its glitzy runway show last night and its fairly surprising sweep of the North American car and truck awards this morning. The company also has a noon press conference where it will unveil its latest concept car, the Chevy Volt, and talk about getting back into the electric car market - just as soon as it develops a new type of battery.

DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY) expects tough sales conditions in the next fiscal year in the U.S. despite a plan to launch a slew of new models, the company's chief operating officer said Sunday. \u001d  Nissan Chief Operating Officer Toshiyuki Shiga hopes his company's planned launch of a new sport-utility vehicle, the sedan version of the Versa compact and other new models for the next fiscal year that will start in April will support sales for the next fiscal year. \u001d  He spoke with reporters on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show. \u001d  The Nissan executive said that overall U.S. sales will likely fall to as low as 16.0 million vehicles in 2007 from 16.5 million in 2006. He told reporters at a round-table meeting that it won't be easy to boost sales amid such a bleak demand picture. \u001d  \"If overall demand dwindles, incentives will increase\" as auto makers will try to spur demand by offering generous sales discounts, he said. \u001d  But \"we don't want to turn around (the trend of weak demand) just to boost (sales) volume\" by increasing sales discounts. \u001d  Shiga said Nissan's U.S. sales for this fiscal year ending March 2007 will be nearly flat from the 1.07 million vehicles that it sold in the previous fiscal year ended March 2006. \b \u001d  -By Yoshio Takahashi, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; yoshio.takahashi@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 17:26 ET (22:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0dc3eced3e2d738901f6586c79e526ca","symR":["MUC"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock MuniHoldings California Insured Fund, Inc.

\u001d  By Christoph Rauwald \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--The president and chief executive of DaimlerChrysler AG's (DCX) Smart minicar division, Ulrich Walker, said Sunday that sales for the Fortwo model are expected to rise in 2007. \u001d  \"We're expecting the new model to push sales this year above last year's level,\" Walker told Dow Jones Newswires at the North American International Auto Show. \u001d  Walker said the division is \"on the safe side\" to reach break-even this year. \u001d  Following a wide-ranging restructuring program at Smart amid painful losses, DaimlerChrysler aims to reach the break-even point by focusing on the two-seater Fortwo model, nearly a decade after the brand's launch in October 1998. The tiny two-seater is the brand's only remaining model, after the company ceased production of a four-seater and a roadster. \u001d  The Smart division saw deliveries fall 22% on the year to 112,100 vehicles in 2006. The Fortwo accounted for around 70% of the unit's sales last year as sales of the Roadtser and Fortwo model were phased out. Walker said the internal targets have been \"more than fulfilled\" ahead of the upcoming model changeover, without elaborating further. \u001d  Smart is set to launch a new version of its tiny two-seater model in April 2007, and plans a U.S. debut for the brand in the first quarter of 2008. For the entry in the U.S. market, DaimlerChrysler signed a General Distributor Agreement, or GDA, with UnitedAuto Group Inc. (UAG) last year. According to previous company statement, DaimlerChrysler estimates the \"market potential\" to be around 20,000 sales a year. \u001d  \"I think there a lot of people out there who are looking for low costs of ownership and are concerned about traffic congestion,\" UnitedAuto Group's CEO Roger Penske told Dow Jones Newswires in Detroit. He declined to give a specific sales target for the Smart brand in the U.S. \u001d  \"Smart sold around 4,000 cars in Canada in its first year, the U.S. auto market is about 11 times as big as the Canadian, and if we get around 50% of this sales level here, this would be a success,\" he said. \u001d  Penske said he received 1,100 applications from interested dealers for franchises. From these applicants, UAG will choose between 50 and 60 dealers for the brand's launch in the U.S., Penske said, adding that the company will go on a roadshow to Las Vegas, Atlanta, Detroit and New York over the next 30 days. \u001d  Penske reiterated that the Smart Fortwo will go on sale for \"a price below $15,000\". \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com \b \u001d  -By

(F) is serious about becoming a bigger player in the small-car segment, a major test comes this year when it launches the 2008 Focus, which has been significantly refreshed. \u001d  Besides a new exterior and interior, Ford will offer a two-door coupe version to reach a broader base of buyers. Ford also is updating the look of its larger Five Hundred sedan and giving it a new power train. \u001d  The new Focus, which goes on sale in the fall and is being introduced at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, is Ford's latest weapon in a segment dominated by Japanese players such as Honda Motor Co.'s (HMC) Civic, Toyota Motor Corp.'s (TM) Corolla and Nissan Motor Co.'s (NSANY) Sentra. \u001d  Ford is in the midst of cutting tens of thousands of jobs and closing plants amid slumping SUV sales and a steady loss of market share in recent years. The auto maker is not expected to turn a profit in North America until 2009, a year later than originally forecast. \u001d  Against this backdrop, Ford is trying to better compete in growing segments, such as crossover utility vehicles - where it has the recently launched Ford Edge - and small cars. \u001d  \"All signs point to continued growth in small cars,\" said George Pipas, Ford's chief of sales analysis. \u001d  It's also a segment where a lot of younger, first-time buyers enter the market, Pipas said. \u001d  \"Frankly, we haven't done a great job in this segment,\" he said. \u001d  But Ford thinks the new Focus should change that trend. The 2008 model has a horizontal chrome grille in the manner of the popular Fusion mid-size sedan, a more striking profile and a stronger-looking back end. The interior also has been refined with a more open look and ice blue lighting. Ford also said the new interior cuts down on outside noise. \u001d  Sales of the Focus were down 4.2% in 2006, while Corolla sales were up 13.5% and Civic sales were up nearly 3%. \u001d  While Ford has only 7% of the small car market, \"that is going to change,\" Pipas said. \u001d  The Focus, considering its age, actually has held up well, said Erich Merkle, director of forecasting for IRN Inc. of Grand Rapids, Mich. \u001d  He said the new Focus should help stem the sales decline but he doesn't think it will trigger a big sales increase. He noted that Nissan has a new Sentra on the market. \u001d  \"I think it's going to do more to stabilize their position,\" Merkle said. \"It's a step forward. Unfortunately, there's progress being made in that segment that's greater than a step. My thought is a step forward might not be enough.\" \u001d  Merkle said Ford should have brought its European version of the Focus off the C-1 platform here, but that's not slated to happen until 2011. \u001d  \"I would rather have seen it this time,\" Merkle said. \u001d  In addition to the Focus, Ford also is trying to give its Five Hundred sedan a push with a redesign and new engine. \u001d  Five Hundred sales were down 22% in 2006 and Ford Americas President Mark Fields said the auto maker is trying to \"import some of the Fusion magic to the Five Hundred.\" \u001d  The 2008 Five Hundred, which goes on sale in the summer, gets the Fusion-inspired horizontal chrome grille, new tail lamps and a new 3.5-liter Duratec V-6 engine that delivers 60 more horsepower than the previous engine. \u001d  Ford also said the interior is quieter, and that the Five Hundred features a new electronic stability control system. \b \u001d  -By Terry Kosdrosky of Dow Jones Newswires;

Stoll \u001d   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--General Motors Corp. (GM) Chief Executive Rick Wagoner on Sunday said the company aims to increase retail sales in the U.S. in 2007 after hitting its retail-sales target in the region last year. \u001d  Wagoner, speaking to reporters following a speech at the North American International Auto Show, said he expects the overall U.S. vehicle market to be flat in 2007. \u001d  GM sold 3 million vehicles to retail customers last year and Wagoner said, \"We'd like to tweak that up\" in 2007. \u001d  Wagoner also said that the company is focused on shoring up its liquidity position, which has been dented by negative cash flow in recent quarters. GM has sold off control in certain assets in order to raise additional cash, but Wagoner insisted GM must get the \"operating business into a cash generating position.\" \u001d  The executive cited a $4 billion to $5 billion health-care disadvantage compared to competitors as a major drain on cash. He said the company will address its health care tab and other competitive issues when it negotiates a new contract with the United Auto Workers later this year. Wagoner said the company needs to erase the health-care disadvantage, but did not provide details on a specific strategy. \u001d  GM is in the midst of a major restructuring of its North American operations after posting heavy losses in recent years. The company has been losing market share to foreign rivals with leaner cost structures. \b \u001d  -By John D.

like a lifer in his appearance at the company's press conference. Driven out in a glistening new 500 sedan, Mulally was poised and energetic in discussing Ford's cars and prospects, sounding much like a man who's excited about what he's doing. After the event, North American head Mark Fields - who matched Mulally in the enthusiasm department - said he expects the auto maker's sales will be down slightly, with light vehicle sales of roughly 16.4M, as the US economy slows down. Fields expects GDP of 2%-2.5%, with a moderating job market and weak housing market. (PJV) \u001d  12:40 (Dow Jones) Was that a press conference or a rock concert? Ford's (F) flashy press conference featured deafening rock music, a light show and five giant video screens. Executives like Bill Ford Jr. and Mark Fields were driven onto the stage in glistening cars and greeted like guitar heroes. The music was so loud it drowned out the engine on Ford's concept muscle car, the Interceptor. Even Bill Gates was trotted out via satellite to talk about Ford and Microsoft's (MSFT) \"Sync\" project. 2006 was difficult, Bill Ford said, and 2007 will be pivotal, but the company's laid the foundation for a better Ford. (PJV) \u001d  11:05 (Dow Jones) Johnson Control (JCI) is trying to beef up the gadget-connection capability in cars, an issue in the spotlight at this year's North American International Auto Show with the Ford/Microsoft deal. JCI on Sunday unveiled its Mobile Device Gateway, which would allow drivers to use Bluetooth, USB and serial ports to plug in cell phones, MP3 players and other devices and use them as if they were factory-installed. JCI is working with automakers on making it available in 2010 and \"maybe even a little earlier,\" says Scott Wright, vice president of electronic sales and marketing. The system expands on JCI's current Bluetooth system. (TAK) \u001d  10:53 (Dow Jones) The media are descending on Detroit. The centennial North American auto show kicks off today, with a full slate of events and hoards of journalists jockeying for position. GM is building the early buzz, with its glitzy runway show last night and its fairly surprising sweep of the North American car and truck awards this morning. The company also has a noon press conference where it will unveil its latest concept car, the Chevy Volt, and talk about getting back into the electric car market - just as soon as it develops a new type of battery.

\u001d  (Update with comments from Premier Su Tseng-chang and prosecutor) \u001d  By Perris Lee Choon Siong \u001d  OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  TAIPEI (Dow Jones)--Taiwan authorities have banned board members of Chinese Bank (2831.TW) from leaving the island, and have frozen their assets, after the Taiwan government took over management of the lender Friday, government officials said Sunday. \u001d  Depositors withdrew more than NT$15 billion from their accounts at the bank Friday, resulting in a liquidity crunch, after two of its sister companies, China Rebar Co. (9801.TW) and Chia Hsin Food & Synthetic Fiber Co. (1207.TW), filed to the Taipei District Court to restructure businesses.  China Rebar and Chia Hsin said years of losses hurt their ability to repay debts. \u001d  Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said in a statement the bank's board members and management have been banned from leaving the island, and their assets frozen by authorities, as they are now under investigation. \u001d  Su didn't elaborate, but said the government will ensure order in the financial markets Monday. \u001d  The government-owned Central Deposit Insurance Corp. took over management and operations of the bank starting Saturday, according to a Financial Supervisory Commission statement late Friday. \u001d  And \"we have asked the Ministry of the Interior to keep the bank's board members and some management people within the island for further investigation,\" FSC Acting Spokesman Justin Chan said in a phone interview Sunday. \u001d  He said the commission has asked prosecutors to probe whether there was any wrongdoing by the bank's management and board members. \u001d  Taipei Prosecutors Office's Spokesman Fred Lin said the prosecutors office is working closely with the FSC to gather information on whether there was any insider-trading or fund embezzlement involved. \u001d  Bank officials weren't available for immediate comments Sunday. \u001d   According to a Chinese Bank filing to the Taiwan Stock Exchange Friday, it asked the commission to take over its operations because of a liquidity crunch resulting from \"abnormal\" withdrawals of more than NT$15 billion (US$459.9 million) Friday.  It had a net worth of NT$10.9 billion at the end of October. \u001d  In a joint advertisement on major dailies Sunday, Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Shih Jun-ji, Central Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan and Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin sought to calm depositors, saying the government will fully insure deposits placed at the bank now that it has been taken over. \u001d  Chinese Bank, a member of the Rebar Group, operates 35 branches islandwide and has a market share of less than 1% by deposits. It reported a net loss of NT$3.8 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2006, after losing a net NT$561 million in 2005 and NT$986 million in 2004. \u001d  China Rebar and Chia Hsin are also members of the Rebar Group, which has interests in hotel, department stores, and textile businesses. \u001d  The Financial Supervisory Commission has also asked the Taiwan Cooperative Bank (5854.TW) and Cathay Financial Holding Co. (2882.TW) to jointly take over the group's Great Chinese Bills Finance Corp. starting Sunday. \u001d  Great Chinese suffers from liquidity shortage, the commission said. \u001d  -By Perris Lee, Dow

7 /PRNewswire/ -- From a sleek, electrically powered concept vehicle that makes trips to the gas station a rarity, to a modern, top-down twist on one of America's favorite muscle cars, design and technology dominate the General Motors exhibit at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, which opens to the public on Jan. 13. \b \u001d  To show off this year's stunning new production and concept vehicles, the all-new, 121,000-square-foot GM exhibit space -- the show's largest -- has been transformed into an art gallery-type setting that complements each of GM's eight vehicle brands and showcases GM's intention to reinvent the automobile with technologies that save fuel, reduce emissions and promote energy independence. \b \u001d  \"GM has some of the greatest design and technology talent in the industry, and our Detroit lineup this year proves it,\" said Mark LaNeve, GM North America vice president, vehicle sales, service and marketing. \"If 2006 was about an amazing year of new-product introductions, 2007 is all about momentum.\" \b \u001d  Four vehicles will make their world debut in Detroit: the Chevrolet Camaro convertible concept, Chevrolet Volt concept, 2008 Chevrolet Malibu and the 2008 Cadillac CTS. \b \u001d  GM's most electrifying advanced technology vehicle introduction, literally, is the Chevrolet Volt concept, a battery-powered, extended-range electric passenger vehicle that uses a gas engine to create additional electricity, making pit stops practically pass&#233;. The technology behind the Volt concept, GM's E-flex System, allows electricity to be produced from gasoline, ethanol, bio-diesel or hydrogen, helping to provide a global solution to diversifying transportation energy sources. \b \u001d  On Saturday at GM Style, a glitzy convergence of Hollywood's brightest stars and 17 GM concept and production vehicles, the Chevrolet Camaro convertible concept was introduced, along with the U.S. premiere of four global concepts that will be on display at the auto show. \b \b \b    Here is the complete list of GM vehicle introductions for Detroit: \b    * All-new 2008 Cadillac CTS (world debut) \b    * All-new 2008 Chevrolet Malibu (world debut) \b    * Chevrolet Volt concept (world debut) \b    * Chevrolet Camaro convertible concept (world debut) \b    * Chevrolet Equinox Sport \b    * Chevrolet HHR Premiere Edition \b    * Pontiac G6 GXP \b    * Pontiac Torrent GXP \b    * Pontiac GXP.R race car \b    * Saab BioPower Hybrid concept (first U.S. introduction) \b \b \u001d  General Motors Corp. (NYSE: GM), the world's largest automaker, has been the global industry sales leader for 75 years. Founded in 1908, GM today employs about 318,000 people around the world.  With global headquarters in Detroit, GM manufactures its cars and trucks in 33 countries.  In 2005, 9.17 million GM cars and trucks were sold globally under the following brands: Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, GM Daewoo, Holden, HUMMER, Opel, Pontiac, Saab, Saturn and Vauxhall.

Expects Sales To Rise 07-Pres \b************************************* \b***EMBARGO **** GMT/15:00ET, DAY 07/01***Detroit (unedited) \b************************************* \b \u001d  By Christoph Rauwald \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--The president and chief executive of DaimlerChrysler AG's (DCX) Smart minicar division Ulrich Walker said Sunday sales for the Fortwo model are expected to rise in 2007. \u001d  \"We're expecting the new model to push sales this year above last year's level,\" Walker told Dow Jones Newswires at the North American International Auto Show. \u001d  Walker said the division is \"on the safe side\" to reach break-even this year. \u001d  Following a wide-ranging restructuring program at Smart amid painful losses, DaimlerChrysler aims to reach break-even at Smart by focusing on the two-seater Fortwo model, nearly a decade after the brand's launch in October 1998. The tiny two-seater Fortwo is the brand's only model after the company ceased production of a four-seater and a roadster model. \u001d  The Smart division saw deliveries fall 22% on the year to 112,100 vehicles in full-year 2006. The Fortwo accounted for around 70% of the unit's sales last year as sales of the Roadtser and Fortwo model phased out. Walker said the internal targets have been \"more than fulfilled\" ahead of the upcoming model changeover, without elaborating further. \u001d  Smart is set to launch a new version of its tiny two-seater model in April 2007, and plans a U.S. debut for the brand in the first quarter 2008. For the entry in the U.S. market, DaimlerChrysler signed a General Distributor Agreement, or GDA, with UnitedAuto Group Inc. (UAG) last year. According to previous company statement, DaimlerChrysler estimates the \"market potential\" to be around 20,000 sales per year. \u001d  \"I think there a lot of people out there who are looking for low costs of ownership and are concerned about traffic congestion,\" UnitedAuto Group's CEO Roger Penske told Dow Jones Newswires in Detroit. He declined to give a specific sales target for the Smart brand in the U.S. \u001d  \"Smart sold around 4,000 cars in Canada in its first year, the U.S. auto market is about eleven times as big as the Canadian, and if we get around 50% of this sales level here, this would be a success,\" he said. \u001d  Penske said he received 1,100 applications from interested dealers for a possible franchises. From these applicants, UAG will choose between 50 and 60 dealers for the brand's launch in the U.S., Penske said, adding that the company will go on a roadshow to Las Vegas, Atlanta, Detroit and New York over the next 30 days. \u001d  Penske reiterated that the Smart Fortwo will go on sale for \"a price below $15,000\". \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com \b \u001d  -By

Expects Sales To Rise 07-Pres \b************************************* \b***EMBARGO **** GMT/15:00ET, DAY 07/01***Detroit (unedited) \b************************************* \b \u001d  By Christoph Rauwald \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--The president and chief executive of DaimlerChrysler AG's (DCX) Smart minicar division Ulrich Walker said Sunday sales for the Fortwo model are expected to rise in 2007. \u001d  \"We're expecting the new model to push sales this year above last year's level,\" Walker told Dow Jones Newswires at the North American International Auto Show. \u001d  Walker said the division is \"on the safe side\" to reach break-even this year. \u001d  Following a wide-ranging restructuring program at Smart amid painful losses, DaimlerChrysler aims to reach break-even at Smart by focusing on the two-seater Fortwo model, nearly a decade after the brand's launch in October 1998. The tiny two-seater Fortwo is the brand's only model after the company ceased production of a four-seater and a roadster model. \u001d  The Smart division saw deliveries fall 22% on the year to 112,100 vehicles in full-year 2006. The Fortwo accounted for around 70% of the unit's sales last year as sales of the Roadtser and Fortwo model phased out. Walker said the internal targets have been \"more than fulfilled\" ahead of the upcoming model changeover, without elaborating further. \u001d  Smart is set to launch a new version of its tiny two-seater model in April 2007, and plans a U.S. debut for the brand in the first quarter 2008. For the entry in the U.S. market, DaimlerChrysler signed a General Distributor Agreement, or GDA, with UnitedAuto Group Inc. (UAG) last year. According to previous company statement, DaimlerChrysler estimates the \"market potential\" to be around 20,000 sales per year. \u001d  \"I think there a lot of people out there who are looking for low costs of ownership and are concerned about traffic congestion,\" UnitedAuto Group's CEO Roger Penske told Dow Jones Newswires in Detroit. He declined to give a specific sales target for the Smart brand in the U.S. \u001d  \"Smart sold around 4,000 cars in Canada in its first year, the U.S. auto market is about eleven times as big as the Canadian, and if we get around 50% of this sales level here, this would be a success,\" he said. \u001d  Penske said he received 1,100 applications from interested dealers for a possible franchises. From these applicants, UAG will choose between 50 and 60 dealers for the brand's launch in the U.S., Penske said, adding that the company will go on a roadshow to Las Vegas, Atlanta, Detroit and New York over the next 30 days. \u001d  Penske reiterated that the Smart Fortwo will go on sale for \"a price below $15,000\". \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com \b \u001d  -By Christoph Rauwald, Dow Jones Newswires; +49 69 29 725 512; christoph.rauwald@dowjones.com \b-0- \u001d  APDJ-01-07-07 1951GMT< \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 15:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"45fc0ad7f9d546806821727630cb26fc","symR":["LWI.LN","GB0005368062"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Lowland Investment Company plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T09:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LWI.LN","GB0005368062"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Lowland Investment Company plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0005368062 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 04:35 ET (09:35 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"45fe1d45c8fba687810b220ac97272c3","symR":["MLAN"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for The Midland Company","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T10:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MLAN"],"IndustryCodes":["INP","INS","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  The Midland Company: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=MLAN or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 05:42 ET (10:42 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"460087bb0dc6083ef9de05c760db4a99","symR":["ATGN"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for AltiGen Communications Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T08:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ATGN"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  AltiGen Communications Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=ATGN or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 03:08 ET (08:08 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4607dd6c646297373d0651c2f5a2db08","symR":["HTP.LN","GB0030348576"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Hat Pin PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T09:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HTP.LN","GB0030348576"],"IndustryCodes":["EAG","SVC"],"Story":"\u001d  Hat Pin PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0030348576 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 04:10 ET (09:10 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"46119c57e9f3ad5155fe9ef80a1dd8db","symR":["GF"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for New Germany Fund, Inc.

\b    By Jon Kamp \b    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--The head of U.S. operations for Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) declined to speculate Sunday on whether the Japanese auto maker could supplant Ford Motor Co. (F) this year in the number two position on the U.S. sales list. \u001d  The auto maker is expecting, though, to make strides in what could otherwise be a flat U.S. market, implying it will continue taking share from the competition. Some analysts have projected that this could be the year Toyota moves into the number two slot - something Toyota managed for a handful of months in 2006 - behind General Motors Corp. (GM). \u001d  Toyota has backed away from making such projections, and Jim Lentz, Executive Vice President of Toyota Motor Sales USA, stuck to that game plan Sunday at the North American International Auto Show. \u001d  \"In North America it's tough to say. I don't know where Ford's going to end up,\" Lentz said, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of a Toyota press conference, where the automaker unveiled the \"CrewMax\" version of its Tundra pickup truck. \u001d  Lentz also backed away from making any statements about potentially surpassing GM on the global stage, and deferred to that auto maker's top position in the U.S. market. \u001d  \"In the U.S., we're a long way away from General Motors,\" Lentz said. \"Globally, it all depends on what happens. It's not a goal, it's not an objective.\" \u001d  Deference aside, Lentz showed off the four-door Tundra pickup truck that's meant to compete in a U.S. segment where GM and Ford are still dominant. Lentz highlighted the truck's American roots and burly attributes, and said it's expected to be one of two key sales drivers, along with hybrids, for Toyota in 2007. \u001d  Lentz reiterated that Toyota's 2007 U.S. sales goal is 2.68 million vehicles. That's up from about 2.54 million vehicles in the U.S. in 2006, according to Autodata Corp. The 2006 total represented a 12.5% climb from 2005. \u001d  The 2006 total left Toyota with a 13.3% share of the U.S. market, still significantly less than Ford's 17.4% share. But total Ford sales were off 8% in 2006, indicating the different kind of momentum Toyota and Ford carry into the new year. \u001d  Lentz noted that the \"vast majority\" of Toyota's sales increase will come from the new Tundra this year. The company is also expecting a big contribution from the hybrid version of its popular Camry sedan. Lentz noted that production of the Camry hybrid will about double to around 60,000 vehicles this year. \u001d  Lentz said overall industry sales in the U.S. this year may be flat, following sales of about 16.5 million vehicles in 2006, weighed down by the negative influence of plant closures. Ford and GM are in the midst of closing several plants as part of their massive domestic restructuring plans. \u001d  But sales in the retail market - which excludes sales to fleet customers like rental agencies - will likely increase this year, Lentz said. \b \u001d  -By Jon Kamp; Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07,

\b   Edited by Paul Vigna \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \b   (call: 201-938-5172; email: paul.vigna@dowjones.com) \b \b   AUTO SHOW MARKET TALK can be found using N/DJMT and I/AUT \b \u001d  5:06 (Dow Jones) Without a doubt, some of the most beautiful and powerful cars at the auto show in Detroit are from the House of Sant'Agata Bolognese - Lamborghini. At the decidedly high end of the auto market, Lamborghini has three models on display, the Murcielago LP640 Roadster, the Murcielago LP640 Coupe and the Gallardo Spyder. The Italian luxury auto maker also reported at the show that 2006 was a record year, with 2,087 cars built and sold, up 30.4% from a year ago. The 640 Roadster, first introduced at the Los Angeles auto show in November, will go on sale in the spring. The cost? Roughly $400,000. (PJV) \u001d  4:13 (Dow Jones) One of if not the smallest cars here is the Smart car, a DaimlerChrysler (DCX) product that's been popular in Europe and will make its US debut in the 1Q08, being sold through United Auto Group (UAG). The little car - it's being displayed outside Cobo Hall maneuvering through and parking between limos and could almost fit in the bed of a Silverado - is being introduced at the \"right time,\" UAG CEO Roger Penske says. Penske wouldn't make a production estimate, but did say jokingly it would be in the \"double digits.\" Penske was asked how he would reply to potential customers worried about driving such a small car on US roads alongside all those big SUVs. He said the car is small, but it's high-tech and has a plethora of safety features. \"It's amazing how resilient it is because of the design.\" (PJV) \u001d  3:52 (Dow Jones) With all the high-tech, space-age know-how on display, it was an usual sight to see a man standing in the lobby of Cobo Hall next to one of the lowest tech vehicles around: a sled. A team of five barking, yelping huskies was attached to the sled, and they ran into the main hall and onto DaimlerChrysler's (DCX) exhibit space, which was covered in a sheet of ice, to kick off DCX's presentation. DCX introduced several new models with its 4matic drive - the general theme being 4matic can handle any terrain - and a few with its Bluetec, clean diesel engines. The dogs were followed by hockey players and ice skaters. \"I hope you didn't expect to see me on skates,\" CEO Dr. Dieter Zetsche said. (PJV) \u001d  3:25 (Dow Jones) GM CEO Rick Wagoner says the Chevy Volt electric car \"isn't about science projects.\" The auto maker has set aside hundreds of millions of dollars to get the electric car started, but Wagoner indicates the company will spend significantly more than $500M to make it a reality. Wagoner says the company needs to build more than the 1,000 or so electric cars the company did in its last electric car effort, the abandoned EV1 program, and adds their vision is clearer this time. Instead, GM would ideally like to build \"hundreds of thousands, (even) millions a year...this is an opportunity to deliver results.\" He concedes, however, there are question marks around the technology. \"Production time will depend on development of battery technology,\" he says. (JDS/PI) \u001d  2:16 (Dow Jones) GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz called it an \"inconvenient truth\" that his company has indeed started development of a new \"E-Flex\" vehicle, the Chevrolet Volt, which run on electricity as well as biodiesel, ethanol and, yes, gasoline. The Volt has a sporty look, WSJ.com observes, and Lutz noted an electric vehicle can also \"look good.\" The Volt can drive 40 miles before other fuels need to help recharge and Lutz emphasized that 78% of Americans live within 20 miles of work. He said if someone drove to work, ran nearby errands and charged the car every night, the owner would never have to buy gasoline for the lifetime of the vehicle, he said. For now, though, the Volt remains only an intriguing concept. (MS) \u001d  (http://blogs.wsj.com/autoshow/) \u001d  1:26 (Dow Jones) In the minutes leading up to Chrysler Group's big auto show press conference, there were giant loafs of bread flanking the stage. A kitchen counter was in the middle, as if on a cooking show. Irreverent slices of cartoon bread danced on a giant screen. \u001d  What was the theme for this revamped minivan unveiling event - the \"best thing since sliced bread\" or \"something's cooking at Chrysler\"? Nope. Instead, it was Chrysler Group's focus on its \"bread and butter\" vehicles. The DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) unit rolled out the latest versions of its Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country minivans, replete with a host of gadgets and options. Not listed: the wood paneling seen on the old Plymouth Voyager minivan, also rolled out as Chrysler touted it's long pioneering position in the vehicle segment. \u001d  Chrysler President Tom LaSorda was joined on stage by celebrity chef Bobby Flay, and the two made a couple of quick dishes that represent the Chrysler and Dodge brands - spicy pork loin with mango for Dodge and a smooth chocolate ganache cake for Chrysler. \u001d  When LaSorda took a turn icing the cake, Flay told the executive, \"I can tell you've spent a lot of time in the hot kitchen,\" to which LaSorda replied, \"The kitchen's been pretty hot lately, I'll tell you,\" a reference to Chrysler's tough 2006. (JDK, TKS) \u001d  1:08 (Dow Jones) Ford's (F) new leader, Alan Mulally, looked like a lifer in his appearance at the company's press conference. Driven out in a glistening new 500 sedan, Mulally was poised and energetic in discussing Ford's cars and prospects, sounding much like a man who's excited about what he's doing. After the event, North American head Mark Fields - who matched Mulally in the enthusiasm department - said he expects the auto maker's sales will be down slightly, with light vehicle sales of roughly 16.4M, as the US economy slows down. Fields expects GDP of 2%-2.5%, with a moderating job market and weak housing market. (PJV) \u001d  12:40 (Dow Jones) Was that a press conference or a rock concert? Ford's (F) flashy press conference featured deafening rock music, a light show and five giant video screens. Executives like Bill Ford Jr. and Mark Fields were driven onto the stage in glistening cars and greeted like guitar heroes. The music was so loud it drowned out the engine on Ford's concept muscle car, the Interceptor. Even Bill Gates was trotted out via satellite to talk about Ford and Microsoft's (MSFT) \"Sync\" project. 2006 was difficult, Bill Ford said, and 2007 will be pivotal, but the company's laid the foundation for a better Ford. (PJV) \u001d  11:05 (Dow Jones) Johnson Control (JCI) is trying to beef up the gadget-connection capability in cars, an issue in the spotlight at this year's North American International Auto Show with the Ford/Microsoft deal. JCI on Sunday unveiled its Mobile Device Gateway, which would allow drivers to use Bluetooth, USB and serial ports to plug in cell phones, MP3 players and other devices and use them as if they were factory-installed. JCI is working with automakers on making it available in 2010 and \"maybe even a little earlier,\" says Scott Wright, vice president of electronic sales and marketing. The system expands on JCI's current Bluetooth system. (TAK) \u001d  10:53 (Dow Jones) The media are descending on Detroit. The centennial North American auto show kicks off today, with a full slate of events and hoards of journalists jockeying for position. GM is building the early buzz, with its glitzy runway show last night and its fairly surprising sweep of the North American car and truck awards this morning. The company also has a noon press conference where it will unveil its latest concept car, the Chevy Volt, and talk about getting back into the electric car market - just as soon as it develops a new type of battery.

powered by Microsoft Auto software, is Ford's new fully integrated, voice-activated in-car communications and entertainment system for mobile phones and digital music players. * Sync will be available in 12 Ford, Lincoln and Mercury products beginning this calendar year. * Sync is the newest technology to emerge from the Ford-Microsoft relationship. * Users can access their mobile phone or digital music player - including genre, album, artist and song title - via voice commands. * Names and numbers in a mobile phone's address book are wirelessly and automatically transferred to the vehicle. * Sync can host nearly any digital media player, including the Apple iPod(R), Microsoft Zune, PlaysForSure players and most USB storage devices. \b \b \u001d  DETROIT, Jan. 7 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Ford Motor Company today announced the launch of a new factory-installed, in-car communications and entertainment system that is designed to change the way consumers use digital media portable music players and mobile phones in their vehicles. \b \u001d  The Ford-exclusive technology based on Microsoft Auto software, called Sync, provides consumers the convenience and flexibility to bring into their vehicle nearly any mobile phone or digital media player and operate it using voice commands or the vehicle's steering wheel or radio controls. \b \u001d  Ford owners will not need to worry about whether their car or truck is compatible with the latest phone or music player that hits the market. Sync seamlessly integrates the vehicle with the popular portable electronic devices of today and is upgradeable to support the devices and services of tomorrow. \b \u001d  \"Sync is what today's generation and today's drivers demand in connectivity,\" says Derrick Kuzak, group vice president, product development, Ford Motor Company.  \"Not only does it offer hands-free phone operation and iPod(R), Zune or MP3 player connectivity, it's built on a software platform that is upgradeable and will allow us to offer new features by simply upgrading the software.\" \b \u001d  Sync offers consumers two ways to bring electronic devices into their Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles and operate them seamlessly through voice commands or steering wheel controls: \b \b \b    * Bluetooth, for wireless connection of phones and phones that play music. \b \b    * A USB 2.0 port for command and control and charging of digital media \b      players -- including the Apple iPod and Microsoft Zune -- as well as \b      PlaysForSure music devices and most USB media storage devices. \b      Supported formats include MP3, AAC, WMA, WAV and PCM. \b \b \u001d  The ability to upgrade Sync, control all portable electronic devices via voice commands, offer a USB port to connect storage devices and recharge electronics puts this technology well beyond technology available today -- including Bluetooth, hands-free offerings or portable music device connections. \b \u001d  \"More than 80 percent of U.S. households use cell phones, and 60 million digital music devices have been sold.  That's a 50 percent increase from just 2005,\" Kuzak said. \"With such market growth led by consumers' needs, Sync is the right new technology at the right time for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.\" \b \u001d  Sync will debut this calendar year on the 2008 Ford Focus, Fusion, Five Hundred, Edge, Freestyle, Explorer and Sport Trac; Mercury Milan, Montego and Mountaineer; and Lincoln MKX and MKZ.  The technology will be on all Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles in the near future. \b \u001d  \"Ford and Microsoft share a vision for a future where drivers are safely connected to the people, information and entertainment they care about while they are on the road,\" said Bill Gates, Chairman, Microsoft Corporation. \"Built on Microsoft Auto technology, Ford Sync delivers an in-car system that is an important step toward achieving this vision. Using software that bridges the automotive and consumer electronics industries, Sync will help revolutionize the driving experience by providing a simple system that intelligently connects mobile phones, music players, and more.\" \b \b \b    Sync Features: \b \b    * Voice-activated, hands-free calling: Simply press the \"Push to Talk\" \b      button on the steering wheel, and then say the name of the person you \b      wish to call. Sync will automatically connect with the names in the \b      mobile phone's contact list. \b \b    * Uninterrupted connections: No need to hang up in the middle of a cell \b      phone call as you enter your vehicle.  Simply touch the Telephone Button \b      on the steering wheel, and Sync will instantly connect to a Bluetooth \b      phone. \b \b    * Audible text messages: Sync will convert text messages from your phone \b      to audio and read it out loud.  The system is even smart enough to \b      translate such commonly used text messaging expressions as \"LOL\" and :). \b      You can choose to reply from any of 20 predefined responses. \b \b    * Advanced calling features: Sync includes the same features offered on \b      mobile phones, including caller ID, call waiting, conference calling, a \b      caller log, a list of contacts, a signal strength icon, and a phone \b      battery charge icon -- all conveniently located on the radio's display \b      screen. \b \b    * Voice-activated music: Browse the music collection on your digital media \b      player, mobile phone or USB drive by genre, album, artist and song title \b      using simple voice commands, such as \"Play genre Rock,\" \b      \"Play < artist >,\" or \"Play Track < song title >.\" \b \b    * Instant voice recognition: Sync's advanced voice recognition technology \b      means when you're ready to use your phone or digital music player, just \b      speak simple voice commands. \b \b    * Ring tone support: For supported phones, Sync will play personal ring \b      tones.  If you've configured unique ring tones to identify specific \b      callers, Sync will automatically play those, too. \b \b    * Automatic phonebook transfer: Sync will automatically and wirelessly \b      transfer all the names and numbers in a mobile phonebook. \b \b    * Multilingual intelligence: Sync is fluent in English, French and \b      Spanish. \b \b \u001d  The names of actual companies

\u001d  By Terry Kosdrosky \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--The Chrysler Group's launch of its redesigned minivans this year - complete with the latest seating innovation and a new exterior look - comes as its U.S. competitors pull out of the segment, developments that could aid the struggling auto maker's turnaround. \u001d  The U.S. unit of DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) invented the minivan in the mid-1980s and has been a market leader since. But it has faced stiff competition from Honda Motor Co.'s (HMC) Odyssey and Toyota Motor Corp.'s (TM) Sienna in recent years. All have spent time and money one-upping each other with new innovations, such as fold-flat third row seats, a split third row that folds flat and fold-flat second-row seats. \u001d  The 2008 Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan will be revealed at the North American International Auto show and go on sale in the fall. They have the requisite \"gee-whiz\" interior innovation - second-row seats that turn 180 degrees to face the third row, with a removable table in between. That's known as \"Swivel 'n Go,\" which builds on Chrysler's \"Stow 'n Go.\" \u001d  Chrysler also makes an exterior statement with the 2008 model, scrapping the egg shape for a more linear, \"athletic\" appearance, said Chrysler design chief Trevor Creed. \u001d  With Ford Motor Co. (F) and General Motors Corp. (GM) essentially pulling out of the traditional minivan segment, Chrysler has a golden opportunity with its new model, said Erich Merkle, director of forecasting at IRN Inc. in Grand Rapids, Mich. \u001d  \"This is huge for Chrysler,\" he said. \"They've always been kind of the front-runner in the minivan segment. That fact that GM and Ford are exiting and they have a new product, that leaves all the more for Chrysler.\" \u001d  Merkle said it will be difficult for Honda and Toyota to fill the gap left by Ford and GM as quickly because of their capacity constraints. \u001d  He called Chrysler's minivans one of the most important vehicles of the show. \u001d  Chrysler minivan sales slumped in 2006, with the Town & Country off 12% and the Caravan off 7%. Toyota Sienna sales were up 1.5% and Honda Odyssey sales were up 2.4%. \u001d  The minivan sales decline was indicative of a general weakening in Chrysler's performance last year. The company's inventory bulged and it had to cut production and offer big incentives on its pickup trucks and SUVs. \u001d  Chrysler, which lost market share despite launching 10 new products, reported a $1.5 billion third-quarter loss. A turnaround plan is expected to be revealed next month. \u001d  Merkle said the second half of this year \"should look a lot better\" for Chrysler in part because of the minivans, which carry good profit margins. \u001d  He said Chrysler made the right move changing the exterior, which can carry risks. \u001d  \"That's one of the things I've been looking for,\" Merkle said. \"It speaks volumes about Chrysler's willingness to take risks. They're taking their No. 1 vehicle, their top selling vehicle, and saying they're going to shake it up. When you get your top vehicle, people tend to get very cautious. That doesn't seem to be the route Chrysler is going to be taking.\" \u001d  The minivans also offer other interior goodies, such as pinpoint LED lighting, retractable sun shades, one-touch power third-row folding seats and ambient halo lighting. \u001d  The Chrysler Town & Country will come in three trim levels, LX, Touring and Country Limited while the Dodge Grand Caravan will come in the SE and SXT levels. \u001d  The vans come with three powertrain options. A 3.3-liter, flex-fuel V-6 engine with a four-speed transmission or a 3.8-liter or 4.0-liter V-6 engine with a six-speed transmission. \u001d  Side-curtain airbags covering all rows are standard, as is an electronic stability program. \u001d  Creed said Chrysler \"took every feature on every minivan today that we don't have that they do, and added some of our own features.\" \u001d  -By Terry

Automakers have said they'd like a more competitive agreement and the union's president has indicated he'd like to hold on to benefits. \u001d  Despite expecting tough negotiations, LaSorda, speaking on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show, said he \"anticipates we'll be able to resolve things. \u001d  He also said a turnaround plan being prepared in the wake of Chrysler's $1.5 billion third-quarter loss will be \"widespread\" and address every area of the company. Chrysler is a unit of DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX). \u001d  LaSorda wouldnt discuss details of the turnaround strategy, saying those would come in February or early March. \b \u001d  -By Terry Kosdrosky,

said. \u001d  West Bengal has plans to build an industrial zone in Nandigram with the help of Indonesia's Salim Group but the project has run into trouble with angry villagers refusing to give up their land. \u001d  West Bengal is ruled by the Communist Party but has keenly looked for domestic and foreign investment in the recent past. \u001d  This isn't the first time such projects have met local resistance. \u001d  Last month, there were angry protests in Singur, a village 30 kilometers northwest of Calcutta after the government sold fertile agricultural land to India's Tata Motors Ltd.

(TM) doesn't expect that reduced tax credits for its gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles will hinder it from boosting sales of the fuel-saving vehicles this year, the head of the company's North American unit said Sunday. \u001d  The Japanese company known for making the world's first mass-produced hybrid, the Prius, aims to sell 250,000 to 300,000 hybrids in the U.S. in 2007, compared with 190,000 sold in 2006, said James E. Press, president of Toyota Motor North America. He spoke with reporters on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show. \u001d  Tax credits for Toyota's hybrid vehicles were halved as its sales hit 60,000 vehicles in May. The reduction stemmed from a law that took effect a year ago. \u001d  Growth in sales of the Prius slowed somewhat after the reduction in tax credits, the Toyota executive said. \"But that hasn't stopped\" the trend of year-over-year growth, he said. \u001d  Customers' appetite for the Prius remains solid, even as they now try to spend less to buy the model. They tend to buy the model without navigation systems, though the version equipped with such systems used to be popular, he said. \b \u001d  -By Yoshio Takahashi, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929;

Stoll \b    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--General Motors Corp.'s (GM) chief financial officer on Sunday said the auto maker doesn't plan to return to furnishing formal earnings guidance in 2007, but the auto maker will lay out some benchmarks for the year during an analyst conference on Thursday. \u001d  Fritz Henderson, talking on the sidelines of a GM presentation at the North American International Auto Show, said relevant company executives, including himself, will continue to be barred from trading GM shares due to the moratorium on guidance. GM quit supplying formal guidance in 2005 as uncertainty about the operating environment added extra challenges to forecasting. \u001d  In 2006, Henderson had indicated the company might return to giving guidance once certain issues were ironed out, including the company's move to sell a controlling stake in the General Motors Acceptance Corp. lending arm and resolving an ongoing conflict at Delphi Corp. (DPHIQ). Delphi filed for bankruptcy in 2005 and GM, which is Delphi's former parent and largest customer, has spent a good deal of the past 16 months ironing out its financial obligation to the parts supplier. \u001d  GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner on Thursday said the major issues that need to be sorted out at Delphi have been largely clarified. While some hurdles remain, such as forging a concrete Delphi labor agreement with the United Auto Workers union, GM estimates its financial obligation to Delphi at between $6 billion and $7.5 billion, much of which has been accounted for in non-cash charges. \u001d  Wagoner, speaking during a roundtable with reporters, said that the company has a plan to lay out its \"plus and minus\" benchmarks at the analyst meeting Thursday. GM last utilized a similar venue to lay out cost-cut targets and other benchmarks. \u001d  Wagoner said the company expects to continue to improve earnings on an ongoing basis and not to experience a \"plateau.\" GM improved earnings by $3.5 billion in the first nine months of 2006 against the backdrop of a challenging U.S. market, Wagoner said. He said GM's continued losses aren't remarkable but said the improvement is significant. \b \u001d  -By John D.

Focus Demonstrated Ford's Commitment to Small Cars","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T05:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["F"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DETROIT, Jan. 7 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The 2008 Ford Focus is redesigned inside and out with a bold new exterior, a modern interior and a long list of new safety and technology features, including Ford Sync(TM) -- Ford's exclusive fully integrated, voice-activated in-car communications and entertainment system for mobile phones and digital media players. \b \u001d  Also new is a sporty two-door Focus coupe, which is designed to attract new and younger buyers in the growing small car market. Small cars make up the largest vehicle segment in the U.S. today, and growth is expected to continue. \"We're expanding our commitment to small cars, as that is where many of our customers are headed. The new Focus is substantially upgraded, and it's the start of several new small cars coming from Ford in the next several years,\" said Mark Fields, Ford's president of The Americas. \b \u001d  \"We've packed more style, more comfort and more features into the new Focus, but we've left the fuel economy as strong as ever.\" On sale in the fall of 2007, the new Focus will offer fuel economy rivaling smaller vehicles. With its fuel efficient 2.0-liter engine and approximately 60 pounds less weight, the new 2008 Focus is expected to deliver real-world fuel economy similar to today's model, despite added content and a stiffer body. Currently, Focus is among the segment's best with a U.S. EPA rating of 37 miles per gallon on the highway. \b \b    Bold details bring new Focus exterior to life \b \u001d  In shaping the new Focus, the design team looked to the Ford Fusion, drawing on its prominent chrome-bar grille design, flared wheel arches and crisp lines to create a small car that's stylish and sporty. Several bold details bring the exterior of the new Focus to life. One is the taut character line that runs from the taillights across the doors just below the door handles and then snaps down at the front wheel well. Another example is the four separate creases incorporated into the hood. \b \u001d  The headlights are a design story by themselves. Horizontal bars with a matte surface run through the reflection area, visually connecting the headlights with a sweeping line running through the chrome-bar grille. \b \b    New interior built to be a second home on wheels \b \u001d  \"We've taken cues from fashion and home design and translated them into a fresh new Focus interior,\" says Lon Zaback, Focus chief designer. \"We've created a second home on wheels with such details as ambient lighting that is popular in homes today. We've also used higher-quality materials -- like the silver metallic finishes you see in appliances -- to make the overall package more inviting.\" Customers can order a new ambient lighting package that places tiny LEDs inside the front and rear cupholders and in the footwells. The LEDs can highlight the cabin in any of seven different colors through a dash-mounted switch.\" \b \u001d  Overall, the interior is modern and quieter. The 2008 Focus features a new acoustic windshield, thicker side glass in the front doors and additional sound deadening materials throughout the cabin. A \"top-of-dash\" display -- positioned at eye-level on the center stack -- features a message center that is easier to read when driving. In addition, a new center console design replaces the traditional \"brick\" pattern for the radio and heating/air conditioning controls. It also houses a standard auxiliary audio input jack and two power points. \b \b    Ford Sync helps Focus owners stay connected \b \u001d  To meet customer demand for must-have technologies, Ford Sync is available in the new Focus. Developed in association with Microsoft, Sync is Ford's new factory installed, voice-activated in-car communications and entertainment system for mobile phones and digital music players. \b \u001d  Sync connects to cellular phones and downloads personal features, such as phone books and ring tones. Using Sync's voice recognition software, drivers can place and receive calls and receive text messages using the vehicle's audio system. Users can even maintain a cell phone conversation while entering or exiting the vehicle. \b \u001d  Sync also offers hands-free, voice-activated control for nearly any digital media player, including the Apple iPod(R), Microsoft Zune(TM), \"Plays for Sure\" players and most USB storage devices. Even MP3 files saved on flash memory sticks can be played by simply inserting the stick into system's USB port. \b \u001d  Because Sync is fully upgradeable, Focus owners will never need to worry about whether their car is compatible with the latest phone or music player that hits the market. \b \b    Reworked suspension and stiffer body give Focus a better ride \b \u001d  For 2008, the Focus's curb weight is reduced by 60 pounds, even though the body structure is stiffer. In retuning the body structure, engineers concentrated on such specific areas as the roof structure, package tray, rear floor area and door systems. They also added a stiffened cross-car beam under the instrument panel for even better lateral stiffness. The result is sharper steering and handling with improved ride quality at the same time. \b \u001d  The 2008 Focus features a 2.0-liter, 16-valve, four-cylinder engine with a new air intake system and new cooling system delivering an estimated 136 hp. Available in states adopting the California emission standards is a super-clean Duratec 20E engine that qualifies as a Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (PZEV). \b \b    Ford's Personal Safety System(R) is standard on all 2008 Focus model \b \u001d  The 2008 Focus, in addition to Ford's Personal Safety System, comes standard with side air bags and side air curtains.  The advanced side air curtains -- Ford's Safety Canopy(TM) -- feature \"roll-fold\" technology. If occupants are resting their heads against a window, the curtain is designed to slide between the glass and occupants as it inflates. In the event of a rollover, the curtains remain inflated for several seconds to enhance protection during an extended crash event. \b \u001d  Ford's Personal Safety System is a comprehensive collection of passive safety features for the front passengers. The system includes dual-deployment front air bags, energy absorbing safety belts, load limiting retractors and pretensioners, all which will help to create one of the safest cabins in its segment. \b \b    About Ford Motor Company \b \u001d  Ford Motor Company, a global automotive industry leader based in Dearborn, Mich., manufactures and distributes automobiles in 200 markets across six continents.

\u001d  (Updates throughout with additional comments from LaSorda on a UAW health care deal and comments from chief operating officer.) \b \b    By Terry Kosdrosky \b    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--Chrysler Group Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said Sunday there's \"no doubt\" in his mind that the auto maker can reach an agreement with the United Auto Workers union \"before the end of the term\" despite the tough issues facing both sides. \u001d  The master contract between the US automakers and the UAW expires later this year. Automakers have said they'd like a more competitive agreement and the union's president has indicated he'd like to hold on to benefits. Chrysler is a unit of DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX). \u001d  Despite expecting tough negotiations, LaSorda, speaking on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show, said he \"anticipates we'll be able to resolve things.\" \u001d  U.S. auto makers are expected to try to address rising health care costs and the controversial \"Jobs Bank\" program that pays workers nearly full pay and benefits while on layoff. \u001d  Chrysler Group Chief Operating Officer Eric Ridenour, during a separate interview with Dow Jones Newswires, said of the Jobs Bank: \"Certainly that would be probably one of the things that would come up\" during negotiations. He woudln't specify any of Chrysler's talking points with the UAW. \u001d  LaSorda's optimism comes even though the UAW has not given Chrysler the health care concessions it gave General Motors Corp. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F). LaSorda, speaking during a roundtable interview with reporters, said Chrysler still hopes to get a similar health care deal before talks start on the master agreement later this summer. \u001d  The UAW has argued that Chryslers is in a different financial position than GM and Ford. \u001d  But LaSorda said Sunday that Chrysler gave the union more financial information at the end of 2006 and he hopes a dialogue with the UAW begins soon after this week. \u001d  He said Chrysler is at a \"competitive disadvantage\" with Ford and GM without a similar deal. \u001d  Despite that difference with the union, LaSorda said he remains confident the auto maker will be able to reach a new master agreement before the deadline expires. \u001d  He said Chrysler and the UAW have a good history of identifying the problems facing them and solving them at the bargaining table. \b \b    Turnaround Plan To Be Widespread \b \u001d  LaSorda also said a turnaround plan being prepared in the wake of Chrysler's $1.5 billion third-quarter loss will be \"widespread\" and address every area of the company. \u001d  LaSorda wouldnt discuss details of the turnaround strategy, saying those would come in February or early March. When asked if the plan would include plant closings, he said it hasn't been decided. \u001d  He also said he's taking a look at the advertising and marketing for each of the auto maker's brands - Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep - to make sure they're getting the right advertising and market message. LaSorda took over responsibility for U.S. sales after the departure of former sales chief Joe Eberhardt in late 2006. \u001d  LaSorda said he's spent a lot of time looking at each brand's message.   \"The question is, am I fully aligned with the brand, brand equity, brand values with my advertising... and I think we can improve upon that,\" he said. \u001d  LaSorda said Chrysler expects to hear a decision from the DaimlerChrysler supervisory board and Chinese authorities within 30 to 60 days on its joint venture proposal with Chinese auto maker Chery Automobile Co. to build a subcompact car for North America and other markets. \u001d  Chrysler has said it wants to offer a subcompact car in North America as consumers shift away from larger vehicles, but also said it's difficult to build a cost-competitive model in North America. \u001d  LaSorda said he expects to make another trip to the White House this year and plans to meet the new Congressional leadership before the end of the second quarter. \"The earlier the better,\" he said. \u001d  LaSorda and his counterparts at GM and Ford met with President George W. Bush late last year to discuss trade, energy and currency policies, among other issues impacting the automotive sector. The Big 3 executives have complained over the past year that certain policies give their foreign competitors an unfair advantage. \b \b    Hopes to Gain U.S. Share \b \u001d  Chrysler hit a bump in the road last year when inventory levels spiked amid a downturn in sales of pickup trucks and SUVs. After gaining market share in 2005, Chrysler's U.S. sales were down 7% to 2.14 million vehicles in 2006. \u001d  LaSorda said Chrysler will focus on \"profitable growth\" in 2007 but didn't give any projections, noting that 2006 was a down year \u001d  Ridenour said he would like to see an increase in U.S. market share for Chrysler in 2007, given the new products launched late last year and with eight new products launching in 2007. Overall, he said 2007 U.S. auto sales likely will be flat to slightly down compared with 2007. \u001d   \"Within that, how do you do from the standpoint of share?,\" he said. \"And certainly with the new products hitting and getting in full stride, we'd like to see an increase in that. And as you take those two together, hopefully that means a net increase in total units.\" \u001d  He wouldln't give a specific projections. \u001d  LaSorda said a priority this year is to help out Chrysler's dealers, who also were stung by the inventory buildup. \u001d  \"We let them down here somewhat in 2006,\" LaSorda said. \"We're going to make sure that our focus is on profit from great products, keep the inventory levels balanced so they can make money again.\" \b \u001d  -By Terry Kosdrosky, Dow Jones Newswires; (313) 226-1251; terry.kosdrosky@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow

 (This updates an item that ran at 1517 GMT with comment from easyJet.) \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Bristol International airport said Sunday that it was had closed its runway as of 1430 GMT and that flights after that would either be diverted or canceled. \u001d  The arrangement will remain in place until Monday morning, the statement said. \u001d  Some airlines operating at Bristol have expressed concerns about the surface of the temporary sections of the runway during an ongoing resurfacing program in wet conditions. \u001d  A spokesman for Bristol airport said that the runway had been closed in order to \"fast-track\" the resurfacing. Budget airline easyJet (EZJ.LN) became the fourth carrier to transfer flights away from Bristol on Saturday, when it opted to operate instead out of nearby Cardiff airport. \u001d  EasyJet said Sunday that it \"will operate 60% of its Bristol operation in and out of Cardiff. However, 20 flights will have to be canceled. EasyJet expects to resume normal operations from Bristol International Airport within the next few days once the maintenance is complete.\" \u001d  It added that passengers must still check in at Bristol airport and that easyJet will transfer them to Cardiff. It said that easyJet had no facilities in Cardiff to check in passengers. \u001d  Three other airlines, Aer Lingus (EIL1.DB), XL and Air Malta, temporarily relocated to Cardiff as well. \u001d  Bristol airport said that detailed assessments were carried out Sunday morning on the impact of additional grooving on test strips of the temporary runway surface. \u001d  \"These have proved satisfactory in terms of further increasing the drainage of surface water on the temporary sections of the runway which is in the process of being resurfaced,\" the statement said. \u001d  The Civil Aviation Authority has no objection to extra grooving work that has been proposed. Bristol airport said the additional grooving and the CAA's stance gave it confidence that the airlines would resume operations at Bristol. \u001d  \"We will continue to liaise fully with our airlines partners and provide them with all the information they need to operate from the airport,\" Bristol International Airport Managing Director Andrew Skipp said in the statement. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.bristolairport.co.uk \u001d  -By Victoria Howley, Dow Jones Newswires;

Wagoner says the company needs to build more than the 1,000 or so electric cars the company did in its last electric car effort, the abandoned EV1 program, and adds their vision is clearer this time. Instead, GM would ideally like to build \"hundreds of thousands, (even) millions a year...this is an opportunity to deliver results.\" He concedes, however, there are question marks around the technology. \"Production time will depend on development of battery technology,\" he says. (JDS/PI) \u001d  2:16 (Dow Jones) GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz called it an \"inconvenient truth\" that his company has indeed started development of a new \"E-Flex\" vehicle, the Chevrolet Volt, which run on electricity as well as biodiesel, ethanol and, yes, gasoline. The Volt has a sporty look, WSJ.com observes, and Lutz noted an electric vehicle can also \"look good.\" The Volt can drive 40 miles before other fuels need to help recharge and Lutz emphasized that 78% of Americans live within 20 miles of work. He said if someone drove to work, ran nearby errands and charged the car every night, the owner would never have to buy gasoline for the lifetime of the vehicle, he said. For now, though, the Volt remains only an intriguing concept. (MS) \u001d  (http://blogs.wsj.com/autoshow/) \u001d  1:26 (Dow Jones) In the minutes leading up to Chrysler Group's big auto show press conference, there were giant loafs of bread flanking the stage. A kitchen counter was in the middle, as if on a cooking show. Irreverent slices of cartoon bread danced on a giant screen. \u001d  What was the theme for this revamped minivan unveiling event - the \"best thing since sliced bread\" or \"something's cooking at Chrysler\"? Nope. Instead, it was Chrysler Group's focus on its \"bread and butter\" vehicles. The DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) unit rolled out the latest versions of its Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country minivans, replete with a host of gadgets and options. Not listed: the wood paneling seen on the old Plymouth Voyager minivan, also rolled out as Chrysler touted it's long pioneering position in the vehicle segment. \u001d  Chrysler President Tom LaSorda was joined on stage by celebrity chef Bobby Flay, and the two made a couple of quick dishes that represent the Chrysler and Dodge brands - spicy pork loin with mango for Dodge and a smooth chocolate ganache cake for Chrysler. \u001d  When LaSorda took a turn icing the cake, Flay told the executive, \"I can tell you've spent a lot of time in the hot kitchen,\" to which LaSorda replied, \"The kitchen's been pretty hot lately, I'll tell you,\" a reference to Chrysler's tough 2006. (JDK, TKS) \u001d  1:08 (Dow Jones) Ford's (F) new leader, Alan Mulally, looked like a lifer in his appearance at the company's press conference. Driven out in a glistening new 500 sedan, Mulally was poised and energetic in discussing Ford's cars and prospects, sounding much like a man who's excited about what he's doing. After the event, North American head Mark Fields - who matched Mulally in the enthusiasm department - said he expects the auto maker's sales will be down slightly, with light vehicle sales of roughly 16.4M, as the US economy slows down. Fields expects GDP of 2%-2.5%, with a moderating job market and weak housing market. (PJV) \u001d  12:40 (Dow Jones) Was that a press conference or a rock concert? Ford's (F) flashy press conference featured deafening rock music, a light show and five giant video screens. Executives like Bill Ford Jr. and Mark Fields were driven onto the stage in glistening cars and greeted like guitar heroes. The music was so loud it drowned out the engine on Ford's concept muscle car, the Interceptor. Even Bill Gates was trotted out via satellite to talk about Ford and Microsoft's (MSFT) \"Sync\" project. 2006 was difficult, Bill Ford said, and 2007 will be pivotal, but the company's laid the foundation for a better Ford. (PJV) \u001d  11:05 (Dow Jones) Johnson Control (JCI) is trying to beef up the gadget-connection capability in cars, an issue in the spotlight at this year's North American International Auto Show with the Ford/Microsoft deal. JCI on Sunday unveiled its Mobile Device Gateway, which would allow drivers to use Bluetooth, USB and serial ports to plug in cell phones, MP3 players and other devices and use them as if they were factory-installed. JCI is working with automakers on making it available in 2010 and \"maybe even a little earlier,\" says Scott Wright, vice president of electronic sales and marketing. The system expands on JCI's current Bluetooth system. (TAK) \u001d  10:53 (Dow Jones) The media are descending on Detroit. The centennial North American auto show kicks off today, with a full slate of events and hoards of journalists jockeying for position. GM is building the early buzz, with its glitzy runway show last night and its fairly surprising sweep of the North American car and truck awards this morning. The company also has a noon press conference where it will unveil its latest concept car, the Chevy Volt, and talk about getting back into the electric car market - just as soon as it develops a new type of battery.

Engine Concept Delivers V-8 Power and Performance V-6 Fuel

The Lincoln MKR concept, unveiled today at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, introduces a new engine technology that delivers V-8 power and performance with V-6 fuel economy.  The new technology, named TwinForce(TM), will appear on future Lincoln and Ford vehicles. \b \u001d  TwinForce uses direct injection technology and turbocharging. These technologies are common in diesel engines, but have only recently been combined for use in gasoline engines. \b \u001d  \"Everything we do is driven by our customers,\" said Derrick Kuzak, group vice president, Global Product Development. \"Our TwinForce engine technology is a key element of how we're going after fuel economy gains without asking anyone to give up performance.\" \b \u001d  TwinForce's direct-injection fuel system is different than conventional port fuel-injected gasoline engines. Instead of squirting gasoline into the engine cylinder head, it directly injects gasoline into the engine's cylinders at high pressures. \b \u001d  Direct-injection fuel systems can more precisely control when and how much fuel is injected into the engine cylinders, allowing for more efficient burn and improved combustion control that delivers optimal performance and fuel economy. \b \u001d  Ford's new Duratec 35 all-aluminum V-6, named a 10 Best Engine by Ward's, is the foundation for the TwinForce technology found in the Lincoln MKR concept. \b \u001d  The Lincoln MKR's engine is flex-fuel capable, providing the driver with the flexibility to switch back and forth between gasoline and E-85 ethanol. At Ford, flexible fuel is an important step toward development of more efficient, renewable biofuels that can provide energy security as well as environmental benefits. \b \u001d  Combining the high octane found in E-85 or premium gasoline with TwinForce technology allows the Lincoln MKR's V-6 to deliver 415 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque -- an impressive 118 horsepower per liter. \b \u001d  To achieve this type of performance from a V-8 would require an engine displacement of 6.0-liters or larger. As a result of the smaller V-6, the Lincoln MKR concept delivers 15 percent better fuel economy than a V-8 with similar performance. \b \u001d  In North America, the market is growing for the new TwinForce technology. Ford Motor Company already has several direct-injection equipped 4-cylinder engines in production, including a 1.8-liter launched in the 2003 Ford Mondeo and the 2.3-liter turbocharged engine developed by Mazda for the 2006 MazdaSpeed6. \b \u001d  The TwinForce technology used in the Lincoln MKR represents Ford's first application of direct injection on a V-6 engine. Its development was led by Ford Powertrain Research and Advanced Engineering, the same group leading the production design and development of this technology in a pilot program intended to speed the time to market with the new engine. \b \b    About Ford Motor Company \b \u001d  Ford Motor Company, a global automotive industry leader based in Dearborn, Mich., manufactures and distributes automobiles in 200 markets across six continents. With about 300,000 employees and more than 100 plants worldwide, the company's core and affiliated automotive brands include Aston Martin, Ford, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mazda, Mercury and Volvo.

The tiny two-seater Fortwo is the brand's only model after the company ceased production of a four-seater and a roadster model. \u001d  The Smart division saw deliveries fall 22% on the year to 112,100 vehicles in full-year 2006. The Fortwo accounted for around 70% of the unit's sales last year as sales of the Roadtser and Fortwo model phased out. Walker said the internal targets have been \"more than fulfilled\" ahead of the upcoming model changeover, without elaborating further. \u001d  Smart is set to launch a new version of its tiny two-seater model in April 2007, and plans a U.S. debut for the brand in the first quarter 2008. For the entry in the U.S. market, DaimlerChrysler signed a General Distributor Agreement, or GDA, with UnitedAuto Group Inc. (UAG) last year. According to previous company statement, DaimlerChrysler estimates the \"market potential\" to be around 20,000 sales per year. \u001d  \"I think there a lot of people out there who are looking for low costs of ownership and are concerned about traffic congestion,\" UnitedAuto Group's CEO Roger Penske told Dow Jones Newswires in Detroit. He declined to give a specific sales target for the Smart brand in the U.S. \u001d  \"Smart sold around 4,000 cars in Canada in its first year, the U.S. auto market is about eleven times as big as the Canadian, and if we get around 50% of this sales level here, this would be a success,\" he said. \u001d  Penske said he received 1,100 applications from interested dealers for a possible franchises. From these applicants, UAG will choose between 50 and 60 dealers for the brand's launch in the U.S., Penske said, adding that the company will go on a roadshow to Las Vegas, Atlanta, Detroit and New York over the next 30 days. \u001d  Penske reiterated that the Smart Fortwo will go on sale for \"a price below $15,000\". \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com \b \u001d  -By Christoph Rauwald, Dow Jones Newswires; +49 69 29 725 512; christoph.rauwald@dowjones.com \b-0- \u001d  APDJ-01-07-07 1951GMT< \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 15:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8dae7d61db657fb16191306140e20fcf","symR":["BCOLOMBIA.BO","CIB","SURAMINV.BO","COB07AO00048","COM13AO00043"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Colombia's Gilinskis Seek Control Of Bancolombia -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T20:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BCOLOMBIA.BO","CIB","SURAMINV.BO","COB07AO00048","COM13AO00043"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BOGOTA (Dow Jones)--Isaac Gilinski, a Colombian businessman whose family formerly owned Banco de Colombia SA, said he wants to get control of the country's biggest bank Bancolombia SA (CIB), the newspaper El Tiempo reported Sunday. \u001d  The Gilinski family, who sold control of Banco de Colombia SA to Banco Industrial Colombiano in 1997 for $418 million, sued BIC claiming the family was defrauded by BIC executives. \u001d  The merged bank was renamed Bancolombia. \u001d  \"The only friendly solution is for them to pay the 1.5 trillion Colombian pesos ($673 million) the experts hired by the prosecutor said we are entitled to,\" El Tiempo quoted Gilinski as saying. \"I think they have to give us the bank back.\" \u001d  The family's lawyers said the family originally sought $632 million in damages. None of Gilinski's lawyers were immediately available for comment Sunday. \u001d  The Gilinskis owns several businesses in Colombia, Central America and the U.S. They control the Colombian bank Banco GNB Sudameris. \u001d  As part of the lawsuit, a public prosecutor Thursday ordered Bancolombia's Chief Executive Jorge Londono and the bank's vice president Federico Ochoa to be placed under house arrest. \u001d  When BIC bought 51% of Banco de Colombia, it financed the purchase with loans from its Panamanian unit that were then transferred onto the books of the newly merged entity, the prosecutor said. BIC also failed to inject $58 million promised in equity for the new bank as part of the transaction. \u001d  The prosecutor accused the two executives of fraud, unlawful use of public funds and non-authorized operations with shareholders, according to a statement from the chief prosecutor's office. \u001d  The 10-year-old dispute was reopened in October 2006 after the Gilisnki family, which lost an initial decision, appealed to the country's Constitutional Court. \u001d  In a statement e-mailed late Friday, Bancolombia said the bank and its officers acted \"with the highest degree of loyalty and transparency\" and that the process followed all the legal requirements. \u001d  \"Neither Bancolombia nor its officers have made improper use of public funds, nor have they appropriated any such funds,\" the statement said. \u001d  Londono denies any wrongdoing and will challenge the prosecutor's decision, according to his attorney, Ricardo Calvete. \u001d  Calvete said his client has not been notified of the arrest order yet, and so is not confined to his home. \u001d  According to Calvete, Londono is still Bancolombia's CEO. \u001d  Bancolombia's ADR fell 6.2% on Thursday after the news of the arrest order broke off, though the price partly recovered on Friday, gaining 1.3% to end at $30.39. The New York-traded share will resume trading Monday. \u001d  The locally traded share of Bancolombia fell 4.6% on Friday to COP16,480, while the share of the holding company controlling the bank Suramericana de Inversiones SA (SURAMINV.BO) fell 3% to COP19,500. \u001d  The stocks are the two most liquid shares of the local stock exchange, and account for about 17% of the total market capitalization of the exchange. \u001d  Monday is a holiday in Colombia, so the shares will only resume trading Tuesday. \b \u001d  -By Inti Landauro, Dow Jones Newswires; 57-310-867 6542;

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \b   (call: 201-938-5172; email: paul.vigna@dowjones.com) \b \b   AUTO SHOW MARKET TALK can be found using N/DJMT and I/AUT \b \u001d  1:26 (Dow Jones) In the minutes leading up to Chrysler Group's big auto show press conference, there were giant loafs of bread flanking the stage. A kitchen counter was in the middle, as if on a cooking show. Irreverent slices of cartoon bread danced on a giant screen. \u001d  What was the theme for this revamped minivan unveiling event - the \"best thing since sliced bread\" or \"something's cooking at Chrysler\"? Nope. Instead, it was Chrysler Group's focus on its \"bread and butter\" vehicles. The DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) unit rolled out the latest versions of its Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country minivans, replete with a host of gadgets and options. Not listed: the wood paneling seen on the old Plymouth Voyager minivan, also rolled out as Chrysler touted it's long pioneering position in the vehicle segment. \u001d  Chrysler President Tom LaSorda was joined on stage by celebrity chef Bobby Flay, and the two made a couple of quick dishes that represent the Chrysler and Dodge brands - spicy pork loin with mango for Dodge and a smooth chocolate ganache cake for Chrysler. \u001d  When LaSorda took a turn icing the cake, Flay told the executive, \"I can tell you've spent a lot of time in the hot kitchen,\" to which LaSorda replied, \"The kitchen's been pretty hot lately, I'll tell you,\" a reference to Chrysler's tough 2006. (JDK, TKS) \u001d  1:08 (Dow Jones) Ford's (F) new leader, Alan Mulally, looked like a lifer in his appearance at the company's press conference. Driven out in a glistening new 500 sedan, Mulally was poised and energetic in discussing Ford's cars and prospects, sounding much like a man who's excited about what he's doing. After the event, North American head Mark Fields - who matched Mulally in the enthusiasm department - said he expects the auto maker's sales will be down slightly, with light vehicle sales of roughly 16.4M, as the US economy slows down. Fields expects GDP of 2%-2.5%, with a moderating job market and weak housing market. (PJV) \u001d  12:40 (Dow Jones) Was that a press conference or a rock concert? Ford's (F) flashy press conference featured deafening rock music, a light show and five giant video screens. Executives like Bill Ford Jr. and Mark Fields were driven onto the stage in glistening cars and greeted like guitar heroes. The music was so loud it drowned out the engine on Ford's concept muscle car, the Interceptor. Even Bill Gates was trotted out via satellite to talk about Ford and Microsoft's (MSFT) \"Sync\" project. 2006 was difficult, Bill Ford said, and 2007 will be pivotal, but the company's laid the foundation for a better Ford. (PJV) \u001d  11:05 (Dow Jones) Johnson Control (JCI) is trying to beef up the gadget-connection capability in cars, an issue in the spotlight at this year's North American International Auto Show with the Ford/Microsoft deal. JCI on Sunday unveiled its Mobile Device Gateway, which would allow drivers to use Bluetooth, USB and serial ports to plug in cell phones, MP3 players and other devices and use them as if they were factory-installed. JCI is working with automakers on making it available in 2010 and \"maybe even a little earlier,\" says Scott Wright, vice president of electronic sales and marketing. The system expands on JCI's current Bluetooth system. (TAK) \u001d  10:53 (Dow Jones) The media are descending on Detroit. The centennial North American auto show kicks off today, with a full slate of events and hoards of journalists jockeying for position. GM is building the early buzz, with its glitzy runway show last night and its fairly surprising sweep of the North American car and truck awards this morning. The company also has a noon press conference where it will unveil its latest concept car, the Chevy Volt, and talk about getting back into the electric car market - just as soon as it develops a new type of battery.

\b   Edited by Paul Vigna \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \b   (call: 201-938-5172; email: paul.vigna@dowjones.com) \b \b   AUTO SHOW MARKET TALK can be found using N/DJMT and I/AUT \b \u001d  5:19 (Dow Jones) The centennial North American International Auto Show kicked off today at Cobo Hall in Detroit, and from a car so advanced General Motors (GM) can't even produce it yet - the Chevy Volt - to a car so small it can fit in a phone booth - the Smart ForTwo - the show has produced more than enough to keep car enthusiasts, investors and even journalists busy. The press preview runs through Monday, then industry insiders get their look, and on the 13th it opens to the public. What follows are some of the first day's highlights. (PJV) \u001d  5:06 (Dow Jones) Without a doubt, some of the most beautiful and powerful cars at the auto show in Detroit are from the House of Sant'Agata Bolognese - Lamborghini. At the decidedly high end of the auto market, Lamborghini has three models on display, the Murcielago LP640 Roadster, the Murcielago LP640 Coupe and the Gallardo Spyder. The Italian luxury auto maker also reported at the show that 2006 was a record year, with 2,087 cars built and sold, up 30.4% from a year ago. The 640 Roadster, first introduced at the Los Angeles auto show in November, will go on sale in the spring. The cost? Roughly $400,000. (PJV) \u001d  4:13 (Dow Jones) One of if not the smallest cars here is the Smart car, a DaimlerChrysler (DCX) product that's been popular in Europe and will make its US debut in the 1Q08, being sold through United Auto Group (UAG). The little car - it's being displayed outside Cobo Hall maneuvering through and parking between limos and could almost fit in the bed of a Silverado - is being introduced at the \"right time,\" UAG CEO Roger Penske says. Penske wouldn't make a production estimate, but did say jokingly it would be in the \"double digits.\" Penske was asked how he would reply to potential customers worried about driving such a small car on US roads alongside all those big SUVs. He said the car is small, but it's high-tech and has a plethora of safety features. \"It's amazing how resilient it is because of the design.\" (PJV) \u001d  3:52 (Dow Jones) With all the high-tech, space-age know-how on display, it was an usual sight to see a man standing in the lobby of Cobo Hall next to one of the lowest tech vehicles around: a sled. A team of five barking, yelping huskies was attached to the sled, and they ran into the main hall and onto DaimlerChrysler's (DCX) exhibit space, which was covered in a sheet of ice, to kick off DCX's presentation. DCX introduced several new models with its 4matic drive - the general theme being 4matic can handle any terrain - and a few with its Bluetec, clean diesel engines. The dogs were followed by hockey players and ice skaters. \"I hope you didn't expect to see me on skates,\" CEO Dr. Dieter Zetsche said. (PJV) \u001d  3:25 (Dow Jones) GM CEO Rick Wagoner says the Chevy Volt electric car \"isn't about science projects.\" The auto maker has set aside hundreds of millions of dollars to get the electric car started, but Wagoner indicates the company will spend significantly more than $500M to make it a reality. Wagoner says the company needs to build more than the 1,000 or so electric cars the company did in its last electric car effort, the abandoned EV1 program, and adds their vision is clearer this time. Instead, GM would ideally like to build \"hundreds of thousands, (even) millions a year...this is an opportunity to deliver results.\" He concedes, however, there are question marks around the technology. \"Production time will depend on development of battery technology,\" he says. (JDS/PI) \u001d  2:16 (Dow Jones) GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz called it an \"inconvenient truth\" that his company has indeed started development of a new \"E-Flex\" vehicle, the Chevrolet Volt, which run on electricity as well as biodiesel, ethanol and, yes, gasoline. The Volt has a sporty look, WSJ.com observes, and Lutz noted an electric vehicle can also \"look good.\" The Volt can drive 40 miles before other fuels need to help recharge and Lutz emphasized that 78% of Americans live within 20 miles of work. He said if someone drove to work, ran nearby errands and charged the car every night, the owner would never have to buy gasoline for the lifetime of the vehicle, he said. For now, though, the Volt remains only an intriguing concept. (MS) \u001d  (http://blogs.wsj.com/autoshow/) \u001d  1:26 (Dow Jones) In the minutes leading up to Chrysler Group's big auto show press conference, there were giant loafs of bread flanking the stage. A kitchen counter was in the middle, as if on a cooking show. Irreverent slices of cartoon bread danced on a giant screen. \u001d  What was the theme for this revamped minivan unveiling event - the \"best thing since sliced bread\" or \"something's cooking at Chrysler\"? Nope. Instead, it was Chrysler Group's focus on its \"bread and butter\" vehicles. The DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) unit rolled out the latest versions of its Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country minivans, replete with a host of gadgets and options. Not listed: the wood paneling seen on the old Plymouth Voyager minivan, also rolled out as Chrysler touted it's long pioneering position in the vehicle segment. \u001d  Chrysler President Tom LaSorda was joined on stage by celebrity chef Bobby Flay, and the two made a couple of quick dishes that represent the Chrysler and Dodge brands - spicy pork loin with mango for Dodge and a smooth chocolate ganache cake for Chrysler. \u001d  When LaSorda took a turn icing the cake, Flay told the executive, \"I can tell you've spent a lot of time in the hot kitchen,\" to which LaSorda replied, \"The kitchen's been pretty hot lately, I'll tell you,\" a reference to Chrysler's tough 2006. (JDK, TKS) \u001d  1:08 (Dow Jones) Ford's (F) new leader, Alan Mulally, looked like a lifer in his appearance at the company's press conference. Driven out in a glistening new 500 sedan, Mulally was poised and energetic in discussing Ford's cars and prospects, sounding much like a man who's excited about what he's doing. After the event, North American head Mark Fields - who matched Mulally in the enthusiasm department - said he expects the auto maker's sales will be down slightly, with light vehicle sales of roughly 16.4M, as the US economy slows down. Fields expects GDP of 2%-2.5%, with a moderating job market and weak housing market. (PJV) \u001d  12:40 (Dow Jones) Was that a press conference or a rock concert? Ford's (F) flashy press conference featured deafening rock music, a light show and five giant video screens. Executives like Bill Ford Jr. and Mark Fields were driven onto the stage in glistening cars and greeted like guitar heroes. The music was so loud it drowned out the engine on Ford's concept muscle car, the Interceptor. Even Bill Gates was trotted out via satellite to talk about Ford and Microsoft's (MSFT) \"Sync\" project. 2006 was difficult, Bill Ford said, and 2007 will be pivotal, but the company's laid the foundation for a better Ford. (PJV) \u001d  11:05 (Dow Jones) Johnson Control (JCI) is trying to beef up the gadget-connection capability in cars, an issue in the spotlight at this year's North American International Auto Show with the Ford/Microsoft deal. JCI on Sunday unveiled its Mobile Device Gateway, which would allow drivers to use Bluetooth, USB and serial ports to plug in cell phones, MP3 players and other devices and use them as if they were factory-installed. JCI is working with automakers on making it available in 2010 and \"maybe even a little earlier,\" says Scott Wright, vice president of electronic sales and marketing. The system expands on JCI's current Bluetooth system. (TAK) \u001d  10:53 (Dow Jones) The media are descending on Detroit. The centennial North American auto show kicks off today, with a full slate of events and hoards of journalists jockeying for position. GM is building the early buzz, with its glitzy runway show last night and its fairly surprising sweep of the North American car and truck awards this morning. The company also has a noon press conference where it will unveil its latest concept car, the Chevy Volt, and talk about getting back into the electric car market - just as soon as it develops a new type of battery.

Structural upgrades to further improve crash protection include reinforcements in the footwell area and new interior door panels. \b \u001d  \"Customers love the Five Hundred's ride and package, and its safety reputation is excellent,\" says Cisco Codina, Ford's group vice president of North America Marketing, Sales and Service. \"For this year, we've dialed up the appeal with a new, more expressive look, a more powerful engine and more than 500 changes to make this great car even better.\" \b \u001d  The Five Hundred's 3.5-liter Duratec V-6 now delivers an estimated 260 horsepower and 245 pound-feet of torque. It also benefits from the same smooth shifting, six-speed automatic transmission and the same available all-wheel- drive system as the new Ford Edge. Importantly, even with the upgraded powertrain, real-world fuel economy for the front-wheel-drive model is expected to be similar to the current model -- thanks to advancements in powertrain technology. \b \b    New look inside and out \b \u001d  The Five Hundred's new look aligns it with the Ford Fusion. New from the A-pillars forward, the Five Hundred now features Ford's signature three-bar chrome grille. A sculpted hood adds a touch of crisp detail, and a new front fascia is chamfered at the outer edges, adding structure to the design.  All- new side mirrors are smaller yet provide better visibility and reduce wind noise. Chrome side vents, door handles and mirror caps give the Five Hundred Limited models a more expensive appearance. New taillamps carry the horizontal theme to the rear, while a new rear fascia houses chrome-tipped dual exhausts. \b \b    Ultra-quiet interior and plush ride \b \u001d  For 2008, the Five Hundred's sound package has been completely revised, helping make it as quiet as many luxury cars. The new sound package includes such technologies as expandable foam pellets in the A-pillars to reduce wind noise and the use of an advanced sound-deadening material called Sonosorb(TM) in the doors, headliner and pillars. Sonosorb increases sound-deadening efficiency by 20 percent while retaining the same thickness as the material it replaces. \b \u001d  Engineers also reduced road noise by stiffening the area where the rear package shelf meets the floor pan. Even the climate control system was improved by making the system 50 percent quieter than before. \b \u001d  The Five Hundred's quiet, confident ride starts with an already solid foundation. Upgrades include revised shock towers that help increase front suspension travel by 10 percent, new dampers and springs in both front and rear, and a revised, retuned rear suspension. \b \u001d  One of the most significant changes is how the engine is mounted in the vehicle. Previously, the engine was mounted to the front subframe. On the new model, the engine and transmission are bolted to the body with hydraulic mounts to reduce vibration. By moving the roughly 600-pound powerpack off the subframe, engineers were able to better tune the suspension and, ultimately, create an even better ride. \b \b    Maximum convenience and space \b \u001d  The Five Hundred features the most spacious interior of any large sedan, with best-in-class legroom front and rear and 60/40-split fold-flat second-row seats. With the fold-flat front-passenger seat, items up to nine-feet long can fit inside. \b \u001d  Five Hundred also offers a number of must-have technologies. In addition to a standard auxiliary audio input jack, available convenience features include a voice-activated navigation system, a DVD entertainment system and factory-installed SIRIUS(R) satellite radio. Ford Sync(TM) is also available on the new Five Hundred. Sync is a voice-activated hands-free in-car communications and entertainment system which fully-integrates mobile phones and digital media players. The Sync in-car communications system was developed in collaboration with Microsoft and will be offered exclusively on 12 Ford, Lincoln and Mercury products in North America beginning this year. \b \b    Building on safety leadership \b \u001d  The 2007 Five Hundred is already the segment leader in safety, earning five stars in all four categories for the U.S. government's crash tests. Five Hundred was also the first Gold Award winner from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and is the class leader in rear crash performance. \b \u001d  For 2008, Five Hundred offers the added safety and control of Ford's AdvanceTrac(R) electronic stability control system. AdvanceTrac can predict the vehicle's intentions using a sensor to detect and measure oversteer and yaw by monitoring the vehicle's speed, throttle position and steering wheel angle. When the system senses wheel slip, engine torque is reduced and braking is applied where needed to help keep the car tracking safely on its intended path. \b \u001d  Five Hundred comes standard with dual-stage driver and passenger front air bags, seat-deployed side air bags for driver and front passenger and Safety Canopy(TM) side curtain rollover air bags for both rows. \b \b    About Ford Motor Company \b \u001d  Ford Motor Company, a global automotive industry leader based in Dearborn, Mich., manufactures and distributes automobiles in 200 markets across six continents.

all the high-tech, space-age know-how on display, it was an usual sight to see a man standing in the lobby of Cobo Hall next to one of the lowest tech vehicles around: a sled. A team of five barking, yelping huskies was attached to the sled, and they ran into the main hall and onto DaimlerChrysler's (DCX) exhibit space, which was covered in a sheet of ice, to kick off DCX's presentation. DCX introduced several new models with its 4matic drive - the general theme being 4matic can handle any terrain - and a few with its Bluetec, clean diesel engines. The dogs were followed by hockey players and ice skaters. \"I hope you didn't expect to see me on skates,\" CEO Dr. Dieter Zetsche said. (PJV) \u001d  3:25 (Dow Jones) GM CEO Rick Wagoner says the Chevy Volt electric car \"isn't about science projects.\" The auto maker has set aside hundreds of millions of dollars to get the electric car started, but Wagoner indicates the company will spend significantly more than $500M to make it a reality. Wagoner says the company needs to build more than the 1,000 or so electric cars the company did in its last electric car effort, the abandoned EV1 program, and adds their vision is clearer this time. Instead, GM would ideally like to build \"hundreds of thousands, (even) millions a year...this is an opportunity to deliver results.\" He concedes, however, there are question marks around the technology. \"Production time will depend on development of battery technology,\" he says. (JDS/PI) \u001d  2:16 (Dow Jones) GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz called it an \"inconvenient truth\" that his company has indeed started development of a new \"E-Flex\" vehicle, the Chevrolet Volt, which run on electricity as well as biodiesel, ethanol and, yes, gasoline. The Volt has a sporty look, WSJ.com observes, and Lutz noted an electric vehicle can also \"look good.\" The Volt can drive 40 miles before other fuels need to help recharge and Lutz emphasized that 78% of Americans live within 20 miles of work. He said if someone drove to work, ran nearby errands and charged the car every night, the owner would never have to buy gasoline for the lifetime of the vehicle, he said. For now, though, the Volt remains only an intriguing concept. (MS) \u001d  (http://blogs.wsj.com/autoshow/) \u001d  1:26 (Dow Jones) In the minutes leading up to Chrysler Group's big auto show press conference, there were giant loafs of bread flanking the stage. A kitchen counter was in the middle, as if on a cooking show. Irreverent slices of cartoon bread danced on a giant screen. \u001d  What was the theme for this revamped minivan unveiling event - the \"best thing since sliced bread\" or \"something's cooking at Chrysler\"? Nope. Instead, it was Chrysler Group's focus on its \"bread and butter\" vehicles. The DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) unit rolled out the latest versions of its Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country minivans, replete with a host of gadgets and options. Not listed: the wood paneling seen on the old Plymouth Voyager minivan, also rolled out as Chrysler touted it's long pioneering position in the vehicle segment. \u001d  Chrysler President Tom LaSorda was joined on stage by celebrity chef Bobby Flay, and the two made a couple of quick dishes that represent the Chrysler and Dodge brands - spicy pork loin with mango for Dodge and a smooth chocolate ganache cake for Chrysler. \u001d  When LaSorda took a turn icing the cake, Flay told the executive, \"I can tell you've spent a lot of time in the hot kitchen,\" to which LaSorda replied, \"The kitchen's been pretty hot lately, I'll tell you,\" a reference to Chrysler's tough 2006. (JDK, TKS) \u001d  1:08 (Dow Jones) Ford's (F) new leader, Alan Mulally, looked like a lifer in his appearance at the company's press conference. Driven out in a glistening new 500 sedan, Mulally was poised and energetic in discussing Ford's cars and prospects, sounding much like a man who's excited about what he's doing. After the event, North American head Mark Fields - who matched Mulally in the enthusiasm department - said he expects the auto maker's sales will be down slightly, with light vehicle sales of roughly 16.4M, as the US economy slows down. Fields expects GDP of 2%-2.5%, with a moderating job market and weak housing market. (PJV) \u001d  12:40 (Dow Jones) Was that a press conference or a rock concert? Ford's (F) flashy press conference featured deafening rock music, a light show and five giant video screens. Executives like Bill Ford Jr. and Mark Fields were driven onto the stage in glistening cars and greeted like guitar heroes. The music was so loud it drowned out the engine on Ford's concept muscle car, the Interceptor. Even Bill Gates was trotted out via satellite to talk about Ford and Microsoft's (MSFT) \"Sync\" project. 2006 was difficult, Bill Ford said, and 2007 will be pivotal, but the company's laid the foundation for a better Ford. (PJV) \u001d  11:05 (Dow Jones) Johnson Control (JCI) is trying to beef up the gadget-connection capability in cars, an issue in the spotlight at this year's North American International Auto Show with the Ford/Microsoft deal. JCI on Sunday unveiled its Mobile Device Gateway, which would allow drivers to use Bluetooth, USB and serial ports to plug in cell phones, MP3 players and other devices and use them as if they were factory-installed. JCI is working with automakers on making it available in 2010 and \"maybe even a little earlier,\" says Scott Wright, vice president of electronic sales and marketing. The system expands on JCI's current Bluetooth system. (TAK) \u001d  10:53 (Dow Jones) The media are descending on Detroit. The centennial North American auto show kicks off today, with a full slate of events and hoards of journalists jockeying for position. GM is building the early buzz, with its glitzy runway show last night and its fairly surprising sweep of the North American car and truck awards this morning. The company also has a noon press conference where it will unveil its latest concept car, the Chevy Volt, and talk about getting back into the electric car market - just as soon as it develops a new type of battery.

Boudette \b   of the WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group has trimmed its stock of \"unassigned\" vehicles to fewer than 10,000, Chrysler Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said in an interview Sunday. \u001d  Chrysler was stuck with bloated inventories last year after building cars and trucks that had not been ordered by dealers. In September it had about 100,000 of these unassigned vehicles. \u001d  But Chrysler executives at the North American International Auto Show said the company has its inventory situation under control. Mr. Lasorda said Chrysler's main inventory, which does not include unassigned vehicles, is now 538,000 cars and trucks, down from 597,000 at the end of 2005. \u001d    (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  Chrysler had an operating loss of $1.5 billion in the third quarter, although parent DaimlerChrysler remained profitable, thanks to a strong showing by its Mercedes-Benz luxury division. Mr. LaSorda is supposed to unveil a restructuring plan by the end of February to cut costs and put the division back into the black. \u001d  Mr. LaSorda said he has the \"full support\" of DaimlerChrysler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche to give the restructuring plan a chance to work. \u001d  Cutting Chrysler's inventory is a key part of rebuilding profitability, however. In a separate interview, sales head Steve Landry acknowledged the auto maker still has not cut stocks to the levels it is aiming for. \u001d  To help boost sales of pickup trucks amid increasing competition, Chrysler plans to offer its V-8 Hemi engine in Ram pickups at no additional cost to customers, Mr. Landry acknowledged. \u001d  Chrysler had planned to roll out the offer in March but is now considering starting it sooner. The planned Hemi promotion was first reported by the Detroit News last week. \u001d  The Hemi deal marks a dramatic turnaround from 2005,  when gas prices were lower and customers were paying about $5,000 extra to get Hemi-equipped models. \u001d  -By Neal E.

It's the ultimate modern touring vehicle that delivers flexibility and capability with dynamic design that evokes the spirit of the journey.\" \b \u001d  The concept is powered by a plug-in hydrogen hybrid fuel cell drivetrain -- called HySeries Drive(TM) -- that operates under electric power at all times.  This advanced fuel cell system is half the weight and cost of today's fuel cells and can operate in the dead of winter.  That's a major step forward because today's fuel cells don't do well when the mercury dips below freezing. \b \b    Natural Intersection \b \u001d  The Ford Airstream Concept captures the sense of optimism and adventure conveyed in American aircraft, spacecraft and the streamlined shape of Airstream trailers.  It's reflected in the crossover concept's organic, fuselage-inspired form language, unique reflective paint and 12 ceremonial rivets, which pay homage to Airstream's iconic construction. \b \u001d  \"For 75 years, Airstream has been an icon synonymous with the optimism, discovery and wanderlust that's helped defined America,\" said J Mays, group vice president - Design, and chief creative officer.  \"It seemed only fitting for us to come together through our shared passion for the open road and show a vision for the future of American transportation.\" \b \u001d  Much like Ford, Airstream began with one man's dream.  In 1931, Wally Byam began leveraging aircraft-construction methods to make trailers aimed at feeding Americans' surging desire to travel. \b \u001d  \"Silver bullets\" have been shooting up and down highways ever since, leading a Recreational Vehicle industry that's realized record profits and revenues in 2005 and the first half of 2006. \b \u001d  \"Business for Airstream and the RV industry has been strong, but we want to continue finding options for tomorrow's road trips.  Our success in recent years has come from challenging the conventional thinking about what an Airstream is.  The Ford Airstream Concept is a stunning example of just that,\" says Bob Wheeler, president and chief executive officer of Airstream.  \"Plus, a partner like Ford, with its long history as an American icon, made perfect sense for this kind of exploration.\" \b \b    Common Ground \b \u001d  Both companies are influenced by economic and demographic trends -- chiefly baby boomers approaching retirement age. \b \u001d  In the U.S., 11,000 people turn age 50 every day.  These consumers are starting to downsize their lives and their vehicles, opting for more nimble and fuel-efficient models.  With their children leaving home and some retiring, they also have more time for travel. \b \u001d  For Ford, that trend -- plus younger couples starting families later -- is fueling a shift to crossover vehicles. \b \u001d  The crossover segment is expected to hit 3 million units by the end of the decade, making it potentially the largest U.S. vehicle segment. \b \u001d  For Airstream, these demographic changes are meaningful as well. RV ownership is highest among retirement-age consumers, and by the end of the decade, 50- to 64-year-old consumers will tally 57 million -- a 38 percent increase versus 2000, according to University of Michigan studies.  And the number of RV-owning households is expected to grow to 8.5 million during the same period. \b \b    Seeing the Future Today \b \u001d  Growing Ford's crossover share means breaking through the competitive and fragmenting segment, and the company is leveraging bold designs to win customers. \b \u001d  Ford's crossover lineup already features the functional Freestyle, newly launched agile and modern Edge and, in time, will include a more refined full-size crossover based on the Fairlane concept. \b \u001d  Ford designers wanted to push further into the future and tapped inspirations including Airstream's iconic designs and the optimistic future Stanley Kubrick created and captured in his 1960s cult film 2001: A Space Odyssey.  These inspirations are evident -- inside and out. \b \u001d  The concept's bold, futuristic front-end explores a new look for Ford, encapsulating the single-surface grille and headlamps into the same graphic. Each of the concept's bold orange-trimmed window graphics is a unique shape. \b \u001d  \"This reflects the purpose of the vehicle:  looking out and remembering that the journey -- not the destination -- matters most,\" said Freeman Thomas, director, North American Strategic Design.  \"The Ford Airstream Concept is an ultra-modern, optimistic vehicle that allows passengers a pure traveling experience to enjoy with good company, no matter the destination.\" \b \u001d  Its doors are asymmetric as well, allowing for easy loading of passengers and cargo. In addition to the driver's side hatch, the passenger side features a power clamshell door that runs two-thirds the length of the vehicle.  A three-door hatch finishes the rear of the crossover. \b \b    Futuristic Interior \b \u001d  The futuristic theme and modern form language of the exterior carries through to the concept's interior. \b \u001d  \"Through the materials, color palette and technology, the Ford Airstream Concept has distinct cues from the spacecraft and environments portrayed in 2001: A Space Odyssey,\" says Thomas.  \"We're able to maximize the spaciousness of the interior, creating a lounge atmosphere in contrasting colors of cosmic red and white that provides an inviting experience for the ultimate journey.\" \b \u001d  The Ford Airstream Concept features a floating instrument panel with flush-mounted, touch-sensitive controls and a multi-function single gauge display provides the driver all primary information. \b \u001d  A Sharp(R) dual-view screen centrally mounted on the instrument panel provides a camera view and secondary driver-oriented information, while allowing the front-seat passenger to view DVDs and post mobile blogs.  The driver and front-seat passenger will navigate in style in modern, pod-shaped swiveling captain's chairs that also rotate so they can easily socialize. \b \u001d  In the rear, lounge-like seating is sculptural, creating a continuous cocoon-like environment wrapped in bold red B&B Italia fabric. The focal point of the rear seating area is a 360-degree screen for entertainment and games. The unique screen also creates ambient mood settings, including a modern lava lamp and virtual fire, as well as a live camera feed. \b \b    How the Rubber Meets the Road \b \u001d  The new HySeries Drive plug-in hydrogen fuel cell featured in the Ford Airstream Concept is more than a concept. \b \u001d  This powertrain is already on the road and driving in a Ford Edge prototype.  Ford scientists and engineers created this vehicle with partial funding from the United States Department of Energy.  The HySeries Drive delivers the combined city/highway equivalent fuel economy of 41 miles per gallon. \b \u001d  In this application, the fuel cell's sole function is to recharge the vehicle's lithium-ion battery pack as needed. This allows it to work like a portable generator, instead of an engine, as had been the case in previous Ford fuel cell vehicles. \b \u001d  The new fuel cell, supplied by Ford partner Ballard, operates in a steady state, allowing a significantly smaller, less expensive fuel cell and drastically improving the durability of the fuel cell.  With this system, the fuel cell delivers the power needed to recharge the lithium-ion batteries, rather than to be the primary power source to drive the wheels, as in a typical fuel cell-powered vehicle. \b \u001d  In pure electric mode, the Ford Airstream Concept can travel 25 miles before the fuel cell begins operating to recharge the vehicle's 336-volt lithium-ion battery pack.  With the hydrogen-powered fuel cell, the range increases another 280 miles for a total of 305 miles. \b \b    Safe Journeys \b \u001d  Safety belts remain the most important safety technology in vehicles. Ford is researching several new safety belt designs, including four-point safety belts found in the front seats of the Ford Airstream Concept. \b \u001d  \"Inside, outside and under the hood, the Ford Airstream Concept speaks to the future,\" Mays said.  \"Ford is looking out onto the horizon and imbuing crossovers with emotion, made even more powerful by our association with Airstream.\" \b \b \b    Ford Airstream Concept Specifications \b    Powertrain \b    Ford's HySeries Drive plug-in hydrogen hybrid fuel cell \b    Chassis lengths \b    Overall length ...................185.0 in. \b    Wheelbase ........................125.9 in. \b    Overall width .....................78.9 in. \b    Overall height at curb ............70.6 in. \b    Track width \b    Front .............................67.6 in. \b    Rear ..............................69.2 in. \b    Suspension \b    Front ................

\u001d  By John D. Stoll \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--Ford Motor Co. (F) Chairman Bill Ford Jr. on Sunday said 2007 is a \"pivotal year\" for the auto maker after a \"difficult\" 2006. \u001d  Ford, speaking during a press conference at the North American International Auto Show, said that his optimism for the company is unwavering and that his sole goal is to build a company that grows and prospers. \u001d  Ford lost about $7 billion in the first three quarters of 2006 as it continued to lose market share in the U.S. to more-nimble foreign competitors such as Toyota Motor Corp. (TM). Ford is in the midst of restructuring its North American operations and aims to restore profitability in the region by 2009. \u001d  Bill Ford, who stepped down as chief executive officer last September, said he's never enjoyed working with anyone as much as he has enjoyed working with new CEO Alan Mulally. \u001d  \"We've laid the foundation for a stronger Ford,\" the company's chairman said. \u001d  Speaking at the same event, Mulally, a former Boeing Co. (BA) executive who is attending the Detroit auto show for the first time, said the auto maker is accelerating its product push in all the markets it competes in. He said Ford's domestic porfolio will include more crossover vehicles and small cars, and said the company will continue investing in its European luxury brands. \u001d  The executives were speaking at an event to introduce redesigned models and concept cars. At one point, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chairman Bill Gates joined Mulally via videoconference. Microsoft and Ford said earlier Sunday they are teaming up on in-vehicle technology that will be available on Ford products later this year. Gates did not give details of the partnership, but said he looks forward to cultivating the partnership with Ford \b \u001d  -By John D.

\b   By Victoria Howley \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The pensions agreement between British Airways PLC (BAB) and its four main trade unions helps clear the way for the renewal of the carrier's long-haul fleet and makes the company more attractive as a takeover target, an analyst said Sunday. \u001d  British Airways said late Friday that it had reached consensus with the unions on a package of reforms to tackle a GBP2.1 billion deficit in its main pension scheme, New Airways Pension Scheme. \u001d  The carrier will make a one-off contribution of GBP800 million into the fund, and the annual contributions will be around GBP280 million for the next 10 years. A British Airways spokeswoman said that further details on the scheme would be released Monday. \u001d  The British Airways Forum, which represents the airline's four unions, is recommending the acceptance of the proposal and will now consult its members formally for approval of the scheme. Support from the unions is a major step forward for the carrier, which has been hit by industrial action in recent years. \u001d  \"Resolution of the pensions issue would be a key milestone for British Airways,\" said John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting, which specializes in matters relating to the aviation industry. \"The company would be able to get acceptable financial terms when ordering new aircraft.\" \u001d  British Airways is considering buying aircraft from Boeing (BA) and Airbus to upgrade its aging long-haul fleet. But the airline has said it won't order new long-haul airplanes until the pension deal is finalized, and its shares have been held back on the possibility of strike action over the pension issue. \u001d  Strickland said that agreement on pensions may also make British Airways more attractive to potential suitors. \"BA is one of the best performers in the world among the legacy carriers,\" he said. \u001d  The U.K. carrier has been linked by analysts to Emirates Airline, as well as to private equity firms that might bid for BA in association with an airline company. Emirates has said it isn't currently pursuing acquisitions, however. \u001d  British Airways faces the prospect of disruption this year after the Transport & General Workers' Union said Dec. 15 that it would ballot some 11,000 cabin crew at the airline over possible strike action related to working conditions. That ballot is scheduled for Friday. \u001d  The union said the key issues in the dispute relate to the imposition of \"practices without negotiation.\" Members have been angered by the management of sickness absence as well as the imposed abolition of some higher grades and lower rates for new starters, the union said. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.ba.com \u001d  -By Victoria Howley, Dow

(Nikkei)--Pioneer Corp. (6773.TO) will introduce a large-screen plasma television in the U.S. this summer, touting superior picture quality and high-definition compatibility, The Nikkei reported in its Monday edition. \u001d  The new plasma panel boasts a contrast ratio of better than 20,000-to-1, more than a six-fold improvement compared with existing plasma models and more than 15 times that of LCD panels. The screen is expected to measure 50-60 inches. \u001d  Pioneer initially planned to launch the TV leading up to the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, but it decided to move up the date in light of faster-than-expected development. The product will be marketed in Japan and Europe within the year. The price and other details have yet to be determined. \u001d  Given that the panel can be made on existing production lines, the firm expects a smooth transition in shifting to the new model. \u001d  Pioneer only has a roughly 10% share of the global plasma TV market, despite a good reputation in the sector. By positioning the new plasma set as a core product and stressing its advanced functions, the company aims to both expand sales and stem price erosion. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d

(GM) swept the car and truck of the year awards at the North American International Auto Show, beating out Japanese auto makers and rival Ford Motor Co. (F). \u001d  The awards, given Sunday, come just days after GM reported an unexpected slide in U.S. sales for December, fueled in part by lower sales of light trucks. \u001d  The awards, voted on by journalists, also represented a turnaround from last year, when Honda Motor Co. (HMC) swept the categories. \u001d  The Chevrolet Silverado was named 2007 truck of the year, while the Saturn Aura was named the year's top car. The Silverado topped the Ford Edge and the Mazda CX7, while the Aura topped the Honda Fit and Toyota Motor Corp.'s (TM) Camry. \u001d  Ed Peper, Chevrolet's general manager, called the award a \"very encouraging\" validation for the GM brand. \u001d  GM, the largest auto maker in the U.S., is restructuring its operations after posting big financial losses in recent years as it struggled to sustain market share in the U.S. and to rein in costs. \u001d  GM, like its main domestic competitors, has struggled in part because of declining sales of highly profitable trucks and SUVs amid high gasoline prices and shifting demographics. \u001d  Sales of the Silverado, for instance, were down 10% in 2006 from the previous year at about 636,000 vehicles. In December alone, Silverado sales were off 20%. \b \u001d  -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 10:33 ET (15:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d28af7aff96b9773e256c447ea9e1b10","symR":["JMAT.LN","JMPLY","GB0004764071"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Johnson Matthey PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T09:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JMAT.LN","JMPLY","GB0004764071"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  Johnson Matthey PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0004764071 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 04:27 ET (09:27 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d2c7ab63b527e2abbaf74ac92c288e37","symR":["NVJ"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen OH Div Adv 3 (NVJ)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T10:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NVJ"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen OH Div Adv 3 (NVJ): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NVJ or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 05:06 ET (10:06 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d2f18848507f313cd6e8dc0794bdcb70","symR":["SBBX"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Sussex Bancorp","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T10:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SBBX"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK"],"Story":"\u001d  Sussex Bancorp: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=SBBX or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 05:38 ET (10:38 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d2fe5b1bfcfb6ea935265d81da45e9cf","symR":["CUO"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Continental Materials","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T08:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CUO"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD"],"Story":"\u001d  Continental Materials: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=CUO or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 03:47 ET (08:47 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d3304ec032b47e5cf0c535480ae1d0cb","symR":["SLET.LN","GB0006039597"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Standard Life Equity Inc trust","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T10:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLET.LN","GB0006039597"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Standard Life Equity Inc trust: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0006039597 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 05:22 ET (10:22 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d341977d75f0de7873f00efd01824393","symR":["DSU"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Merrill Lynch Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.

But it has faced stiff competition from Honda Motor Co.'s (HMC) Odyssey and Toyota Motor Corp.'s (TM) Sienna in recent years. All have spent time and money one-upping each other with new innovations, such as fold-flat third row seats, a split third row that folds flat and fold-flat second-row seats. \u001d  The 2008 Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan will be revealed at the North American International Auto show and go on sale in the fall. They have the requisite \"gee-whiz\" interior innovation - second-row seats that turn 180 degrees to face the third row, with a removable table in between. That's known as \"Swivel 'n Go,\" which builds on Chrysler's \"Stow 'n Go.\" \u001d  Chrysler Group Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said Sunday after the minivan introduction that he expects \"at least\" 25% to 40% of buyers to take the Swivel 'n Go option. \u001d  Chrysler also makes an exterior statement with the 2008 model, scrapping the egg shape for a more linear, \"athletic\" appearance, said Chrysler design chief Trevor Creed. \u001d  With Ford Motor Co. (F) and General Motors Corp. (GM) essentially pulling out of the traditional minivan segment, Chrysler has a golden opportunity with its new model, said Erich Merkle, director of forecasting at IRN Inc. in Grand Rapids, Mich. \u001d  \"This is huge for Chrysler,\" he said. \"They've always been kind of the front-runner in the minivan segment. That fact that GM and Ford are exiting and they have a new product, that leaves all the more for Chrysler.\" \u001d  Merkle said it will be difficult for Honda and Toyota to fill the gap left by Ford and GM as quickly because of their capacity constraints. \u001d  He called Chrysler's minivans one of the most important vehicles of the show. \u001d  LaSorda said Sunday on the sidelines of the auto show that he's \"kind of happy\" that GM and Ford have pulled out of the segment. He said the minivan continues to be a \"bread and butter\" product for Chrysler and sees the overall minivan market at 1.1 million a year. \u001d  Chrysler minivan sales slumped in 2006, with the Town & Country off 12% and the Caravan off 7%. Toyota Sienna sales were up 1.5% and Honda Odyssey sales were up 2.4%. \u001d  LaSorda said he expects the new minivans to bring Chrysler's minivan sales back up above 400,000. Chrysler sold 370,245 minivans last year. He also said Chrysler wouldn't sell as many minivans to fleet customers, such as car rental companies, since they will be fresh products. \u001d  The minivan sales decline was indicative of a general weakening in Chrysler's performance last year. The company's inventory bulged and it had to cut production and offer big incentives on its pickup trucks and SUVs. \u001d  Chrysler, which lost market share despite launching 10 new products, reported a $1.5 billion third-quarter loss. A turnaround plan is expected to be revealed next month. \u001d  Merkle said the second half of this year \"should look a lot better\" for Chrysler in part because of the minivans, which carry good profit margins. \u001d  He said Chrysler made the right move changing the exterior, which can carry risks. \u001d  \"That's one of the things I've been looking for,\" Merkle said. \"It speaks volumes about Chrysler's willingness to take risks. They're taking their No. 1 vehicle, their top selling vehicle, and saying they're going to shake it up. When you get your top vehicle, people tend to get very cautious. That doesn't seem to be the route Chrysler is going to be taking.\" \u001d  The minivans also offer other interior goodies, such as pinpoint LED lighting, retractable sun shades, one-touch power third-row folding seats and ambient halo lighting. \u001d  The Chrysler Town & Country will come in three trim levels, LX, Touring and Country Limited while the Dodge Grand Caravan will come in the SE and SXT levels. \u001d  The vans come with three powertrain options. A 3.3-liter, flex-fuel V-6 engine with a four-speed transmission or a 3.8-liter or 4.0-liter V-6 engine with a six-speed transmission. \u001d  Side-curtain airbags covering all rows are standard, as is an electronic stability program. \u001d  Creed said Chrysler \"took every feature on every minivan today that we don't have that they do, and added some of our own features.\" \u001d  -By Terry Kosdrosky, Dow Jones Newswires; (313) 226-1251; terry.kosdrosky@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 12:37 ET (17:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d46f7339e53d89a756204f2c4e2f1212","symR":["MK9.DB","IE0005527274"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for McInerney Holdings plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T09:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MK9.DB","IE0005527274"],"IndustryCodes":["HOM","HPR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  McInerney Holdings plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=IE0005527274 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 04:41 ET (09:41 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d48839ace3d205f557fd40cf37a7d391","symR":["CTAC"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for 1-800-Contacts, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T08:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CTAC"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  1-800-Contacts, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=CTAC or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 03:00 ET (08:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d4a7fde9b0cbda62043735c78aa838f9","symR":["RSW.LN","GB0007323586"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Renishaw plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T10:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RSW.LN","GB0007323586"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Renishaw plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0007323586 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 05:07 ET (10:07 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d4f549662e98460fc444270191484e0b","symR":["JLT.LN","GB0005203376"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T09:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JLT.LN","GB0005203376"],"IndustryCodes":["INB","INS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0005203376 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 04:27 ET (09:27 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d502a25ff7ae6ba6c77367c0c232e7c1","symR":["MYI"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Blackrock MuniYield Insured Fund, Inc.

/PRNewswire/ -- The Chevrolet Volt concept sedan, powered by the E-flex System - GM's next-generation electric propulsion system - could nearly eliminate trips to the gas station. \b \u001d  The Chevrolet Volt is a battery-powered, four-passenger electric vehicle that uses a gas engine to create additional electricity to extend its range. The Volt draws from GM's previous experience in starting the modern electric vehicle market when it launched the EV1 in 1996, according to GM Vice Chairman Robert A. Lutz. \b \u001d  \"The EV1 was the benchmark in battery technology and was a tremendous achievement,\" Lutz said. \"Even so, electric vehicles, in general, had limitations. They had limited range, limited room for passengers or luggage, couldn't climb a hill or run the air conditioning without depleting the battery, and had no device to get you home when the battery's charge ran low. \b \u001d  \"The Chevrolet Volt is a new type of electric vehicle. It addresses the range problem and has room for passengers and their stuff. You can climb a hill or turn on the air conditioning and not worry about it.\" \b \u001d  The Volt can be fully charged by plugging it into a 110-volt outlet for approximately six hours a day. When the lithium-ion battery is fully charged, the Volt can deliver 40 city miles of pure electric vehicle range. When the battery is depleted, a 1L, three-cylinder turbocharged engine spins at a constant speed, or revolutions per minute (rpm), to create electricity and replenish the battery. According to Lutz, this increases the fuel economy and range. \b \u001d  \"If you lived within 30 miles from work (60 miles round trip) and charged your vehicle every night when you came home or during the day at work, you would get 150 miles per gallon,\" Lutz said. \"More than half of all Americans live within 20 miles of where they work (40 miles round trip). In that case, you might never burn a drop of gas during the life of the car.\" \b \u001d  In addition, the Chevrolet Volt is designed to run on E85, a fuel blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. Using E85, fuel economy of 150 mpg would translate into more than 525 miles per petroleum gallon. \b \u001d  In the event a driver forgets to charge the vehicle or goes on a vacation far away, the Volt would still get 50 mpg by using the engine to convert gasoline into electricity and extending its range up to 640 miles, more than double that of today's conventional vehicles. \b \u001d  A technological breakthrough required to make this concept a reality is a large lithium-ion battery. This type of electric car, which the technical community calls an \"EV range-extender,\" would require a battery pack that weighs nearly 400 pounds (181 kg). Some experts predict that such a battery - or a similar battery - could be production-ready by 2010 to 2012. \b \u001d  Jon Lauckner, GM vice president of Global Program Management, said the Volt is uniquely built to accommodate a number of advanced technology propulsion solutions that can give GM a competitive advantage. \b \u001d  \"Today's vehicles were designed around mechanical propulsion systems that use petroleum as their primary source of fuel.\" Lauckner said. Tomorrow's vehicles need to be developed around a new propulsion architecture with electricity in mind. The Volt is the first vehicle designed around GM's E-flex System. \b \u001d  \"That's why we are also showing a variant of the Chevrolet Volt with a hydrogen-powered fuel cell, instead of a gasoline engine EV range-extender,\" said Lauckner. \"Or, you might have a diesel engine driving the generator to create electricity, using bio-diesel. Finally, an engine using 100-percent ethanol might be factored into the mix. The point is, all of these alternatives are possible with the E-Flex System.\" \b \u001d  The Volt concept car is built on a modified future architecture, Lauckner said, similar to the one GM uses for current small cars, such as the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR. \b \u001d  According to Larry Burns, GM vice president for research and development and strategic planning, the world's growing demand for energy and its dependence on oil for transportation is the common theme behind today's headlines. \b \u001d  \"Whether your concern is energy security, global climate change, natural disasters, the high price of gas, the volatile pricing of a barrel of oil and the effect that unpredictability has on Wall Street - all of these issues point to a need for energy diversity,\" said Burns. \"Today, there are more than 800 million cars and trucks in the world. In 15 years, that will grow to 1.1 billion vehicles. We can't continue to be 98-percent dependent on oil to meet our transportation needs. Something has to give. We think the Chevrolet Volt helps bring about the diversity that is needed. If electricity met only 10 percent of the world's transportation needs, the impact would be huge.\" \b \b    GM's E-flex System moves automobile toward new electric age \b \u001d  GM's E-flex System enables multiple propulsion systems to fit into a common chassis, using electric drive to help the world diversify energy sources and establish electricity from the grid as one of those sources. \b \u001d  \"The DNA of the automobile has not changed in more than 100 years,\" said Burns. \"Vehicles still operate in pretty much the same fashion as when Karl Benz introduced the 'horseless carriage' in 1886. \b \u001d  \"While mechanical propulsion will be with us for many decades to come, GM sees a market for various forms of electric vehicles, including fuel cells and electric vehicles using gas and diesel engines to extend the range. With our new E-flex concept, we can produce electricity from gasoline, ethanol, bio- diesel or hydrogen. \b \u001d  \"We can tailor the propulsion to meet the specific needs and infrastructure of a given market. For example, somebody in Brazil might use 100-percent ethanol (E100) to power an engine generator and battery. A customer in Shanghai might get hydrogen from the sun and create electricity in a fuel cell. Meanwhile, a customer in Sweden might use wood to create bio- diesel.\" \b \u001d  The Chevrolet Volt is just the first variant of the E-flex System. The Volt uses a large battery and a small, 1L turbocharged gasoline engine to produce enough electricity to go up to 640 miles and provide triple-digit fuel economy. GM will show other variations of the propulsion systems at future auto shows. \b \u001d  \"GM is building a fuel cell variant that mirrors the propulsion system in the Chevrolet Sequel (fuel cell concept),\" Burns said. \"Instead of a big battery and a small engine generator used in the Volt, we would use a fuel cell propulsion system with a small battery to capture energy when the vehicle brakes. Because the Volt is so small and lightweight, we would need only about half of the hydrogen storage as the Sequel to get 300 miles of range.\" \b \b    Future concepts might incorporate diesel generators, bio-diesel and E-100. \b \b    Environmentally conscious vehicles can be aesthetically appealing \b \b \u001d  With exterior proportions associated more with classic sports cars, the Chevrolet Volt conveys an immediate message of agility and sophistication. Twenty-one-inch wheels and sheer, taut surface relationships reiterate the statement. The Volt's athletic design challenges the notion that an environmentally conscious vehicle can't be beautiful and possess an aesthetic spirit that matches its driving characteristics. \b \u001d  \"We leveraged our resources around the globe to develop the design aesthetic for the Volt,\" said Ed Welburn, vice president, GM Global Design. \"It was important that the design capture the face of the Chevrolet as it's recognized around the world.\" \b \u001d  True to the heritage of its Chevrolet bowtie, the Volt's exterior design suggests spirited performance and is wrapped in a stylish package, with classic Chevrolet performance cues that hint at both Camaro and Corvette. On the inside, near-term technologies and innovative materials combine with ingenious use of ambient light for an interior environment that's light, airy and thoughtful. \b \u001d  \"First and foremost, this is an advanced technology vehicle that uses little to no fuel at all. But we didn't see any reason why that should compromise its design,\" said Anne Asensio, executive director, GM Design. Asensio led the design team that created the Volt concept, with designs solicited from GM's studios around the world. \b \u001d  \"We wanted a size that connected with everyone, so we designed a small car,\" said Asensio. \"In the end, the interior design team from England inspired the final interior execution, and the exterior is the work of the Michigan advanced design team. \b \u001d  \"Our job was to design a vehicle people could easily imagine,\" said Asensio. \"It couldn't be a 'science project,' because that's not what this car is all about. It had to be realistic, executable and carry the essence of the Chevrolet brand.\" \b \bSOURCE  General Motors Corporation \b \u001d    /CONTACT: Scott Fosgard, of GM Communications, +1-248-857-0239,

GM is building the early buzz, with its glitzy runway show last night and its fairly surprising sweep of the North American car and truck awards this morning. The company also has a noon press conference where it will unveil its latest concept car, the Chevy Volt, and talk about getting back into the electric car market - just as soon as it develops a new type of battery.

Stoll \b    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--Ford Motor Co. (F) Chairman Bill Ford Jr. on Sunday said 2007 is a \"pivotal year\" for the auto maker after a \"difficult\" 2006. \u001d  Ford, speaking during a press conference at the North American International Auto Show, said that his optimism for the company is unwavering and that his sole goal is to build a company that grows and prospers. \u001d  Ford lost about $7 billion in the first three quarters of 2006 as it continued to lose market share in the U.S. to more-nimble foreign competitors such as Toyota Motor Corp. (TM). Ford is in the midst of restructuring its North American operations and aims to restore profitability in the region by 2009. \u001d  Bill Ford, who stepped down as chief executive officer last September, said he's never enjoyed working with anyone as much as he has enjoyed working with new CEO Alan Mulally. \u001d  \"We've laid the foundation for a stronger Ford,\" the company's chairman said. \u001d  Speaking at the same event, Mulally, a former Boeing Co. (BA) executive who is attending the Detroit auto show for the first time, said the auto maker is accelerating its product push in all the markets it competes in. He said Ford's domestic portfolio will include more crossover vehicles and small cars, and said the company will continue investing in its European luxury brands. \u001d  Mulally, speaking with reporters after the press conference, said that he expects more collaborative alliances to spring up in the global auto industry and said the auto maker will continue collaborating with Toyota. \u001d  He downplayed, however, a recent meeting he had with the chairman of Toyota. Mulally said Ford has a variety of collaborations, but he ruled out a broad alliance with the Japanese company. \u001d  Mulally noted that partnerships have worked in the airline industry and that he expects \"more alliances working around the world\" in the auto business. \"It benefits everybody,\" he said. \u001d  At one point during Sunday's Ford event to introduce redesigned models and concept cars, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chairman Bill Gates joined Mulally via videoconference. Microsoft and Ford said earlier Sunday they are teaming up on in-vehicle technology that will be available on Ford products later this year. Gates did not give details of the partnership, but said he looks forward to cultivating the relationship with Ford. \u001d  Ford in recent months has accelerated its North American turnaround plan, which was first unveiled last January. \u001d  Mark Fields, Ford's Americas chief and the architect of the restructuring strategy, told reporters on Sunday that he expects U.S. light-vehicle sales to be down slightly in 2007. He also noted that job growth is expected to moderate and the housing market is expected to remain weak, which could affect light truck sales. \u001d  Fields said he expects sales of F-Series pickup trucks - Ford's top-selling vehicle - to continue their current trend through the first half of the year. F-Series sales fell 12% to just under 800,000 vehicles in 2006, well short of the company's target of 900,000. \u001d  Fields added that Ford will do enough on incentives to keep their dealers \"competitive,\" but that the incentives won't be excessive. \b \u001d  -By John D.

It also provides the company's growing base of FiOS TV customers with a powerful new navigational tool and delivers a superior entertainment experience not available to users of competitors' broadband or cable services. \b \u001d  Ingalls noted that customers today demand and deserve infinite choice, absolute control and precise personalization.  The FiOS digital media experience delivers to consumers all three. \b \b        New Interactive Media Guide Enhances Entertainment Experience \b \u001d  At the heart of the system is a new interactive media guide that makes watching FiOS TV easier and better than ever.  With the new guide, customers can find, control and manage a vast array of digital content including television programming, movies, Internet video, games, music and photos.  This lets a customer, for example, watch a movie about an action hero, play a video game about the same character and buy retail items associated with the character, all on the same home system. \b \u001d  FiOS TV customers in New Jersey will be the first to receive the new FiOS TV applications.  By mid-year, all FiOS TV customers in the 10 states where the service is offered today will enjoy many of the new applications and services enabled by the new FiOS. \b \u001d  \"FiOS TV already is intuitive and easy to use,\" said Ingalls. \"In 2007, we'll further transform home entertainment by making it easier and more enjoyable for consumers to access rich Internet content and other digital media through the TV.\" \b \b                   Simplifying the Entertainment Experience \b \u001d  The FiOS digital media platform provides FiOS TV customers with two key enhancements -- a simplified entertainment experience and greater convergence of devices. \b \u001d  \"As we designed the new FiOS, a key principle was to help customers reach all content with just two clicks of their remote control,\" said Ingalls. \b \u001d  The FiOS media guide helps customers easily navigate, personalize and enjoy all their digital media.  The new interactive guide features a network search function that brings multimedia into the television-viewing experience. \b \u001d  During a demonstration of the new FiOS TV features, Ingalls explained that most search functions on TV today are limited to looking for broadcast listings.  With the new FiOS TV, however, customers will be able to scan through broadcast, on-demand and recorded content with a single search. \b \u001d  In addition to getting Internet content to the television, the new FiOS gives customers the power to remotely manage parental controls and program their digital video recorder from any Web-enabled PC.  Later in the year, the company will extend that capability to a customer's Verizon Wireless cell phone. \b \u001d  \"We've designed this experience with minute attention to detail and have borrowed from advances in our other businesses, including the use of predictive text and \"triple-tap\" input when using the remote control that you typically find on a cell phone,\" Ingalls said. \b \u001d  The new FiOS builds on Verizon's earlier launch of the Home Media DVR and adds games atop the PC-based digital photos and music that FiOS TV customers can access on their TVs today.  In addition, Verizon will deliver this year Internet radio and video content to the TV sets of FiOS TV customers, including user-generated content like that from Revver; expand its video gaming offer to embrace serious video gamers; and personalize customers' viewing experience with ratings and recommendations based on personal preferences. \b \b                      FiOS Delivers Greater Convergence \b \u001d  \"The combination of Verizon's unique 100-percent fiber network, which, extends all the way to customers' homes and our in-home FiOS network makes this all possible,\" said Ingalls. \"This powerful network combination means we can capitalize on the interactivity of broadband, the mobility of wireless and the entertainment experience of TV. \b \u001d  \"Only Verizon is positioned to enrich the entertainment experience across all three platforms - broadband, mobile and television,\" said Ingalls.  \"So don't think of us as a traditional telecommunications provider.  Think of us as a key to the growth of the entertainment industry.\" \b \u001d  Verizon began offering FiOS TV service in the fall of 2005, and the service is now offered in more than 200 cities in parts of 10 states: California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia, with more states being added this year. \b \u001d  FiOS TV provides a true choice for subscription television and on-demand programming via the company's all-digital, fiber-optic network, said Ingalls. The company, which plans to have customers in 3 million to 4 million homes by 2010, said FiOS TV offers a better-quality picture, more high-definition and on-demand programs, and more reliable service at competitive prices. \b \u001d  The company's fiber network also offers consumers and businesses high- speed FiOS Internet Service, which is currently available in more than 1,600 cities in 16 states.  Only Verizon's fiber to the premises (FTTP) network has earned the certification of the independent Fiber to the Home Council for providing fiber all the way to customers' homes and businesses. \b \u001d  More information about FiOS TV, fiber optics and other broadband services and applications on display during the International Consumer Electronics Show is available in Verizon's online News Center at www.verizon.com/news. \b \u001d  Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), a New York-based Dow 30 company, is a leader in delivering broadband and other wireline and wireless communication innovations to mass market, business, government and wholesale customers.  Verizon Wireless operates America's most reliable wireless network, serving nearly 57 million customers nationwide.

\b    By Terry Kosdrosky \b    OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--The head of Johnson Controls Inc.'s (JCI) automotive interiors business said Sunday that electronics is the division's main growth opportunity and acquisitions are an option to gain more exposure in the area. \u001d  Johnson Controls interiors president Beda Bolzenius also said that raw material costs, which have eaten into supplier margins, will be a challenge this year even if they stay at current levels, which he said are high. \u001d  But he reiterated the company's commitment to the interiors business, even as one major competitor, Lear Corp. (LEA), is putting its interior systems division into a joint venture with billionaire investor Wilbur Ross. \u001d  Speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show, Bolzenius said that Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls already is one of the most complete auto interior suppliers, but there's a lot of growth in interior electronics and \"we are still nowhere we want to be.\" \u001d  He said electronics that control interior comforts and and the interface between the driver and interior controls are growth opportunities. \u001d  Bolzenius said making an acquisition \"is always an option\" but it would be \"premature\" to discuss details. \u001d  Johnson Controls, which also has a building systems and battery business, produces automotive seats and a variety of automotive interior components. \u001d  High raw material prices, particularly for plastic resins, have hit automotive interior suppliers hard at a time when U.S. auto makers are cutting production. \u001d  Bolzenius said raw material prices \"will be a challenge\" even if prices don't increase but stay the same. He wouldn't give a specific forecast for raw materials but said prices are still high. \u001d  For the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Johnson Controls' automotive interior sales were down 3% to $18.3 billion and operating income was down 21% to $500 million. The company is relying more on its building systems and battery business to drive earnings and revenue growth. \u001d  Bolzenius said the company's Asian and European automotive businesses are faring better than in North America, where the challenges of production, health care costs and raw materials are more acute. \u001d  Still, he said there's opportunity for growth in North America as foreign-owned auto makers move more production here and import fewer vehicles. Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) is looking for locations for its eighth North American production plant. \u001d  Bolzenius said there could be 2 million more vehicles produced in North America in the next three to five years that will replace imports. \b \u001d  -By Terry Kosdrosky, Dow Jones Newswires; 313-226-1251; terry.kosdrosky@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 09:25 ET (14:25

\u001d  By TOM KRISHER \u001d  Of THE ASSOCIATED PRESS \b \u001d  DEARBORN, Michigan (AP)--CD players in automobiles could go the way of eight-track tapes with in-dash systems like one Ford Motor Co. (F) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are jointly producing to link cars with cell phones and personal music players. \u001d  The \"Sync\" system being unveiled Sunday at the North American International Auto Show connects popular iPods and all other digital music players - including Microsoft's nascent Zune - to in-dash software through a USB port. Drivers will be able to pick songs, artists or genres using voice activation or controls on the steering wheel. \u001d  The system also links Bluetooth-capable smart phones and personal digital assistants to the car's electronics, allowing the car system to pick up Internet broadcasts. An electronic voice even will read inbound text messages through the sound system, complete with a vocabulary of slang abbreviations such as \"LOL\" for \"laughing for loud.\" \u001d  Sync ratchets up the car electronics war as the struggling Ford tries to compete with General Motors Corp.'s (GM) OnStar system, DaimlerChrysler AG's (DCX) MyGIG in-dash hard drive storage system and similar devices offered by other manufacturers. \u001d  It gives Ford leadership, at least for now, in what is becoming an increasingly competitive race in cabin electronics, said Kevin Reale, an AMR Research Inc. automotive analyst who has been briefed by Microsoft on the Sync system. \u001d  \"It's going to give them some competitive differentiation in being able to provide capabilities of personal electronics in the vehicle,\" said Reale, who predicted that other manufacturers will catch up quickly with other electronics suppliers. \u001d  Just last week, Hughes Telematics and DaimlerChrysler teamed up to develop a new system. \u001d  The whole race places the venerable CD in danger of extinction. Sync can even take music off a small USB thumb drive, ending the need to fumble with and store multiple CDs. \u001d  In fact, Ford already is discussing whether it needs to offer CD players in future models, said Gary Jablonski, the company's manager of \"infotainment\" systems. \u001d  \"Certainly we know there are customers who have migrated their entire personal music collection to a digital realm, in which case, Sync and the USB connection will probably be the only thing in the vehicle that they use,\" Jablonski said. \"Is there a day when the CD player disappears from the vehicle? It seems likely.\" \u001d  Ford plans to put the system in 12 of its vehicles starting with 2008 models. Company officials say it is likely to be an option that costs less than $1,000. \u001d  The motor company said it has an exclusive contract with Microsoft for one year, after which the system can be sold to other automakers. \u001d  The system is designed so it is linked to all car electronics and promises to be flexible enough to handle devices yet to be invented. Sync someday could include laptop computer links, vehicle diagnostics and even voice reading of Web sites, Jablonski said. \u001d  \"Phones last with a customer about 18 months. Our cars last a lot longer than 18 months,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that the car stays relevant, compatible with what the customer is using.\" \u001d  The system grew out of discussions among Ford engineers who saw the company, like many manufacturers, caught off guard by the iPod phenomenon. Some of its current models don't even have a jack to plug such devices into the sound system. \u001d  But Ford vows not to be caught off guard again. \u001d  \"You'll see a significant shift in the kinds of technologies that Ford's offering and the speed at which they're coming to market,\" Jablonski said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 01:02 ET (06:02 GMT)\u001d

ASIA) \b   By Laura Santini \u001d  WHEN A PAIR of New York hedge funds tried to oust executives of a small Nasdaq-listed online-games company in South Korea late last year, the funds armed themselves with allegations of mismanagement and conflicts of interest and pressed for a shareholder vote. \u001d  They knew they couldn't possibly succeed. Gravity Co.'s chief executive, Il Young Ryu, owns a 52.4% stake through a holding company. \u001d  The funds -- Ramius Capital Group and Moon Capital Management, which together own about 18% of Gravity -- wanted to send a message of dissatisfaction with management, says Mark Mitchell, executive managing director of Ramius. They also wanted to pressure the company's independent directors to act on their own, Mr. Mitchell says. \u001d  What's striking about the December vote was that 87% of Gravity's minority investors threw their support behind the activist funds, voting to rid the company of its CEO and one board member. The response suggests that investors who agitate for change at companies in which they own stock may be gaining traction with rank-and-file shareholders in markets such as Korea. \u001d  Minority shareholders typically tend to vote with management, partly because satisfaction with how executives run a company often is what prompted them to invest in the first place. Two years ago, Dubai fund Sovereign Global Investment struggled, and ultimately failed, to garner enough support to remove the chairman of Korean oil refiner SK Corp., who had been convicted of accounting fraud. Even U.S. fund giant Capital Group sided with management. \u001d  Since then, Korea has become a battleground for activist investors in Asia. Hedge funds say they view Korean companies as good buys, with solid businesses and lower share prices relative to earnings than companies in other markets. \u001d  At the same time, the clubby manner in which some Korean companies are run often puts managers at odds with shareholders, especially those who aggressively seek to unlock value for themselves. Carl Icahn and New York hedge fund Steel Partners successfully pushed executives of Korean tobacco company KT&G Corp. last year to adopt measures aimed at increasing investor returns. \u001d  Gravity's chief financial officer, Tae Sung Hwang, says the company will support its managers and proceed with its own strategy to boost sales, seeking new markets as well as developing more games. \u001d  Gravity had issues before hedge funds Ramius and Moon became involved. In 2005, the founder was charged with embezzlement and settled with the company, turning over control to Mr. Ryu. \u001d  Ramius and Moon allege that conflicts of interest led new management to engage in \"improper\" transactions that squandered the company's assets. The company's American depositary receipts, which rose for several weeks after the funds began their campaign in late March, are off more than 40% from their 52-week high in April. \u001d  In a 19-page filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated Nov. 21, the funds pointed to what they considered dubious use of the corporate credit card to pay certain expenses, such as rent on the CEO's luxury apartment and evenings in so-called room salons, where many Korean businessmen talk shop as they drink and socialize with women. \u001d  Among transactions cited in the filing was the re-licensing in Japan of Gravity's most popular game, Ragnarok, a term in Norse myth referring to the final battle between good and evil. GungHo Online Entertainment was reissued an exclusive three-year license in August. \u001d  GungHo derives most of its revenue from Gravity's game. In 2005, affiliates of GungHo created a holding company that allowed Mr. Ryu to acquire the controlling 52.4% stake in Gravity. According to the holding company's regulatory filing with the SEC, the reason for setting up the shell company was \"to secure for the benefit of GungHo a continuing license for Ragnarok.\" The funds argue that this relationship between GungHo affiliates and Mr. Ryu kept Gravity from seeking bids from competing distributors. \u001d  \"One is hard-pressed to think [Gravity] went for maximum value here,\" says Tim Gordon, a partner at LeGrange Capital, a New York fund that holds Gravity shares and voted in favor of removing Mr. Ryu. \u001d  Gravity declined to disclose other terms of that agreement, including price. Yoon Joo Lee, a spokeswoman for Gravity, says the company weighed competing offers from 10 other distributors before deciding to renew GungHo's license, though she wouldn't name them. Sales of the game declined in the first half of last year, which Gravity attributes to heightened competition and a dearth of new distribution outlets. \u001d  Ms. Lee says that Mr. Ryu relocated from Japan, and it isn't unusual for a company to provide housing in that case. As for the room salons, she says distributors from around the world visit Gravity executives and it is \"common in Korea to entertain guests.\" \u001d  In another transaction, Gravity agreed to buy an online game, called Emile Chronicle Online, from GungHo for approximately $6 million without obtaining an independent valuation, according to the filing. The funds say the price was \"unwarranted and excessive,\" noting that Gravity's financial statement for the first half of 2006 makes no mention of the game's contribution to revenue. \u001d  In late 2005, Gravity spent about $7.4 million to buy Neo-Cyon Inc., a Korean provider of media content to mobile phones. In their filing, Ramius and Moon say that Neo-Cyon had an alliance with another company affiliated with GungHo and the deal was expensive given Neo-Cyon's revenue. Neo-Cyon's chief executive at the time, Seung Taik Baik, now sits on Gravity's board and was targeted for dismissal by Ramius and Moon in the recent vote. \u001d  Mr. Hwang, Gravity's chief financial officer, says Messrs. Ryu and Baik have done nothing wrong. A GungHo spokeswoman said GungHo's relationship with Gravity is strictly a licensing one and maintains that GungHo has nothing to do with Mr. Ryu's control over the company. \u001d  Meanwhile, Ramius and Moon say they are weighing their next move. In addition to pushing for measures that would improve corporate governance and boost Gravity's share price, the investors say they might welcome a buyout offer for all shares in the company, although no bids have materialized. \u001d  --- \u001d  Andrew Morse contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ef8b9c1207c3abf8845f9fe77873acc4","symR":["CBRY.LN","CSG","GB0006107006"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Cadbury Schweppes PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T08:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBRY.LN","CSG","GB0006107006"],"IndustryCodes":["BVG","FOD","OFP","SFT","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  Cadbury Schweppes PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0006107006 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 03:27 ET (08:27 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"efa222173d9d4bbe27a43732637c2f5f","symR":["28932.AE","NL0000289320"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Rodamco Europe NV","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T10:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["28932.AE","NL0000289320"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX"],"Story":"\u001d  Rodamco Europe NV: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=NL0000289320 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 05:09 ET (10:09 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"effba6b413cde3e8372d32128b40a601","symR":["ENO.LN","GB0000931526"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Enodis plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T08:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ENO.LN","GB0000931526"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  Enodis plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0000931526 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 03:52 ET (08:52 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f061b4b8ac1af0a386c980fae08d0135","symR":["2311.TW","ASX","CAY.XX","TW0002311008"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UK PRESS: Taiwan Signals Support For Carlyle's ASE Offer","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T11:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["2311.TW","ASX","CAY.XX","TW0002311008"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","SEM","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission signaled that it would not stand in the way of Carlyle Group's $6.4-billion bid for Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc.

 LOS ANGELES (AP)--Museum crowds are strong at movie theaters. \u001d  Ben Stiller's \"Night at the Museum\" took in $24 million to stay on top at the box office for a third straight weekend, fending off a soft crop of newcomers during the post-holiday lull. \u001d  \"Night at the Museum,\" from 20th Century Fox, raised its three-week domestic total to $164.1 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. Will Smith's \"The Pursuit of Happyness,\" from Sony, finished second again with $13 million to raise its total to $124.2 million. \u001d  Expanding from its Christmas debut in a handful of theaters, Universal's thriller \"Children of Men\" led the new wide releases, coming in at No. 3 with $10.3 million. The film stars Clive Owen and Julianne Moore in a tale of a near future in which humanity faces extinction because of infertility. \u001d  Debuting in fourth with $9.7 million was Paramount's drama \"Freedom Writers,\" starring Hilary Swank as an idealistic teacher who uses writing journals and exercises in tolerance to inspire her class of racially divided teens. \u001d  Lionsgate's animated comedy \"Happily N'Ever After,\" a fairy-tale farce featuring the voices of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sigourney Weaver, opened at No. 6 with $6.8 million. \u001d  New Line's \"Code Name: The Cleaner,\" a comedy with Cedric the Entertainer as a janitor who thinks he's a spy, premiered out of the top 10, coming in at No. 11 with $4.6 million. \u001d  Films competing for Academy Awards attention did well as they expanded to more theaters, including Fox Searchlight's \"Notes on a Scandal,\" which took in $1.1 million in just 93 theaters. The film stars Judi Dench as a teacher preying on a colleague (Cate Blanchett) having an affair with a student. \u001d  Hollywood started off 2007 well, with overall grosses for the first week of the year at $273 million, up 10% from the same period last year, according to box-office tracker Media By Numbers. \u001d  \"This is a reflection of the fact that 2006 ended rather strongly\" with \"Night at the Museum,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Media By Numbers. \"So it's not surprising that 2007 would start on a positive note.\" \u001d  With a family-friendly PG rating plus a lot of appeal for adults without children, \"Night at the Museum\" is pulling in audiences of all ages. \u001d  \"It plays from 8 to 80, and it plays from Maine to Maui,\" said Chris Aronson, senior vice president for distribution at 20th Century Fox. \"It's one of those across-the-board hits that pleases everybody who sees it.\" \u001d  Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Media By Numbers LLC. Final figures will be released Monday. \u001d  1. \"Night at the Museum,\" $24 million. \u001d  2. \"The Pursuit of Happyness,\" $13 million. \u001d  3. \"Children of Men,\" $10.3 million. \u001d  4. \"Freedom Writers,\" $9.7 million. \u001d  5. \"Dreamgirls,\" $8.8 million. \u001d  6. \"Happily N'Ever After,\" $6.8 million. \u001d  7. \"Charlotte's Web,\" $6.6 million. \u001d  8. \"The Good Shepherd,\" $6.5 million. \u001d  9. \"Rocky Balboa,\" $6.3 million. \u001d  10. \"We Are Marshall,\" $5.1 million. \u001d  --- \u001d  Universal Pictures and Focus Features are owned by NBC Universal, a joint venture of General Electric Co.

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \b   By Evan Ramstad in Seoul and Sarah McBride in Las Vegas \u001d  In becoming the first manufacturer to build a machine that can play both formats of high-definition digital videodiscs, South Korea's LG Electronics Co. is likely to encourage a slew of rivals to also start making dual-format players. That would free consumers from worrying about which format will eventually win out. But it doesn't mean the long-brewing format wars will end soon. \u001d  A way around the format fight, even one that falls short of giving one side or the other a clear victory, is likely to boost sales of next-generation DVDs, which are designed to take advantage of the better picture quality offered by high-definition TV sets. \u001d  But manufacturers and movie studios will still tout their favorite format, because reputations and royalty payments on the underlying technology are at stake. In fact, the compromise will likely cause the format war to drag on even longer behind the scenes, as the dual-format solutions will allow the weaker side to cling on for months or years longer than it otherwise could. That could continue to discourage consumers from embracing next-generation players, especially as dual-format discs and players are likely to cost more. It also means studios must decide whether to release titles on dual-format discs instead of, or in addition to, the two existing formats. \u001d  As the annual Consumer Electronics Show began in Las Vegas, LG yesterday took the wraps off the first machine to play discs in both Blu-ray and HD-DVD formats. The player is priced at $1,199, about twice the price of an HD-DVD player and slightly more than the average price of a Blu-ray player. \u001d  And in another attempt to skirt the format battle, Warner Brothers later this week is expected to announce a design for a disc that can store a movie or other content in the HD-DVD format on one side and the Blu-ray format on the other side. The movie studio is trying to persuade others to package their movies, TV shows and other high-definition video that way instead of coming out with two separate discs. The dual-format disc is likely to hit the market toward year end, according to people familiar with the situation. \u001d  Retailers said they expect the dual-format options to jump-start slow sales of high-definition players and discs. \"It will help reduce the confusion,\" said Randy Wick, senior vice president and general merchandising manager for consumer electronics at Circuit City Stores Inc. \u001d  \"It's about giving consumers the confidence to get in the game,\" said Mike Vitelli, Best Buy Co.'s senior vice president for consumer electronics. \"We can recommend to our customers, if you buy the LG machine, you're not going to be left out in the cold.\" Mr. Vitelli added that he planned to bring up LG's announcement with other DVD manufacturers he is meeting with during the electronics show, encouraging them to go the same route. \u001d  Although he didn't commit to supporting one of the new dual options, Universal Studios Home Entertainment President Craig Kornblau welcomed the developments. \"These are both interesting solutions, and it's really important that we work toward a solution as quickly as possible,\" Mr. Kornblau said. Universal is releasing movies in HD-DVD, but not in Blu-ray. \u001d  Consumer-electronics companies rolled out next-generation DVD players about seven months ago, starting in the U.S. But so far, sales have been slow. There were only 225 titles available for the new machines as of mid-December, compared with more than 18,000 titles for regular DVD players. And consumers are hesitant to spend money when they aren't sure which format will end up surviving. \u001d  LG will begin shipping its product to stores later this month. If consumers bite and more manufacturers jump in with similar products, competition and higher volumes are likely within a couple of years to bring prices down to a level that appeals to the mass market. \u001d  But persuading the bigger DVD-player manufacturers to follow suit, especially those already committed to one format or the other, may prove difficult. \"I don't see a dual-format player as solving anything,\" said Andy Parsons, director of advanced product development at Pioneer Corp., which is selling a $1,500 Blu-ray player. He recalls Pioneer's attempts to introduce an audio player a few years ago that worked with two types of incompatible high-fidelity audio discs, Super Audio CD and DVD Audio. The invention did nothing to alleviate that format war, he says. \u001d  Many studio executives also panned the idea of a dual-format disc, saying the discs are likely to prove expensive and they were unsure how it would work. At Walt Disney Co., which is committed to the Blu-ray technology rather than HD-DVD, a spokesman said the studio wouldn't use the dual-format disc. \u001d  LG's decision to produce the dual-format player is a rebuke to its Blu-ray partners. Still, the Blu-ray Disc Association, which promotes the format, cast LG's announcement in a positive light. \"If you look at the significant content advantage Blu-ray has, with seven of the eight major studios publishing on Blu-ray, we don't believe a dual-format player is a necessary step,\" the group said. \"That said, every dual-format player is a Blu-ray player, and given the imbalance in content, we think it's likely that you'll see Blu-ray libraries growing even more quickly if dual-format players reach the market.\" \u001d  LG decided to break ranks with its partners and also support HD-DVD after executives visited the industry trade show in Las Vegas last year and saw just how entrenched support for the rival format was. \"We recognized and just could not deny that HD-DVD is here to stay,\" said Lee Hee Gook, president and chief technology officer for LG. \"Our conclusion was this format-division issue will continue on for many years and this is bad for everybody.\" \u001d  Executives initially worried, however, that the technical challenges and costs would be too high. \u001d  In August, the engineers brought a prototype of the dual-format machine to LG's top managers. \"We were encouraged and thought 'Gee, maybe this can be a product, not just a prototype,'\" Mr. Lee said. \"We reassessed the content situation and decided the competing formats were still a problem. So we went forward. \u001d  \"We realized Blu-ray alone is not good enough,\" Mr. Lee said. \"We want to be ahead of the game.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 16:30 ET

Since then, the Chrysler Group has sold more than 11 million minivans and invented more than 60 minivan firsts that not only have revolutionized the minivan segment, but made their way into other vehicle segments as well. \b \u001d  \"Chrysler Group is the leader in bringing innovations to the minivan segment, and those innovations seem to have an uncanny way of ending up in other products,\" said Lyons. \"Integrated child safety seats, dual-zone temperature controls, a power liftgate and DVD entertainment are just some of the features that started in a minivan, but are now available in other vehicle segments.\" \b \u001d  For 2008, the Chrysler Town & Country (sold as the Chrysler Grand Voyager in most markets outside North America) and Dodge Grand Caravan offer value, functionality, safety and a package of innovative features that no other manufacturer can match. With 35 new or improved features, the all-new 2008 Chrysler Town and Country and Dodge Grand Caravan offer consumers a home away from home. \b \u001d  \"The 2008 Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan offer the best amenities for today's busy families,\" said Murphy. \"With a dual DVD system that plays different media at the same time, pinpoint LED lighting to read by, a table to play games or finish homework, a voice-activated navigation system with real-time traffic, power sliding doors and liftgate and YES Essentials(R) cloth seats, every member of the family will enjoy their journey.\" \b \b    Unmatched Functionality and Entertainment \b \u001d  The 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country have spiced up the recipe for minivan success to include a place for everything. A premium, multi-function, front-row sliding console, dual glove boxes, second-row covered storage bins, third-row storage area and clever storage bins and pockets offer more places to store things than ever before. \b \u001d  Three distinct seating configurations are available for 2008 in North America. They include a second-row bench seat with second-row covered storage bins and third-row fold-in-the-floor seating, a Stow 'n Go(R) seating and storage system that offers the only second- and third-row fold-in-the-floor seats in the industry and the new Swivel 'n Go seating that allows the second row seats to swivel 180 degrees to face rearward. Swivel 'n Go also includes a removable table that fits between the second and third rows with a fold-in-the-floor third-row seat. A one-touch power-folding third-row seat also is available. \b \u001d  Available comfort and convenience features include a new, removable sliding front console that is large enough to store a purse; remote start; heated first- and second-row leather or cloth seats; rearview interior conversation mirror; YES Essentials stain-resistant, odor-resistant, anti-static cloth fabric; a removable flashlight in the rear quarter panel; first- and second-row power windows; second- and third-row retractable sun shades; power sliding doors; power liftgate with power button on the key fob and rear-pillar, ambient halo lighting; movable, pinpoint Light Emitting Diode (LED) reading lamps; map lights; and a dual- or tri-zone heating and cooling system. \b \u001d  \"To get the best recipe of comfort, security and flexibility that fits any lifestyle, we added comfort features like remote start, heated first- and second-row cloth or leather seats and ambient lighting, then mixed in standard safety features like all-row supplemental side-curtain air bags and ESP,\" said Ann Fandozzi, Director - Front-wheel-drive Product Marketing, Chrysler Group. \"Clever features found in the 2008 Chrysler Group minivans include a 'Swiss- army-knife-like' sliding front console and a removable flashlight in the rear quarter panel.\" \b \u001d  Entertainment features include a dual DVD, multimedia entertainment system that can play different media at the same time, MyGIG(TM) CD/DVD/HDD/MP3/satellite radio with voice-activated capability, touch screen and real-time traffic and navigation, UConnect hands-free communication system with Bluetooth(R) technology, mesh side pockets on the second-row seats that can hold iPods, hand-held gaming systems or beverages, 110V inverter, two second-row output/input jacks with a 12-volt power outlet and an overhead console with bins large enough to store headphones. \b \b    Model Lineup \b \u001d  Five models and three powertrains are available for the 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country. Dodge offers two models: the Dodge Grand Caravan SE and Dodge Grand Caravan SXT. Chrysler offers three models: the Chrysler Town & Country LX, the Chrysler Town & Country Touring and the Chrysler Town & Country Limited. \b \u001d  Powertrain choices for North America include a new 4.0-liter V-6 aluminum engine mated to a new six-speed transaxle that produces 240 hp (179 kW) and 253 lb.-ft. (343 N*m) of torque, a 3.8-liter V-6 aluminum engine mated to a new six-speed transaxle that produces 198 hp (148 kW) and 230 lb.-ft. (312 N*m) of torque or a 3.3-liter flex-fuel-capable (FFV) V-6 aluminum engine mated to a four-speed transaxle that produces 170 hp (127 kW) and 205 lb.-ft. (278 N*m) of torque. The varied powertrain options provide a pleasant driving experience in a variety of conditions. \b \u001d  \"Chrysler Group has been a leader in flex-fuel-capable vehicles,\" said Lyons. \"We sold our first minivan capable of running on E85 in 1998, and since then, Chrysler Group has sold more than 1,330,000 flex-fuel minivans.\" \b \u001d  Full model details and feature availability for markets outside the United States will be released ahead of the vehicles' launch in each respective market. \b \b    Manufacturing Information \b \u001d  The 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country minivans will be built at Windsor Assembly Plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada and St. Louis South Assembly Plant in Fenton, Missouri. \b \u001d  The 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country are expected to be in dealerships in the United States in the fall of 2007. \b \bSOURCE  Chrysler Group \b \u001d    /CONTACT: Kathy Graham, +1-248-512-2942, kad@dcx.com; or Beth Ann Bayus,

\b    By Christoph Rauwald \b    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--DaimlerChrysler AG's (DCX) Chief Executive and head of the Mercedes Car Group unit, Dieter Zetsche, said Sunday he expects his division this year to maintain the record sales level reached in 2006. \u001d  \"We intend to continue on this level,\" Zetsche told reporters at the North American International Auto Show. He declined to provide a specific sales target for the Mercedes-Benz brand. \u001d  Sales at Mercedes Car Group, which comprises the Mercedes-Benz, Smart and ultra-luxury Maybach brands, were up 3.2% on the year at 1.26 million passenger cars in 2006. \u001d  Zetsche confirmed Mercedes Car Group's target to reach 7% return on sales in 2007, adding that this \"shouldn't be the ceiling for a luxury automaker\". \u001d  Zetsche confirmed that the Chrysler Group division expects rising sales on the year in 2007. \u001d  Zetsche said he's confident that Chrysler's management team under CEO Tom LaSorda will turn the division around. \u001d  \"Tom has my support and the support of the board,\" he said. \"He and his team are doing a good job ... Tom is full of energy and optimism,\" he said. However, Zetsche noted that he \"doesn't exclude\" the possibility of adding more management capacity to the unit, if this would help the current turnaround efforts. He didn't elaborate further. \"The dealers are supporting Tom, and this is most important,\" Zetsche added. \u001d  The company's troubled Chrysler Group, which posted a painful operating loss of EUR1.2 billion in the third quarter, is considering cutting capacity and looking to reduce costs as part of a restructuring plan it expects to announce by the end of the first quarter. \u001d  Zetsche was Chrysler's CEO before taking over the helm at the parent company, leading the division through a wide-ranging restructuring earlier in the decade. \u001d  Zetsche said that the cooperation between the Mercedes and Chrysler divisions has to improve further. \"We have to find more areas of technical cooperation,\" he said. \"There is much more transfer of Know-how going on already, but we have to continue improving these things,\" Zetsche said. \u001d  Zetsche wants to increase the number of shared parts and components, but has no plans for a joint production platform for both brands. \u001d  Zetsche said unfavorable exchange rates will have \"no major impact\" on the German-U.S. auto maker's financial performance in 2007. \u001d  The Stuttgart-based company hedged around 70% of its expected exposure to currency effects this year, Zetsche said. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com \b \u001d  -By Christoph Rauwald, Dow Jones Newswires; +49 69 29 725 512; christoph.rauwald@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 17:18 ET (22:18 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fb0d8a4dc5d757379f9e35b8891b83a6","symR":["MJW.LN","GB00B021F836"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Majestic Wine plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T09:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MJW.LN","GB00B021F836"],"IndustryCodes":["FDR","RTS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Majestic Wine plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B021F836 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 04:38 ET (09:38 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"fb15694f3b4d7c2e0772231a46085aa9","symR":["FUTR.LN","GB0007239980"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Future plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T09:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FUTR.LN","GB0007239980"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB"],"Story":"\u001d  Future plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0007239980 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 04:02 ET (09:02 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"fb6f577e10b7b75fc1b4580257f07aea","symR":["JLA"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen Equity Premium Advantage Fund (JLA)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T09:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JLA"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen Equity Premium Advantage Fund (JLA): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=JLA or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 04:56 ET (09:56 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"fb7d27cfede59443e4af86d0957b36d3","symR":["600636.SH","8031.TO","DB","DBK.XE","MITSY","RWE.XE","RWEOY","CN0005813851","DE0005140008","DE0007037129","JP3893600001"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJA(1/8) How China Is Cashing In On Global-Warming Fight","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T21:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["600636.SH","8031.TO","DB","DBK.XE","MITSY","RWE.XE","RWEOY","CN0005813851","DE0005140008","DE0007037129","JP3893600001"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","CHM","CHS","DIB","MUT","SVC","X225","XATI","XDAX","XDJGI","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \b   By Jeffrey Ball in Dallas, John D. McKinnon in Washington, and Shai Oster in Beijing \u001d  China is turning its environmental problems into a shrewdly managed financial asset, capitalizing on corporate and governmental efforts to curb global warming. But how much China's actions will do for the atmosphere remains an open question. \u001d  Concerns about the world's rising temperature have prompted many industrialized countries to cap the amount of carbon dioxide and other global-warming gases companies can emit. One way companies can comply is by bankrolling emission-cutting projects in the developing world, where such projects often are cheaper than back home. In return, the Western companies receive \"carbon credits\" that essentially allow them to continue to emit greenhouse gases themselves. \u001d  The credits, which can be bought and sold, have led to a burgeoning global \"carbon market.\" The World Bank, a major player in the market, estimates the market was worth $21.5 billion in the first three quarters of 2006, about double its value in all of 2005. China, the world's No. 2 global-warming emitter behind the U.S., has become the biggest source of developing-world carbon credits bought by Western investors, benefiting both Chinese corporations and Chinese government tax receipts. \u001d  The market has led to projects like one announced last year involving two Chinese companies in Jiangsu province on China's east coast. The two will receive $1 billion, though 2012, from a private- and public-sector consortium that includes the World Bank, utilities such as Germany's RWE AG and Deutsche Bank AG, and Japanese trading firm Mitsui & Co. The project will, through 2012, destroy about 125 million so-called CO2-equivalent tons of HFC-23, a greenhouse gas that scientists say is thousands of times more potent than CO2 and that is a byproduct of the manufacture of a common refrigerant, HCFC-22. \u001d  The Western investors will pay the Chinese companies roughly 6 euros, or $8, per \"CO2-equivalent\" ton of emissions, the metric used in the carbon market, according to people with knowledge of the transactions. That is a bargain for the Western investors, who would have to pay far more to reduce emissions back home. But it also is a boon for the Chinese companies, for whom the actual cost of destroying the gas is less than $1 per CO2-equivalent ton of emissions. \u001d  The deal \"alleviates the carbon-emissions pressure, [and thus] does less harm to the atmosphere,\" said Zhang Jingyi, board secretary of one of the companies, a refrigerant-making unit of Shanghai 3F New Materials Co. \"Besides, we can receive revenue from it.\" He said the company hasn't yet decided how it will spend the carbon revenue, though it will consider investing in other projects or paying a dividend to shareholders. \u001d  The Chinese government, meanwhile, has rolled out new policies to boost the proceeds and maximize the energy security the country gets from the new stream of foreign investment. China has mandated that only companies with a majority Chinese ownership can own projects generating carbon credits. The country also is effectively imposing minimum prices for its carbon credits, market participants say. China also is taxing the profits from the sale of the credits -- tax revenue that goes into a fund targeted to promote cleaner forms of energy. \u001d  \"They're always thinking ahead all the time on this,\" said Neeraj Prasad, who coordinates the World Bank's carbon-market activities in East Asia and who worked with Chinese officials to set up the tax system. In setting up their carbon rules, he says, Chinese officials asked: \"How much can we tax it?\" \u001d  The emission-cutting projects the Chinese government says it most wants to encourage -- such as the installation of renewable-energy technology -- are taxed at 2%. The projects that Western investors most favor -- HFC-23-destruction projects like those in Jiangsu province -- are taxed at 65%. \u001d  Investors prefer the HFC-23-destruction deals because the gas's potency compared with CO2, and the relatively low cost of installing the machinery that destroys the HFC-23, means the projects spin off massive numbers of carbon credits at what amounts to rock-bottom prices. Indeed, selling the credits from HFC-23-destruction projects typically generates more profit than selling the actual refrigerant. \u001d  As a result, regulators worry that the carbon market is encouraging companies in the developing world to make more of the underlying refrigerant than they otherwise would -- so they can produce more of the global-warming gas, destroy it, and sell the credits. Such a \"perverse incentive,\" as the United Nations calls it, would be problematic because the refrigerant itself both threatens the ozone layer and contributes to global warming. \u001d  Whether the carbon market actually is prompting more production of HFC-23 than otherwise would have occurred is unclear. Demand for the refrigerant is rising along with incomes around the world, and production is expected to soar in the coming decades in China as well as in much of the developing world, where it remains unrestricted by ozone rules. Officials with a U.N.-affiliated panel that helps govern the carbon market are studying the issue and plan to discuss it in May. \u001d  More broadly, critics worry that the HFC-23-destruction projects are siphoning Western carbon-market investment away from the kind of emission-reduction projects the market was designed to encourage: those that generate energy more cleanly, such as natural-gas-fired power plants and wind turbines. \u001d  Even some market participants involved in the HFC-23 deals say China's unofficial imposition of a minimum carbon-credit price makes it tougher to finance clean-energy projects, because those projects require relatively greater upfront capital. A developing country like China is \"shooting [itself] in the foot\" by imposing a de facto credit-price floor, says Paul Bodnar, who helps assemble carbon projects in China for Climate Change Capital, a London-based company active in the market. \"Because you're discouraging precisely the kind of [clean-energy] investment that the [carbon market] was supposed to encourage.\" \u001d  Chinese government officials didn't respond to questions for this article. But they have pointed to their clean-energy fund as evidence of their effort to help the environment. The World Bank's Mr. Prasad says that fund is likely to reach about $1 billion over the next few years. \u001d  Publicly, China plays down HFC-23-destruction projects. \"We would prefer to have more energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that could help alleviate poverty in the countryside,\" Lu Xuedu, deputy director of China's Office of Global Environment Affairs in the Ministry of Science and Technology, said in a statement in October. \u001d  --- \u001d  Tang Hanting in Beijing contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fb9e470b570c4681b013ad538a642410","symR":["SRSL"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for SRS Labs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T10:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SRSL"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  SRS Labs: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=SRSL or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 05:29 ET (10:29 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"fbb0f8b86a2ac8ea2d3557f7d22f8b76","symR":["DCX","DCX.XE","F","GM","DE0007100000","US3704421052"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Chrysler CEO Confident Will Reach Pact With UAW","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T17:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DCX","DCX.XE","F","GM","DE0007100000","US3704421052"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Updates throughout with additional comments from LaSorda and background on Chrysler.) \b \b    By Terry Kosdrosky \b    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--Chrysler Group Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said Sunday there's \"no doubt\" in his mind that the auto maker can reach an agreement with the United Auto Workers union \"before the end of the term\" despite the tough issues facing both sides. \u001d  The master contract between the US automakers and the UAW expires later this year. Automakers have said they'd like a more competitive agreement and the union's president has indicated he'd like to hold on to benefits. \u001d  Despite expecting tough negotiations, LaSorda, speaking on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show, said he \"anticipates we'll be able to resolve things.\" \u001d  U.S. auto makers are expected to try to address rising health care costs and the controversial \"Jobs Bank\" program that pays workers nearly full pay and benefits while on layoff. \u001d  LaSorda also said a turnaround plan being prepared in the wake of Chrysler's $1.5 billion third-quarter loss will be \"widespread\" and address every area of the company. Chrysler is a unit of DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX). \u001d  LaSorda wouldnt discuss details of the turnaround strategy, saying those would come in February or early March. When asked if the plan would include plant closings, he said it hasn't been decided. \u001d  He did say that Chrysler expects to hear a decision from the DaimlerChrysler supervisory board and Chinese authorities within 30 to 60 days on its joint venture proposal with Chinese auto maker Chery Automobile Co. to build a subcompact car for North America and other markets. \u001d  Chrysler has said it wants to offer a subcompact car in North America as consumers shift away from larger vehicles, but also said it's difficult to build a cost-competitive model in North America. \u001d  LaSorda said he expects to make another trip to the White House this year and plans to meet the new Congressional leadership before the end of the second quarter. \"The earlier the better,\" he said. \u001d  LaSorda and his counterparts at General Motors Corp. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F) met with President George W. Bush late last year to discuss trade, energy and currency policies, among other issues impacting the automotive sector. The Big 3 executives have complained over the past year that certain policies give their foreign competitors an unfair advantage. \u001d  Chrysler hit a bump in the road last year when inventory levels spiked amid a downturn in sales of pickup trucks and SUVs. After gaining market share in 2005, Chrysler's U.S. sales were down 7% to 2.14 million vehicles in 2006. \u001d  LaSorda said Chrysler will focus on \"profitable growth\" in 2007 but didn't give any projections. He said a priority this year is to help out Chrysler's dealers, who also were stung by the inventory buildup. \u001d  \"We let them down here somewhat in 2006,\" LaSorda said. \"We're going to make sure that our focus is on profit from great products, keep the inventory levels balanced so they can make money again.\" \u001d  After launching 10 vehicles in 2006, most of them in the second half of the year, Chrysler plans to launch eight new vehicles in 2007. \b \u001d  -By Terry Kosdrosky, Dow Jones Newswires; (313) 226-1251; terry.kosdrosky@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones

\b    By Jon Kamp \b    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--Toyota Motor Corp. (GM) debuted the new \"CrewMax\" full-sized version of its Tundra pickup truck on Sunday, and said the Tundra will be a key sales driver for the auto maker in the U.S. this year. \u001d  The four-door CrewMax, headed to dealer lots in March, represents Toyota's latest effort to compete in a segment that's still dominated by General Motors Corp. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F). Toyota introduced the truck for the first time here at the North American International Auto Show, highlighted its American design and assembly roots and also showed off other versions of the 2007 Tundra. \u001d  \"Our annual sales goal is 200,000 vehicles, reflecting our confidence in the product,\" said Jim Lentz, executive vice president for Toyota Motor Sales, during a press conference. \u001d  The sales goal also reflects a \"striking change\" in who the trucks are designed for - \"true truckers\", Lentz said. \u001d  The Tundra sales goal would represent a significant jump for Toyota, as 124,500 Tundras were sold in the U.S. in 2006. Ford sold nearly 800,000 F-Series pickups last year, in contrast, and more than 900,000 in each of the two prior years. \u001d  Other Tundra versions include the Tundra Regular Cab and Tundra Double Cab, which arrive at dealerships in February. Lentz said the new Tundra is expected to be one of two key sales drivers, along with hybrids, for Toyota this year. \u001d  The new Tundra is larger in every dimension than the version it replaces, Toyota noted in a press release, and comes with an optional 381-horsepower, eight-cylinder engine. The optional tow package for the V8-equipped pickups give them up to 10,800 pounds of towing capacity, depending on the model and drivetrain. \u001d  Despite their prowess in growing U.S. passenger car sales, Japanese auto makers have found it difficult to penetrate the full-size pickup market. Earlier this decade, Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY) unveiled a completely new Titan pickup that has struggled to meet expectations. \b \u001d  -By Jon Kamp; Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 15:38 ET (20:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fdbfbe2d352a080acef2a311875c9757","symR":["DIV"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for J Hancock Patriot Select (DIV)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T09:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DIV"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  J Hancock Patriot Select (DIV): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=DIV or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 07, 2007 04:29 ET (09:29 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"fe1354a6790b72cc6ba542f903bcc36b","symR":["F","GM","US3704421052"],"date":"2007-01-07","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"JD Power Sees US Retail Auto Sales Rising In 2007","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-07T16:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["F","GM","US3704421052"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d   By John D. Stoll \u001d   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)-- A leading research firm expects retail vehicle sales in the U.S. will show a modest increase in 2007, while overall sales decline slightly as auto makers scale back their reliance on sales to fleet customers such as rental car agencies. \u001d  J.D. Power and Associates said Sunday in a press release that retail sales should rise to about 13.2 million vehicles this year, versus 13 million in 2006. Overall sales, however, are seen dropping by about 90,000 vehicles to 16.5 million. \u001d  \"We're seeing a gradually recovering retail market, one that's returning to pre-2005 levels,\" J.D. Power and Associates auto analyst Jeff Schuster said in the press release. \u001d  Retail numbers exclude sales to rental car agencies and other companies or government bodies that buy in bulk or for commercial purposes. Retail sales are generally seen as offering larger profit potential than sales to rental companies, but some fleet sales - such as those of commercial trucks - are hugely profitable. \u001d  General Motors Corp. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F) are decreasing fleet sales in order to focus more intently on the retail market. GM and Ford have typically sold at least 30% of cars to fleet customers. \u001d  \"The fleet market is going through a correction as automakers pull back on fleet sales, and that's causing a dip in the total market,\" Schuster said. \u001d  JD Powers predicts that new-vehicle retail sales will account for approximately 80% of the total light-vehicle market in 2007, up from 78.8% last year. Retail sales had comprised nearly 85% of total U.S. light vehicle sales between 2002 and 2004, but fell as low as 77.7% in 2005 as fleet sales increased. \b \u001d  -By John D.
