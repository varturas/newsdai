(532174.BY), India's largest private bank by assets, Saturday said it has priced its domestic follow-on public offer at INR940 per share and its American Depository Receipts issue at $49.25 per unit. \u001d  The combined public offer, through which the company is aiming to raise $4.29 billion, excluding the greenshoe options, is the largest ever fund raising exercise by an Indian company and has evoked strong interest from overseas and domestic investors. \u001d  The offer tops that by state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp. in 2004, which raised INR105.42 billion ($2.58 billion). \u001d  The INR87.50-billion domestic part of the offer is by itself India's second largest after ONGC. \u001d  \"This (issue) is a huge vote of confidence for ICICI Bank, India's economy and its growth story,\" Arjun Khullar, managing director at J.P. Morgan said. \u001d  Deven Choksey, managing director at Mumbai-based KR Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. Ltd., described the pricing as a \"fair one for investors.\" \u001d  ICICI Bank had set an indicative price band of INR885-INR950 for its follow-on public offer, subscriptions for which opened June 19 and closed Friday. \u001d  Its shares closed Friday 0.4% higher at INR953.75. \u001d  The overall issue was subscribed 11.5 times the offer of 98.87 million shares. \u001d  The qualified institutional buyers portion was subscribed 21.6 times, the non-institutional investors section was subscribed nearly 6.1 times, while the portion earmarked for retail investors was subscribed one time. \u001d  \"Foreign investors still see a lot of growth in Indian industrial credit and corporate growth,\" said Khullar. \u001d  He added about one-third of the subscriptions had come in from Asia - primarily Singapore and Hong Kong, about 15% from the Middle East, about 30% from Europe and about 20% from the U.S. \u001d  \"Foreign demand is less price sensitive than retail demand,\" said Khullar. \u001d  People close to the development had earlier said that principal bidders included Singapore's Temasek Holdings, Goldman Sachs (GS) and private equity firm Warburg Pincus. \u001d  Choksey expects the \"effects of stock dilution\" to limit ICICI Bank's gains to the INR975 levels for about six months, but expects its growth to push the price to about INR1,025 around a year from now. \u001d  The bank's local offer has a greenshoe option worth INR13.13 billion, while the $2.14-billion overseas offer has a greenshoe option worth $320 million. \u001d  The bank didn't specify whether the greenshoe options will be exercised. \u001d  A \"greenshoe\" is a clause in an underwriting agreement saying that, in the event of exceptional public demand, the issuer will authorize additional shares for distribution. \u001d  ICICI Bank's offer comes at a time when major Indian lenders are looking to raise funds. \u001d  State Bank of India (500112.BY), ICICI Bank's biggest competitor and the country's largest bank by assets, plans to raise INR140 billion-INR150 billion in the current financial year. \u001d  HDFC Bank Ltd. (500180.BY) is in the process of raising $1 billion via a preferential issue and a public offer in the domestic and international markets and Industrial Development Bank of India (500116.BY) is also planning to raise $1.5 billion via overseas debt. \u001d  ICICI bank is planning to use the funds from the sale to expand its consumer credit, corporate business and rural-agri business, Kalpana Morparia, ICICI Group's chief strategy and communication officer said earlier. \u001d  \"The growth in India's economy is being fueled by the financial liberalization program and that is creating new opportunities from domestic banks,\" said Patti McLaughlin, vice-chairman at investment banking, DSP Merrill Lynch. \b \u001d  -By Romit Guha, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-9900181471; romit.guha@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 12:46 ET (16:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0594a05fbc91b5e23f162397b5d93e9e","symR":["BX","FIG","VNO"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) Top Of The Market","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BX","FIG","VNO"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","FIS","REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Andrew Bary \u001d  Blackstone's initial public offering Thursday marked the most important debut for any company since Google went public in 2004. Just as Google changed the rules of the game in Internet search and dealt a sharp blow to newspapers and other traditional media, the Blackstone Group, the world's most prominent private-equity firm, is reshaping the corporate landscape and helping to fuel a global bull market in stocks through its appetite for leveraged buyouts. \u001d  Blackstone isn't another Google, however, and is unlikely to see its shares -- or, more precisely, its limited-partnership units -- quintuple in coming years, as Google (ticker: GOOG) famously did. To the contrary, Blackstone (BX) may well disappoint investors, notwithstanding its stellar performance Friday, and its IPO may signal the absolute top of the buyout boom. The stock opened at 37, above its offering price of 31, and finished the day at 35.06, endowing the New York-headquartered firm with a market value of $38 billion. Blackstone's high-profile CEO, Steve Schwarzman, now is worth over $9 billion, thanks to first-day gains in Blackstone shares. \u001d  By almost any financial yardstick, Blackstone looks richly valued relative to other asset managers, especially at a time when rising interest rates and burgeoning competition threaten to make the buyout business tougher. Indeed, the IPO could prove a high-water mark for the private-equity business. \u001d  A rising stock market has made compelling takeover targets scarcer for both private and corporate buyers, even as more rivals, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs, crowd the field and eye the same ripe targets. Higher rates and more conservative lending standards likewise threaten to make life more expensive for borrowers and deal-doers of all stripes. \u001d  As Wall Street veteran Seth Klarman of Baupost Group wrote in a letter to investors earlier this year about the surge in alternative assets, private-equity included: \"There are no magic investments that make money for you no matter what you pay for them. The more you pay, the less the return; the greater the competition, the less the inefficiency.\" \u001d  What's more, even when private-equity firms identify targets, gaining control is getting more difficult and costly because once-spineless institutional investors are starting to view LBOs as thefts of public companies. \u001d  Witness the financial concessions that a buyout group led by Bain and Thomas H. Lee Partners is making to emboldened holders of Clear Channel Communications (CCU) in a bid to acquire the radio giant. Two weeks don't make a trend, but the first half of June marked the slowest period for mergers and acquisitions since January, according to Thomson Financial. \u001d  But neither these concerns nor Washington's threat to enact rules that would raise Blackstone's taxes deterred the firm's large underwriting group, led by Morgan Stanley, from pricing 133 million of Blackstone's limited-partnership units Thursday night, five days ahead of schedule. On heavy demand, the deal priced at the top of its expected range of $29 to $31 per unit, although one buyer was able to scoop up shares at a 4.5% discount: Concurrent with the IPO, an investment arm of the Chinese government purchased a $3 billion stake in the firm. \u001d  The public offering was a coup for Schwarzman, 60, and other Blackstone partners, who now own about 75% of the company's shares -- stock for which they paid nothing, at least in monetary terms. The deal gives Blackstone a currency to make acquisitions and raise money for investments in its private-equity, real-estate and hedge funds. Schwarzman and Pete Peterson, Blackstone's co-founder and senior chairman, probably can't believe their good fortune. A few years ago, a Blackstone IPO might have had trouble getting done at all, given the weaker market environment and novelty of the idea of taking a private-equity outfit public. \u001d  Blackstone executives declined to comment for this article. \u001d  The bullish case for Blackstone is that it's led by some of the smartest people in the investment business. Blackstone managed $88 billion on May 1, up from $14 billion at the end of 2001, and stands to earn high returns while risking little or none of its own capital. So far, it has delivered handsomely for investors: Its private-equity funds, which control $33 billion, have returned 22.6% annually (after fees) since 1987, double the Standard & Poor's 500 index's gain. \u001d  How has Blackstone done it? Its 2004 purchase of Celanese, a chemicals concern, is a textbook example of an LBO score. Blackstone recognized that Celanese, though a U.S. company, had shares that were traded mainly in Germany, where chemical-company valuations were lower. The firm won control of Celanese for $4 billion and quickly took it public, arbitraging the valuation gap between the U.S. and European markets -- and getting help from an upturn in the chemicals business. Blackstone had a fivefold return on its investment, evidence of the magic of a smart acquisition financed with lots of debt. \u001d  The bearish case for Blackstone rests in good part on valuation. At 35, the company is valued at about 32 times 2006 profits, five times book value and 43% of its assets under management. \u001d  The buzz is that Blackstone has quietly been guiding investors to a projection of 2008 profits of about $1.75 a share, which means the stock trades in line with the valuation of Blackstone's only publicly traded peer, Fortress Investment Group [FIG], an operator of hedge funds and private-equity funds that went public in February. Fortress shares trade around 24. \u001d  Trading for 20 times projected 2008 earnings, Blackstone looks rich relative to Wall Street's biggest securities firms -- Goldman Sachs (GS), Bear Stearns (BSC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Merrill Lynch (MER) and Lehman Brothers (LEH) -- which fetch an average of 10 times their estimated '08 earnings. Asset managers like T. Rowe Price (TROW) and Franklin Resources (BEN) are valued at about 18 times estimated '08 earnings. Put a price-earnings multiple of 15 on Blackstone's estimated 2008 earnings and the stock would be trading in the mid-20s. \u001d  Assets managers typically sell for 2% to 5% of their managed investments. Blackstone has a higher market value than Franklin Resources. Yet Franklin manages $620 billion, seven times Blackstone's asset base. \u001d  What is crucially different is that Blackstone enjoys much higher fees than traditional asset managers, owing to the 20% incentive fee it gets on clients' gains. But such fees, which account for most of its earnings, could now be unsustainably high. \u001d  In the past, investors in companies such as Man Group, the British hedge-fund operator, effectively assigned a lower price-earnings multiple to incentive fees than base fees because of greater uncertainty about the sustainability of incentives. No such discount has been applied to Blackstone. Although the firm has made no big missteps in recent years, the odds are rising that it will be stung by one or more of its leveraged buyouts in coming years. A blowup could damage its reputation, hurt its stock, depress fees and hurt its ability to raise new funds. \u001d  Blackstone's financial statements are tough to read because of a host of adjustments the firm makes to its earnings, based on partners' compensation, equity grants and taxes. A key profit measure is \"pro forma economic net income\" -- $1.2 billion after taxes in 2006. Dividing that amount into the company's $38 billion market value yields a P/E of 32. \u001d  Blackstone had a blockbuster first quarter, earning $640 million in economic net income, half of what it made in all of 2006. Its latest good fortune owed largely to huge profits from its real-estate funds. Blackstone's earnings are apt to be lumpy, since they hinge on its timing in harvesting gains in its portfolio and realizing its 20% incentive fee. But the firm can earn pretty much whatever it wants in coming quarters, given already-embedded gains in its investments. \u001d  A key risk to Blackstone's shares is the threat of higher taxes. In its prospectus, Blackstone assumed a 17% tax rate for last year (when state as well as federal taxes are taken into account), but that could rise by 20 percentage points if Congress moves to force the firm into a corporate structure. Iowa Republican Charles Grassley has introduced a bill in the Senate to do just that, arguing Blackstone shouldn't benefit from a low tax rate relative to other asset managers and Wall Street firms. If Grassley and others get their wish, higher taxes probably won't bite for several years. Still, if Blackstone were paying a full corporate tax rate, its P/E, based on 2006 earnings, would be nearly 40. \u001d  House Democrats took aim Friday at another tax break enjoyed by partners in private-equity firms that enables them to treat as a capital gain the \"carried interest,\" or 20% profit, they earn on increases in their firms' investment funds. This income is taxed at the preferential 15% federal capital-gains rate, rather than the top 35% levy on ordinary income. Capital gains get favorable treatment because the government wants to reward investment and compensate investors for risk. But Blackstone risks none of its own capital to get its carry fees. \u001d  Schwarzman may have himself to blame for Washington's sudden focus on his industry's tax treatment. While most private-equity, hedge-fund and Wall Street chieftains prefer a low profile, he craves the limelight. He threw himself a lavish party when he turned 60 in February. He lives in one of New York's poshest apartments, in the best address on Park Avenue. And in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, he described takeover battles in military terms, saying: \"I want war, not a series of skirmishes. I always think about what will kill off the other bidder.\" \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"05e5b8357c7ddba9d1cc273d8234015c","symR":["BITAL.YY","DB1.XE","ISE","LSE.LN","NDAQ","NYX","OMX.SK","DE0005810055","GB00B0SWJX34","SE0000110165"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"LSE To Offer 4.9 Own Shares For Each Borsa Share In Merger","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T09:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BITAL.YY","DB1.XE","ISE","LSE.LN","NDAQ","NYX","OMX.SK","DE0005810055","GB00B0SWJX34","SE0000110165"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","SCR","XDAX","XDJGI","XHEX","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSTF","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 05:38 ET (09:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0b19d9f31eee5060c11d931202989551","symR":["532174.BY","IBN","INE090A01013"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ICICI Bank Prices Public Offer At INR940/Shr - Source","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T12:59:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["532174.BY","IBN","INE090A01013"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MUMBAI (Dow Jones)--ICICI Bank Ltd.

To cash in on the current gravy train, Brazil's family-dominated beef dynasties are going public. For small-cap investors with an appetite for emerging-market stocks, the lineup of initial public offerings is enticing. And analysts see very promising upside for Brazilian meat companies overall. \u001d  The latest example: the March 28 IPO of JBS (ticker: JBSS3.Brazil), which owns Friboi Group -- the largest meatpacker in Latin Americaand soon-to-be proud parent of Swift & Co., the fifth-largest meat outfit in the U.S. \u001d  Marfrig (MRFG3.Brazil), Brazil's No. 3 beef exporter, will list on Bovespa, the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, on June 28, with Americans who meet the SEC's 144A rules qualified to invest. The fourth-largest beef exporter, Minerva, has announced that it will list common shares on Bovespa's Novo Mercado system-the exchange's most rigorous and transparent form of stock listing-later this year. Bertin Group, the No. 2 beef exporter in Brazil, is also toying with the idea of an IPO. Investment funds from JPMorgan, Credit Suisse First Boston and Santander Investment all have a stake. \u001d  Nearly three-fourths of JBS/Friboi's IPO shares were gobbled up by foreigners. They now trade around 7.30 Brazilian reals, or $3.80, below the IPO value of BRL8 per share, with the drop mostly due to expansion costs. JBS' first-quarter net revenue was BRL1.1 billion, 22.6% above the level a year earlier. Export revenue was BRL626 million, up 24.8%. \u001d  In the quarter, growth in Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was 28.4%. The Ebitda margin was 14.4%, versus 3.14% for multinational Tyson Foods (TSN). Since its IPO, JBS' average share volume has outstripped Tyson's by about 10%. \u001d  While it's hard to compare Friboi's corporate structure to U.S. peers', Brazil's dominant meat companies look like cheap bets in a growing market, as developing-world populations eat more animal protein. Brazil, the world's top beef exporter, boasts record export volume (over $3 billion annually) the past two years -- despite a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak leading to a 56-nation ban, mostly on meat from the states where sick cattle were reported. Companies such as Bertin and Friboi have used ban-free states to keep the cash flowing in. Brazil exported 1.2 million metric tons of fresh beef in 2006, versus 1.08 million tons in '05, according to its foreign trade ministry. \u001d  \"Sanitation risks are the biggest barriers to success for these companies. That's something Friboi and Bertin can't really predict or control,\" says Amaryelles Romano, a food-sector analyst for consultants Tendencias in Sao Paulo. \"Other than that, this sector's outlook is extremely positive,\" she adds. \u001d  Brazil's most-traded meat companies, Sadia and Perdigao, both have American depositary receipts traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the respective tickers SDA and PDA. Both companies are expanding. Perdigao just announced a $49 million investment in a beef-packing facility in Mato Grosso state, home to Brazil's second-largest cattle herd. \u001d  \"The IPO markets are a positive, because companies like Bertin can use them to pay back bond holders. They will tend to invest capital-market cash in capacity expansion and acquisitions, which bodes well for long-term revenue,\" says Isabela Bacchi, a bond analyst from the emerging-markets credit research team at JPMorgan Securities in New York. \u001d  --- \u001d  Kenneth Rapoza is a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires in Sao Paulo. \u001d  --- \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1027a3a014b3a099c93dbd857f752792","symR":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","GZPFY","SIBN.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625","RU0009062467"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gazprom Vice Chmn Doesn't Rule Out Eni Role In Shtokman Proj","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T16:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","GZPFY","SIBN.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625","RU0009062467"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  ROME (Dow Jones)--Alexander Medvedev, vice chairman of OAO Gazprom (GSPBEX.RS), Saturday didn't rule out a role for Eni SpA (E), Italy's biggest oil company by volume, over joining the giant Shtokman gas field in Russia. \u001d  Medvedev said Gazprom and Eni may develop further cooperation deals between the two as part of their strategic alliance when asked by Dow Jones Newswires regarding the possibility of Eni taking part in the Shtokman project. \u001d  The Gazprom executive was speaking at a press conference in Rome for the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the two companies on the possibility of building a new pipeline called \"South Stream,\" bringing Russian gas to the European Union. \u001d  Eni and the Russian gas behemoth signed a strategic agreement in November extending supplies of gas to the Rome-based company to 2035 while allowing Gazprom to sell directly certain quantities of the fossil fuel in Italy. Among other items agreed was the possibility of allowing Eni to enter Russia's upstream market. \u001d  Earlier this month, people familiar with the matter said Eni has had preliminary contacts with Gazprom over joining the Shtokman project in Russia's Barents Sea. \u001d  Joining Shtokman \"has been talked about at high levels (between Eni and Gazprom), but it has been a recent discussion, not one that's advanced,\" a Moscow-based official familiar with the two companies' operations told Dow Jones Newswires June 1. \u001d  Gazprom had previously preselected partners for minority stakes in the Shtokman project, but in October the Russian firm changed tack and said it would keep 100% equity control over the project, with foreign partners involved only as contractors. \u001d  Natural gas exports from the massive Shtokman gas field are set to begin to flow to Europe in 2013, with LNG deliveries to North America due to start in 2014. The field boasts some 3.7 trillion cubic meters of gas. \u001d  Separately, Medvedev also said Gazprom may decide not to exercise the option it holds to buy the 20% stake Eni owns in Russian company OAO Gazprom Neft (SIBN.RS) depending on the outcome of talks with the Italian company on how to expand their alliance accord of November. \u001d  Gazprom has two years to exercise the option. \b \u001d  -By Liam Moloney, Dow Jones Newswires; +39 06 678 2543; liam.moloney@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 12:08 ET (16:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"10467105eac799ac38df15e9c270f208","symR":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Eni: New Pipeline To Link Russia To Bulgaria Via Black Sea","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T12:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","OIL","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 08:04 ET (12:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"12360994ac21d879ba2b9340ed0216fc","symR":["CFC","CNX","LUM","SCMLX"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) Staying Out Of Trouble","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CFC","CNX","LUM","SCMLX"],"IndustryCodes":["COA","FIS","MFN","REA","REI","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Sandra Ward \u001d  Interview With Arnie Schneider \u001d  Founder and Chief Investment Officer, Schneider Capital Management \b \u001d  Call it greatness. Call it gifted. Call the consistently outstanding stock-picking performance all in a day's work for Schneider and his team at Schneider Capital Management of Wayne, Pa., who manage $6.3 billion. Dedicated to finding deeply undervalued stocks on the verge of cyclical change, Schneider's funds have outshone their benchmarks and most competitors year after year after year. As of May 31, the Schneider Small Cap had average, since its start in September 1998, compared with 15% for the Russell 2000 Value index. The Schneider Value Fund (SCMLX) was up 29.2% annually, on average, since its start in October 2002, versus 20.1% for the Russell 1000 Value index. That's what greatness looks like. This is what it sounds like. \b \u001d  Barron's: Last year, you likened the market to Lake Wobegon, where all stocks were priced above average. What do you make of this year's market? \u001d  Schneider: I don't have any cute lines for it, but it seems late in the bull-market cycle. The market is priced for perfection. It seems to me that the market is assuming that credit spreads stay low and therefore the private-equity boom continues. It also seems to assume that the U.S. economy avoids a recession and that the very rapid international economic growth continues. Collectively, the risks are high that one of those ends, and if one does then the bull market is over. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say it is the credit-spreads, private-equity boom that is the most important driver of the three. \b \u001d  Q: With interest rates rising, aren't we starting to see more concern about spreads and private-equity funding? \u001d  A: Yes, that is the first threat to the private-equity boom. Credit costs have gone up and that's making acquisitions more expensive. Wider credit spreads will be the second nail in the coffin. Last year, 8 1/2% of the U.S. market was leveraged-buyout-related, which was similar to peaks in the late 1990s and late '80s. That's a pretty big number. \b \u001d  Q: How are you approaching the market, given the risks? \u001d  A: The value markets are very difficult now because there are very few valuation differentials to exploit, and so we have concentrated our portfolios on our best ideas to a greater degree. We are focused increasingly in the financial area because it is one of the last remaining areas that is cheap. It is an area where we can find earnings streams that are still low and have the availability to improve, as opposed to paying big multiples on earnings streams that are not durable, in our judgment. There are opportunities in names that are high-quality institutions that should do well, irrespective of the housing debacle, and in some cases will benefit as their weaker competitors that lost their way move aside. \b \u001d  Q: What are your expectations for the economy? \u001d  A: The risks of a domestic recession have risen with this bond-market back-up. The consumer is very fragile. Consumers, who are two-thirds of the economy, have hung in there, although clearly at a decelerating rate. They're the $64,000 question for which direction the economy goes. Exports are leading the economy, housing is dragging the economy and the consumer will be the ultimate arbiter of whether we avoid a recession or not. Employment has been slowing but is still solid. We are averaging about 130,000 jobs a month this year, which is down by about one-third from last year but not too bad. And incomes are growing nicely, so the consumer has hung in there. We were spending well above incomes and consumers, probably correctly, have ratcheted their spending down to equal their incomes. I think the next move is for spending to move below income growth, mostly because we've got the first housing-price depreciation since the Great Depression. It is just inconsistent to me that home builders are trading at new lows and retailing stocks are trading at new highs. That isn't the way the economy works. They're more closely linked than that. \b \u001d  Q: But why the disconnect? \u001d  A: I think the reason is that 94% of homeowners have over 10% equity in their homes. They have unrealized losses versus a year ago, but they still have realized gains in their homes and they are not forced sellers. As long as they have a job, consumers are going to continue to spend and be confident, and that is why we are most likely to avoid a recession. But the foundation is weaker. \u001d  If you look at the financial-obligations ratio, it is at an all-time high. Mortgage-equity withdrawal is half its peak level, but it is still way above normal and there are lags there. The headwinds on the consumer have started and they are gathering, but it takes a shock to tumble the economy into a recession. Again, the most likely outcome is avoidance of a recession, but the odds have clearly gone up. \b \u001d  Q: Are you looking not only for stocks that are inexpensive but also defensive? \u001d  A: Ideally, you would like to find those. The problem is the true defensive stocks -- the utilities and stocks of that nature -- are very expensive. Playing pure defense is too expensive to do. We haven't found a lot of pure defensive stocks. The food stocks are 17 times earnings. The telephone stocks are not cheap. \b \u001d  Q: What about Big Pharma? \u001d  A: Pharma is defensive and the stocks are statistically cheap, unlike the others. But the question there is, what's the growth rate? Congress is attacking their franchise and there are a lot of patent expirations going on. So the growth rates in earnings over the next few years are quite sluggish. \b \u001d  Q: So you're focused on financials, and what else? \u001d  A: Coal. \b \u001d  Q: Let's start with the financials. \u001d  A: The first name is Countrywide Financial [ticker: CFC]. Countrywide is the largest and arguably the most efficient mortgage originator and servicer in the country. They've got an integrated operation and can respond quickly to changing industry conditions. Their servicing portfolio represents about 15% of U.S. mortgage debt outstanding. The key to this stock is that the current mortgage-industry turmoil should lead to less competition and more rational pricing. The pricing has been very, very thin, really throughout the mortgage chain, so they'll be a direct beneficiary of better spreads, which are already emerging in mortgages. Also, Countrywide has diversified into several new businesses in the last decade that should smooth out the earnings stream and provide some balance for the mortgage operation. \b \u001d  Q: If we are looking at a possible recession and a bottom in the housing market has yet to occur, won't there be more pain for people who invest in this stock now? \u001d  A: That's the point. I look at 2007 as the trough year for their earnings. Mortgage margins are extremely low. Originations are down by over a third from the peak in 2003. The new-home market is extraordinarily weak and the refi market is somewhat weak, and so we view mortgage spreads as being at a low. We view mortgage originations as being at a low. We think volumes will go up next year and spreads will go up next year as competitors exit. Even if housing starts go down next year, Countrywide's earnings likely would go up. Remember, they are generating tremendous amounts of capital. This year they are going to earn a 15% return on equity on trough earnings. Their capital base will grow, enabling them to grow earnings. \b \u001d  Q: Let's talk about the numbers. \u001d  A: The market expects them to earn $3.80 this year, which we think is the trough year of earnings. The stock is 10 times trough earnings, and trough earnings have a 15% return on equity. Over time, ROE has averaged in the high teens to low 20s, so earnings power clearly is higher, not only as the capital base grows but as the return on equity returns to median levels. \b \u001d  Q: Any other financials? \u001d  A: The other pick is Luminent Mortgage Capital [LUM], a small-cap mortgage REIT. Luminent is different than Countrywide in that they don't originate mortgages. They are just a disciplined buyer of mortgage product and can sit on the sidelines when spreads are tight. When spreads are wide, as they were in March and April, they can buy as much as their balance sheet allows. Luminent is selling below book value, and it is a fairly hard book. \b \u001d  Q: A hard book? \u001d  A: It's solid. The portfolio is marked to market at the end of the quarter. They have very strong credit management. Their portfolio is showing significantly better credit performance than portfolios with similar metrics, and the stock is selling for a whopping six times Wall Street's estimated '08 earnings. They are buying back stock and, most important, they benefit from the wider credit spreads, mortgage spreads that have existed since February. \b \u001d  Q: Does Luminent pay a dividend? \u001d  A: Yes, it's yielding more than 12%. \b \u001d  Q: On to coal. What's to like? \u001d  A: Coal has a promising future. Last year was kind of a perfect storm for the coal industry. There was a warm winter and a cool summer, strong hydroelectric and relatively low natural-gas prices. Demand was weak and in response to the strong coal prices in 2004 and 2005, supply was in the process of really ramping up. Inventories exploded, prices collapsed and stock prices collapsed. Coal is now in the process of reversing the ugly 2006 trends. \b \u001d  Q: What's changing? \u001d  A: There are three main regions of the coal industry: the Powder River Basin in the West; the North Appalachian area; and Central Appalachian, which is the high-cost area in the U.S. Under current conditions, Central App is shutting down capacity. They are about 20% of U.S. production. Year to date, Central App production is down about 20 million tons, and we think it will be down about twice that for the entire year. More Central App capacity will shut in 2008 because most coal contracts are multiyear. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1ea5983a42bff26c472c4d51131ff04d","symR":["BITAL.YY","DB1.XE","ISE","LSE.LN","NDAQ","NYX","OMX.SK","DE0005810055","GB00B0SWJX34","SE0000110165"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Borsa Italiana, LSE Say Boards Back Merger","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T09:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BITAL.YY","DB1.XE","ISE","LSE.LN","NDAQ","NYX","OMX.SK","DE0005810055","GB00B0SWJX34","SE0000110165"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","SCR","XDAX","XDJGI","XHEX","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSTF","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 05:29 ET (09:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1eadbc0b288a868452d08fec1ca9d927","symR":["ANBB","SAN.MC","STD","ES0113900J37"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Santander Sees 2007 Ordinary Net Profit Above EUR8 Bln","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T09:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ANBB","SAN.MC","STD","ES0113900J37"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XDJGI","XES","XIBEX","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 05:21 ET (09:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2054d70f72f562e308c4d8f80e013da8","symR":["BBY","HD","LTD","US0865161014","US4370761029"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) Streetwise: Of Dangerous Books And Markets","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BBY","HD","LTD","US0865161014","US4370761029"],"IndustryCodes":["HIM","OTS","RTS","SAP","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Michael Santoli \u001d  One of the summer's two surprise nonfiction bestsellers is The Dangerous Book for Boys. The other, The Black Swan, might as well be called The Book for Dangerous Boys, so popular has it become among the same hedge-fund traders and sell-siders the author blames for raising the odds of a catastrophic financial surprise. \u001d  The former book is a nostalgic guide to traditional boyhood games and hobbies, meant to teach Wii-addicted, over-scheduled kids about supposedly simpler pleasures. The latter, a treatise on the way dramatic chance occurrences shape the world, instructs us to mistrust high-tech models and statistical assumptions. \u001d  The Black Swan -- by the trader and scholar Nassim Nicholas Taleb -- was spotted on a few lounge chairs last week at a beach resort favored by Wall Streeters, within reach of well-thumbed BlackBerrys. \u001d  It is No. 24 among all books on www.amazon.com, and the site says its buyers also commonly ordered Inside the House of Money: Top Hedge Fund Traders on Profiting in the Global Markets. Clearly, it's the season's beach read among the trading set. \u001d  The book (reviewed in Barron's Balancing the Books, June 4) is worthwhile. It's a learned, provocative, consensus-challenging work, if also a bit repetitive and strident. The essential point is that humans underestimate the frequency and impact of unforeseeable events, underweight the importance of luck in life and take false comfort in illusory patterns. Financial types come in for particular scorn. \u001d  But what does it suggest about the present market moment that this book has found such a ready audience in the investment world? What would it mean if \"everyone\" began going around \"expecting the unexpected\"? \u001d  Here's guessing that the lessons of the book will become oversimplified and misapplied. Before long, research reports and market commentaries will make \"black swan\" an overused buzz phrase, as they did \"tipping point.\" And, more concretely, perhaps even more traders will look to hedge against known, conceivable risks -- a 10% stock-market correction, a subprime-mortgage rupture -- rather than open their minds to the utterly unpredictable occurrence. \u001d  This would fit with an already-active tack among hedge funds to -- yes -- hedge, to keep some short exposure on the books at all times. Bernie Schaeffer of Schaeffer's Investment Research has noted the accumulation of protective options, with last week's open S&P 500 puts versus calls running near 12-month highs. NYSE short interest again was up in the latest month, by 6%. Even though this measure is in long-term ascent, Ned Davis Research notes the short-interest ratio has run above its recent trend range. \u001d  These nuggets are not meant to imply that \"everyone's bearish,\" which is far from true. Funds are comfortably net long, and, as a group, professional investors are upbeat. Yet there remains an overlay of skepticism -- a just-in-case exposure to the downside -- that creates a high burden of proof for those arguing the market is near an important top. And it lays a bid underneath the market should a break come. \u001d  This all says nothing about the direction of, say, the next 5% move, mind you (though as Taleb would scream, handicapping such things is futile and even dishonest). \u001d  Last week's 2% loss seemed to show that with little earnings news, a slowdown in merger action and the prevailing concept of abundant liquidity challenged by a mortgage hedge-fund run aground, this market belongs to the sellers. Bottom line: Having risen 25% in value in the past year, the market could give back a good bit more before the broader uptrend is undermined. \b \u001d  Time was when successful chain retailers were all about growth -- square-footage growth, sales growth, market-share growth. Now, due to the demands of catalyst-obsessed professional investors, they are financial-engineering stories. \u001d  Last week Home Depot (ticker: HD) got its long-idle stock moving with a plan for an asset sale, debt issuance and a buyback of 25% of its market value. Best Buy's (BBY) CFO said on a conference call that his company would mull its capital structure in light of Home Depot's move. And Limited Brands (LTD) -- subject of a recent bullish Barron's feature (\"Victoria's Real Secret,\" June 11) -- said it would cut 500 jobs, take on new debt and repurchase 10% of its equity. \u001d  These shifts make for more efficient balance sheets. But also recognize that these companies are borrowing in order to shrink themselves. This is late-bull-market and late-profit-cycle action, which is a net positive until the game stops. \u001d  Note that quality companies weren't buying back stock as the bear market was giving way to a bull phase in late 2002 and stocks were relatively cheap. Hindsight is 20/20. Generals and CFOs fight the last war. Before long, we'll be back to demanding, and paying for, true growth strategies. \u001d  --- \u001d  e-mail: michael.santoli@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2200251e5a0813d54e14448965f022f6","symR":["MRK","US5893311077"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Longer-Term Study On Merck's Januvia Released","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T15:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MRK","US5893311077"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Jennifer Corbett Dooren \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--A study of Merck & Co.'s (MRK)diabetes drug Januvia showed the medication lowered a key measure of blood sugar when taken in combination with another common diabetes drug in patients followed for a year. \u001d  The study, to be released Saturday at the American Diabetes Association's annual meeting in Chicago, marks the first time one-year data involving the drug will be released. Previous data involved patients with type 2 diabetes who were followed for six months. \u001d  Patients in the year-long study were broken into various groups - those who took Januvia alone; those who took metformin, another common diabetes drug, and patients who received both drugs together. The study, which also looked at different doses of Januvia and metformin, involved 762 patients who had an average so-called A1C level of 8.7% at the study start. \u001d  A1C measures blood glucose or blood sugar for an average of two to three months. A level below 7% is considered good blood sugar or blood-glucose control for people with diabetes. \u001d   The study showed that 67% of patients taking a combination of 50 milligrams of Januvia and 1000 milligrams  metformin twice daily achieved an A1C level of less than 7%  compared to 44% of patients who took metformin alone. The study showed 48% of patients taking a combination of 50 milligrams of Januvia and 500 milligrams of metformin twice daily achieved an A1C level of less than 7% compared to 25% of patients on 500 milligrams of metformin alone. The study showed 23% of patients taking 100 milligrams of Januvia once a day reached an A1C level of 7% or below. \u001d  Januvia, approved by the Food and Drug Administration last October, is known as a DPP-4 inhibitor and so far is the only type of drug in its class that's on the U.S. market. In February, the FDA delayed the approval of a similar drug made by Novartis (NVS) called Galvus. \u001d  Drugs like Januvia work by increasing the level of so-called incretin hormones in the body that help lower the blood sugar or blood-glucose levels. They work in a different manner than blood-glucose-lowering drugs currently on the market, including sulfonylurea drugs, which stimulate the pancreas to release insulin, and metformin, which works on the liver to reduce blood sugar. \u001d  About 21 million Americans have diabetes, a disease characterized by high blood-glucose levels that result from the body's inability to use or produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes most often occurs in people who are older than 45 and overweight, although there has been an increase in younger patients in recent years. \u001d  Type 1 diabetes, often diagnosed in childhood, requires people to use insulin to manage their blood sugar levels. Many diabetics also have poor lipid profiles, which puts them at risk for cardiovascular disease. Diabetes also can lead to blindness, kidney disease and amputations. \b \u001d  -By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9294; Jennifer.Corbett@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 11:00 ET (15:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"24028a422ca422d1523325f8f72a8372","symR":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gazprom Vice-Chmn Says Pipeline May Have 30BCM/Yr Capacity","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T12:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","OIL","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 08:51 ET (12:51 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"26bd15322ddf80221bea19c412ef96fc","symR":["BX","FIG","VNO"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) Top Of The Market -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BX","FIG","VNO"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","FIS","REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  Schwarzman appeared on the cover of Fortune earlier this year, under the headline \"The New King of the Street.\" It may be worth recalling that not long after John Gutfreund, the head of Salomon Brothers in the late 1980s, was crowned King of the Street, he was forced out of his job in a Treasury-bond scandal in the early '90s. \b \u001d  There's plenty of irony in Blackstone's IPO, since Schwarzman and other private-equity executives regularly tout the supposed benefits that companies gain from being private. Because of strong investor demand, Blackstone has been able to get away with being \"a different kind of public company,\" to borrow a phrase from the IPO prospectus. Blackstone will be run like a private partnership, and public investors will have no real say in how it is run. \u001d  Many individual investors might not realize that investing in Blackstone's shares could involve tax hassles. Because of the partnership structure, individual holders will owe tax on the company's full annual profits. The good news is that Blackstone plans to give investors the wherewithal to pay taxes by providing an ample annual dividend of $1.20 a share through the end of 2009, resulting in an initial yield on the shares of 3.4%. Thereafter, the company plans to pay out in dividends the bulk of its economic net income. \u001d  Individual investors in Blackstone will get a K-1 partnership tax form, not the more common 1099 tax form. They probably will have to ask the Internal Revenue Service for an extension to file their tax returns, because Blackstone doesn't expect to have a K-1 available by next April 1. Also, individuals could owe income taxes in multiple states, according to the prospectus. \u001d  No matter these potential headaches, buyers lined up last week to purchase stock in the hope Blackstone's money machine keeps whirring. The firm has done particularly well with its real-estate funds, which now manage $20 billion. They've returned 31% annually, after fees, since inception in 1992. That is extraordinary, although any good real-estate fund has done well in the bull market of the past 15 years. One of the leading real-estate investment trusts, Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), which focuses on the office market, has returned 25% annually since 1992. \u001d  Blackstone's blockbuster deal to purchase Equity Office Properties, the REIT founded by Sam Zell, for $39 billion in February demonstrates the benefits and potential pitfalls of highly leveraged investments. \u001d  After putting up just $3.5 billion of equity in the EOP deal, Blackstone's real-estate fund moved quickly to unload about $20 billion of properties at high prices, including a $7 billion Manhattan sale. Blackstone generated over $500 million of net investment profits from its real-estate funds in the first quarter, reflecting the EOP sales. \u001d  It's notable that Blackstone reported big gains even though it still owns about half the EOP portfolio. Trouble could be looming for Blackstone because the Morgan Stanley index of REIT stocks is down about 20% since the EOP deal closed. Will Blackstone take a mark-to-market loss on its remaining EOP properties to reflect the declining share price of office REITs like Vornado? Don't bet on it. In the prospectus, Blackstone says that since the end of the first quarter, its real-estate business continues \"to be favorably affected\" by market conditions. This assessment seems rosy; rising interest rates and tightening lending standards are stinging buyers of commercial real estate, including the purchaser of the Manhattan buildings sold by Blackstone. \u001d  Blackstone and other real-estate investors now face a threefold problem. Prices of office buildings, shopping malls and hotels have soared around the world. Cash yields on commercial real estate are in the 4%-to-6% range, half what they were in the late 1990s. At the same time, more money is chasing these properties. Just last week, Morgan Stanley closed on an $8 billion real-estate fund, while Goldman brought in $4 billion for a new fund. With rates rising, the leveraged real-estate game is much tougher. \u001d  An investment in Blackstone amounts to a bet on the ability of its private-equity and real-estate funds to continue generating high returns. These funds produced 80% of Blackstone's profits last year. The firm also manages $35 billion of so-called alternative-asset funds, including a $20 billion fund-of-funds, which involves farming money out to hedge-fund managers. Blackstone also has a financial-advisory business. \u001d  One little-noticed feature in Blackstone's private-equity funds is a \"clawback\" provision. If a fund generates sizable profits, producing an incentive fee for Blackstone, and then suffers losses on a subsequent investment, Blackstone may have to repay the incentive fee to the fund's investors. \u001d  New capital commitments to private-equity firms hit $140 billion last year, up from $41 billion in 1997, according to Thomson. Blackstone just finished raising a $19.6 billion fund. \u001d  The private-equity business might not have reached bubble status, but there are eerie parallels with the late 1990s' venture-capital boom, when investors sought the next eBay. Venture returns plummeted after 2000 due to a dearth of opportunities and much-reduced valuations for tech stocks. \u001d  Asked about private equity at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in May, Warren Buffett offered this insight: \"Due to the nature of private equity, it's not a bubble that will burst. They lock up their money for five to 10 years and buy businesses that don't price daily. It takes many years for the score to be put on the board, and the investors can't leave. It's not like leverage in marketable securities.\" \u001d  Buffett observed that the interests of the managers of private-equity funds aren't necessarily aligned with those of their investors. \"If you have a $20 billion fund and get a 2% fee, you're getting $400 million a year. But you can't raise another fund with a straight face until you've invested it, so there's a great compulsion to invest it quickly so you can raise another fund and get more fees. I think it will be quite some time before disillusion sets in\" among private-equity investors, Buffett continued, according to a transcript by investor Whitney Tilson. \u001d  Last week's IPO could portend public offerings by Blackstone's rivals, much as Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette's offering in 1970 \"blazed the trail for Merrill Lynch and others,\" says Byron Wien, the chief investment strategist at Pequot Capital Management in New York. It may be difficult for private-equity firms to stay private because \"the temptations of being public will be too great,\" he adds. \u001d  KKR soon may file for an IPO. Other firms that could be waiting in the wings are Carlyle Group, Citadel Investment and Apollo Management. But when smart people agree to sell their businesses, investors ought to be wary. Such was the case when Zell parted with Equity Office in February. \u001d  Blackstone may be ringing a bell for private equity. It is, after all, no Goldman Sachs -- which has been around for more than 100 years. A decade from now, Goldman probably will have found new ways to mint money. It's uncertain what Blackstone and Schwarzman will be doing. With a $38 billion market value, Blackstone is discounting highly profitable leveraged buyouts stretching well into the future. Based on the headwinds in its key businesses, Blackstone looks significantly overvalued. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"349b5ed8eb4293a1096717ca59d127b9","symR":["5730.FR","BA","FNC.MI","LLL","RTN","IT0003856405","NL0000235190","US0970231058","US7551115071"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Raytheon Protests L-3 Win In US Small Cargo Plane Bidding","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T12:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","BA","FNC.MI","LLL","RTN","IT0003856405","NL0000235190","US0970231058","US7551115071"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","DFN","XCA4","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XISL","XMDAX","XMIB","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Rebecca Christie \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--Raytheon Co. (RTN) said Saturday it has filed a protest with the U.S. government over the outcome of a U.S. cargo plane competition that could be worth $6 billion or more to the winning contractors. \u001d  The U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force recently picked L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL) for the Joint Cargo Aircraft, a small cargo plane sought for short-range transport missions. The winning bid offered the C-27J aircraft, made by Finmeccanica SpA's (FNC.MI) Alenia unit, with plans for Boeing Co. (BA) to start a U.S. assembly line. \u001d  Losing bidder Raytheon also offered a plane of European origin, the C-295 made by the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. (5730.FR). This week, company officials received a briefing on the contest outcome and decided to file a protest. \u001d  In a statement, Raytheon offered few clues about the basis for its challenge. \"Raytheon filed a bid protest on Friday with the Goverment Accountability Office regarding the Joint Cargo Aircraft award announced June 13, 2007. We will have no further comment at this time,\" Raytheon said. \u001d  But earlier this week, Raytheon Chief Executive William Swanson said his company generally doesn't file a protest without good cause. \u001d  \"You can only protest and win if the process was flawed,\" Swanson said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires that took place before Raytheon had received its full post-competition briefing. \u001d  \"Did they follow the process they said they were going to follow?\" Swanson said. \"If they made an incorrect assumption about your proposal that was clear, or if they evaluated something that wasn't spelled out in the criteria, then the process becomes flawed.\" \u001d  The JCA protest is yet another challenge for Pentagon weapons buyers, who already are wrestling with a series of contentious issues. The Air Force is enmeshed in a messy protest of its $15 billion CSAR-X helicopter competition that has included several rounds of legal filings. The small cargo plane contest could follow that model, or be resolved more quickly if GAO finds no grounds to sustain the protest. \u001d  Questions swirled around the JCA program at this week's Paris Air Show. L-3 and Alenia officials offered several scenarios for production rates and timelines. And it also isn't clear how many planes the Pentagon has on contract - the official announcement says \"up to\" 78. \u001d  Last week, the U.S. Army said the $2 billion in the Pentagon announcement was a \"misprint\" and that the cost of those planes will actually be more like $4 billion. Analysts said the $2 billion number might represent 54 planes headed for the Army, without any of the 24 planes designated for Air Force purchase. \u001d  \"I have always seriously questioned the Air Force's real commitment to the JCA program. My skepticism will increase if it is confirmed that the Air Force has committed no funds to buy aircraft in the actual contract award, whatever they say they intend to buy,\" said Stephen Trimble, who writes the DEW Line blog on defense weapons issues. \u001d  Wall Street projections say the total JCA market could be 200 planes or more, if the U.S. adds more planes for the National Guard and starts a foreign military sales program. The Air Force is working this year on a study that may determine its long-term interest in the program. \b \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; Rebecca.Christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 08:21 ET (12:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"37c2ea4eaac96f8229122e15826afa79","symR":["BITAL.YY","DB1.XE","ISE","LEH","LSE.LN","MER","NDAQ","NYX","OMX.SK","DE0005810055","GB00B0SWJX34","SE0000110165","US5249081002","US5901881087"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Borsa Italiana Board Backs London Stock Exchange Merger","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T10:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BITAL.YY","DB1.XE","ISE","LEH","LSE.LN","MER","NDAQ","NYX","OMX.SK","DE0005810055","GB00B0SWJX34","SE0000110165","US5249081002","US5901881087"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","SCR","XDAX","XDJGI","XFFX","XHEX","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTF","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Liam Moloney and Sabrina Cohen \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  MILAN (Dow Jones)--The board of Borsa Italiana SpA Saturday said it approved a EUR1.63 billion all-share takeover bid from the London Stock Exchange PLC (LSE.LN), marking a further step in the ongoing consolidation of stock exchanges worldwide. \u001d  Borsa Italiana executives, which met Friday, took two days to iron out details of the proposed new business which will be headed by current LSE Chief Executive Clara Furse, with Borsa Italiana CEO Massimo Capuano taking the deputy CEO role. \u001d  The tie-up \"creates the leading diversified exchange group in Europe and the platform for additional strong growth on a European and global scale,\" the two companies said in a joint statement. \u001d  The two also said the combined group will provide \"significant\" benefits for customers and shareholders. \u001d  LSE is offering 4.90 of its own shares for each Borsa Italiana share. Borsa is unlisted and owned mainly by Italian banks. \u001d  The new group is valued at EUR5.78 billion based on Tuesday's closing price, the companies said. \u001d  The merger is expected to be earnings neutral to positive in financial year 2008, and at least 1% earnings accretive the following year, LSE and Borsa said. \u001d  LSE will have seven directors on the enlarged business's board, and Borsa Italiana will have five. \u001d  LSE had previously rejected several takeover offers from rival exchanges, including Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. (NDAQ), pan-European bourse operator Euronext - which has since merged with NYSE Group Inc. to create NYSE Euronext (NYX) - the Nordic exchange OMX (OMX.SK) and Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1.XE). \u001d  LSE and Borsa Italiana announced Wednesday they were discussing a merger. The deal will give the LSE greater weight in any future talks with its longtime suitor, Nasdaq. The New York-based company has twice pursued LSE and owns 30% of its shares. \u001d  Borsa Italiana also said its board met Thursday and Friday to discuss \"other strategic alternatives and indicative proposals,\" without naming them, before accepting LSE's offer. \u001d  NYSE Euronext sent a rival offer to Milan on Thursday, a person familiar with the matter said. \u001d  Last year, Euronext talked to Borsa Italiana about merging but didn't reach an agreement. NYSE Euronext executives have said several times since that they are still open to forging a deal with the Milan-based bourse. \u001d  Borsa Italiana also held talks last year with Deutsche Boerse. Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni told analysts Friday that he remains open to all forms of cooperation, but said there were no large acquisition \"up its sleeve.\" \u001d  Francioni said his is now focused on growing organically and to complete the acquisition of the U.S. options exchange International Securities Exchange (ISE). \u001d  Last month Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi urged banks and other Borsa Italiana owners to clarify the exchange's growth strategy. \u001d  In 2006, Milan's EUR1.14 trillion-worth of total trades placed it fourth among European bourses, behind Euronext, the LSE and Deutsche Boerse. \u001d  An Italian deal would also give the LSE - which is predominantly an equities trading market - greater access to the European bond market. Borsa Italiana has exercised an option to buy NYSE Euronext's stake in their bond-trading joint venture \u001d  LSE also would get a business in derivatives, where it has struggled to get established. \u001d  The NYSE Euronext merger in April kicked off a wave of consolidation in the sector as established stock exchanges face increased competition for business, particularly in Europe where the E.U.'s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID, will from November this year allow the creation of alternative trading systems. \u001d  In November 2006, seven investment banks unveiled plans for a standalone stock trading platform called Project Turquoise. They aim to reduce their securities trading costs. \u001d  Also last year, nine investment banks announced plans for a trade and market data dissemination platform called Project Boat, aiming to reduce the individual banks' costs, which will arise with MiFID's requirements regarding post-trade transparency. \u001d  In May the Nasdaq made an agreed $3.7 billion bid for OMX. \u001d  A conference call on the LSE and Borsa link up is scheduled for 0800 GMT Monday. \u001d  Merrill Lynch (MER) and Lehman Brothers (LEH) advised LSE, while Morgan Stanley (MS) and Mediobanca SpA (MB.MI) advised Borsa Italiana. \b \u001d  Company Web sites: http://www.londonstockexchange.com \u001d                     http://www.borsaitaliana.it \b \u001d  -By Liam Moloney and Sabrina Cohen, Dow Jones Newswires; +39 339 4607390; liam.moloney@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 06:54 ET (10:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3856317eb4060ed13f42f928e21354bb","symR":["AB.LN","PFE","GB00B0P7Y252","US7170811035"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Alliance Boots Pulls Out Of Europe Trade Group - Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T11:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AB.LN","PFE","GB00B0P7Y252","US7170811035"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","RTD","RTS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Alliance Boots PLC (AB.LN) has pulled out of a key European trade association after a row with its competitors over sweeping changes to the Europe's wholesale medicines market, The Times of London reported Saturday, citing a leaked letter from Ornella Barra, the company's wholesale affairs director. \u001d  The letter apparently shows that the company withdrew unilaterally from the European Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers on June 11, the newspaper said. \u001d  According to the Times, the decision followed a series of disagreements with the organization, which represents 600 of Europe's largest drug wholesalers, after Alliance Boots's exclusive distribution deal with Pfizer Inc.

At the same time, MBIA entered into a reinsurance agreement on future business with the same reinsurers, guaranteeing them nearly $300 million in future premiums over a period of years. Subsequently, MBIA insisted that the $170 million in loss payments and the $297 million in future premiums wasn't a disguised loan agreement but two separate, bona fide reinsurance deals. The appeal of that interpretation was clear: If the opposite were true, then MBIA wouldn't have qualified for insurance-accounting treatment. Instead, it would've been required to take a $170 million charge, dinging 1998 earnings by 25% -- a serious blow to its dependable growth-stock image and its then much-ballyhooed claim of being a zero-loss underwriter. By virtue of a decorously long payback period, MBIA could both spread and bury the loss over seven years or more. \u001d  Finally, in early '05, the MBIA story began to unravel as a result of an aggressive joint investigation of the Aherf deal by the New York Attorney General's office, SEC and the U.S. Justice Department. Smoking guns abounded. Among other things, investigators turned up secret side agreements between MBIA and the reinsurers, leaving little doubt as to the true loan nature of the transaction. \b \u001d  MBIA agreed to pay fines and restitution of $75 million without \"admitting or denying any wrongdoing.\" It also was required to hire and pay for an independent consultant to review the company's auditing, compliance and accounting procedures and investigate some other possibly suspect MBIA deals. In a posting on its Website, MBIA says that it doesn't \"anticipate any further enforcement action with respect to any of the matters being reviewed by the Independent Consultant or with respect to any of the other matters that were under investigation.\" \u001d  That may be too optimistic. The consultant, John Siffert, is a tough former federal prosecutor in Manhattan who's now a civil and criminal litigator. And unless he has gone native during his MBIA probe, he should have plenty of grist for his mill in MBIA's handling of an investment it made in the late '90s in a municipal property-tax lien company called Capital Asset Research. \u001d  The Capital Asset contretemps began innocently enough, with MBIA's parent concern purchasing a 46% stake in the lien concern for just $15 million. But by 1998, just two years later, the company had gone haywire and MBIA was in deeply over its head. Just how badly came out at a Capital Asset directors' meeting when Gary Dunton, then MBIA chief investment officer and now chairman, president and CEO, was caught on videotape complaining to a fellow director that MBIA's exposure to Capital Asset's woes had ballooned to something like $500 million. \u001d  Two weeks earlier, the same Dunton had assured analysts on a conference call that MBIA had only about $140 million at risk in Capital Asset and three other municipal finance operations it had lumped into the same unit. \u001d  MBIA, which has not commented on the Capital Asset saga, ultimately suffered around a $300-million loss, but was able to delay recognition of $200 million of that over the next eight years or so by prevailing on its insurance unit to guarantee two securitizations of more than $300 million of Capital Asset's horribly-performing tax lien portfolio. The quality of one of the securitizations was so bad that MBIA whimsically dubbed it \"Caulis Negris,\" an incorrect Latin translation of \"black hole.\" \u001d  Such non-triple-A behavior for a time emboldened Pershing Square's Ackman and fellow shorts to think the unthinkable -- that perhaps the rating agencies like Moody's and S&P might decide to take away MBIA's vaunted credit rating. Such a move would be the proverbial knockout punch effectively putting the company out of business. \u001d  But that is highly unlikely. MBIA is one of the rating agencies' biggest revenue sources. They are also loath to call into question their triple-A ratings on the $635 billion par value of MBIA-guaranteed debt that's currently outstanding. A sudden markdown of that much debt could have calamitous legal and political repercussions for the rating-agency oligopoly. \u001d  So these days, Ackman and the other shorts have more modest ambitions. By constantly sounding the undercapitalization tocsin, they hope to starve the holding company by cutting off the flow of munificent upstream payments from the insurance unit that the parent has used to bolster the stock through fat dividend payments and large stock buybacks. Or even better, the shorts are hoping that a spiral in future claims losses might force the holding company to raise more equity and dilute shareholders. \u001d  If the subprime-mortgage market continues to unravel, the shorts might finally get a measure of solace. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3b9225961c4a31814c0b0964ff8bf6d5","symR":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Eni, Gazprom Sign MoU For Gas Pipeline, Capacity Undecided -2","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T13:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","OIL","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said at a press conference in Rome he expects the pipeline to provide the gas, should the feasibility study approve it, would take three years to build from when it receives all the necessary authorizations. \u001d  The CEO said the feasibility project will take \"months,\" allowing the Italian company to envisage construction beginning in 2008 or the following year. \u001d  Scaroni told reporters he expects the pipeline price-tag to be in the \"multi billion\" U.S. dollar range but wasn't more specific. \u001d  The pipeline would be called \"South Stream,\" the companies said. \u001d  Eni and Gazprom said the capacity will be determined in the feasibility study. \u001d  Gazprom Vice Chairman Alexander Medvedev, who was at the memorandum of understanding signing ceremony in Rome, said the yearly capacity of South Stream could be about 30 billion cubic meters. \u001d  Eni and Gazprom said the pipeline would link Russia and Bulgaria via an underwater line crossing the Black Sea. \u001d  The companies must decide if it then breaks into two lines, one heading north across Hungary to reach Central Europe, while the other across Greece and reaching Southern Italy. \u001d  Eni's CEO said they might decide with the feasibility study to build both lines rather than having to necessarily pick one of the two. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 09:38 ET (13:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3d848c439e79872f37a26ca5a530d40e","symR":["DRI","GHS","HD","PALM","WGO","US2371941053","US4370761029"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) Speaking Of Dividends: Open Palm","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DRI","GHS","HD","PALM","WGO","US2371941053","US4370761029"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","ENT","HIM","MED","PUB","REQ","RES","RTS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Shirley A. Lazo \u001d  On June 4, Palm, maker of handheld computers and the Treo smartphone, announced a strategic relationship and a recapitalization plan to help it sharpen its competitive edge against the likes of Nokia, Research in Motion (which makes BlackBerry devices), Motorola, Samsung and Apple. Palm (ticker: PALM) plans to sell 25% of itself to private-equity firm Elevation Partners for $325 million of a new series of convertible preferred stock and to install Jon Rubenstein, who ran the iPod division of Apple from 2004 to 2006, as executive chairman. Palm also plans to pay its investors a $9 dividend. \u001d  Assuming green lights all around, the recapitalization is slated to close in the third quarter. Palm said the dividend, which would amount to approximately $940 million, is expected to be treated as a return of capital for most shareholders. That said to Robert Willens, a Lehman Brothers managing director and tax-accounting expert, that Palm \"has no accumulated earnings and profits and expects to have no earnings and profits for 2007, the taxable year in which the distribution will be made.\" Elevation's contribution cannot be counted. (\"Earnings and profits\" is a tax-accounting concept designed to measure a corporation's dividend-paying capacity.) However, in the unlikely event that Palm generates at least $940 million of E&P this year, the entire distribution would instead be dividend income. \u001d  As it's more likely to be a return of capital, Willens explains that the dividend will not be included in the recipient's gross income but will instead be applied against, and reduce dollar for dollar, the basis (cost) of the stock on which the distribution is made. If the return of capital is in excess of that cost, the excess will be treated as a \"gain from the sale or exchange of property\" and therefore will be a capital gain. \u001d  Moreover, \"it is generally conceded that the gain or loss on the return-of-capital distribution must be computed on a share-by-share basis.\" Accordingly, a shareholder with a combination of low-basis and higher basis blocks of Palm stock will have to recognize a gain on the portion of the distribution allocated to low-cost blocks even though the basis of the higher-cost blocks will not have been fully recovered. \u001d  As for dividend stripping, whereby short-term capital gains, taxed at 35%, are converted into qualified dividend income, taxed at 15%, forget about it. According to Willens, \"a successful dividend strip can only arise where the distribution received is classified, in the first instance, as dividend income.\" \u001d  Noteworthy among last week's dividend announcements, Home Depot (HD) plans to buy back up to another $22.5 billion worth of its shares. That gives its current program a value of $40 billion, which shareholders hope will rev up the company's lackluster stock price. The world's No. 1 home-improvement retailer already has spent $16.5 billion on repurchases. It'll fund the buyback by selling its construction-supply business for $10.3 billion and by issuing $12 billion of senior unsecured notes. Although shareholder friendly, the action, in the face of the housing slowdown, prompted Standard & Poor's to place Home Depot's debt ratings on negative watch and Fitch Ratings to make downgrades. Home Depot pays a quarterly dividend of 22.5 cents a share and yields 2.26%. \u001d  GateHouse Media (GHS), one of the largest publishers of locally based print and online media across 20 states, hiked its quarterly common dividend for the second time this year, to 40 cents a share from 37 cents (up in March from 24 cents), for an 8.46% yield. \u001d  Darden Restaurants (DRI), the world's largest casual-dining company (the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains are among its eateries), will now pay a quarterly dividend on its common of 18 cents a share, or 72 cents annually, versus a semiannual payout of 23 cents, or 46 cents a year. That's a 56.5% increase. Yield: 1.66%. Darden has spent $2.62 billion on stock buybacks since December 1995. \u001d  Winnebago Industries (WGO), one of the nation's biggest manufacturers of motor homes, boosted its quarterly payout to 12 cents a share from a dime and announced a new $60 million stock buyback. Since year- end 1997, the company has repurchased 24.4 million shares for some $356.8 million. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3f5ae60bdbe7b97e9ece34af26ba98fc","symR":["ARB","CCU"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(6/23) Clear Channel Picks Arbitron's Radio-Ratings System","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ARB","CCU"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","BRD","MED","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Shira Ovide \u001d  In a major win for Arbitron Inc., Clear Channel Communications Inc. has agreed to a broad deal to use Arbitron's new electronic radio-ratings system, according to a person familiar with the deal. \u001d  The radio-station chain is expected to sign a multiyear agreement to subscribe to Arbitron's \"portable people meter\" -- or PPM -- system to measure radio audience.

Williams \u001d  As Ingersoll-Rand slims down, interest in its stock is gaining some heft. \u001d  The Bermuda-based company's announcement in May that it could sell its cyclical Bobcat and construction-related operations and buy back shares sparked the stock (ticker: IR) to a high of 56 by last week. The stock has jumped 43% this year, easily outpacing the overall market and the machinery group. Speculation that Ingersoll-Rand itself could be bought is also fueling the rally. \u001d  Despite the run-up, Ingersoll remains a compelling play on industrial production and spirited spending on infrastructure projects across the globe. Ingersoll will use its copious cash flow to buy back stock, boosting earnings per share, and the likely sale of Bobcat should make the company a more consistent performer. \u001d  Furthermore, there's the potential that Ingersoll, free of the slumping Bobcat unit, could be snapped up by a private-equity company for at least 60 a share, according to some analysts. \u001d  Ingersoll's seven-year transformation into a diversified industrial outfit from a cyclical heavy-equipment maker may only now be winning fans, but Barron's highlighted the promise of the makeover two years ago (\"Ingersoll-Rand: New and Improved,\" Aug. 1, 2005). The stock has since delivered a 47% return. \u001d  We believe the full benefits of the strategy have yet to be realized. So does Peter Bates, an industrials analyst with T. Rowe Price. \"Stay in the stock,\" he advises. \"If they stick to the game plan, it's still a good story.\" \u001d  One of the main tenets of that plan has been a muscular stock-repurchase program. After buying back $330 million worth of its shares under an authorization announced in December, management said last month that it would double the program to $4 billion. \"Next year, they could have 40% of the company bought out internally,\" says Bates, who thinks the buyback could help boost earnings to about $5 a share in '09. \u001d  Affixing a price-to-earnings multiple of 13, he values Ingersoll-Rand at 65 a share, 16% higher than the current price. The Street is looking for Ingersoll to earn $3.51 a share this year and $3.95 in 2008. \u001d  Selling Bobcat would go a long way toward hitting those estimates; a divestiture could net $3.2 billion to $5 billion, say analysts. Ingersoll management wasn't available to comment, but in May the company said it was seeking \"strategic alternatives\" for the operation, including a sale or spinoff. Bear Stearns analyst Ann Duignan says a sale of Bobcat for $3.2 billion would generate $11 a share in cash, making the company an \"attractive takeover candidate.\" \u001d  Even in the absence of a takeover, Ingersoll still holds appeal, say bulls. The Bobcat sale would solidify its transformation into a true diversified giant, worthy of the higher multiple typically afforded companies such as Illinois Tool Works (ITW). Bobcat, which makes construction equipment, has been hurt by the slumping housing market. Possible suitors: Volvo, Terex (TEX) and Deere (DE). \u001d  The \"new\" Ingersoll will be focused on refrigeration, security and industrial technologies, and be well-positioned to weather economic downturns, says T. Rowe's Bates. He thinks only 10%-15% of Ingersoll's earnings would \"fall out of bed\" in a recession. \u001d  Some investors worry that the company might make a big, costly acquisition. But the moves it has made so far have boosted shareholder value. Paying 16 times this year's earnings isn't too much to bet that it continues to do so. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4c352b3876a1711fa187a1925a20879b","symR":["CRM","ORCL","US68389X1054"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) A Tough Sell","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CRM","ORCL","US68389X1054"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Mark Veverka \u001d  Salesforce.com is the fastest-growing business-software company in the world, not to mention one hot stock. Yet the on-demand darling may have bitten off more than it can chew by taking on Oracle -- the biggest of the business-software bunch. \u001d  When Oracle reports earnings early this week, it's expected to disclose a head-to-head contract win or two over Salesforce (ticker: CRM) for large corporate customers. In effect, Oracle will be giving notice to its feisty rival-- which has less than 5% of Oracle's $14 billion in annual sales -- that it's ready to compete in selling robust on-demand customer-relations management software to top enterprise customers, says Cowen analyst Peter Goldmacher. \u001d  \"Oracle is establishing a beachhead within Salesforce.com's high-end installed-customer base,\" says Goldmacher, who downgraded Salesforce to Neutral in April. He rates Oracle (ORCL) a Buy. Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff told Barron's he didn't know of any big Oracle wins, but he wouldn't rule them out. Oracle wouldn't comment. \u001d  Salesforce shareholders should also take note. The stock has risen 88% in the past 52 weeks and has tripled since its initial public offering in June 2004. As the market digests more information about the challenge that Salesforce now faces, Goldmacher thinks the stock, a popular momentum play, could drop as much as 10%. \u001d  Goldmacher argues that the shares, trading at 45 times free cash flow, are pricey even taking into account the company's phenomenal growth. Salesforce's free cash flow has a compound annual growth rate of 31%, suggesting that the stock has outrun underlying growth. Another red flag: CEO Benioff has unloaded about 38% of his shares in the past two years. \u001d  Until 18 months ago, eight-year-old Salesforce rarely competed with Oracle, focusing on small and medium-sized businesses. But with great fanfare, Salesforce entered the enterprise market with a bang by landing deals with Cisco Systems, Dell, ADP and others. \u001d  By going after big corporate customers, Benioff also was testing his former boss, Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison, who isn't one to back down from a fight. \u001d  Benioff has revolutionized business software, especially sales-automation applications, by selling it as a computer service via the Internet rather than as software installed on a company's hardware. \u001d  On-demand software is expected to grow 20% to 25% annually over the next five years, compared with a 9%-to-12% rate for traditional enterprise software, says Chicago's William Blair & Co. Salesforce's system has been readily accepted by mom-and-pops because it's affordable and easy to deploy and use. But large companies have been reluctant clients because Salesforce's product sacrifices the ability to integrate and customize systems, Goldmacher explains. There's demand for both kinds of software, and  many  big customers want both, which should help Oracle defend its turf, Goldmacher says. \u001d  Through its 2006 acquisition of Siebel Systems, which practically invented customer-relationship software, Oracle became the dominant provider to large customers. But Siebel's pre-Oracle on-demand products delivered over the Internet fell short, giving Salesforce a big opening. \b \u001d  Oracle has been working hard in the past 18 months to develop an improved offering: Oracle CRM On Demand. Goldmacher says the completed application is up and running in an Oracle data center and is being sold. He predicts Siebel users will give it a try because it complements their previous investments in Siebel applications, integrates easily and doesn't come from a new vendor. \u001d  Price is another potential pitfall for Salesforce. Goldmacher contends that Salesforce, which already has a high cost of sales, is heavily discounting its deals to enterprise customers. Salesforce charges, on average, about $75 a month per user for its core small-business customers but fetches as little as $25 a month per user for enterprise customers, Goldmacher says. Benioff would not disclose average prices per customer. \u001d  The trouble is that Salesforce has been buying growth with little added profit. Sales soared 60% to $554.8 million in fiscal 2007 (ended Jan. 31), but margins grew only 1%, Goldmacher says. More discounted enterprise deals would pressure margins further, the analyst says. \u001d  Yet if Salesforce intends to compete for big corporate customers, it will need to continue to slash prices. If Salesforce were to get anything close to its average-price-per customer for a big client like Merrill Lynch with 25,000 users, the brokerage's price would be $20 million a year or so. \"For that kind of money, Oracle would sell you all of the [CRM] software it has, and Larry [Ellison] would come over and install it himself,\" Goldmacher argues. \u001d  Between Oracle's revamped on-demand service, its advantage in bundling software for big customers and Salesforce's heavy discounting, Goldmacher thinks that picking a fight with Oracle and Ellison was a mistake: \"Their enterprise strategy is fatally flawed,\" he says. \u001d  Benioff disagrees. Pointing to the quality of his enterprise-CRM customers like Cisco, he argues that seeking enterprise business was a wise move. To suggest otherwise is \"insanity,\" he says. \"Enterprise is not a zero-sum game; you don't have to win every deal,\" Benioff says. \u001d  Aside from his other challenges, Microsoft is expected to enter the on-demand business-software market in late summer, with a new CRM service that's code-named Titan, which will compete directly against Salesforce. \u001d  After having the small-business market mostly to itself, Salesforce will be battling Oracle on one front and Microsoft on another. That isn't easy. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"500f951bb7ff36d7639e706019d1d30a","symR":["BK","IFIN","MEL","STT"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) Running Its Own Boston Marathon","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BK","IFIN","MEL","STT"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","BNK","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Jack Willoughby \u001d  You'd think a guy running a business catering to the world's biggest institutional investors would coddle his shareholders a little more. But in February, State Street CEO Ronald Logue went ahead with the $4.5 billion stock-based acquisition of smaller Boston rival Investors Financial Services knowing that it would snatch about 14 cents a share from this year's earnings. The decision cut short an extended rise in the banking company's stock as investors bolted: The sharesfell 13% in the weeks after the news. Wall Street didn't like the 38% premium Logue was paying for a second-tier custody outfit that would reduce State Street's near-term performance. \u001d  Several months later, the 61-year old Boston native hasn't changed his longer-term view of the deal's value, which he anticipates will add 10 cents a share to earnings by 2009. \"We believe that it will be revenue growth that will separate the men from the boys in our business,\" he tells Barron's. \"It's all about keeping customers and finding ways to do more business.\" Logue confidently projects that State Street (ticker: STT) will retain 90% of Investors Financial's (IFIN) customers. \u001d  Such a well-informed streak of independence is refreshing in a CEO, even if it doesn't always make him popular.  \"Shareholders are furious with the company, believing they don't care about the short term and the dilution,\" says Richard Bove, an analyst at broker Punk Ziegel. \"They don't. The acquisition has only enhanced their superb international position.\" \u001d  The investor unhappiness has only enhanced the value in the shares. Although the price has rebounded, it's still flat for the year, underperforming the S&P 500's 7% gain. The shares are  trading at a multiple of 16 times 2008 earnings projections, well below their typical 20 times forward estimates. \u001d  \"The lower multiple certainly creates a buying opportunity,\" says Bove, who's got an $85 target on the stock, more than 20% above last week's level. \b \u001d  The dust-up over IFIN aside, State Street has a lot going for it these days. Its servicing unit, which will absorb IFIN and accounts for 80% of revenues, provides everything from accounting to securities lending to foreign-exchange research to custody and administration services for major institutions like Axa Financial, the California Public Employees Retirement System, Pimco and Putnam. As a result, its shares are a play on the global expansion of the capital markets, the proliferation of hedge funds and the outsourcing of non-core financial services. State Street's high-margin asset-management group, which kicks in 20% of revenues, is the biggest money manager in the world, overseeing the second biggest index-fund complex along with thriving active money-management and ETF operations. \u001d  \"Our secret weapon is focus,\" says Logue, who leads a bank-holding company that doesn't offer much in the way of traditional banking services. \"This is all we do. I have no commercial banker, no branch banker coming through that door asking me for money. All the investment goes into the business. . . . Virtually all the other organizations have competing influences for investment. We only do two businesses: asset management and asset servicing.\" \u001d  That makes it a far different sort of bank than, say, Citigroup (C), which has struggled to get its multi-faceted global financial supermarket in synch. \u001d  The model has worked well, allowing State Street to exceed its objectives. It targets annual growth in operating earnings per share of between 8% and 10%, top-line revenue expansion of 16% to 18% and return on equity of between 12% and 15%. Last year EPS rose 16%, revenue gained 15% and return on equity came to 17%. Revenue totaled $6.3 billion in 2006, with earnings of $1.1 billion. The consensus calls for $7.3 billion in 2007 revenues and $1.3 billion in profits, gains of 16% and 18%, respectively.  The company's shares have risen 75% in the last four years. \u001d  At its core, State Street is a technology provider with deep, longstanding relationships at major financial institutions. In fact, it's sometimes been criticized for spending too much -- about 22% of expenses in 2006 -- on more powerful computer systems. But that has allowed it to build a superior global platform that handles more and more transactions. Fully 15% of the world's securities trades -- cleared in shorter and shorter time periods -- go through State Street's computer networks. \u001d  \"Assets under custody no longer means what it once did,\" says Logue, who's credited with unifying State Street's executive team since taking the top spot in 2004 after a bout of nasty corporate infighting. \"Global management has become so complex that the real benchmark of success comes from the amount of revenue you can draw from each client.\" \u001d  State Street is doing what it can to bombard them with every sort of record- and score-keeping service, usually in competition with its main custody rivals, the soon-to-merge Bank of New York (BK) and Mellon Financial (MEL) \u001d  Money-management arm State Street Global Advisors has seen its index operations grow to $714 billion today as investors have wearied of paying higher fees for mediocre returns from actively-managed funds. SSGA has also ridden the wave of enthusiasm for exchange-traded funds by launching 83 of them, including the world's first and still biggest, the Spider, traded on the American Stock Exchange. In all it now runs $115 billion in ETF assets. Although known as an indexer, SSGA has also built a formidable active-management group that now oversees $188 billion in assets, including $4.5 billion in hedge funds. \u001d  While much smaller in revenue, asset management's healthy pretax margins of 35% dwarf servicing's 26%. As always, State Street stands ready to exploit the next professional money-management trend. \b \u001d  But investor worries about the IFIN deal, expected to close next month, have obscured some of this promise. Management is convinced the transaction fits its strategy of cross-selling many products to a core-client base that it's trying to expand. \u001d  \"Investors Financial serves 12 of the top 25 global investment managers, who will now have access to State Street's continuous global asset management and custody accounting as well as foreign exchange, securities lending and other ancillary services,\" says Jay Hooley, vice chairman and head of global securities servicing. \u001d  State Street, which has been one of the leading consolidators in the custody market, expects to squeeze as much as a 50% reduction in expenses from IFIN while raising revenues by offering the new clients its full array of services. \u001d  Reeling in its Boston neighbor isn't expected to be a big problem. A decade ago, State Street bought the $1.9 trillion asset- servicing arm of Deutsche Bank: It rationalized the German bank's eight legacy systems to get a 35% cost savings, while keeping almost 90% of customers. \u001d  \"We're using the same blueprint complete with the same people,\" Logue explains. \"You make decisions quickly so the customers know what's happening and retain as many customer-facing people from the acquired entity as possible.\" \u001d  Once complete, the deal will give State Street added heft in mutual-fund custody and will deliver more administration and servicing clients within the fast-growing hedge-fund world. IFIN also has a solid constituency among private-equity funds, handling about $60 billion in assets. \u001d  Perhaps most important, the acquisition helps realize State Street's desire to expand internationally, where it sees growth rates nearly double those of the U.S. over the next few years. IFIN had $35 billion among offshore funds. \u001d  There is one potential hitch: Asset-management rival Barclays Financial is a big IFIN custody customer that State Street will have to figure out how to retain. \b \u001d  Obviously, State Street's fortunes are closely tied to the health of the world's capital markets. If transaction volumes fall, State Street's revenues and profits fall, too, though not as much as participants with more direct market exposure. \u001d  State Street is otherwise in an excellent spot to benefit if, as expected, the world's capital markets expand over time and global money flows become more interconnected. It has a deep reservoir of contacts to draw upon. A remarkable 80% of the firm's new revenue comes from existing customers; its 25 top customers have been clients for an average of 19 years and typically use 15 products. \u001d  Even if Wall Street doesn't always agree with his moves, Logue plans to keep pushing State Street to be a survivor. \"At the end of the day, there are only going to be two or three of us left\" in the custody-bank business, says Logue. \"My belief is that large commercial universal banks will not be in that business. It's only a small portion of their overall activity. And it requires so much focus.\" And focus, long term, is what he and State Street are good at. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5032dc89da7b8fb1ec8d1bc5e4310e28","symR":["IGPK"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Integrated Parking Solutions, Inc.

But the purchase actually carries some serious risks. \u001d  It can't be taken for granted that Luxottica, which up to now has focused its retailing efforts on fashion brands, can translate its expertise to a sports brand. \u001d  The trend for luxury-goods manufacturers to expand their portfolios to include sports brands was highlighted by PPR's (ticker: PP.France) recent takeover of Puma. But it's too early to say that what looks good in theory will work in practice. \u001d  Another worry for Luxottica (LUX.Italy) is that its heavy exposure to the North American retail market -- it operates the LenCrafters and Pearle Vision retail chains -- won't be remedied by the acquisition of U.S.-based Oakley (OO). \u001d  Over 80% of Luxottica's retail outlets are already in the States and Canada, which provide a substantial amount of its revenue. Adding Oakley's existing retail operation will do nothing to reduce this imbalance and minimize the risk. Oakley, with headquarters in Foothill Ranch, Calif., is similarly dependent on the North American market. \u001d  Indeed, putting more eggs in one geographical basket looks particularly odd because Luxottica has stated that it's looking for takeover targets worldwide. As a global organization with an appetite for acquisitions, Luxottica would do well to look toward other locations for future purchases, ones that will provide better opportunities for growth. \u001d  Yet the incorporation of Oakley's operations into Luxottica's seems to make enough financial sense that investors have immediately warmed to the deal, based on the cost savings from the companies' overlap as sunglass makers. Luxottica's stock was up 3.8% for the week, to 27.82 euros a share. \u001d  The proposed savings over three years are equivalent to $932 million in today's money. This is higher than the $663 million premium paid for the company. \u001d  On top of that, the difference in the profit margins of the two companies -- 9.4% for Luxottica and 5.9% for Oakley -- suggests that there's ample room for Luxottica to squeeze out better returns from its acquisition. \u001d  That said, the jury is surely out on whether Luxottica has the ability to manage the Oakley brand better than its current management has done. \u001d  Luxottica is paying a fairly full price for Oakley -- nearly 15 times estimated 2007 earnings, compared with the 12 multiple on PPR's purchase of Puma. But if Luxottica does figure out how to sell into the sports sector more effectively than Oakley has, the deal will make sound sense. \b \u001d  Airbus may have grabbed the headlines at this year's Paris Air Show, but it's worth noting the strong performance of Rolls-Royce (RR.U.K.). The British company secured civil- and military-engine deals worth more than $15 billion at catalog prices, helped in particular by its models for new wide-bodied passenger aircraft. \u001d  It has benefitted from being the sole current supplier of engines on the new A350 XWB, for which Airbus secured 141 firm orders last week. Rolls-Royce is also one of two suppliers for Boeing's (BA) new fuel-efficient 787, which is due to make its first flight this year, and for Airbus' long-delayed A380 double-decker. \u001d  While engine sales are swelling the order book, it's over the long term that shareholders will see the real benefits. Engine makers typically achieve better profit margins on spares and maintenance than on new sales. These orders therefore are crucial for the long-term fortunes of the company. \u001d  Rolls-Royce has been pushing more and more customers into its \"TotalCare\" package, which helps airlines remove uncertainties over their engine-servicing costs. Airlines pay an agreed-upon rate for each flying hour in return for 24-hour support. The company now generates some 59% of its commercial aerospace engine revenue from such after-market activities. \u001d  At the end of 2006, Rolls-Royce had some 12,000 engines operating around the world and expects this to hit about 15,500 by 2010 -- some three years before the A350 is due to enter service. \u001d  A major hole in Rolls-Royce's portfolio is that it doesn't supply engines for Boeing's strong-selling single-aisle 737. However, Rolls-Royce's exposure to the new wide-bodied jet programs should stand it in good stead when it looks to supply engines for both Boeing and Airbus' next generation of single-aisle planes, due around 2015 at the earliest. \u001d  The long-term outlook for the maintenance business should also reassure investors. Rolls' stock, already up 36% in the past 12 months, to 46 British pounds, may well continue its ascent. \u001d  --- \u001d  Sean Walters and Rod Stone are contributors to The Skeptic, a Dow Jones Newswires column on which this European Trader is based. \u001d  --- \b                      DOW JONES GLOBAL INDEXES \b \bRegion/ \bCountry \b   DJ Global           DJ Global           DJ Global     Point \b    Indexes,            Indexes,            Indexes,      Chg.    % Chg. \b Local Curr.

(BA) is optimistic that the U.S. Army's $162 billion Future Combat Systems program will escape devastating cuts in next year's defense budget. \u001d  The House of Representatives is weighing a proposal to cut $867 million from the Army's 2008 request. The move would effectively scrap development on the manned ground vehicles at the heart of the Boeing-led project, which also is developing a range of computer networks, communications systems and battlefield drones. \u001d  But the Senate hasn't embraced cuts on any similar scale, and a proposal this year would even add money to the FCS request. Also, Army support for the program hasn't wavered despite changes in its its civilian and military leadership. \u001d  As a result, Boeing is optimistic that the vehicles will stay in the development plan, said Roger Krone, president of Boeing's networks and space systems unit, in an interview at the Paris Air Show. He said concern for troops will convince lawmakers to keep ground vehicles in the plan, despite pressure to fund other programs and also keep a close eye on Boeing as lead systems integrator. \u001d  If the manned ground vehicles get cut, \"the soldiers who are out on patrol will be going around in vehicles that were designed 30 and 40 years ago,\" Krone said. \u001d  \"If we don't move forward with the manned ground vehicles, that's exactly where the Army will be, and that is why in discussions that I have been party to with the House, they've said we're not going to cut the manned ground vehicle,\" Krone said. \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; Rebecca.Christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 16:56 ET (20:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"71ab4630d8cee430faa879ac20477070","symR":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BBV","BBVA.MC","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113211835","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"2nd UPDATE: Santander Chief Sees 07 Pft Up 21%, Highest Ever","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T11:59:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BBV","BBVA.MC","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113211835","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XB20","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XIBEX","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Updates item from 1019 GMT with details on the change of the bank's official name.) \b \u001d  By Christopher Bjork \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  SANTANDER, Spain (Dow Jones)--Spain's Santander Central Hispano SA (STD) expects ordinary net profit to grow 21% this year, Chairman Emilio Botin said Saturday during the bank's annual general meeting. \u001d  Botin told shareholders that his bank, Spain's largest by assets, is on its way to a record result in 2007. He said he expects Santander to reach a 2007 net profit - excluding extraordinary gains - of more than EUR8 billion, compared with EUR6.58 billion in the same period last year. \u001d  \"Santander is well positioned to continue to grow more than its competitors,\" the 73-year-old Santander chief said. \u001d  \"We have an outstanding position today because we have combined a strategy of organic, sustainable and recurrent growth with corporate transactions throughout our history.\" \u001d  Botin said Santander will call an extraordinary general meeting for July 27 to ask shareholders to approve a EUR9 billion equity issue as part of its plan to buy about a third of ABN Amro Holding NV (ABN). \u001d  Santander is part of a trio of European banks trying to take over and split the Dutch bank between them, and has said it is willing to pay EUR19.9 billion in cash and shares for ABN's Brazilian and Italian units. \u001d  \"For Santander, there are very clear advantages to this transaction which, if it occurs, will enable us to buy some very interesting assets,\" he added. \u001d  A successful bid for the ABN Amro units would give Santander a solid foothold in Italy, and give it control of the third-largest banking network in Brazil. \u001d  The bidding group, which includes Santander's long-time business partner Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN)and Fortis NV (FORSY), has outlined a EUR71.1 billion ($96 billion) offer for ABN Amro. \u001d  The proposed offer, the biggest ever in the banking industry, is competing with a friendly, lower, bid for the Dutch bank made by Barclays PLC (BCS). \u001d  At Saturday's meeting, held in its northern Spanish home city of Santander, Botin said he was still optimistic about global economic conditions. \u001d  \"We believe that the boom has not yet come to an end,\" Botin said. \"We will have somewhat higher interest rates, markets may become more volatile and growth may slow in some economies. but global expansion, already in its longest phase in 35 years, is built on a very broad base.\" \u001d   Santander, with a market capitalization of slightly more than EUR85 billion, is the euro zone's largest bank by market value. It also controls the largest banking franchise in Latin America and a big U.K. lender. \u001d  On Spain, Botin said the red-hot housing market had begun a healthy cooling process. \"A slowing of growth has begun, which is positive, good even.\" \u001d  Like its rival Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBV), Santander is profiting from the resurgent economies in Latin America, which are in their fourth consecutive year of balanced growth. Exposure to these markets has helped make Santander and BBVA two of Europe's fastest-growing banks. \u001d  Botin said he was optimistic about the region's outlook for the rest of the year. \u001d  After a strong share performance last year, when the stock rose 27%, Santander shares are down around 1% so far this year, while the the Spanish benchmark index IBEX-35 is up about 5%. Uncertainty related to the offer for ABN Amro is weighing on the share price, analysts say. \u001d  Botin said that he was optimistic about the stock in the medium term. \"Remember what happened with Abbey: the market initially punished us, but then went on to reward our strategy,\" Botin said, referring to Santander's 2004 purchase of U.K. mortgage lender Abbey National. \u001d  Ibersecurities analyst Mario Lodos, who has a buy rating on the stock, said that the 2007 target looked ambitious. \u001d  \"I think it's doable, but many investors are gonna be skeptical that they can reach such a figure, which would be the highest in the euro zone,\" Lodos said. \u001d  Botin added that Santander will pay on August 1 a first dividend on 2007 results of EUR0.12294, 15% higher than its first dividend in 2006. \u001d  In the first quarter, Santander posted a 21% rise in net profit to EUR1.9 billion, backed by strong growth at its main businesses in Latin America, Spain and the U.K. \u001d  During Saturday's AGM, shareholders also voted in favor of changing the bank's official name to Banco Santander SA. \u001d  The bank, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, is unifying its brand around the world, gradually phasing out the names of the banks it has bought in the past and focusing on the Santander brand. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.santander.com \b \u001d  -By Christopher Bjork, Dow Jones Newswires, +34 91 395 81 23, christopher.bjork@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 07:59 ET (11:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"73a0db7da3d3189d1e82a1d45b32b4d6","symR":["THALK.IS","TSKB.IS","TRATSKBW91N0","TRETHAL00019"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Turkey's TSKB,Halkbank Secure EUR200M Loans From World Bk-IHA","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T10:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["THALK.IS","TSKB.IS","TRATSKBW91N0","TRETHAL00019"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  ANKARA (Dow Jones)--The Turkish Treasury said late Friday that Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S.

He said all the right things, but you sensed it was a tad disingenuous, making one wonder what was really rattling through his head. \u001d  Sticking to his pre-game script, the CEO went on to say that the iPhone's emphasis on music, video and the Web would \"energize\" the entire business, including the video, music and data services offered by Verizon (VZ). \"I am actually hoping that the Apple iPhone will do reasonably well,\" he told reporters. \u001d  No matter how many kisses he tossed AT&T's (T) way, the reporters would not let him off the hook. Finally, Seidenberg let his guard down, saying that Verizon has been the incumbent wireless champion for 10 or so years through organic growth (as opposed to AT&T's more acquisitive expansion). \"We think that we're the premier wireless carrier,\" Seidenberg declared. \u001d  Then, sounding more like a coach who finished first in the regular season standings but wasn't getting any respect, he said: \"I think the burden is on them to prove that the market will change\" before Verizon needs to do anything dramatic -- such as introduce a so-called iPhone killer that can compete with the much-hyped handset. \u001d  Verizon has been blazing its own trail in mobile music and video through its V Cast services and Chocolate multi-media phones made by Korea's LG Electronics (066570.Korea), which are expected to get a refreshed design in July. The company's recently launched V Cast mobile video services, which are based on Qualcomm's (QCOM) MediaFLo technology, will be available in 40 cities by July and 120 markets by the end of the year. \u001d  In the meantime, the Verizon CEO seems to think it's time for AT&T and Apple to stop the pre-game chatter and prove what they can do on the field. Says Seidenberg: \"You've got to buy your ticket and show up for the game.\" \b \u001d  The watchword of the Chicago confab was \"convergence.\" The so-called triple-play packages offered by cable companies and traditional phone carriers, which often bundle phone, television and broadband services -- are likely to become quadruple plays with the inclusion of wireless services. \u001d  The addition of wireless coupled with the anticipated explosion in mobile video, games and Web surfing is going to hasten demand for broadband bandwidth. Cisco Systems' Chief Executive John Chambers couldn't be happier that Internet network capacity will probably need to grow 300% to 500% a year to keep pace. Cisco (CSCO) supplies the plumbing fixtures of the pipeline, such as routers and switches. Even that may not be enough for Chambers, who says: \"We need to make the definition of broadband broader.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  e-mail: mark.veverka@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"802a49f07f81b69966ec38d8c47b0c43","symR":["GSPBEX.RS","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gazprom Vice Chmn Says EU Gas Unbundling Is 'Painful' Issue","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T16:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GSPBEX.RS","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  ROME (Dow Jones)--Alexander Medvedev, vice chairman of Russia's OAO Gazprom (GSPBEX.RS), said Saturday a European Union proposal to split the production and distribution infrastructure of gas companies is a \"painful\" issue, indicating the company's strong opposition to it. \u001d  This proposal \"is in conflict with rules of the market economy,\" said Medvedev, adding that these allow producers of end-products to sell them to consumers. \u001d  The Gazprom executive was speaking at a press conference in Rome for the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Eni SpA (E) on the possibility of the two companies building a new pipeline called \"South Stream\" to bring Russian gas to the E.U. \u001d  Medvedev said the E.U. proposal is also facing the opposition of some member states.

Alternatively, co-founder and returning CEO Jerry Yang could reinvigorate the Internet service provider. \"Any way you look at it, the stock goes up from here,\" says Larry Haverty of Gabelli Global Multimedia. \"It is very good value.\" \u001d  Trading at 27.60, Yahoo! shares are modestly below the 29 where they stood when we presented a bullish picture last year (\"Yahoo!'s Edge,\") May 22, 2006). We argued that interest in Google had led investors to overlook a lot of Yahoo!'s strengths, including the facts that it has the biggest audience on the Web, is the leader in Internet display ads and generates a ton of cash. \u001d  What we didn't know at the time was how far behind Yahoo! was in Project Panama, its effort to upgrade its search engine, to boost profitability and better compete with Google. \u001d  The long delay ultimately allowed Google to run away with market share. In May, Google accounted for 56.3% of all Internet searches, compared with 21.5% for Yahoo! Only late in the first quarter of this year did Yahoo! finally launch the much-anticipated search upgrade. \u001d  The shares climbed as high as $33.74 after our story, then slumped to a low of $22.65, as buoyant expectations gave way to bitter disappointment time and again. Indeed, overshadowed by the announcement that Semel would step down as CEO (he remains non-executive chairman) was Yahoo!'s warning that second-quarter results would fall short of forecasts. The company said that improvements in search-advertising would be offset by a slowdown in display advertising and weakness in its affiliate network. \u001d  Certainly, the company is more vulnerable. If it can't find its footing, there's no doubt in some investors' minds that it will be sold outright to a Microsoft (MSFT) or News Corp. (NWS.A). Microsoft and Yahoo! have held informal discussions in the past and News Corp. has been said to be contemplating a swap of its MySpace social networking unit for a 25% stake in Yahoo! There's also been talk of a bid by Yahoo! and a member of its board, Ron Burkle and his holding company, Yucaipa, for Dow Jones (DJ), publisher of Barron's, but no such bid has emerged and most observers are skeptical. \u001d  Some investors would like to see a private-equity style deal in which Yahoo! sells strategic assets and strips itself down to its core business of providing niche Websites for everything from autos to entertainment to sports. One hedge-fund investor holding Yahoo! shares envisions a deal -- similar to Google's pact with MySpace -- in which the company outsources its search function to Google for $10 billion to $15 billion. That would save Yahoo! hundreds of millions in operating and capital expenses. Then, this investor says, it could sell Yahoo! Japan for roughly $7 billion. Yahoo! would then be free to focus on its business of building the best niche destination sites, potentially buying Website companies like Bankrate, Monster Worldwide, WebMd and Expedia. \u001d  Others, however, insist that the best way to maximize shareholder value is an outright sale. Haverty sees Yahoo! shares fetching in the upper 30s in a sale. \u001d  Right now, based on 2009 estimated cash flow, Yahoo! trades at only a slight premium to newspaper companies. Even with all the company's troubles, that just doesn't make sense. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8297e6e9f70816008db7f51a8dcd9f5e","symR":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","ANBB","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Santander Equity Issue Will Fund ABN Amro Buy","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T09:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","ANBB","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XB20","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XIBEX","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 05:09 ET (09:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"852d47e0dc98af5a8d79c6ea28fcd616","symR":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Eni, Gazprom To Build Gas Pipeline Called \"South Stream\"","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T11:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","OIL","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 07:52 ET (11:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"866fd980693ad234b389ca9470fdb78b","symR":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Eni CEO Says South Stream Capacity Still Not Decided","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T12:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","OIL","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 08:11 ET (12:11 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"88c54dbe1b14996e53dd3e2a0f73eea4","symR":["GOOG"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Google Seeks Govt Support In Fighting Internet Censorship","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T11:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GOOG"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  WASHINGTON (AP)--Once relatively indifferent to government affairs, Google Inc. (GOOG) is seeking help inside the Beltway to fight the rise of Web censorship worldwide. \u001d  The online search giant is taking a novel approach to the problem by asking U.S. trade officials to treat Internet restrictions as international trade barriers, similar to other hurdles to global commerce, such as tariffs. \u001d  Google sees the dramatic increase in government Net censorship, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, as a potential threat to its advertising-driven business model, and wants government officials to consider the issue in economic, rather than just political, terms. \u001d  \"It's fair to say that censorship is the No. 1 barrier to trade that we face,\" said Andrew McLaughlin, Google's director of public policy and government affairs. A Google spokesman said Monday that McLaughlin has met with officials from the U.S. Trade Representative's office several times this year to discuss the issue. \u001d  \"If censorship regimes create barriers to trade in violation of international trade rules, the USTR would get involved,\" USTR spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel said. She added though that human rights issues, such as censorship, typically falls under the purview of the State Department. \u001d  While human rights activists are pleased with Google's efforts to fight censorship, they harshly criticized the company early last year for agreeing to censor its Web site in China, which has the second-largest number of Internet users in the world. \u001d  The company defends its actions, saying the Chinese government made it a condition of allowing Chinese users access to Google Web pages. China has an Internet firewall that slows or disrupts Chinese users from accessing foreign uncensored Web sites. \u001d  Censorship online has risen dramatically the past five years, belying the hype of the late 1990s, which portrayed the Internet as largely impervious to government interference. \u001d  A study released last month by the OpenNet Initiative found that 25 of 41 countries surveyed engage in Internet censorship. That's a dramatic increase from the two or three countries guilty of the practice in 2002, says John Palfrey, executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School, who helped prepare the report. \u001d  China, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, India, Singapore and Thailand, among others, are increasingly blocking or filtering Web pages, Palfrey says. \u001d  Governments \"are having more success than the more idealistic of us thought,\" acknowledges Danny O'Brien, international outreach coordinator at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u001d  Still, even government filtering isn't always successful. In a brutal regime like Iran, which filters Web content, there are nearly 100,000 bloggers, making Farsi \"one of the most blogged languages in the world,\" says Palfrey. \u001d  Google's YouTube has become a common target for thin-skinned rulers. Turkey in March blocked the video-sharing site for two days after a complaint that some clips insulted Turkey's founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. \u001d  Thailand continues to block YouTube after several videos appeared in April, criticizing the country's monarch. \u001d  Bloggers in Morocco said in late May that they could not access YouTube shortly after videos were posted critical of that nation's treatment of the people of Western Sahara, a territory that Morocco took control of in 1975. A government spokesman blamed a technical glitch. \u001d  One likely source for Google's censorship idea is a paper written two years ago by Timothy Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School, who argues that downloading a Web page hosted in another country effectively imports a service. \u001d  Drawing on that concept, Google envisions using trade agreements to fight back. The negotiated pacts would include provisions guaranteeing free trade in \"information services.\" As is true of most trade pacts, the provisions would call for arbitration if there are violations. \u001d  The U.S. has a trade agreement with Morocco and began negotiating one with Thailand in 2004, although those talks were suspended early last year after a military coup. \u001d  Columbia's Wu said the trade pact approach is likely to be more effective when governments are guilty of blocking entire Web sites or applications, such as Internet phone-calling, than when they filter specific content. \u001d  Under World Trade Organization rules, countries can limit trade for national security or public moral reasons, Wu said, exceptions that authoritarian governments would likely cite when filtering politically sensitive material. \u001d  The company's trade initiative reflects Google's increasing acceptance of the value of federal lobbying. The company didn't hire a lobbyist until 2003, according to public filings, but paid the high-powered Washington-based Podesta Group $160,000 last year to work on Internet free-speech, tax and other issues. \u001d  Human rights groups say Google's censorship efforts seem sincere, albeit motivated by bottom-line incentives. \u001d  \"Free expression is a unique selling point\" for a company like Google, O'Brien said. Filtering and censorship \"diminishes the value of their product.\" \u001d  Yet last month at the company's annual meeting, Google's board recommended investors vote against a shareholder resolution urging Google to renounce censorship. \u001d  The resolution was defeated, although Google is already acting on some of the proposal's ideas, including working with other technology leaders, such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO), to develop a set of principles on how companies should respond to censorship and other human rights violations when doing business abroad. \u001d  Human rights advocates, academics and corporate social responsibility groups are involved in the project, announced earlier this year. \u001d  Meanwhile, Google's global growth efforts continue. YouTube said Tuesday that it plans to expand into nine other countries, including Brazil, France, Spain and Poland, offering local-language Web sites and highlighting videos of domestic interest. \u001d  In China, where Google is the No. 2 search engine behind the domestically based Baidu.com Inc. (BIDU), the company said in April it will increase its investment as it works to create more content of interest to Chinese users. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 07:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"88fb32385408021f46c44c5d66c9059c","symR":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Eni, Gazprom Sign MoU For Pipeline Project","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T12:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","OIL","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 08:25 ET (12:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8e7e0e508317262ee6382688b31e35c8","symR":["ALK","CBON","CC","CNTY","HERO","MEND","SMTS","TSN","YHOO","US9843321061"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) Research Reports: How Analysts Size Up Companies","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ALK","CBON","CC","CNTY","HERO","MEND","SMTS","TSN","YHOO","US9843321061"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","BNK","CNO","DRL","FOD","ISV","MDV","OFP","OIE","OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   Edited By Anita Peltonen \u001d  The research reports excerpted here were issued recently by investment firms.

With shares having sold off more than 40% from last year's highs, we feel a large portion of recent negative developments are reflected in the airline's stock price. Investors seem uneasy with fundamental turbulence that includes: Moderating demand; ticket-pricing sustainability; competition on West Coast routes; greater fuel-cost exposure; and pilot-contract negotiations. \u001d  At the same time, Alaska's cost structure, excluding fuel, has seen improvement. An all-737 mainline fleet by the end of 2008 should reduce fuel and maintenance expenses while providing greater long-term earnings leverage tied to higher-gauge aircraft. Tough quarters may still be in store, [but] these entry points merit consideration . . . We view the idea as suitable for accounts willing to accommodate higher risk. \b \u001d  Century Casinos \u001d  -- CNTY-NNM \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 8.45 on June 19 \u001d  by Sterne Agee \b \u001d  Gaming revenue showed a 25% increase in Central City, Colo. This is the third consecutive month of 20+% increases for that market, driven by CNTY property there. We continue to believe the stock does not adequately reflect the prospects for this property and think margins could reach 30% in second quarter. Our 13 target is based on the shares selling at 9 times our 2008 Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] estimate, assuming no debt. \b \u001d  Circuit City Stores \u001d  -- CC-NYSE \b \u001d  Outperform \u001d  -- Price 16.70 on June 18 \u001d  by Cowen & Co. \b \u001d  Reiterating Outperform, as we believe CC's valuation remains attractive at just 7 times fiscal-year '08 estimated enterprise value/Ebitda, a 7% [free-cash-flow] yield, and $4/share in cash or about 25% of its market cap. While we're encouraged by CC's recent restructuring measures, we believe store productivity remains a central, and as yet incomplete, element of CC's turnaround story. Infrastructure investments, services, and store-level employee adjustments should help [long term]. These initiatives, however, must progress quickly to benefit the critical second-half fiscal '08. . . . we look for further updates on the CFO search. We maintain our FY08 and FY09 EPS estimates of 53 cents and 67 cents, respectively. \b \u001d  Community Bancorp \u001d  -- CBON-NNM \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 30.00 on June 18 \u001d  by Oppenheimer & Co. \b \u001d  2Q net-interest margin of 5% appears likely, relatively stable [versus] 5.03% level of 1Q. 2Q loan growth likely slowing, due to a high level of loan prepayment activity. While we anticipate that loans outstanding will increase on a linked-quarter basis, we believe the slowdown in construction of commercial structures such as professional office buildings and strip malls is correlated to slowdown in new housing construction. \u001d  Land acquisition/development . . . accounted for 55% of total loans outstanding. Improved 2Q operating efficiencies [expected]. Lowering target to 36 from 38, which is achievable by applying current 3.1 times multiple on 1Q07 tangible book value per share ($9.75) to projected 4Q07 tangible book value of $12.11, results in an implied forward share price of $35.68. \b \u001d  Hercules Offshore \u001d  -- HERO-NNM \b \u001d  Outperform/Speculative \u001d  -- Price 36.54 on June 18 \u001d  by Morgan Keegan \b \u001d  HERO announced a small acquisition of a 200' international liftboat for . . . about $10 million . . . Fleet-status update shows continued U.S. Gulf jackup choppiness with three idle rigs. Adjusting 2007/2008 earnings per share to $4.13/$5.17 from $4.30/$5.16, as we build in the lower rig utilization [and] cash spend on the acquisition [which] is modestly accretive and expands international presence . . . we like where supply-demand fundamentals are heading . . . despite earnings cut, [we are] still buyers, given cash-generating capabilities and new scale of the combined HERO-Todco entity. . . .[Our view:] HERO remains undervalued, given its position 37% below the offshore driller relative-value trend line . . . based on our forward-four-quarters estimated [return on invested capital] of 62%, we'd estimate HERO to be fairly valued in the high $40[s] range, with potential upside to mid-$60[s] level, applying the 10-year median slope. \b \u001d  Micrus Endovascular \u001d  -- MEND-NNM \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 23.99 on June 19 \u001d  by Punk, Ziegel & Co. \b \u001d  Driven by favorable market trends and events, with the most innovative product offering of bare platinum and bioactive endovascular [aneurysm-occluding] coils, MEND's business is going through hyper-growth . . . As a consequence, MEND is positioned as the second player (behind Boston Scientific) in a $500 million worldwide market, growing at an annual rate of 20%. MEND's market share in the U.S. coil market is approximately 30%. . . . Initiating coverage with 31 target. Our valuation is based on a 5.5 times multiple on our FY 2008 revenue estimate of $85.9 million. After [greater than] 100% appreciation in last 12 months, we expect MEND shares to continue appreciating, although at a slower rate, as growth continues in spite of [rivals'] new product launches and Cordis' return to market. Market cap: $367 million. \b \u001d  Somanetics \u001d  -- SMTS-NNM \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 17.97 on June 18 \u001d  by Maxim Group \b \u001d  Shares of [medical-device maker] SMTS are currently trading below both our fair-value estimate of 27 and 12-month target of 30, which we derive using a blended [discounted-cash-flow] and sum-of-the-parts analysis. \b \u001d  Tyson Foods \u001d  -- TSN-NYSE \b \u001d  Underperform \u001d  -- Price 22.94 on June 19 \u001d  by Wachovia \b \u001d  Tyson announced [last week] it will produce all of its branded fresh chicken without the use of antibiotics and will concurrently shift its packaging and marketing to reflect the conversion. This is an opportunistic move into a more-highly-demanded segment of the chicken industry (91% of consumers view \"without antibiotics\" as important, according to the company). . . . We expect consumers to absorb much of the increased costs. . . . The press release suggests Tyson's converted fresh chicken will be priced \"substantially less than the premium . . . charged by most competing niche brands.\" Currently, niche brands sell for a roughly $1.50 to $2 premium to conventional chicken, leaving ample space for price competition. Fresh chicken is less than 10% of total company sales. While not a key driver of consolidated results, [it is] one more step along Tyson's value-added strategy (roughly 45% of sales are value-added, and mostly chicken) . . . we think valuation, 13.4 times LTM [long-term mean] Ebitda, already more than reflects the marginal positive impact of this good (yawn) news. \b \u001d  Yahoo!

Tang had pushed for such a tax but gave up earlier this year, a political U-turn that he attributed to the lack of public support. \u001d  Critics say Hong Kong now relies unduly on salary taxes paid by only a minority of the population. The matter of a wider tax base is expected to be considered during Donald Tsang's second term, which starts next month. Donald Tsang and John Tsang aren't related. \u001d  Donald Tsang told reporters he would work to promote economic growth in Hong Kong, and said he would address the issue of a widening income gap, though he stopped short of discussing specifics. \u001d  \"We will work hard on the poor, making sure that there will not be the continuous and incorrigible poverty in the community,\" the chief executive said. \u001d  The disparity between the rich and the poor widened last year. Government statistics show that the number of individuals earning less than US$513 a month increased to 11.7% of the working population from 9.9% last year, while people earning more than US$1923 per month rose to 31.5% of the workforce from 25.8%. \u001d  John Tsang worked his way into the financial secretary's job through a career in civil service that began in 1982, unlike his two immediate predecessors who came from the private sector. \u001d  A critic from the opposition Democratic Party, lawmaker Sin Chung-kai, said that while the incoming financial secretary is familiar with government finances, he lacks experience putting them together. \u001d  The new cabinet contains more than a half dozen new appointments and some reappointments. The new officials will be inaugurated July 1, on the 10th anniversary of the return of the former U.K. colony into the hands of China. \u001d  Among the appointments, secretary for financial services Chan Ka-keung will replace Frederick Ma as secretary for financial services and the treasury. \u001d  Chan, a director of Hong Kong Mortgage Corp., is chair professor of finance of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. \u001d  The new director of the chief executive's office will be Norman Chan, a banker at Standard Chartered Bank PLC (2888.HK) and former vice president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. \b \u001d  -By Amy Or and Jonathan Li, Dow Jones Newswires; 852-2802-7002; amy.or@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 01:43 ET (05:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"900a73809e9e816c8df4733cff1788b7","symR":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Eni, Gazprom Sign MoU For Gas Pipeline, Capacity Undecided -3","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T15:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","OIL","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b   Eni's Scaroni said the project costs will be equally split between the two companies. \u001d  Scaroni and Medvedev said the gas supplied by the pipeline is destined for the European Union market, although some may go to the Italian one too. \u001d  Europe needs new gas supplies, and this pipeline is aimed at this, the Italian company said. \u001d  Eni expects the E.U. to require an extra supply of gas of around 200 billion cubic meters in 2015. \u001d  The pipeline \"will increase interconnection between Western and Eastern Europe,\" Scaroni said. \b \u001d  -By Liam Moloney, Dow Jones Newswires; +39 06 678 2543; liam.moloney@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 11:11 ET (15:11 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"900c7d63c199b385d0e0697ba8281625","symR":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","ANBB","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Santander To Hold EGM July 27 To Approve ABN Amro Buy -Chmn","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T09:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","ANBB","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XB20","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XIBEX","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"92b6826b2c348c9fb849b89120be1fd2","symR":["CFC","CNX","LUM","SCMLX"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) Staying Out Of Trouble -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CFC","CNX","LUM","SCMLX"],"IndustryCodes":["COA","FIS","MFN","REA","REI","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\u001d  At the end of this year, a whole new set of contracts will roll off that were priced two, three, four years ago when prices were better, and they will be facing the new lower prices of today and therefore there will be further shutdowns. Overall U.S. production is down almost 3% year to date and so it's under very good control. On the demand side, we are assuming a normal summer and electricity generation in general will be up roughly 4% this year. Inventories are slowly moving back to a lower level and supply and demand will be more balanced in 2008. \b \u001d  Q: What about China? \u001d  A: China is exploding. They are adding a coal-power plant a week, and China has now crossed over to become a net importer of coal in 2007 for the first time. \b \u001d  Q: What about pricing? \u001d  A: Coal is extremely cheap on a BTU basis. At $7 natural gas, on a comparable basis, coal should be about $70 a ton for high-quality steam coal. Today, the price is about $45. That cost arbitrage is going to narrow over time. \b \u001d  Q: Which region and what companies should benefit the most from developments in the industry? \u001d  A: You could throw a dart at the industry. All companies will benefit from the closing of the price gap between natural gas and coal. But Northern Appalachia is the area specifically that will benefit the most. Central App prices will probably move up the most, because they have the biggest swing capacity. And the PRB is the low-cost growth area. But Northern Appalachia has the most going for it now because the sulfur-emission restrictions mandated by the government will result in the amount of scrubbers installed at coal plants almost tripling in the U.S. by 2010. \u001d  Northern App coal is very high-sulfur. Before scrubbers, they were significantly disadvantaged and had to sell their coal at a discount to lower-sulfur coals elsewhere. But with scrubbers, they can operate on a more equal footing with the low-sulfur coals. We see Northern Appalachian coal prices moving more in line with the lower-sulfur coals. \b \u001d  Q: Any particular company that stands to benefit? \u001d  A: Consol Energy [CNX]. And Consol Energy owns 80% of a public company called CNX Gas [CXG], which represents about $20 a share of Consol Energy's stock price. CNX Gas is a terrific low-cost player with long-life reserves. It is a nice property in its own right. \u001d  If you consider the earnings that Consol could generate if gas trades on a BTU-equivalent priced with coal, they could earn over $6. If it were to occur, it would be a ways away. There are really only two cost-effective power options: nuclear and coal, and the United States has 250 years of reserves of coal, while new nuclear plants won't be available until at least 2016. \b \u001d  Q: Thanks, Arnie. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"949fb30106b2eec22084972089a765bf","symR":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Santander Calls July 27 EGM To OK Equity Issue For ABN Buy","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T09:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XB20","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XIBEX","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SANTANDER, Spain (Dow Jones)--Spain's Santander Central Hispano SA (STD) will call an Extraordinary General Meeting for July 27 to approve an equity issue to fund its proposed purchase of part of ABN Amro Holding NV (ABN), Chairman Emilio Botin said Saturday. \u001d  During the bank's annual general meeting in the city of Santander, northern Spain, Botin said that his bank will ask shareholders for approval for a capital increase of EUR4 billion and a convertible bond issue of EUR5 billion as part of the funding of the offer. \u001d  The 150-year-old lender is part of a trio of European banks trying to take over and split the Dutch bank between them, and has said it is willing to pay EUR19.9 billion in cash and shares for ABN Amro's Brazilian and Italian units. \u001d  A successful bid for the ABN Amro units would give Santander a solid foothold in Italy, and give it control of the third-largest banking network in Brazil. \u001d  The bidding group, which includes Santander's long-time business partner Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN) and Fortis NV (FORSY), has outlined a EUR71.1 billion ($96 billion) offer for ABN Amro. \u001d  The proposed offer, the biggest ever in the banking industry, is competing with a friendly, lower, bid for the Dutch bank made by Barclays PLC (BCS). \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.santander.com \b \u001d  -By Christopher Bjork, Dow Jones Newswires; +34 91 395 81 23; christopher.bjork@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 05:47 ET (09:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"998a02027024c1e4d46d321193322069","symR":["AMLN"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": SYMLIN(R) Used in Conjunction with Basal Insulin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T15:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMLN"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS"],"Story":"Improved Glucose Control and Reduced Weight without Increased Incidence of Hypoglycemia \b \b \u001d  CHICAGO, June 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMLN) announced today study results showing SYMLIN(R) (pramlintide acetate) injection used in conjunction with basal insulin improved glucose control and reduced weight without increased hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with insulin glargine and oral agents. These findings were detailed in four poster presentations at the American Diabetes Association's 67th Annual Scientific Sessions (ADA) in Chicago. \b \u001d  \"We are encouraged by the results from this study investigating the use of SYMLIN with an established regimen of basal, or long-acting, insulin,\" said Matthew C. Riddle, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University. \"Improved glucose control often is accompanied by weight-gain or increased hypoglycemia, but with this approach, neither of these problems occurred while glucose control improved.\" \b \u001d  This 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the safety and efficacy of using SYMLIN as an adjunct to basal insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study demonstrated reductions in a set of pre-defined diabetes treatment goals including A1C, post-meal glucose, weight, and incidence of severe hypoglycemia. One in four SYMLIN patients achieved these goals (a composite endpoint) compared to less than one in ten patients on basal insulin without SYMLIN. A1C is a test that measures average blood sugar levels over approximately three months. Overall rates of hypoglycemia were similar between groups and SYMLIN patients reported mild nausea, consistent with previous studies. \b \u001d  Additional analysis of data from this study demonstrated that weight loss also was associated with a significant reduction in C-reactive protein levels, a marker for increased risk for cardiovascular disease. \b \u001d  Results from this study formed the basis of a supplemental New Drug Application submitted in the fourth quarter of 2006. \b \b    About SYMLIN \b \u001d  SYMLIN is an antihyperglycemic drug for use in patients with diabetes treated with insulin. SYMLIN is a synthetic analog of human amylin, a naturally occurring hormone that is made in the beta cells of the pancreas, the same cells that make insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes who use insulin, and in patients with type 1 diabetes, those cells in the pancreas are either damaged or destroyed, resulting in reduced secretion of both insulin and amylin after meals. The use of SYMLIN contributes to glucose control after meals. \b \u001d  Healthcare professionals and people with diabetes may obtain more information, including the complete prescribing information and the medication guide, at http://www.SYMLIN.com. \b \b    Important Safety Information \b \u001d  SYMLIN is not intended for all patients with diabetes. SYMLIN is used with insulin and has been associated with an increased risk of insulin-induced severe hypoglycemia, particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes. When severe hypoglycemia associated with SYMLIN use occurs, it is seen within three hours following a SYMLIN injection. If severe hypoglycemia occurs while operating a motor vehicle, heavy machinery, or while engaging in other high- risk activities, serious injuries may occur. Appropriate patient selection, careful patient instruction, and insulin dose adjustments are critical elements for reducing this risk. This information is highlighted in a boxed warning in the SYMLIN prescribing information for healthcare professionals and in a medication guide for patients, which will be distributed by pharmacists. \b \u001d  Other adverse events commonly observed with SYMLIN when co-administered with insulin were mostly gastrointestinal in nature, including nausea, which was the most frequently reported. The incidence of nausea was higher at the beginning of SYMLIN treatment and decreased with time in most patients. The incidence and severity of nausea are reduced when SYMLIN is gradually increased to the recommended doses. \b \b    About Diabetes \b \u001d  Diabetes is a large and growing market in the United States, affecting over 20 million Americans and growing at three times the rate of population growth. Approximately 4.5 million patients with diabetes use insulin. Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. \b \u001d  Diabetes is a complex metabolic disease manifesting with a defect in the beta cells in the pancreas, resulting in a deficiency of both insulin and amylin secretion. Poor control of blood sugar may result in severe long-term complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage, blindness, amputation and cardiovascular disease. \b \b    About Amylin Pharmaceuticals \b \u001d  Amylin Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving lives through the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines. Amylin has developed and gained approval for two first- in-class medicines for diabetes, SYMLIN(R) (pramlintide acetate) injection and BYETTA(R) (exenatide) injection.

Through Thursday, Rogers stock was up 45%, beating the NYSE's 9% gain and a -2% decline in shares of Comcast, the U.S.' largest cable company. And Toronto-based Rogers has a big advantage: It's not just the biggest cable outfit in the Great White North; it's also the top wireless operator, deriving half of its $7.8 billion in 2006 sales from cellular contracts. And average revenue from each of its seven million wireless customers is rising in a market where only about 60% of likely cellphone customers have phones -- a wide-open tundra compared with the highly competitive U.S. cellular market. That's given Rogers wireless operating-profit margins near 50% -- higher than U.S. wireless or cable operators enjoy. \u001d  That's good news for the stock, which recently traded around $44 and which should rise by 15% or more over the next year, depending on growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda -- estimates for which are rising. \"Rogers is not cheap anymore, but the growth prospects are higher than they've been and margins are widening,\" says Stephen Gauthier, head of Gauthier & Cie in Montreal, which manages investments for private accounts. \u001d  Rogers' cable operation started in the late 1960s, but the company became a wireless operator only in 2004, when it bought AT&T's stake in a Canadian joint venture. In the first quarter, 71% of Rogers' operating profit came from wireless, versus 27% from other phone operations and cable. \u001d  Cash flow is strong. The wireless unit is expected to have a 47% operating-cash-flow margin this year, according to Bear Stearns analyst Philip Cusick. That figure is expected to rise to 50% or so in a few years, as cash flow climbs by about 16% annually, writes Cusick. In the U.S., Verizon is the only wireless company with such a rich margin. \"In this company you get pricing power, you get a better market, you get less competition,\" the analyst adds. \u001d  Two things worry the bulls: The prospect of a large acquisition draining cash and the chance that the relatively cushy cellular environment will draw new competition. Where most U.S. markets now have five or six cellular rivals, up north it's just Rogers, Bell Canada (BCE) and Telus (TU). And airwave auctions are coming up next year. \u001d  It's possible that Rogers could spend big to add assets. One potential target, analysts have speculated, is $9 billion (stock-market value) Shaw Communications (SJR), the No. 2 Canadian cable outfit. \"But given the combined cash generation and the strong profile of their businesses, it wouldn't look all that bad,\" says Standard & Poor's analyst Madhav Hari. The new-competition worries seem overstated. \u001d  The long-term attraction of Rogers is communications' holy grail -- cable TV, wireless, traditional phone and high-speed Internet on one bill. That's a future worth owning, even at a premium. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a1eb5833f0a2eb1460ddbf16160baad6","symR":["BITAL.YY","DB1.XE","ISE","LSE.LN","NDAQ","NYX","OMX.SK","DE0005810055","GB00B0SWJX34","SE0000110165"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"LSE, Borsa:Merger Seen At Least 10% Earnings Accretive In 09","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T09:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BITAL.YY","DB1.XE","ISE","LSE.LN","NDAQ","NYX","OMX.SK","DE0005810055","GB00B0SWJX34","SE0000110165"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","SCR","XDAX","XDJGI","XHEX","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSTF","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 05:43 ET (09:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a3364dcfeef35f869131e664592dba29","symR":["YELL.LN","GB0031718066"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Yell CEO Got 56% Compensation Hike Before Profit Warning -FT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T10:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["YELL.LN","GB0031718066"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The chief executive of Yell Group PLC (YELL.LN), John Condron, received a 56% boost to his package of salary, bonus and pension benefits for the year to March just before a profit warning from the Yellow Pages publisher took 20% off its shares in a day, the Financial Times reported Saturday. \u001d  The newspaper cited a remuneration review conducted by non-executive directors and accountants Deloitte. \u001d  The rise in Condron's total remuneration, to GBP2.53 million from GBP1.62 million came after Yell's remuneration committee raised the maximum bonus payable during the year  to 180% of salary from 120%, the FT reported. \u001d  According to the newspaper, the rewards came in a financial year when Yell's revenue rose 28%, helped by acquisitions, and adjusted profits were up 18.5%. \u001d  However, a refinancing and higher interest charges related to the EUR3.3 billion acquisition of Spain's TPI directories group led to a 21% drop in pretax profits the FT reported. \b \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.ft.com \b \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires;

Some patients, however, still require a longer-acting insulin injection in order to control the body's blood sugar levels. \u001d  One of the main concerns the FDA had about Exubera involves pulmonary safety because the insulin is absorbed by the lungs rather than under the skin, so Pfizer's been studying the effect of the drug on patient's lungs. \u001d  The new data involves about 1,200 patients who've been followed for three years. Overall the studies found that any declines in lung function were small, occurred early in treatment and didn't get any worse over time. \u001d  Patients were either given standard insulin injections or Exubera for two years. Then all patients received injected insulin for six months and then for another six months some patients started receiving Exubera again. Any declines in the lung function of Exubera users reversed a month after stopping Exubera. When Exubera was started again, lung-function declines were also small and were similar to the changes seen among first-time users of Exubera. \u001d  The studies also showed Exubera controlled blood sugar in a similar manner to those using injected insulin and that Exubera patients generally gained less weight than those receiving injections, Pfizer said. \u001d  It's recommended that people using Exubera undergo   baseline tests for lung function before beginning treatment and then periodically during treatment. \u001d  When Exubera was first approved, many analysts had predicted Exubera could reach blockbuster status with annual sales of $1 billion or more. So far Pfizer has said it's been \"disappointed\" with sales, but plans to start a broader promotion of the drug later this summer. \u001d  About 21 million Americans have diabetes, a disease characterized by high blood-glucose levels that result from the body's inability to use or produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes most often occurs in people who are older than 45 and overweight, although there has been an increase in younger patients in recent years. \u001d  Type 1 diabetes, often diagnosed in childhood, requires people to use insulin to manage their blood sugar levels. Many diabetics also have poor lipid profiles, which puts them at risk for cardiovascular disease. Diabetes also can lead to blindness, kidney disease and amputations. \b \u001d   -By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9294; Jennifer.Corbett@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 11:00 ET (15:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"aee8f654c662646756240c4e73a80d35","symR":["AOB"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) Asian Trader: Chinese Medicine Show","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AOB"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Leslie P. Norton \u001d  Few investing concepts are as hot as China, so it's no wonder that companies are rushing to tap the well. One is Big Board-listed American Oriental Bioengineering (ticker: AOB), a Chinese herbal medicine outfit that this week plans to sell 13 million shares in a secondary offering. At last week's price around $9.30 per share, the deal would raise $140 million, equivalent to nearly a quarter of its market value. Chief Executive Shujun \"Tony\" Liu will sell another 2 millionshares. \u001d  Watch out. For such a small company, there are a lot of big questions, along with a history of muddled disclosures and misleading claims. \u001d  AOB is based in the city of Harbin, in China's northeastern Heilongjiang province, and began life in the U.S. stock market in 2002, when it came public via a reverse merger on the bulletin board. It moved to the American Stock Exchange in 2005, and last December, jumped to the Big Board. Off about 20% this year, it trades for just under six times its 2006 revenues of $110 million, though underwriter Brean Murray believes those revenues will jump to $193 million in '08. \u001d  If that happens, it means customers aren't looking very closely at two key product lines: a prescription soft-gel and over-the-counter adhesive patch to treat bed-wetting, and over-the-counter soy peptide products, which AOB has in the past suggested can inhibit the growth of tumor cells. \u001d  Packaging for both carry misleading claims. The \"UrinStopper Patch\" package says it contains \"radioactive photons\" that \"warm the acupoints.\" But Maryland Heights, Missouri-based Chemir Analytical Services, which analyzed the patch for an investor, says it detected no radioactive elements. Meanwhile, packaging for AOB's SoyPeptide powder says it has \"patent technology from University of California, Berkeley.\" But an official at a U.C. Berkeley's Office of Technology Licensing says, \"They are not one of our licensees.\" \u001d  AOB chief executive Liu and other officials declined to be interviewed, citing the quiet period before the offering, but their outside investor-relations firm referred Barron's to relevant filings and answered some questions via e-mail. AOB confirmed it doesn't use technology from U.C. Berkeley. As for the patch, it says only that it was approved by Chinese regulators who required pre-clinical trials of the products. \u001d  AOB intends to become one of China's largest pharma outfits, and plans to use part of the offering proceeds to buy a Chinese company for up to $30 million. Yet things haven't always gone according to the plans it announces. In March 2004, it said its primary objective was \"to penetrate the U.S., European and Asian markets,\" and in September 2004, that it was busy \"expanding [its] nutraceutical and pharmaceutical business in the U.S.\" In earlier releases, it said it got 5% of sales from Japan and 20% from Korea, and that it had established a distribution arrangement in the U.K. and Europe. But in its June offer document, it says, \"We currently sell our products mainly in China. China will remain our primary market for the foreseeable future.\" \u001d  Liu became chief executive in 1994, according to AOB, after a long career with the People's Liberation Army and as a top official with Heilongjiang province. Another top official of Heilongjiang province, Wang Xianmin, helped introduce AOB to reverse merger specialists in the U.S., and Wang Xianmin became a director of AOB in 2005. Wang was also reportedly a driving force behind the initial public offering of Daqing Lianyi Petrochemical. \u001d  In 1999, according to the Wall Street Journal, regulators found that Daqing Lianyi executives had bribed officials to facilitate its IPO. AOB's response: \"Wang Xianmin was appointed to the Board of Directors as of January 19, 2005. Based on the Company's due diligence at the time he became a director, including a review of official [People's Republic of China] documentation, the Company does not believe further disclosure in its public filings is required.\" \u001d  Also helping AOB in its long march to the New York Stock Exchange were a couple of characters associated with penny-stock frauds. One was Mid-Continental Securities, which received shares from and was a consultant to AOB until '04. Mid-Continental was controlled by Mark Anthony, who had been barred in 1997 from associating with brokers and investment advisers or participating in penny-stock offerings. In 2005, AOB was using CEOcast, a Website that hosted video clips and sent out newsletters about small-cap stocks, for investor relations. \u001d  As my colleague Bill Alpert reported last November, CEOcast was controlled by Michael Wachs, who in 1997 served 11 months in federal prison and agreed to be barred from the banking and brokerage industries. Wachs didn't return calls, and AOB said: \"We do not currently have relationships with Mid-Continental Securities nor with CEOcast.\" \u001d  Expect the questions to keep coming. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"af972f9da9aa2a338ea6fd9e643b15c3","symR":["BSC"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) Up & Down Wall Street: Yo, Bloomberg!","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BSC"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Alan Abelson \u001d  What exactly does George Bush have against Tony Blair? Perhaps he has always been deep down resentful of Blair's surer grasp of the mother tongue; but, on that basis, Dubya would have reason to be aggrieved at a good portion of the millions of English-speakers on both sides of the Atlantic. \u001d  The president's irritation with the outgoing prime minister of Great Britain conceivably springs from a perceived slight -- he may feel Mr. Blair failed to respond with sufficient alacrity when Dubya famously yelled \"Yo, Blair!\" to summon him as both were chomping away at lunch during an otherwise deadly dull summit meeting in St. Petersburg last summer. Always possible, too, that it's nothing personal, simply a status thing: top dogs are bred to be contemptuous of lap dogs. \u001d  Just as likely, Mr. Bush, an avid student of American history and never forgetting that it was the British from whom we won our independence 231 years ago, couldn't imagine a more fitting way to celebrate this Fourth of July than by sticking it to a prominent Brit in plain view of the whole world. \u001d  Whatever the precise motive, Mr. Bush is proposing something you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy -- that Mr. Blair shoulder the task of making peace between Israel and the Palestinians, ex Gaza and Hamas. \u001d  Now, we know that the president prides himself on being compassionate and that Mr. Blair, shorn of official office, is about to go on the dole, has a family to support and slim prospects of landing a cushy job like the one he was rudely compelled to leave. And since the peace project has been dragging on for four decades, if he agrees to do Mr. Bush's bidding one more time, he's likely to have a secure position for life. \u001d  But, even if in the unlikely event Mr. Bush is trying to help a buddy in distress, didn't some wise man once observe that the road to hell is paved with good intentions? \u001d  It seems to us that urging Tony to plunge into the middle of such an unholy mess is like telling him to go jump in the lake, while thoughtfully cautioning him to mind and not get the piranha stirred up. \u001d  Of course, if Mr. Blair, who enjoys a high opinion of himself not widely shared by his erstwhile subjects, allows ego to elbow aside his instinct for self-preservation, he will, wittingly or not, be doing a big favor for Mr. Bush. For it will enable the president, as he limps through the final year and a half of his lame-duckacy, to avoid the embarrassing futility of trying to breathe life into a peace process that's all but defunct. \u001d  We haven't the slightest doubt that whoever succeeds Mr. Bush -- be it Hillary, Rudy, Mike or any one of the millions of other highly qualified New Yorkers who might like a shot at the top slot but have not yet gone public with their candidacy -- will be called upon to arbitrate between the Middle East antagonists for at least four and maybe eight years. As will their successors, as well. \u001d  Michael Bloomberg's emergence as a possible third-party candidate for the presidency has caused fear and loathing among both Democrats and Republicans, and that's no mean commendation. \u001d  The Dems worry big-time that, should Mr. Bloomberg decide to throw his hat in the ring (he probably will have to buy a hat before he declares), he would siphon off a ton of votes from them, and exert a Ralph Nader effect, circa 2000, but many times magnified. The GOP frets that he is the devil -- that is, a Democrat -- in disguise, and should he actually win, it would be curtains for conservatives. \u001d  Our own informal but highly scientific poll of three New York City cab drivers, one of whom even claimed to be a citizen, showed all respondents were for Bloomberg -- and quite ecstatic about his achievements as mayor, which might be summed up as raising taxi fares by 50% (all assured us this was not really a core item, so not to be concerned that it was inflationary). \u001d  Mr. Bloomberg has name recognition, money beyond count, his city is booming thanks to the bull market in Wall Street, he exudes a certain measure of sincerity (for a politician) and alone among the likely candidates knows the difference between a deficit and a surplus. What he really has going for him, though, is that he thinks it would be nice to be the nation's CEO, but if he doesn't get it, in contrast to all the other presidential wannabes, isn't apt to be tempted to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. \u001d  What kind of a president would Michael Bloomberg make? Hard to say, since as mayor he hasn't faced either a 9/11 or the financial day of reckoning that's a reasonable possibility for our profligate nation sometime in the next few years. Nor is it a cinch that he'd be great for Wall Street. For while it made him rich and famous, his long and intimate familiarity with the place also means that no one knows better than he where all the bodies are buried. \b \u001d  The stock market got roughed up again last week, in the process summarily giving the lie to the complacent fiction that has found such favor with the Wall Street wise guys: that the collapse of housing is not having much of an effect on the consumer's psyche or the economy. \u001d  So, pray tell, we ask them, how do you explain that huge and ever-widening sinkhole in the mortgage market? Or the rather panicky rise in bond yields? Or the evident unease in the populace at large, manifesting itself in the unimaginable-an atrophying desire to consume? \u001d  And, if not the devastation visited on housing and the massive wave of delinquencies and foreclosures that are accompanying it, what caused the fiasco that has befallen Bear Stearns, the investment bank with a hedge-fund mentality (an aberration most investments suffer from these days)? An irresponsible computer that insisted on screwing up an otherwise infallible risk-model? An innocent mispricing mishap? Or, perhaps, it was something beyond any mortal being's control -- nothing less than an act of Lucifer. \u001d  Bear Stearns came within the width of an old school tie of having to liquidate its two jumbo hedge funds, whose combined portfolios were supposedly worth $20 billion and were loaded to the gills with assets shrinking with the speed of light, for no reason other than they served as collateral for subprime mortgages. \u001d  Any necessitous liquidation of the funds, besides inflicting real pain on the holders of such collateral, would have caused an explosion heard 'round the world. \u001d  Happily, the Bear funds' blue-chip creditors -- JPMorgan Chase, Merrill, Lehman, Goldman, Bank of America, Barclay's (we apologize if we've inadvertently omitted one or two) at the last moment chose not to pull the plug. They acted, we've no doubt, out of the goodness of their hearts. Bears Stearns' decision to help out its troubled progeny with a $3.2 billion infusion may have helped some, too. \u001d  Despite the gracious gesture of the creditors, we may not have witnessed the end of the story for those benighted hedge funds. The future of the more leveraged of the pair, which boasts the catchy title of the High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage fund, still looks a bit problematic. We're grateful to the sharp-eyed toilers at East Shore Partners, which bills itself as research boutique and brokerage firm, for alerting us to the melancholy fact that everyone is not as lucky or agile or well-connected in dealing with subprime-mortgage woes as Bear Stearns. \u001d  Brookstreet Securities, a broker-dealer in Orange County, Calif., with 3,000-odd customers, went belly-up almost simultaneously with the hairbreadth escape by Bear's funds from a fate worse than debt. In a scant few days, Brookstreet's capital shrank from $16 million to minus $3 million, as it failed to meet a margin call from its clearing house, National Financial Services. \u001d  The demand for more margin was on securities called collateralized mortgage obligations, popularly (or now unpopularly) known as CMOs, the value of which had sunk to 18 cents on the dollar. More than one Brookstreet customer was wiped out, and quite a few of the others, as a spokesperson for the firm put it, went \"negative.\" Some 100 employees got pink slips. \u001d  We fear that what's in store for us in the months ahead shapes up as more Brookstreet than Bear Stearns. \b \u001d  Our glum view of the outlook for housing and the mortgage market was only strengthened by The Wall Street Journal's distressing revelation that managers of college-endowment funds are rushing to snap up mortgage-backed securities in the wake of the skid inspired by Bears Stearns' woes. Boy, we muttered, talk about cruisin' for a bruisin' -- these guys really are going to get an education the hard way. \u001d  Reinforcing our negative take as well was a powerful reiteration, replete with facts and charts, by Bank of America's Robert Lacoursiere and colleagues at the bank's equity research unit, of their bearish call on residential mortgage credit. They term the dire experience of the Bear Stearns funds as merely the tip of the iceberg, and foresee the deterioration in mortgage credit stretching out and deepening into next year. In fact, they don't expect a peak in losses in that beleaguered sector until the second half of '08. \u001d  They raise the disquieting prospect of a \"broader fallout from subprime-mortgage credit deterioration that would lead to cascading deleveraging and ultimately ending with higher rates to new mortgage borrowers.\" House prices, they predict, will weaken further as higher rates and further credit tightening force the marginal buyer out of the market. \u001d  Wonder if the folks in the mortgage-lending part of the bank have read the report. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b14bf2c51f7ce070dd38b0b11ad8963e","symR":["F"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) The Long View: Essays On The History Of Business: Back To The Future, Detroit-Style","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["F"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By John Steele Gordon \u001d  Chrysler went private when DaimlerChrysler sold an 80.1% stake in its Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management for $7.4 billion on May 14. In a way, the deal brings the story of Detroit's erstwhile Big Three full circle. \u001d  Until the Cerberus transaction, Ford had been the biggest automobile company ever to operate as a private concern. General Motors and Chrysler were born as public companies; Ford wasn't and indeed didn't go public until a half-century after it was founded. \u001d  In 1903, 12 men scraped together $28,000 to form Ford Motor, named for its chief engineer, Henry Ford. This proved to be one of the great investments of all time. Every $1,000 invested in Ford in 1903 was worth $2.5 million a mere 16 years later, without taking into account the $250,000 in dividends the  $1,000 in stock had received. \u001d  By 1906, Ford was the country's largest automobile company, having passed Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac, all then independent, and Henry Ford had become president and majority stockholder, with 58.5% of the stock (up from an original 25.5%). \u001d  In 1908, Ford Motor launched the Model T and the world changed forever. Before the Model T, successful automobile companies had made a few hundred cars a year and charged several thousand dollars for each of them. In 1908, Ford made 10,607 Model Ts, each of which sold for $850. But Henry Ford reasoned that he could make a lot more money selling many cars at a lower price than a relative handful at a lofty one. \u001d  To drive down the price, Ford introduced ever more efficient manufacturing methods, fully implementing the assembly line by 1913. By 1916, Model Ts were being assembled in only 93 minutes and the price had dropped to $360. Ford Motor sold 730,041 Model Ts that year. By the 1920s, Ford was making about half the automobiles manufactured in the world. \u001d  And Ford was not merely private; Henry Ford owned the entire company. In 1919, for the then-titanic sum of $106 million, Ford had bought out the remaining stockholders and become sole owner of the mightiest industrial enterprise on earth. That enterprise had been entirely financed by the original $28,000 investment and reinvested profits. Ford Motor was debt-free and a cash cow. After Ford bought out his partners, the company was earning well over $100 million a year, after taxes. \u001d  The company suffered setbacks in the late 1920s and the 1930s, thanks partly to Henry Ford's increasing age, stubbornness -- he was reluctant to introduce new models and long favored selling vehicles in only one color, black -- and paranoia. Ford Motor fell to third place in autos, behind GM and Chrysler. But under the vigorous leadership of his grandson Henry Ford II, who became president in 1945, the Dearborn, Mich., giant was once again very profitable and second only to General Motors among industrial corporations. \u001d  Ford Motor plowed most of its increasing profits back into its operations in the postwar years, building 28 plants between 1945 and 1955 and spending $1.4 billion on renovating older facilities. By the mid-1950s, it was the world's most modern car maker. \u001d  With rising profits, modern facilities and a controlling family with plenty of money, Ford had no need to go public. And yet it did. The catalyst: the Ford Foundation, which by the mid-'50s held 3,089,908 of the 3,452,900 shares outstanding. Edsel Ford, Henry's only child, had established the foundation in 1936 to fund projects \"for the public welfare.\" But the Ford family soon realized that it was also a perfect means to circumvent the crippling federal tax that then amounted to 70% on estates over $50 million. After the deaths of Edsel (in 1943) and Henry Ford (in 1947), the foundation owned 95% of Ford Motor's stock, although 100% of the voting power stayed with the family. \u001d  The foundation, which Henry Ford II had made independent, wanted to diversify its endowment. Its head, Rowan Gaither, wasn't comfortable with its being subject to one company's inevitable ups and downs. Furthermore, its managers felt the foundation could increase its income -- and largesse -- by selling part of its Ford stock and investing in other securities that paid more in dividends or interest. But none of the other stockholders -- the family and 108 senior executives -- could afford to buy much of the foundation's holdings. The only alternative: Go public, a move Henry Ford II didn't oppose. \u001d  In May 1955, the foundation announced that it would offer 15% of its holdings to the public in January 1956. It was by far the largest single stock offering in Wall Street history, though the company would get none of the proceeds and the family would retain 40% of the voting stock and thus effective control. \u001d  Demand was enormous, perhaps driven by remembrances of the original stockholders' fantastic profits a half-century earlier. The Ford Foundation upped the amount of stock offered to 22% of its holdings. When the market settled down after the initial offering, 350,000 investors owned Ford stock-an average of just 29 shares per person. While the stock showed an immediate profit above the initial offering price of $64.50, it soon sank as low as $54.25. But in the next five years -- very prosperous ones for the American automobile industry -- it nearly doubled over its initial offering price. \u001d  One denizen of Wall Street at the time thought that \"Investing in stocks, might become as popular as owning a car or a washing machine.\" A half-century on, he has proved to be right. Well over half the families in the country today own stocks or mutual funds. \u001d  But now, ironically, Chrysler, one member of the industrial sector that helped popularize stocks, has pegged its hopes of survival on leaving the public market and going private, where its new owners will have a freer hand to revamp it. \u001d  --- \u001d  JOHN STEELE GORDON is an author of business books, most recently An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b2ce1b907a2b0febc7506480b3052a11","symR":["OXPS"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) The Electronic Investor: Pick Your Own Online Stock Sherpa","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OXPS"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Theresa W. Carey \u001d  A few weeks ago, a stock-market trading contest run by TheStreet.com was found to be compromised -- ie. some participants were cheating. So the game, called \"Beat the Street,\" was cancelled and the prize money withheld. The provider of market news and commentary then started up another round of the game on June 13 (beat.thestreet.com), throwing in the original $100,000 prize money to create a grand prize of $150,000 for the second tourney. TheStreet.com also said it had added new safeguards that would make it impossible to trick the results this time around. \u001d  Cheating in a trading game? It's like finding out that the apple pie was made with crackers. Stock-picking tournaments, which Barron's also runs, are great ways to learn about high-risk trading strategies without losing any of your own money. But they're no fun when your rivals have found holes in the contest's rules that give them an unfair advantage. \u001d  I came in second in an investing game a few years ago, and enjoyed the rush of competition immensely. It was also educational to see what other contestants were doing, and to learn from their successes and failures. \u001d  Several online-brokerage sites allow traders using real money to give others a peek at their strategies. TradeKing (www.tradeking.com) customers, for instance, can set themselves up as \"Certified Traders\" and the firm will publish their actual transactions on the site's \"Community\" section. However, the certified trades include only those executed at TradeKing, so customers trading with other brokers can show only a portion of their activity. \b \u001d  Enter Covestor (www.covestor.com), which opened its virtual doors on June 5. Covestor is designed to enable individual investors to view the portfolio allocations of others -- and to follow in the path of those who enjoy successful outcomes. \u001d  Stock-picking games like those run by TheStreet.com display fantasy trades, but at Covestor you see real trades, documented by brokerage records. Members' names don't have to be displayed for all the world to see, but to sign up for an account, they must provide proof of identity and upload brokerage statements to verify their actual holdings. \u001d  Rikki Tahta, co-founder and chairman of Covestor, explains: \"We all know people who are managing their own money, and doing a great job. Our research shows there are tens of thousands of unsung heroes and millions of others who would be keen to invest alongside them.\" \u001d  After an account is created, Covestor logs that member's trades and holdings -- using a secure link into his or her brokerage account, or accounts. The link is provided by Yodlee, an account consolidator that we've written about many times. Those who don't want to link their brokerage accounts can enter their transactions manually. Covestor checks these entries periodically against paper brokerage records to assure accuracy. Other members, or \"followers,\" can then track the real-time investments of those who share their investment goals. \u001d  All of the participants can opt to publish their real names or remain anonymous by selecting screen names. It might be hard to give much credence to the financial acumen of \"bigdaddy69,\" so it would be a good idea to pick a moniker that doesn't scream goofiness. Actual trade sizes are not disclosed, merely the item purchased and the price. \u001d  Covestor could give a marketing push to some small investment managers by publicizing their picks, but it would be difficult to calculate an actual portfolio return without knowing the size of a particular investment. \u001d  Should you become a Covestor member, each time you execute a trade you will be invited to give the rationale for your move. Covestor will then build you an auditable, time-stamped record of your decision-making and will track your returns. \u001d  Within a year, says co-founder Perry Blacher, members will be able to sign up to follow the trades of their favorite Covestor Sherpas. That will entail a fee for what is now a free service. And here's where it gets more interesting. Covestor plans to partner with several online brokers that eventually will allow members to sign on with high-performance money managers of their choosing. These guides will essentially run separately managed accounts for their followers. This service also will require a fee, most of which will flow to the adviser, thus rewarding those who have created the biggest online following. \u001d  Blacher says that a verified track record will start with the existing holdings in your account. Owing to the rollout of these additional services in a year or less, it pays to sign up relatively soon to start creating a successful track record, he notes. The firm is also still working out some regulatory issues. \u001d  We'll check back on Covestor in a few months to see if it's taken off. \b \u001d  Online-broker news: Advanced Chart Patterns are now available to all optionsXpress (www.optionsxpress.com) customers, allowing them to search for bullish, bearish and other trends among thousands of securities, using real-time data. Investors can access 36 technical trends from the familiar, such as Double Bottoms, Head and Shoulders, Moving Average Crossovers and Breakouts, to the more esoteric, such as Bearish Symmetrical, Continuation Triangle or Descending Continuation Triangle. The charting-pattern software is provided by Recognia. \b \u001d  Coming soon: A series of regulatory initiatives designed to modernize and strengthen the National Market System for equity securities, brought to you by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is due to be implemented for 250 stocks (100 NYSE, 100 Nasdaq, 50 Amex) on July 9. Full compliance with the Regulation National Market System (Reg NMS) is scheduled for Aug. 20. \u001d  Most of the changes won't be visible to the retail trader's eye, but trading centers have been extremely busy getting ready over the past couple of years. They are required to make a serious effort to avoid executing trades at prices inferior to protected quotes displayed by other trading centers, which means trades ought to execute at the best price available when your order was entered. \u001d  Quite a few market centers are setting up \"dark pools,\" or inventories of stock to be sold outside the NMS. How will this affect you? It should not be of much significance to the smaller retail trader, but we'll let you know if that changes. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bb89820301cca8edc80d54f51074512d","symR":["ANBB","SAN.MC","STD","ES0113900J37"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Santander Ordinary Net Profit Excludes Extraordinary Gains","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T09:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ANBB","SAN.MC","STD","ES0113900J37"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XDJGI","XES","XIBEX","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 05:21 ET (09:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bc3314048be0fa9b25f37a915aaece86","symR":["MBI"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) A Mortgage Meltdown For MBIA?","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MBI"],"IndustryCodes":["INP","INS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Jonathan R. Laing \u001d  Despite its reputation for somewhat slipshod underwriting, giant municipal-bond and corporate-debt insurer MBIA seemed to have allayed investors' concerns of late by working its way out of some tough situations. \u001d  For instance, an impending debt-restructuring will defer or perhaps eliminate the insurer's obligation to make future principal and interest payments on some $1.5 billion of debt securities it had insured for the troubled Eurotunnel project. Likewise, MBIA has dramatically whittled down its once-$4 billion exposure of securities backed by manufactured housing, $2 billion of rental-car securitizations, and various equipment trust certificates of the formerly bankrupt carriers Northwest and US Airways. The fact is, few financial insurers are better at restructuring problem deals or stringing out repayments of deals gone bad. \u001d  Yet trouble may be brewing in MBIA's $1 trillion guaranty portfolio -- and from a piece of it that has been virtually ignored. The potential losses from these obligations could be of a dimension and immediacy that dwarf MBIA's record $170 million in payments to cover bond-guaranty losses incurred when in 1998 a Pennsylvania hospital group named Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation, or Aherf, declared bankruptcy. Namely, MBIA could suffer massive losses from the blowback of the subprime mortgage crisis, through the billions of dollars of subprime-mortgage securitizations that MBIA has insured. \u001d  The issue was first raised by hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management at an investment conference. In a presentation provocatively-entitled \"Who's Holding the Bag?,\" Ackman contended that MBIA has guarantees on some $5 billion worth of potentially dicey securitizations of subprime-mortgage and other types of asset-backed debt that could ultimately damage the company's balance sheet. Based in Armonk, N.Y., MBIA guarantees the timely payment of interest and principal on municipal bonds and other forms of debt. \u001d  The peril is particularly acute because the company will have a narrow cushion of perhaps $500 million or so by yearend over the minimum capital level required to maintain a triple-A rating. Currently, MBIA has $6.8 billion in statutory or insurance-company-level capital, plus unallocated reserves of $200 million, to protect its total guaranteed portfolio of $635 billion in par value against loss. And if woes of the subprime-mortgage market continue to wax as some expect, MBIA could sustain claims losses of more than half a billion bucks. \u001d  The company is quick to play down such doubts, and it brushes Ackman aside. It points out to Barron's that Ackman's past intimations of MBIA's impending doom -- such as on the Chunnel project -- have come to naught. Ackman has sold large amounts of MBIA stock short, betting on declines, since late 2002, when he issued a lengthy negative report on MBIA -- and has lost money on the trades. Ever since, both sides have engaged in a jihad that has included attempts by each party to push the Securities and Exchange Commission and New York Attorney General into bringing charges against the other side. \u001d  The battle royal is far from over, although Ackman appears to be winning the latest round. Since his report in May, MBIA's stock (ticker: MBI) has fallen from over 70 to under 65, despite a strong stock market. Yet renowned value players like Marty Whitman's Third Avenue Fund and Dodge & Cox remain in the stock, no doubt attracted by its modest price-to-earnings ratio of 10.4 times analysts' consensus forecast for 2007 earnings. \u001d  As of March 31, 2007, MBIA had insured $5.4 billion in subprime mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, which receive cash flow from underlying pools of mortgages. Here, MBIA probably faces negligible risk, since it generally insures higher-rated classes, or tranches, of MBS, including the triple-A bonds that have first dibs on the flow of mortgage interest and principal payments cascading down the payment waterfall. \u001d  But MBIA could be in significant peril as a result of its guarantee of a class of subprime-mortgage derivatives called collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs. These instruments represent a degree of separation from underlying mortgage-backed securities, since CDOs are constructed from individual classes hived off from different MBS or, in the case of \"CDOs-Squared,\" classes of other CDOs. \b \u001d  The risk of CDOs is amplified by the fact that they tend to be built from lower-rated tranches of different mortgage-backed securities, classes far below the top of the payment cascade. Thus, any depletion in the value of mortgage pools backing the MBS can so restrict the flow of cash down to the tranches near the bottom of the waterfall that the CDO investors, in effect, die of thirst. \u001d  On its Website, MBIA said that as of year end, some $2.4 billion of the total $7.7 billion in mortgage CDOs it has insured were backed by subprime mortgages. The $2.4 billion of CDOs, in turn, is a mix of \"mezzanine\" and \"high-grade\" CDOs, according to the company. Mezzanine portfolios are comprised of MBS tranches rated no higher than triple-B, while about two-thirds of high-grade CDOs are made up of single-A tranches. \u001d  The risks in such CDOs are indeed daunting, should the subprime-mortgage market continue to deteriorate. The triple-B tranches of MBS are protected by a mere 7% or so of the underlying mortgage pools of total collateral. So, if the cumulative collateral losses mount to 7%, the holders of the triple-B tranches would torched. Once losses hit 10%, the single-A tranches also get snuffed. \u001d  While in a 10% loss scenario, more than 85% of an MBS capital structure would survive intact, subprime CDOs built from lower-rated MBS tranches would face catastrophic losses. Many mezzanine CDOs would be completely pancaked. Meantime, high-grade CDOs could lose as much as 65% of their value as the A-rated tranches took gas. MBIA typically insures only the triple-A portion of the latter, but this affords it only 20% collateral protection before the losses attach to it. Yet it would be potentially on the hook for covering 45 percentage points of the 65% in overall losses or over half of the 80% in par value it had insured. \b \u001d  Such a meltdown in subprime, once deemed remote, is indeed possible these days. Since January, the ABX index that measures the performance of triple-B subprime MBS tranches has lost nearly 40% of its value. Credit downgrades of MBS are spiraling, with Moody's alone chopping the ratings of 131 bonds earlier this month. \u001d  In a report, Moody's dolefully revealed that an unprecedented 3% of the subprime mortgages securitized in last year's third quarter are now in foreclosure. Likewise, the rating concern projected that because of unfavorable trends in home prices, mortgage rates and lending standards, cumulative losses on loans backing 2006 subprime securitizations will \"generally range between 6% and 8%.\" Some private estimates see losses of 10% or more in the 2006 loan vintage. \u001d  Part of the problem is mortgages taken out by fraudsters who lied on their applications as to their income and net worth, and by property-flippers who mail in their home keys after seeing home prices fall in such premium markets as California, Florida, Arizona and Las Vegas. \u001d  A far more ominous drama figures to play out over the next two years, when more than $600 billion in subprime mortgages will \"reset\" from low, fixed teaser rates to higher-floating rates. Monthly payments will soar 50% or more for already-financially strapped homeowners caught in a proverbial roach motel. \u001d  Tightened lending requirements and falling home values will likely choke off any opportunity to refinance at attractive teaser-rate levels. Nor will these homeowners be able to find refuge in a fixed-rate, 30-year loan, with no equity value in their homes and long-term rates moving up. \u001d  In such an environment, foreclosure rates figure to soar and lender-recovery rates to plummet. And efforts by lenders to restructure loans via interest-rate reductions, payment deferrals and the like in order to avoid foreclosure will be all the more difficult because of the complexity of sub-prime loans, now mostly lodged in securitizations. \u001d  Contacted by Barron's, MBIA officials denied that either its $5 billion in mezzanine CDOs or its $2.4 billion in subprime-mortgage CDO exposure constitutes a major risk to the company. Firstly, its mezzanine CDOs consist of other types of collateral in addition to subprime mortgages, including prime mortgages, corporate debt, credit-card receivables and auto-loan paper. Many of the CDOs are likewise overcollateralized, although the company refused to quantify at what level. Likewise, the levels or tranches of CDOs insured by MBIA often sit higher up in the structure than even the triple-A level, with additional collateral protection. \u001d  The latter consideration, however, may prove nugatory -- a luxury suite on the Titanic, if you will -- should MBIA's subprime mezzanine CDOs run into trouble. Senior position matters little if all the collateral gets wiped out. The company conceded that some $800 million of its $2.4 billion subprime CDO collateral is of the mezzanine variety, with \"some small buckets\"of double-B tranches mixed in with the triple-B holdings. Collateral impairment could thus move more rapidly up the CDO structure than even the bears imagine. \u001d  A dose of skepticism certainly is in order for dealing with MBIA, since the company has sometimes seemed less than candid in its recent history. One only has to look back to the aforementioned $256 million bond default in 1998 by the hospital chain Aherf, when MBIA cooked up an apparently phony reinsurance scheme to avoid taking a $170 million charge to earnings that year. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c45824af9682f7bd7618a04fb720026b","symR":["7267.TO","BSC","DBD","DJO","GE","HMC","HOG","M","NCR","JP3854600008","US3696041033"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) The Trader: A Stalled Rally","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["7267.TO","BSC","DBD","DJO","GE","HMC","HOG","M","NCR","JP3854600008","US3696041033"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","CPR","IDD","MDV","RTB","RTS","SCR","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Kopin Tan \u001d  Don't look now, but has the runaway bull market run into -- gasp -- a trading range? \u001d  For seven weeks now, the Standard & Poor's 500 index has swung, at times violently, within a tight 3.5% range near its record high. Buyers have stepped in each time the benchmark slides toward 1490, emboldened by evidence of teeming liquidity and the persistent payoffs that came from buying every dip. \u001d  But feats of bravado become harder to pull off in the thin air above 1539. Bond-market selling had recently driven the yield on 10-year Treasuries to a five-year high near 5.3%, and while the yield settled Friday at about 5.14%, the threat of higher borrowing costs has announced itself. Crude oil, at a 10-month high near $70 a barrel, made for a dual set of worries. \u001d  Almost exactly a year after stocks mounted a stubborn 24% climb, investors now have to grapple with a recently-rare thing: a stalled rally. \u001d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its second-worst week this year and closed down 279, or 2.1%, to 13,360. The S&P 500 fell for the second time in three weeks and lost 30, or 2%, to 1503. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 38, or 1.4%, to 2589, while the Russell 2000 index of small stocks gave up 13, or 1.6%, to 835. \u001d  Bulls will put a positive spin on the pause, pronouncing such consolidation a constructive necessity for the bull's onward charge. A wholly unscientific poll, conducted over several happy hours, also suggests that many traders do not see higher interest rates hurting stocks until the 10-year yield tops 5.5%. \u001d  Bond yields are not there -- yet. But as Natexis Bleichroeder's ever-entertaining technical analyst John Roque noted (in a report entitled \"Oh, Say! Can You See?\"), yield charts have crucially started to turn up after a prolonged decline. In fact, the 10-year yield has nudged above its recently-upward-sloping 50- and 200-day moving averages. \"It's a trite line, but if the yield were a stock we'd be getting long,\" Roque says. \u001d  Meanwhile, the number of new highs at the New York Stock Exchange each week has steadily constricted -- from 759 in late April, to 618 in late May to 436 in mid-June. At the very least, this narrowing leadership points to the increasing importance of stock-picking from here. \u001d  On Tuesday, General Electric's (ticker: GE) 3.2% pop to a fresh five-year high brought out the cheers on an otherwise drab day. But was the bellwether's move such a promising omen? Oppenheimer's chief market technician Carter Worth counted only 40 instances -- out of more than 4,000 trading days since 1990 -- when GE rallied 3% or more while the market remained unmoved. The S&P 500 would make little to no progress two, even four weeks later. \"This isn't necessarily the confirmation of strength everyone hopes it is,\" Worth says. \"It could also be the market hiding in a big, safe stock,\" a shift often seen in the later stage of a mature, waning rally. \u001d  Diligent option-hedging and rampant skepticism -- short interest at the NYSE, for instance, jumped 6%, to a record 12.47 billion shares in June -- suggest any correction won't prove crippling. And deal-making, or the mere whiff of it, continued to encourage the serial optimists. \u001d  On Friday, Macy's (M) jumped more than 6% on chatter that its steady cash flow and choice real estate have earned the attention of buyout firms -- never mind a balance sheet already levered after recent big mergers. A noisy rumor that the staid Honda Motor (HMC) is lusting after Harley Davidson (HOG) revved up enough buyers to drive Harley shares up 4%. \u001d  Last week's news, and the handwringing, centered on the collapse of two Bear Stearns (BSC) hedge funds that invested in \"high-grade\" securities backed by subprime mortgages. A slight retreat in brokerage and bank stocks indicates little fear of contagion or systemic damage. But will lenders now begin to reprice risk? \u001d  \"The good news is that the markets have proven themselves to be eminently capable of taking a counterparty default in stride,\" notes the independent research firm CreditSights. \"The bad news is that this market is well overdue for a correction, and its resilience is likely to be sorely tested if the situation at the Bear Stearns funds is not an isolated event.\" \u001d  In any case, a credit market already bogged down by worries about higher interest rates, subprime downgrades, counterparty risk and a loaded upcoming supply calendar could remain under pressure. And until that bond-market cloud dissipates, the outlook may not brighten much for the stock market. \b \u001d  The average American adult, according to the government, is an inch taller but a full 25 pounds heftier than he or she was in the 1960s. Paradoxically, we're also more active (or try to be), thanks to the pressure to play hard, look hot and sport a six-pack. The result: creaky joints, and quite a few bum knees. \u001d  But America's pain is DJO's gain. The Vista, Calif., company (DJO) is the U.S. market leader in non-operative orthopedic care, with more than 700 products, including braces for knees, ankles, elbows and every injury-prone body part; an array of \"soft goods\" like neoprene sleeves; and \"pain-management\" products like pumps and cold therapy. Its brands, like DonJoy, ProCare and Aircast, are familiar to professional jocks and weekend warriors alike. \u001d  Lately, however, it's the stockholders who are hurting. Shares took a beating in May when they slipped to a 15-month low near 31 after DJO reported its second earnings miss in a row. And while the stock has hobbled back to about 39, it's still 14% off its late-November high. \u001d  The pullback was treated as a buying opportunity by some hedge funds, like Millbrook Capital Management -- which has accumulated a 9.4% stake in the company. Millbrook is seeking regulatory clearance to buy more shares, possibly up to 14.9%. That news sent DJO up 6% Friday, to 41.33. \u001d  It's not difficult to see why the firm pounced. The injury-care business is recession-proof, and DJO boasts gross margins near 60%. DJO's earnings flub also was caused by glitches -- like $2 million in cost overruns -- as it struggled to absorb a recent acquisition of Aircast, the No. 1 name in ankle casts. \u001d  Notes Piper Jaffray analyst Mark Mullikin: \"Management took a big bite when it did the deal, and appears to have underestimated the amount of time it would need to chew and digest the acquisition.\" DJO has since resolved most of the issues, although margins may take a few quarters to fully recover. \u001d  It also wasn't the first time DJO has missed its mark. The stock staggered for a while in 2004, after DJO acquired a bone-growth-stimulation business. But management swiftly righted its error, shares rebounded, and the unit grew to account for 16% of last year's revenue. \u001d  In fact, through a string of deals, DJO has built a leading 25% share of the growing but fragmented segment. DJO's geographic reach is also broadening, with 22% of 2007 revenue expected to come from overseas, up from less than 12% in 2005. \u001d  Canaccord Adams analyst William Plovanic expects DJO to earn $2 a share in 2008, up from $1.24 in 2007 and 54 cents in 2006. With mid-cap medical-technology companies trading at an average 23.7 times 2008 earnings, DJO's 20.7 multiple manages to look reasonable. He expects strong cash flow to help DJO pare debt and grow per-share earnings \"well in excess of revenues for at least the next three to four years.\" \u001d  Better medicine is another catalyst, as masochists who once suffered in silence increasingly opt for surgery, and each procedure means more post-operative brace sales. Also, \"demographics favor DJO,\" says Jerome Lande, Millbrook's executive vice president. \"People's knees break down as a result of getting older, getting fatter and being more physically active -- all three of which are true of the U.S. population.\" The firm sees shares trading near 60 within one to two years. \b \u001d  In banks' escalating battle for customers, the humble ATM has emerged as a weapon of choice. No longer content to just spit out cash, ATMs increasingly are called upon to do more: process bulk deposits, remember customers' banking habits, reduce the hassle of personal-ID numbers with fingerprint or eye scans, and meet the self-service customer's every whim. \u001d  Shares of Diebold (DBD), the world's second-largest maker of automated-teller machines, have rallied 32% over the past year, while market leader NCR (NCR) has surged 50%. Although the market struggled recently, Diebold shares, for example, have climbed decisively above their 50-day moving average as the company noisily talks up new \"EmPower\" software that allows banks to customize ATM functions and speed up information management. \u001d  In North America, where there already seems to be an ATM on every corner, the financial self-service market is expected to grow by just 3% to 5% a year, although the Street may have underestimated the demand for upgrades and next-generation technology. \u001d  Yet in less saturated markets, like China, India and Eastern Europe, the growth rate exceeds 10% as banks jockey for the early-mover edge in the nascent self-service banking market. \u001d  The shift toward higher-margin managed services also should generate more cash flow in a business not known to be capital intensive. Diebold, for example, recently shuttered a plant in France, and opened one in Hungary. These and other cost savings could add up to $100 million over the next two years, and Jefferies analyst Yvonne Varano expects \"improving demand for ATMs, and cost savings to drive double-digit earnings growth in the coming years.\" \u001d  Some investors also expect Diebold to sell a business making electronic voting machines that it entered in 2001, but whose security fiascos and missteps led at least one magazine to label Diebold \"an enemy of democracy.\" \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c6e66c315bce2d675e869f51810f8b2a","symR":["AMD","INTC","MRVL","US0079031078","US4581401001"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/25) Tech Trader: Lesson From A Science Fair: Intel Is Back On The Rise","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMD","INTC","MRVL","US0079031078","US4581401001"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Eric J. Savitz \u001d  I spent some time at Intel's campus in Santa Clara, Calif., last week for the annual geekfest known as Research@Intel day. Intel flew in scientists from its research centers in Germany, China, Russia and elsewhere to show off a wide range of research projects. Charmingly unpolished, the event felt like a middle-school science fair, except that all of the exhibitors were wearing black Research at Intel polo shirts. That, and the fact that ultimately this was not just a dayabout R in the long run, what matters is EPS. \u001d  In truth, I went to the Intel event looking for an excuse to write a bullish column on the microprocessor giant (ticker: INTC). I have been writing oodles of posts on my blog about the company of late, many reflecting how Intel may be affected by developments at arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). In particular, the Street is obsessed with any scrap about AMD's much-anticipated new server processor, Barcelona. Whether or not Barcelona is the chip that saves AMD, that kind of short-term focus misses Intel's long-term strengths. And I came away from the Research Day convinced that Intel has the right instincts to complete its turnaround and blow past AMD. \u001d  This is not to say there was any single thing at Intel's science fair that struck me; it was more the sense that the company is smartly planning beyond the next processor cycle and looking for long-term ways to build the business. Intel displayed a wide variety of projects at the event, many more than I can describe here, but there were a few trends that struck me as worth watching. \u001d  The busiest room Wednesday involved a series of demonstrations on how Intel will be able to produce far more powerful processors than it sells today -- and what people might do with that kind of power. Intel demonstrated an 80-core processor that it claims is the first to offer more than one teraflop of performance. (A teraflop is a trillion floating-point operations per second; in other words, they showed an astounding amount of computing packed into a single chip.) \u001d  Other displays focused on what you might do with that kind of power. For instance, one demo showed a method for automating the process of editing video of sporting events down to the highlights. Another demo involved 3D Web conferencing -- think WebEx meets Worlds of Warcraft. And there was a demonstration of Ct, a version of the programing language C specifically designed to work with multi-core processors. (The t stands for \"throughput.) \u001d  Also in evidence was a big push into mobile computing. I was particularly struck by a series of demos from the company's Seattle lab, where researchers think there is a big opportunity to insert environmental sensors into mobile devices. The idea: Mobile devices are more useful if they know something about the world around them. \u001d  Take, for instance, a goofy gadget Intel calls the Ubifit Garden. Intel built a device roughly the size of a pager that contains a variety of digital sensors, including a thermometer, a barometer, a 3-axis accelerometer, a microphone, a digital compass and sensors for humidity and for visible and infrared light. Worn on your collar or belt, the device then tracks all of your physical activity during the day. Based on the sensor data, plus some special algorithms, it can apparently tell when you are standing around doing nothing and when you are walking, running, biking or doing other physical tasks. The data are then sent wirelessly to your cellphone, which displays -- I am not making this up -- a bunch of digital flowers. The more activity you engage in, the more your digital flowers grow. \u001d  There was lots of other cool stuff. A software program called MashMaker makes it easy to do Website mashups -- combining elements from multiple sites. There was technology to improve battery performance in portable devices. There was a project aimed at reducing power costs in data centers by having them switch from AC power to high-voltage DC power. I also liked the demo of a mesh network using Classmate PCs, low-cost laptops Intel is targeting for students in the developing world (but which Intel likely will eventually sell here, as well). \u001d  The big takeaway is that Intel is thinking big -- and thinking ahead. The market doesn't think that far ahead, though. While the stock is up about 27% since April, the shares continue to be buffeted by rumors about the status of Barcelona. \u001d  This is all short-term noise. Intel continues to dominate the global market for microprocessors. Its market share varies, but tends to hover around 80%. AMD has most of the rest. For years, Intel more or less tolerated AMD as a necessary evil, a buffer against the antitrust police. But in 2003, 2004 and 2005, a funny thing happened on the way to the monopoly: Intel stumbled badly, and AMD briefly had the technological edge. From early January 2004 through mid-2006, the stock lost half of its value. The company responded with a series of belt-tightening moves, cutting heads and chopping costs. And it is now on the mend. \u001d  David Readerman, an analyst at Marsico Capital in Denver, notes that Intel, a company with a $140 billion market cap, has become a turnaround story. Readerman points out that revenue in the June quarter should come in at about $8.8 billion, up from $8 billion a year ago; the previous quarter, revenue was actually off a tad year over year. He also says the June quarter should be the trough for gross margins. Intel continues to take steps to fix its cost structure, unloading its mobile-phone processor business to Marvell (MRVL) and spinning off its money-losing NOR flash-memory business into a joint venture. There is also speculation on the Street that Intel will tighten capital spending to help soak up excess capacity and boost margins. \u001d  Let's not forget that Intel remains a powerhouse in semiconductor manufacturing; it has begun transitioning from 65 nm line widths on its chips to 45 nm; AMD is not there yet. And in fact, there is growing belief that AMD is planning to start outsourcing at least a portion of its production. Goldman Sachs analyst Jim Covello recently upgraded his rating on Intel on the theory that Intel will benefit from AMD's outsourcing moves. His view is that pricing pressure in downturns will be more muted if there is less dedicated processor manufacturing -- and that Intel will widen its edge in production if AMD is not in direct control of its fabs. \u001d  Intel has manufacturing strength, a new focus on cost controls, a wounded rival and a vision of the future. In short, as you look out over the next few years, your portfolio really should have Intel inside. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: eric.savitz@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c72920336fde4dab27d7b4336a4775f8","symR":["PFE","US7170811035"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Exubera Demonstrated Pulmonary Safety with Blood Sugar Control in Three-Year Interim Analyses","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T15:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PFE","US7170811035"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 23, 2007-- \u001d  Results from three-year interim analyses of two ongoing long-term clinical trials showed that small mean declines in lung function in diabetes patients who took Exubera(R) (insulin human (rDNA origin)) Inhalation Powder reversed when Exubera was discontinued. Upon re-initiation of Exubera, lung function changes similar to first time users of Exubera were observed. The studies also showed that patients on an Exubera regimen maintained blood sugar control and generally gained less weight over the three-year period than those on an injected insulin regimen. These data were presented today at the 67th Annual Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association. \b \u001d  In the first two years of these studies, Exubera patients had small and non-progressive mean declines in lung function that reversed one month after discontinuing treatment. Upon re-initiation of Exubera, small changes in lung function re-appeared and were consistent with those shown in previous Exubera studies. These studies are part of the largest database of pulmonary function in patients with diabetes. \b \u001d  \"These data further our understanding of the pulmonary profile of Exubera. This highly effective treatment option will help patients control their blood sugar levels, which is critical given the progressive nature of diabetes and the challenges related to treating and managing the disease over time,\" said Dr. William Cefalu, lead investigator and Chief of the division of nutrition and chronic diseases at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, a campus of the Louisiana State University System, in Baton Rouge. \b \u001d  The rates of diabetes are high and growing in almost all areas of the globe. By 2030, the World Health Organization predicts that 366 million people worldwide will have diabetes. \b \u001d  The ADA recognizes insulin as the most effective medication to control blood sugar, and despite this, studies have shown that people - even those poorly controlled - delay the initiation of insulin for 5 years or longer. Injection fear and anxiety are often cited as some of the key reasons to delay. \b \u001d  \"Patients have stated that Exubera has had a positive impact on their diabetes and some of these patients have been taking Exubera for up to eight years,\" said Rochelle Chaiken, M.D., vice president cardiovascular medical group leader at Pfizer. \"We are committed to educating physicians and patients about the critical role that earlier insulin initiation may play in managing this disease.\" \b \b   Cefalu et al Study: Type 2 Diabetes \b \b-- The primary endpoint was to evaluate pulmonary safety in patients \b   without underlying lung disease upon discontinuation and \b   re-initiation of Exubera. \b \b-- 627 adults with type 2 diabetes who had stable injected insulin \b   therapy (basal insulin, plus two or three injections of \b   short-acting insulin) at baseline were randomized to receive either \b   Exubera or continued injected insulin therapy for two years, \b   followed by a six month wash-our period during which all patients \b   received injected insulin, and subsequent re-administration of \b   their original randomized therapy for six-months. \b \b-- Exubera was well-tolerated and this study confirmed that mean \b   decreases in lung function as measured by FEV1 and DLco relative to \b   comparator treatments were small, occurred early, did not progress \b   and showed resolution one month after discontinuation of therapy. \b \b-- The study also showed the following: \b \b     -- Baseline blood sugar levels (A1C) were 7.7 percent in both \b        groups. After three years, patients in both groups had similar \b        improvement or maintained their blood sugar levels (A1C levels \b        of approximately 7.4 percent after 3 years). \b \b     -- Patients using Exubera achieved lower fasting blood sugar \b        levels throughout the study versus comparator. \b \b     -- Patients using Exubera gained less weight (3.5 kg, 7.7 pounds) \b        than those using injected insulin (4.1 kg, 9.1 pounds) over \b        the three-year study period despite comparable blood sugar \b        control. \b \b-- Adverse events were similar in both groups with the exception of \b   cough and shortness of breath (dyspnea), which were more frequent \b   in the Exubera group. The cough was predominantly mild, occurring \b   shortly after dosing, decreasing over time and rarely resulted in \b   discontinuation of treatment. \b \b-- In addition, the overall hypoglycemic and severe hypoglycemic event \b   rates in the two studies were similar between treatment groups. \b \bHollander et al Study: Type 1 Diabetes \b \b-- This study, with 580 adults with type 1 diabetes, had the same \b   endpoints and methodology as the type 2 diabetes study. \b \b-- Exubera was well-tolerated, with comparable lung function changes, \b   and this study confirmed that mean decreases in lung function \b   relative to comparator treatments were small, occurred early, did \b   not progress and showed resolution one month after discontinuation \b   of therapy. \b \b-- The study also showed the following: \b \b     -- Baseline blood sugar levels (A1C) were 7.4 percent (Exubera) \b        and 7.5 percent (injected insulin). Over three years, blood \b        sugar control was generally well maintained (A1C levels of \b        7.6 percent on Exubera and 7.2 percent on injected insulin). \b \b     -- Patients using Exubera gained less weight (1.6 kg, 3.5 pounds) \b        than those using injected insulin (2.9 kg, 6.4 pounds) over \b        the three-year study period. \b \b-- Adverse events were similar in both groups with the exception of \b   cough, which was more frequent in the Exubera group. The cough was \b   predominantly mild, occurring shortly after dosing and rarely \b   resulted in discontinued treatment. In addition, the overall \b   hypoglycemic and severe hypoglycemic event rates in the two studies \b   were similar between treatment groups. \b \b   About Exubera \b \u001d  Exubera is the first inhaled form of insulin and the first insulin option in the U.S., European Union, Mexico and Brazil in 85 years that does not need to be administered by injection. \b \u001d  It is a rapid-acting insulin that is inhaled through the mouth prior to eating, using the handheld Exubera Inhaler. The unique Exubera(R) Inhaler produces a standing cloud of insulin powder, which is designed to pass rapidly into the bloodstream to regulate the body's blood sugar levels. \b \u001d  In the U.S., Exubera is a prescription medicine approved for the treatment of adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes for the control of high blood sugar levels. Patients with type 1 diabetes will still have to take some injected insulin in addition to Exubera. Some, but not all, patients with type 2 diabetes will also need to take some injected insulin in addition to Exubera. \b \u001d  In the European Union, Exubera is approved for the treatment of adult patients with type 2 diabetes who require insulin therapy and are not adequately controlled with diabetes pills. In patients with type 1 diabetes, Exubera should be used in combination with long or intermediate acting insulin. \b \u001d  Exubera is currently available in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Mexico, Spain and Brazil. \b \u001d  Exubera is marketed by Pfizer and is a product of a developmental collaboration between Pfizer and Nektar Therapeutics. \b \b   Important Safety Information about Exubera \b \u001d  Exubera may lower your lung function, so you will need to take a breathing test before you start treatment and, from time to time, as you keep taking Exubera. \b \u001d  You should not take Exubera if you have an unstable or poorly controlled lung disease (such as unstable or poorly controlled asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or if you smoke, start smoking, or quit smoking less than 6 months ago. \b \u001d  You should not take Exubera if you are under 18 years of age or if you are allergic to insulin or any of the inactive ingredients in Exubera. \b \u001d  Tell your health care provider about all your health and medical conditions, including if you have any lung disease or breathing problems, if you are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant. \b \u001d  As with all forms of insulin, a possible side effect of Exubera is low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be mild to severe. It is important to check your blood sugar as your health care provider has advised you. Other common side effects are cough, dry mouth and chest discomfort. \b \u001d  Patients and health care providers in the U.S. can call 1-800-EXUBERA (800-398-2372) or visit www.EXUBERA.com and register to receive more information about Exubera, including the Medication Guide and the full prescribing information. \b \b    CONTACT: Pfizer Inc \b             Vanessa Aristide, 212-733-3784 or 917-697-0481 \b             or \b             Jennifer Brendel, 212-733-9690 or 917-837-3867 \b \b    SOURCE: Pfizer Inc \bCopyright Business Wire 2007 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 11:00 ET (15:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"ce1f74d5ff97235928ed52d498ba66bc","symR":["ARB","CCU"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Clear Channel In Broad Pact With New Arbitron Ratings System","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T04:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ARB","CCU"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","BRD","MED","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Shira Ovide \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In a major win for Arbitron Inc. (ARB), Clear Channel Communications Inc. (CCU) has agreed to a broad deal to use Arbitron's new electronic radio-ratings system, according to a source familiar with the deal. \u001d  The country's largest radio chain is expected to sign a multiyear agreement to subscribe to Arbitron's \"portable people meter\" - or PPM - system for measuring radio audiences. The contract covers the country's largest 50 radio markets. \u001d  The deal ensures a wide adoption of the ratings system, which for the first time seeks to electronically calculate which radio stations people listen to and for how long. The agreement also may end resistance to Arbitron's new ratings methodology. Radio companies, including Clear Channel, have complained the new system is too costly and uses flawed technology. \u001d  San Antonio-based Clear Channel may have had little choice but to embrace the PPM system. For years, advertising rates in radio have been tied to ratings calculated from people jotting down their listening habits in paper diaries. Advertisers have been pushing radio broadcasters and Arbitron to adopt more modern and accurate methodologies, particularly as the rise of advertising on the Web promises more precision in counting audiences for marketing pitches. \u001d  Philadelphia earlier this year became the first market to use the PPM to calculate radio ratings. The rollout into other major cities is expected to take several years. \u001d  Large radio companies, including Emmis Communications Corp. (EMMS) and CBS Corp. (CBS), have agreed at least in part to have their ratings measured by PPM. \u001d  Participating broadcasters put codes into their programming that are read by the pager-sized PPM gadgets Arbitron's sample audience will carry with them. The devices detect what the wearer listens to throughout the day, eliminating the problem of people forgetting to write down what they listen to as they jump around the dial. \u001d  Despite its embrace of the PPM, Clear Channel is leaving its options open. The company, which is slated to be acquired by a private equity group, continues to evaluate alternative measurement systems for radio ratings, according to the source familiar with the Arbitron deal. \u001d  Along with other broadcasters, Clear Channel has sponsored tests of a competing radio-ratings system for research firms the Media Audit and Ipsos SA. \u001d  Broad adoption of the PPM system is expected to propel profits for Arbitron.

Sears \u001d  Somehow, viewing Detroit's labor negotiations through a binomial-options-matrix model seems as incongruous as a merger between Daimler and Chrysler. \u001d  Yet Citigroup analysts have developed such a model, and they have identified 17 scenarios in which Ford (ticker: F) and General Motors (GM) might realize savings from the United Auto Workers union. Chrysler, which Daimler recently sold to a private equity firm, wasn't included in the report. \u001d  The complex model used by the Citigroup team, whose members are skilled in equity derivatives, corporate-bond research, capital structures and the auto industry, simply concludes that investors should buy GM January 35 calls. It also recommends financing the purchase by selling a \"strangle\" on Ford composed of January 7.50 puts and January 10 calls. (In a strangle, an investor holds both a call and a put on a stock. The options have different strike prices but the same maturity.) The Citigroup model also recommends hedging the strangle with credit-derivatives swaps. \u001d  Try telling that to the more than 738,000 active and retired UAW members who will be affected by the negotiations. Or this: \"Using a binomial options framework, we estimate the value of potential concessions for Ford at $1.11 per share and for GM shares at roughly $5.01,\" the analysts advised clients in a recent note. They expect Ford's shares, recently quoted at $8.83, to stay in a range between $7.50 and $10. If the model is right, investors would pocket the premium. If GM's shares -- recently at $34.22 -- aren't higher than $35 at expiration, investors would lose the money spent on the call. \u001d  \"This is one of those situations where there is potentially big upside. It's much cheaper to play it with derivatives than to do it with the equity,\" says Jon Rogers, Citigroup's auto analyst. \"What we've essentially done is give people with a risk tolerance for derivatives a free way to play big moves in the stock.\" \u001d  The opinion on Ford's stock trajectory reflects the company's poor chance -- at least in Rogers' estimation -- of achieving more than limited savings in the labor talks. GM's stock may have more upside due to factors including its capital structure. Ford has 1.8 billion shares outstanding, and the float would grow if Ford's stock advances beyond $10, triggering a convertible security that would result in 400 million additional shares, Rogers says. General Motors has only 566 million shares outstanding, so \"a billion in savings means more to GM than Ford on an earnings-per-share basis.\" \u001d  What, if any, concessions the auto makers will receive is unclear, but they're reportedly asking the union for $10 billion worth, so they can better battle Asian vehicle producers. Informal talks with the UAW have started; formal ones begin in mid-summer. The contract expires Sept. 14. \u001d  \"There's a soft economy and declining truck market share and both GM and Ford [will] survive but [they'll] survive as smaller companies that sell smaller cars,\" Rogers predicts. \u001d  Hmm. Sounds like a good reason to buy calls on Toyota (TM), too. \u001d  --- \u001d  e-mail:steven.sears@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e3b80f493cb4b8e4824b85624bff9e36","symR":["BITAL.YY","DB1.XE","ISE","LSE.LN","NDAQ","NYX","OMX.SK","DE0005810055","GB00B0SWJX34","SE0000110165"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Borsa Italiana, LSE Say Merger Values Borsa At EUR1.63B","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T09:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BITAL.YY","DB1.XE","ISE","LSE.LN","NDAQ","NYX","OMX.SK","DE0005810055","GB00B0SWJX34","SE0000110165"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","SCR","XDAX","XDJGI","XHEX","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSTF","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 05:36 ET (09:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ea8c206390f14c9b61bb92690adf2cfe","symR":["OXY","OXY"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Yemeni Guard Shoots Up Occidental Oil Site, One Killed","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T12:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OXY"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 08:15 ET (12:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f006fe997417216ed17964ec1d493335","symR":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BBV","BBVA.MC","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113211835","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Santander Chief Sees '07 Profit Up 21%, Highest Ever","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T11:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30086.AE","30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BBV","BBVA.MC","BCS","FORB.BT","FORSY","RBS.LN","SAN.MC","STD","BE0003801181","ES0113211835","ES0113900J37","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XB20","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XIBEX","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Christopher Bjork \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  SANTANDER, Spain (Dow Jones)--Spain's Santander Central Hispano SA (STD) expects ordinary net profit to grow 21% this year, Chairman Emilio Botin said Saturday during the bank's annual general meeting. \u001d  Botin told shareholders that his bank, Spain's largest by assets, is on its way to a record result in 2007. He said that he expects Santander to reach a 2007 net profit - excluding extraordinary gains - of more than EUR8 billion, compared with EUR6.58 billion in the same period last year. \u001d  \"Santander is well positioned to continue to grow more than its competitors,\" the 73-year-old Santander chief said. \u001d  \"We have an outstanding position today because we have combined a strategy of organic, sustainable and recurrent growth with corporate transactions throughout our history.\" \u001d  Botin said Santander will call an extraordinary general meeting for July 27 to ask shareholders to approve a EUR9 billion equity issue as part of its plan to buy about a third of ABN Amro Holding NV (ABN). \u001d  Santander is part of a trio of European banks trying to take over and split the Dutch bank between them, and has said it is willing to pay EUR19.9 billion in cash and shares for ABN's Brazilian and Italian units. \u001d  \"For Santander, there are very clear advantages to this transaction which, if it occurs, will enable us to buy some very interesting assets,\" he added. \u001d  A successful bid for the ABN Amro units would give Santander a solid foothold in Italy, and give it control of the third-largest banking network in Brazil. \u001d  The bidding group, which includes Santander's long-time business partner Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN)and Fortis NV (FORSY), has outlined a EUR71.1 billion ($96 billion) offer for ABN Amro. \u001d  The proposed offer, the biggest ever in the banking industry, is competing with a friendly, lower, bid for the Dutch bank made by Barclays PLC (BCS). \u001d  At Saturday's meeting, held in its northern Spanish home city of Santander, Botin said he was still optimistic about global economic conditions. \u001d  \"We believe that the boom has not yet come to an end,\" Botin said. \"We will have somewhat higher interest rates, markets may become more volatile and growth may slow in some economies. but global expansion, already in its longest phase in 35 years, is built on a very broad base.\" \u001d   Santander, with a market capitalization of slightly more than EUR85 billion, is the euro zone's largest bank by market value. It also controls the largest banking franchise in Latin America and a big U.K. lender. \u001d  On Spain, Botin said the red-hot housing market had begun a healthy cooling process. \"A slowing of growth has begun, which is positive, good even.\" \u001d  Like its rival Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBV), Santander is profiting from the resurgent economies in Latin America, which are in their fourth consecutive year of balanced growth. Exposure to these markets has helped make Santander and BBVA two of Europe's fastest-growing banks. \u001d  Botin said he was optimistic about the region's outlook for the rest of the year. \u001d  After a strong share performance last year, when the stock rose 27%, Santander shares are down around 1% so far this year, while the the Spanish benchmark index IBEX-35 is up about 5%. Uncertainty related to the offer for ABN Amro is weighing on the share price, analysts say. \u001d  Botin said that he was optimistic about the stock in the medium term. \"Remember what happened with Abbey: the market initially punished us, but then went on to reward our strategy,\" Botin said, referring to Santander's 2004 purchase of U.K. mortgage lender Abbey National. \u001d  Ibersecurities analyst Mario Lodos, who has a buy rating on the stock, said that the 2007 target looked ambitious. \u001d  \"I think it's doable, but many investors are gonna be skeptical that they can reach such a figure, which would be the highest in the euro zone,\" Lodos said. \u001d  Botin added that Santander will pay on August 1 a first dividend on 2007 results of EUR0.12294, 15% higher than its first dividend in 2006. \u001d  In the first quarter, Santander posted a 21% rise in net profit to EUR1.9 billion, backed by strong growth at its main businesses in Latin America, Spain and the U.K. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.santander.com \b \u001d  -By Christopher Bjork, Dow Jones Newswires, +34 91 395 81 23, christopher.bjork@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 07:19 ET (11:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f185de4ab47f6bb35330975561f35adb","symR":["GMEXICO.MX","PCU","PCU.VL","MXP370841019","US8436111046"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Unions At Southern Peru's Operations Begin Strike - Unions","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T12:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GMEXICO.MX","PCU","PCU.VL","MXP370841019","US8436111046"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","ONF","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LIMA (Dow Jones)--Unionized workers at Southern Copper Corp.'s (PCU) Cuajone and Toquepala mines and its Ilo smelter and refinery in Peru went on strike early Saturday, a union leader said. \u001d  Unionized workers presented a strike notice a week ago after collective agreement talks with the company broke down. \u001d  A series of additional talks between the company and union representatives were held this week but also failed to reach an agreement. \u001d  \"The strike started this morning,\" said union leader Remberto Garcia Prieto in a telephone interview from Toquepala. \u001d  \"The paralyzation started this morning. It is a total paralyzation,\" said Ramon More, secretary general at the Cuajone union unit, in a telephone interview. \u001d  The main points on the agenda are a salary increase and the length of the new collective agreement. \u001d  According to union officials, the company wants a new six-year agreement and is offering an extremely low salary increase. \u001d  The union officials said that the company will be able to continue operating but at a reduced capacity. \u001d  They added that the Ministry of Labor has declared the strike inadmissible, which means that the company can continue to use administration and other workers to carry out functions. \u001d  \"It doesn't mean that the production will be shut down, but it does mean that they won't be able to produce at 100%, as they are using untrained workers,\" said More. \u001d  Southern Copper Corp. Chief Executive Oscar Gonzalez Rocha said recently that the planned strike could affect up to 5% of the company's copper production in Peru. \u001d  The company has a series of contingency plans it puts in place in order to maintain production levels. \u001d  Gonzalez Rocha previously said that the company forecasts producing some 700,000 tons for this year, in operations in both Mexico and Peru. \u001d  In late April and early May this year, workers from the three units downed tools to support a strike led by Peru's National Federation of Mining, Metallurgy and Steel Workers and to push for their own demands. \u001d  Workers at Toquepala and Cuajone had earlier walked out in April 2004. \u001d  They walked off the job for the second time that year in August 2004 to back demands for better wages, among other issues. \u001d  That strike, which also lasted two weeks, was declared illegal by Peru's Ministry of Labor. \u001d  At that time, Gonzalez Rocha said that production was slightly affected but that sales were spared due to inventories. \u001d  Southern Copper operates mines, smelting and refining facilities in Mexico and Peru. Grupo Mexico (GMEXICO.MX) has a 75.1% stake in Southern Copper. \u001d  The company posted full-year 2006 net income of $2.02 billion, compared with $1.40 billion the year before. \u001d  Its first-quarter 2007 net income totaled $563.5 million, up from $421.6 million in the same quarter a year earlier. \b \u001d  -By Robert Kozak, Dow Jones Newswires;peru@dowjones.com; 51-1-221 7050 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 08:48 ET (12:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f44b64f7c085acf5f074705a0655b1fe","symR":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Eni CEO Says Pipeline Construction May Start In '08 Or '09","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T13:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["E","ENI.MI","GSPBEX.RS","IT0003132476","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","OIL","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 23, 2007 09:06 ET (13:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f4e324fcf7b925e52ea6cb4f6dca1da4","symR":["BA","LMT","RTN","US0970231058","US5398301094","US7551115071"],"date":"2007-06-23","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Raytheon CEO Calls On US To Break Out Of 'Space Malaise'","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-23T21:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BA","LMT","RTN","US0970231058","US5398301094","US7551115071"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","DFN","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Rebecca Christie \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--Raytheon Co. (RTN) Chief Executive William Swanson said the U.S. needs to break out of its \"space malaise\" through more stable funding and better performance on development programs. \u001d  Swanson said space programs are one of the defense industry's most pressing challenges as the Pentagon budget makes its way across Capitol Hill. Big-ticket space programs have a long history of running over budget and behind schedule, leading Congress to cut funding and add even more constraints. \u001d  \"My biggest concern is space,\" Swanson said in a Paris Air Show interview. \"You're usually pushing the requirements. Funding is not always stable. When you have all of those things happening, you have a troubled environment.\" \u001d  Swanson said industry needs to do its part by performing well on the projects it takes on. This means understanding the risks involved and working with the government to keep programs on track, he said. \u001d  Raytheon makes sensors, ground stations and other equipment for Pentagon space programs, though usually not the satellites themselves. This means the company often plays a supporting role on big space programs, although it has snagged some big wins like a recent $960 million pact to make satellite terminals for the U.S. Navy. \u001d  Also, Raytheon has made experimental systems for so-called operationally responsive space, the Pentagon's effort to develop smaller, cheaper satellites that can launch quickly when needed. U.S. officials say this area is one of their biggest space interests, but so far the Pentagon budget hasn't followed suit. \u001d  Other major players in the space industry say that even though the Defense Department budget is on track to top $600 billion this year, it has relatively little flexibility for new projects. War operations, personnel costs and existing weapons-buying commitments mean there's no room to move large amounts of money into new areas, said Roger Krone, president of Boeing Co.'s (BA) networks and space systems unit. \u001d  \"We're going to see it in the hundreds of millions first, before we see it in the billions,\" Krone said in an air show interview, on the funding prospects for quick-launch space projects. Still, such responsive space systems will remain an area of interest for the U.S., particularly if bigger and more established satellite systems run into technical or other difficulties. \u001d  One of the Pentagon's biggest and most ambitious satellite programs, the $24 billion Transformational Satellite Communications program known as TSAT, is moving forward this year after a string of funding cuts and restructuring. \u001d  The Air Force plans to decide this year between Boeing and Lockheed Martin Co.
