Meanwhile, the Fidelity International Real Estate fund has switched managers twice in the past two years. \u001d  \"That's the kind of manager musical chairs I don't like,\" says the 58-year-old Mr. Genovese, director of the Orlando division of the South Florida Water Management District. \"I'm putting my life savings into mutual funds -- I don't want someone practicing with my money.\" \u001d  Fidelity says its new manager, Steve Buller, has nine years of experience in the real-estate sector and \"that the fund is in good hands.\" And Mr. Buller points out that he managed the fund after it was first launched in 2004, and then turned it over to a colleague. \"I just reassumed something that I had launched many years ago and am very familiar with the space,\" he says. \u001d  Still, Mr. Genovese's concern is a common one among mutual-fund investors. People are often reluctant to invest in a fund that changes managers frequently, for fear that the new leader isn't seasoned enough to navigate the sector successfully. \u001d  Now there's finally some data to back up the conventional wisdom. According to a pair of new studies, managers who have been with their funds for a long time tend to deliver better returns than managers with a shorter tenure. \u001d  For the five years ended Dec. 31, the average tenure of a portfolio manager of a large-company stock fund was 5.6 years, according to a study by Standard & Poor's Corp., a division of McGraw-Hill Cos. But the managers who consistently ranked in the top half of the group had a much longer average tenure: 9.5 years. \u001d  In another study, S&P found that the length of a manager's tenure stood out \"as a primary differentiator\" of the funds that beat their peers or the index. Tenure was more linked to long-term success than lower expenses or diversification of holdings. S&P didn't provide specific data about that observation, however. \u001d  These statistics confirm what many mutual-fund watchers already suspect. Indeed, research firms such as Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. have often relied heavily on manager tenure when analyzing funds. \u001d  When Neal Miller retired a year ago after managing Fidelity's New Millennium fund since its inception in 1992, Morningstar went so far as to say, \"With the departure of its longtime skipper, there's little reason to own this mutual fund.\" \u001d  Mr. Miller had a reputation as an eclectic stock picker who consistently beat his peers by being early to spot trends among midsize companies. \"He was just a tremendous iconoclast,\" says Dan Lefkovitz, Morningstar's Fidelity analyst. \"Not that the new manager was bad; he was unknown.\" \u001d  Mr. Miller's replacement, John Roth, was a relative Fidelity newcomer whose experience was in funds that focus on a specific area, such as the chemicals sector, rather than in diversified funds like New Millennium. \u001d  In the 11 months since Mr. Roth took over, the fund has returned 16.3%, lagging behind the 22.6% total return of its benchmark, the S&P 500. By contrast, in the roughly 11 months before Mr. Miller left, the fund returned 16.6%, well above the benchmark's 4.7%. \u001d  A Fidelity spokesman says the company is confident in Mr. Roth. Along with managing sector funds, the spokesman says, Mr. Roth was an analyst who supplied \"successful investment ideas\" to diversified funds. \u001d  In addition, \"John has only been managing the fund for a little more than nine months, which is a relatively short period of time around which to measure performance,\" says the spokesman. \"We tend to look at performance over longer periods, as do our mutual-fund shareholders.\" \u001d  Fund firms know how suspicious investors can be about management changes. The firms are all too aware that they are \"vulnerable to having assets march out the door\" when top managers leave, says Jim Lowell, editor of Fidelity Investor, an independent newsletter about Fidelity funds, and founder of a subscription service that ranks fund managers. \u001d  Big pension funds, in particular, sometimes yank millions of dollars from a fund company when a successful, veteran portfolio manager leaves. In January, for example, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association took assets out of Pyramis Global Advisors, a unit of Fidelity. Why? James Rutherford, a star European portfolio manager for Pyramis, left after 18 years to go to a smaller firm. \u001d  The pension fund says it was worried about \"instability\" because of Mr. Rutherford's departure, and so it moved more than $600 million to Barclays Global Investors, a unit of Barclays PLC. \u001d  A Fidelity spokesman says Pyramis has retained \"the vast majority of assets\" invested under Mr. Rutherford and has continued to gain investors in the international funds. The Pyramis assets are entrusted to money managers Peter Hadden and Steve Oler, \"who have 40 years' experience and were very familiar with the strategy's investment process.\" \u001d  Worried about losing assets when star managers leave, some fund complexes have started \"going toward a team-management model to mitigate risks\" from manager changes, says Owen Concannon, an analyst with Financial Research Corp., Boston. \u001d  Fidelity traditionally has been known for its star system. Now the firm tries to make funds less dependent on any one manager by hiring more career-track analysts who will work on funds for years and thus ensure some continuity even when one particular manager departs, says Mr. Concannon. Fidelity says its goal is to increase the depth of its research team. \u001d  Some firms have eschewed the star system for a long time. Capital Research & Management's American Funds, for one, has used that approach since 1958. The fund firm has a general policy of not publicizing the work of individual stock pickers, preferring investors to buy instead based on a fund's overall investment style. The team members are called \"portfolio counselors\" rather than \"portfolio managers.\" \u001d  Even if fund companies stick with the traditional manager system, there are steps they can take to keep investor confidence. For instance, Morningstar continued to rave about MassMutual Financial Group's Oppenheimer Global Fund even after manager Bill Wilby left the fund in 2005 after 13 years at the helm -- because Mr. Wilby had selected and mentored his successor, Rajeev Bhaman. \u001d  The two had co-managed the fund for a year, so analysts figured it was unlikely that Mr. Bhaman would remake the fund or stray from his mentor's proven strategy of buying on bad news, when stocks are often artificially depressed. \u001d  In the roughly 17 months since Mr. Bhaman took over, the fund has mostly stayed even with its benchmark, the Morgan Stanley Capital International index, returning 19.2% compared with the index's 20%, Morningstar says. \u001d  \"It was the ideal way to handle a manager transition,\" says Morningstar's Mr. Lefkovitz, \"to tell shareholders about it way ahead of time so the managers can work together on the fund.\" \u001d  Kurt Wolfgruber, president and chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds Inc., MassMutual's money-management unit, says that the firm recognizes the important role that an experienced manager plays in a fund's performance. So the firm encourages longtime managers to identify successors -- and then mentor them. \"It makes it a much more painless transition,\" he says. \u001d  All of this means that investors should do some research before choosing a stellar fund that has just waved goodbye to its stock-picking guru. Who is taking over? Is it someone with a sparse track record or someone who is very experienced? Is it a longtime analyst who's been with the fund's team and knows the strategy? If so, a manager change might be just fine if the old bench is staying put. \u001d  Not all individual investors, of course, can bail on a fund that already is in their portfolio. Within employers' retirement plans, for instance, fund options often are limited. And investors outside of tax-sheltered accounts will want to weigh the consequences of capital-gains tax before cashing out. \u001d  But given a choice, investors like Mr. Genovese, of South Florida, will pick funds where the nameplates have been up for awhile. \"I worked hard for my money,\" he says. \"I want someone who's been there for a while.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Alex Frangos \u001d  Apartment giant Archstone-Smith Trust's $15.2 billion deal to be acquired by Tishman Speyer Properties and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. carries a relatively modest $235 million breakup fee. \u001d  In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Archstone-Smith, an Englewood, Colo., real-estate investment trust, said it would have to pay the fee if it accepts a superior bid. \u001d  Several investors and analysts have said the Tishman Speyer/Lehman Brothers offer is low considering Archstone-Smith's underlying value. The breakup fee \"seems reasonable and allows another bidder to come in,\" said Craig Leupold, analyst at Green Street Advisors Inc., a Newport Beach, Calif., real-estate research company. \u001d  The fee comes to around 94 cents a share, or 1.5% of the $60.75-a-share offer. Breakup fees vary from deal to deal but are often in the 3% range. \u001d  The filling also disclosed that R. Scot Sellers, Archstone-Smith's chief executive, who has signed an employment agreement to stay with the acquired company, will forgo change-of-control benefits he would have received under previous agreements. \u001d  Archstone-Smith owns 86,000 apartment units across 344 complexes in such high-entry-barrier markets as New York, San Francisco and Germany. \u001d  According to the filing, Tishman Speyer, a closely held New York property company, will contribute $250 million in equity in the deal. Investment arms of Lehman Brothers and Bank of America Corp. will put in $4.85 billion in equity financing.

Aimed primarily at business travelers, the projects include Hilton's first franchise agreement with a major property owner in the U.K. and more than a dozen  full-service hotels in Russia slated to be managed directly by the Beverly Hills, Calif., lodging company. All of the projects are planned to be built through 2012. \u001d  When Hilton decided \"to begin a big push in Russia,\" company executives decided they would \"feel a little bit more comfortable\" adopting a hands-on strategy to oversee operation of those new projects, according to Matthew J. Hart, president and incoming chief executive. The move follows partnerships Hilton announced late last year envisioning construction of as many as 100 hotels throughout India and China. \u001d  Mr. Hart said the latest ventures also underscore Hilton's determination to pick partners with deep pockets and a strong track record of local development. \u001d  In Russia, it said, Hilton linked up with one of its long-standing partners, closely held London & Regional Properties Ltd., to focus not only on Moscow and St. Petersburg but to develop properties in large regional centers with few foreign hotels. \u001d  In the U.K. and Ireland, the partner is Shiva Hotels Ltd., another closely held real-estate firm. The third agreement, covering the Caribbean and Central America, calls for Caribbean Property Group, based in New York, to concentrate projects initially in population centers in Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Panama, the Dominican Republic and Trinidad. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 19:41 ET (23:41 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0659cd8a1afe5016d118d40a213df568","symR":["YRK.LN","GB00B00QHC86"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for York Pharma PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["YRK.LN","GB00B00QHC86"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG"],"Story":"\u001d  York Pharma PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B00QHC86 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:40 ET (09:40 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"06768c342f8d220c9235bfbcacd3e348","symR":["NMB"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen MA Dividend Adv Municipal Fund (NMB)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T08:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NMB"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen MA Dividend Adv Municipal Fund (NMB): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NMB or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 04:54 ET (08:54 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"06806ea8c9363994f64be8713828754d","symR":["AHD","APC","APL","ATLS","US0325111070"],"date":"2007-06-04","ret":[-0.00099,0.9822907,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.015784,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. to -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-04T01:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AHD","APC","APL","ATLS","US0325111070"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","PIP","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations willbe attained.

 (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Peter Loftus \u001d  CHICAGO -- Adding Genentech Inc.'s Avastin cancer drug to a certain chemotherapy regimen modestly improved a measure of survival in people with an advanced form of lung cancer, a new study found. But the study could have negative financial implications for Genentech and its majority owner, Roche Holding AG, because it showed that a lower dose of Avastin was just as good as a higher dose. \u001d  If doctors begin to prescribe lower amounts of the drug, it could slow the blockbuster drug's sales growth. \"You are going to see physicians use the lower dose,\" said Christopher Raymond, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. However, he said it is possible this would be offset by increases in the number of lung-cancer patients who use Avastin. \u001d  Avastin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in October for use in combination with a different chemotherapy regimen -- carboplatin and paclitaxel -- to treat nonsmall-cell lung cancer. The new study tested Avastin in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine. \u001d  Nonsmall-cell lung cancer is the most common form of lung cancer, one of the deadliest and most prevalent types of cancer. \u001d  Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif., had said in February the new study met its primary goal of prolonging progression-free survival, which measures the time until patient death or tumor growth. Full results were released Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. The new study was sponsored by Roche of Switzerland. \u001d  Genentech has signaled that the finding that a lower dose of Avastin was effective could hurt sales. FDA's approval of Avastin in lung cancer last year was at the higher dose, albeit with a different chemotherapy regimen. \u001d  Ian Clark, executive vice president of Genentech's commercial operations, said in April that the presentation of the new study data at the oncology meeting might cause an \"increase in the number of physicians who decide to treat certain patients at this lower dose level.\" \u001d  The study wasn't designed to directly compare the two dosage arms. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 19:38 ET (23:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow

At-Home Viewers Took Center Stage with Interactive Web Wall and New \"Best Movie Spoof\" Winner \b \b \u001d  UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif., June 3 /PRNewswire/ -- MTV pushed the limits for the \"2007 MTV Movie Awards\" as it aired LIVE for the first time welcoming stars, celebrities and fans alike.  Hosted by the incomparable Sarah Silverman, the sixteenth annual ceremony celebrated the audiences' favorite performances and films, and most importantly honored the fans for the first time ever.  The 2007 MTV Movie Awards welcomed legendary actors Jack Nicholson and Johnny Depp as they made their first-ever appearance at the ceremony.  The night also featured heart-stopping and eye-popping performances by Rihanna, featuring Jay-Z as they performed \"Umbrella,\" the #1 song in the country.  And making her first-ever live U.S. television debut, British singer/songwriter Amy Winehouse brought the house down with her electrifying performance of hit single, \"Rehab.\" \b \u001d  \"Best Performance\" honors went to Johnny Depp for his role in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.\"  The MTV audience celebrated Gerard Butler and The Uber Immortal who won \"Best Fight\" for their performance in \"300.\" Will Ferrell and Sacha Baron Cohen won \"Best Kiss\" for \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,\" making it the second year in a row that guys have snagged the best kiss award.  Sacha Baron Cohen also took home \"Best Comedic Performance\" for \"Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\" and \"Transformers\" beat out seven other yet to be released films winning the award for \"Best Summer Movie You Haven't Seen Yet.\" \b \u001d  The night started off in true Sarah Silverman style as she kept the censors on their toes with a song whose only airable words were \"flippety floppety.\" \b \u001d  Mike Myers once again had one of the most memorable moments of the night as he accepted the \"MTV Generation Award\" presented by \"Shrek the Third\" co- star Cameron Diaz. Recognizing him for his dynamic career and acting roles that have captured and entertained MTV audiences for years, Myers accepted the award in true comedic fashion, with an ode to Austin Powers and a mojo-induced dance number. \b \u001d  Newcomer Jaden Smith accepted his first-ever award show win for \"Breakthrough Performance,\" in an over-the-top and side-splitting home video fitting for a kid with superstar parents Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith. \b \u001d  As always, the MTV Movie Awards was filled with laugh-out-loud film parodies including \"Boratitis,\" with Susan Sarandon, Kevin Spacey, Marilyn Manson, Amanda Bynes, Matt Dillon, Aaron Eckhart, Heather Graham, Jennifer Hudson, Eva Mendes, Ryan Reynolds and T.I.,  raising awareness of the spreading epidemic, \"Boratitis,\" which finds people unable to stop imitating everyone's favorite Kazakhstani. \b \u001d  Saying goodbye to boring award show music when acceptance speeches run too long, the \"2007 MTV Movie Awards\" introduced a naked fat man, a la Ken Davitian's character in \"Borat,\" chasing winners off the stage. \b \u001d  The \"2007 MTV Movie Awards\" also invited viewers to take control of the night as MTV rolled out the first-ever \"Best Movie Spoof\" category where they had the opportunity to submit their own original movie shorts parodying films from the past year.  MTV and Yahoo! partnered to launch this interactive website via Yahoo! Movies which explored the convergence of entertainment and technology like never before.  In the weeks leading up to the show, fans submitted more than 400 film spoofs and throughout the contest the finalists received over 250,000 votes combined. \b \u001d  The Web Wall kept a constant flow of fans in the spotlight and on the stage as Sarah interacted with the viewers at home.  While Sarah searched for a presenter for the \"Breakthrough Performance\" category she turned to the all- important Web Wall for a viewer to save the day. \b \u001d  Under Surveillance & On Demand - MTV.com covered all the action on the \bcarpet and backstage that fans didn't see on TV.   There were cameras all over the backstage area -- from green rooms, to dressing rooms -- giving viewers rare glimpses as only MTV could provide.  Exclusive interviews with winners and presenters were also available on MTV.com only.  This year we truly did not know a winner until the last possibly minute, as the MTV Movie Awards left the \"Best Movie\" Category open throughout the show for live voting. \b \u001d  The \"2007 MTV Movie Awards\" welcomed the biggest names in music, movies and more throughout the night. Presenters included Cameron Diaz, Jessica Biel, John Krasinski, Mandy Moore, Robin Williams, Justin Long, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Josh Duhamel, Samuel L. Jackson, Amanda Bynes, Chris Tucker, Seth Rogen, Shia LaBeouf, Michael Chiklis, John Travolta, Zac Efron, Tyrese Gibson, Andy Samberg, Chris Evans and Ioan Gruffudd join the growing list of presenters at the \"2007 MTV Movie Awards.\"  And MTV welcomed Victoria Beckham as she made the \"2007 MTV Movie Awards\" her first official television appearance since moving to the states. \b \b \b    Winners for the \"2007 MTV Movie Awards\" are: \b    BEST MOVIE \b    -- Winner not determined at press time due to live voting throughout the \b       show \b \b    BEST PERFORMANCE \b    -- Johnny Depp- Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (Walt Disney \b       Pictures) \b \b    BREAKTHROUGH PERFORMANCE \b    -- Jaden Smith- The Pursuit of Happyness (Sony Pictures) \b \b    BEST COMEDIC PERFORMANCE \b    -- Sacha Baron Cohen- Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make \b       Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (20th Century Fox) \b \b    BEST KISS \b    -- Will Ferrell & Sacha Baron Cohen- Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky \b       Bobby (Sony Pictures) \b \b    BEST VILLAIN \b    -- Jack Nicholson- The Departed (Warner Bros.

The movie's weekend gross equaled its entire production budget. \u001d  MGM's thriller \"Mr. Brooks,\" with Kevin Costner as a mild-mannered businessman who moonlights as a serial killer, premiered in fourth place with $10 million. \u001d  Picturehouse's sports tale \"Gracie,\" featuring Elisabeth Shue in a film inspired by tragic events in her own life and her teenage days as the only girl on a boys soccer team, opened at No. 7 with $1.4 million. \u001d  The big drop for \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" was typical of summer flicks that open to colossal numbers. In the second weekend, Sony's (SNE) \"Spider-Man 3\" tumbled 62% from its record $151.1 million debut, while DreamWorks Animation's \"Shrek the Third\" fell 57% from its $121.6 million opening. \u001d  While big films once had longer shelf life, most blockbusters today aim to pack in the crowds the first weekend before audiences move on to the next hit. By the second weekend, most people who wanted to catch a big movie already have seen it. \u001d  \"It's exactly where I expected it,\" said Chuck Viane, head of distribution for Disney. \"Once you get everybody who is that avid, crazy fan that's going to see it the first week, then you rely on people who never go out the first week and the people who just come back and back and back.\" \u001d  Overseas, \"At World's End\" did an additional $105.4 million over the weekend to bring its worldwide total to $625.3 million. \u001d  Domestically, the movie has grossed $216.5 million, trailing last summer's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,\" which had a $135.6 million opening and had taken in $258.4 million after its second weekend. \u001d  \"Shrek the Third\" took in $26.7 million domestically to lift its total to $254.6 million. It is rolling out gradually overseas. \u001d  With $7.5 million, \"Spider-Man 3\" padded its domestic haul to $318.3 million. Worldwide, \"Spider-Man 3\" has taken in $844 million, surpassing 2002's \"Spider-Man\" $821 million to become the biggest hit in Sony's history. \u001d  Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Media By Numbers LLC. Final figures will be released Monday. \u001d  1. \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,\" $43.2 million. \u001d  2. \"Knocked Up,\" $29.3 million. \u001d  3. \"Shrek the Third,\" $26.7 million. \u001d  4. \"Mr. Brooks,\" $10 million. \u001d  5. \"Spider-Man 3,\" $7.5 million. \u001d  6. \"Waitress,\" $2 million. \u001d  7. \"Gracie,\" $1.4 million. \u001d  8. \"Bug,\" $1.22 million. \u001d  9. \"28 Weeks Later,\" $1.2 million. \u001d  10. \"Disturbia,\" $1.1 million. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 19:42 ET (23:42 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones &

That left many of these companies with a patchwork of assets across countries that often lacked the scale to compete with the local incumbent. France Telecom, for example, owns mobile or broadband businesses in the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom, among other countries. \u001d  But now, France Telecom is among several companies looking to dump some of those assets and perhaps pick up new ones. France Telecom has put its Netherlands-based cellphone unit on the block. Analysts estimate that the Orange Netherlands unit, the country's No. 4 provider, is valued at about 1.5 billion euros, or around $2 billion. One likely buyer is Deutsche Telekom AG, which could combine the unit with its own Netherlands business, No. 3 T-Mobile, to bulk up. KPN NV and Vodafone Group PLC lead the Dutch market. \u001d  At the same time, Deutsche Telekom is selling broadband units to focus more exclusively on mobile operations outside Germany. It is close to selling its French broadband unit to Neuf Cegetel SA for about 900 million euros. It also put Ya.com, its Spanish broadband unit, up for sale. Since France Telecom owns a mobile and fixed-line business in Spain, Amena, it is considering acquiring Ya.com so it can offer packages of broadband, mobile and television. \u001d  Vodafone has also expressed interest in buying Ya.com, as a way to expand into broadband in Spain, where it already has a mobile-phone business. \u001d  Vodafone shuffled its assets last year, selling stakes in Belgian and Swiss mobile-phone operators for 2 billion euros and 2.6 billion euros, respectively. Vodafone then made a big bet this year on emerging markets by buying a controlling stake in Hutchison Essar Ltd., an Indian mobile-phone operator, for $11.1 billion. \u001d  Other recent merger-and-acquisition activity includes Swisscom AG's acquisition of Italy-based Fastweb SpA, a broadband and Internet-TV specialist, for 3.1 billion euros. \u001d  The deals come as Europe's telecoms try to devise strategies to survive in an increasingly difficult market. Revenue in telecom services across Europe grew less than 3% last year, according to Idate Consulting & Research. \u001d  Fixed-phone revenue is dropping under pressure from free Internet calling services like Skype, while Europe's mobile-phone businesses, long a reliable engine of growth, have been hit hard by European Union regulations mandating lower tariffs for consumers. The EU ordered a decrease in roaming tariffs for cross-border calls and lower charges for calls terminating on other networks. \u001d  Arun Sarin, Vodafone's chief executive, says he expects consolidation in the industry to continue. \u001d  Vodafone has said it would be interested in buying the 56% stake in Vivendi SA's mobile unit, SFR, that it doesn't own, or fixed-line assets in key European markets such as Spain. \u001d  Many had been expecting a more sweeping consolidation among large European telecoms along the lines of what has happened in the U.S., where companies such as AT&T Corp. and SBC Communications Inc. have merged in recent years to cut costs and gain scale. But European telecom operators can't reduce staff as easily, limiting synergies from a merger. At Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, many workers retain civil-servant status from when the companies were state-owned, making it almost impossible to lay them off. \u001d  \"There are such national and political issues tied up with merging incumbents, it just doesn't make any sense economically,\" said Jill Finger Gibson, a research director at IDC. \u001d  Some countries are loath to see their national champions in sectors like telecom tie up with foreign rivals. The Italian government, for example, recently rallied a group of financial institutions to take stakes in Telecom Italia SpA, helping scuttle a potential sale to AT&T and Mexico-based America Movil SA. \u001d  Didier Lombard, chief executive of France Telecom, told a German newspaper last week that big cross-border mergers in Europe are impractical. \"An alliance only makes sense if you can create added value, and this is very difficult to realize in the case of a possible merger of two ex-monopolies,\" Mr. Lombard said. \"We prefer to examine acquisitions in growth markets,\" he said, citing Vietnam and Algeria as countries France Telecom was considering. \u001d  --- \u001d  Cassell Bryan-Low in London contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June

WIRE)--June 04, 2007-- \u001d  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) today announced it has reached an agreement with Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. (NYSE:APL), whereby Anadarko will receive $1.85 billion and Atlas will acquire control of Anadarko's interests in the Chaney Dell and Midkiff/Benedum natural gas gathering systems and associated processing plants. \b \u001d  \"We are extremely pleased with this agreement, which further validates the value of our remaining midstream assets,\" said Al Walker, Anadarko Sr. Vice President, Finance and CFO. \"This transaction also represents the first significant step in our strategy to monetize our midstream assets, which also includes the formation and initial public offering of a midstream Master Limited Partnership (MLP) later this year. In 2006, cash flow before interest and taxes generated by these two systems and facilities totaled approximately $130 million.\" \b \u001d  The Chaney Dell system (100% owned by Anadarko) is located in central Oklahoma and southern Kansas. It consists of approximately 3,500 miles of gathering lines and processing plants with a combined processing capacity of approximately 230 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (MMcf/d). The Midkiff/Benedum gathering systems and processing plants (73% owned by Anadarko) are located in the Spraberry Trend of the Permian Basin near Midland, Texas. This system includes approximately 2,500 miles of gathering lines and processing plants with a combined capacity of approximately 170 MMcf/d. Anadarko has no equity gas production in either of these systems. \b \u001d  \"Our divestiture program has now yielded approximately $12.5 billion in after-tax proceeds from announced and closed transactions,\" added Walker. \"We remain on track to achieve our stated goal of $12 billion of net debt by year end. Coupled with the performance of our retained assets, we are confident in our outlook for the remainder of the year and in our ability to execute on our strategic plan.\" \b \u001d  The parties are forming two separate joint ventures to effect the transactions, which are expected to close in the third quarter of 2007, subject to customary closing conditions and adjustments. The effective date of the transactions is July 1, 2007. \b \u001d  UBS Investment Bank and Citi acted as financial advisors to Anadarko on this transaction. \b \u001d  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural gas resources vital to the world's health and welfare. As of year-end 2006, the company had 3.0 billion barrels-equivalent of proved reserves, making it one of the world's largest independent exploration and production companies. In August 2006, Anadarko acquired Kerr-McGee Corporation and Western Gas Resources, Inc. in separate transactions. For more information about Anadarko, please visit www.anadarko.com. \b \u001d  This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Anadarko believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. No assurance, however, can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this news release, including Anadarko's ability to successfully complete its announced asset sales, the successful creation and initial public offering of an MLP, and the achievement of its debt reduction goals.

  By Aaron Lucchetti \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Bear Stearns Cos. (BSC) and a futures exchange backed by hedge fund company Man Group PLC (EMG.LN) have developed a new way to bet on whether or not government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE) will be able to pay off their debts, The Wall Street Journal has learned. \u001d  The new contracts, expected to be announced as early as Monday and launched by the end of the year on Man's U.S. Futures Exchange, represents the first time a major Wall Street firm has launched a product with an exchange in the booming market for credit derivatives. In the estimated $27 trillion credit derivatives market, products are priced based on the likelihood that a company or group of companies won't be able to pay all their debts. They allow hedge funds to bet on credit moves and big financial players to manage the risks of lending. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  In recent years, investment banks such as J.P Morgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have traded the products with each other and for clients, generating healthy profits while bypassing futures exchanges. \u001d  This year however, exchanges have started to jump into the market. In March, Deutsche Boerse AG's majority owned Eurex unit started trading a product based on an index of credit derivatives. Trading has been light so far, but that hasn't discouraged other exchanges in the U.S. - including Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings, or CME, CBOT Holdings Inc. and the Chicago Board Options Exchange from pushing ahead with their own plans to launch a credit derivatives contract. \u001d  Investment banks have been reluctant to embrace exchange-traded credit derivatives products, viewing them as unnecessary and potentially threatening to their trading profits. Exchanges say they offer more open trading platforms and back-office systems that reduce the risk that trades will be delayed or subject to late payment. \u001d  Bear Stearns developed the product with US Futures Exchange and has a patent pending on elements of its design, according to David Boberski, head of interest rate strategy at Bear Stearns. Basing the product on Fannie and Freddie's credit allows it to be designed in a way that more closely follows the existing market where big dealers trade with each other. That is because the agencies' debt, like Treasury notes, is exempt from registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, he says. \u001d  The CME has had to alter the design of some of its proposed products so that they fall under Commodity Futures Trading Commission jurisdiction instead of the SEC. \"It's the most important characteristic,\" says Mr. Boberski. \"You get all the benefits of an exchange traded product without the problems of alternative design.\" \u001d  Still, many new products fail and it's not clear how large the demand is to hedge the credit risk of two companies with very high credit and the backing of the U.S. government. \"The credit derivatives market is exploding,\" says Satish Nandapurkar, U.S. Futures Exchange's chief executive. \"We're approaching it from a different angle.\" USFE is majority owned by hedge fund company Man Group. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 20:08 ET (00:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"23dc7b816be17273d76660d925b1616c","symR":["SLR.T","XPL","US83422R1068"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Solitario Resources","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLR.T","XPL","US83422R1068"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Solitario Resources: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=XPL or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:30 ET (09:30 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"23df248aa5aed46235c8b770fdffae62","symR":["VIEV.VI","AT0000911805"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Vienna International Airport","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VIEV.VI","AT0000911805"],"IndustryCodes":["TRS","XATX","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  Vienna International Airport: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=AT0000911805 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:35 ET (09:35 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2425b4362e28d3263badbc197c77ae2b","symR":["IEX"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for IDEX Corporation","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T08:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IEX"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  IDEX Corporation: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=IEX or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 04:24 ET (08:24 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"244b010c25d76227db5c1aea02443c6f","symR":["AHD","APC","APL","ATLS","US0325111070"],"date":"2007-06-04","ret":[-0.00099,0.9822907,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.015784,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. to Acquire Control of Anadarko Petroleum's Interest in Oklahoma and Texas Gas Gathering and Processing Systems for $1.85 Billion","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-04T01:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AHD","APC","APL","ATLS","US0325111070"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","PIP","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  PHILADELPHIA, PA -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 06/03/07 -- \u001d   Atlas Pipeline Partners L.P. (NYSE: APL) (the \"Partnership\" or \"APL\") announced today that the Partnership has signed definitive agreements to acquire control of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's (NYSE: APC) (\"Anadarko\") interests in the Chaney Dell and Midkiff/Benedum natural gas gathering and processing systems for $1.85 billion, subject to customary closing conditions and other adjustments. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Partnership and is expected to close on or about July 11, 2007, subject to certain approvals. \u001d  The acquisition is immediately accretive.  Available distributable cash flow to the Partnership is projected to be approximately $2.14 to $2.22 per unit for the second half of 2007, representing a 6-10% increase compared with prior guidance, and $4.56 to $4.80 per unit in 2008. APL expects to distribute between $1.78 and $1.85 per limited partner unit in the second half of 2007, and expects to distribute between $3.80 to $4.00 per limited partner unit in 2008, after an increase in its distribution coverage ratio to 1.2x. At the mid-point of this range, this payout would represent over a 13% increase over the Partnership's current distribution rate of $0.86 per quarter, or $3.44 on an annualized basis. \u001d  \"This purchase is transformative for APL,\" said Edward E. Cohen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Partnership. \"APL's aggregate processing capacity will more than double -- from 350 million cubic feet per day (\"Mmcf/d\")  to over 750 Mmcf/d, and current total cash flow should nearly triple following this transaction. In addition, these new assets offer considerable opportunity for further rapid and substantial organic growth.\" \u001d  The Chaney Dell natural gas gathering and processing system, currently 100%owned by Anadarko, is located in northwest Oklahoma and southern Kansas, near the center of the Anadarko Basin. Throughput on the Chaney Dell system averaged 226 Mmcf/d in 2006, and is centered within an active drilling area. This system consists of two active processing facilities:--  the Waynoka Plant, a 200 Mmcf/d cryogenic unit in Woods County, OK; \b--  the Chester Plant, a 30 Mmcf/d cryogenic expander unit in Woodward \b    County, OK; and \b--  approximately 3,470 miles of gathering pipeline covering six counties \b    in the Anadarko Basin across northwestern Oklahoma and southern Kansas \b \u001d  The Midkiff/Benedum natural gas gathering and processing system, which isapproximately 73% owned by Anadarko, is located in the Spraberry Trend of the Permian Basin, near Midland, Texas. In 2006, the Midkiff/Benedum systemhad approximately 139 Mmcf/d of average throughput. This system consists ofthe following:--  the Midkiff Plant, a 130 Mmcf/d cryogenic facility in Reagan County, \b    TX; \b--  the Benedum Plant, a 43 Mmcf/d cryogenic facility in Upton County, TX; \b    and \b--  approximately 2,500 miles of gathering pipeline located across four \b    counties in the Permian Basin of west Texas \b \u001d  The Midkiff/Benedum system is subject to a third-party's preferential right, the exercise of which, if any, would occur prior to the expected closing.  The information in this release assumes no exercise of the preferential right. \u001d  In order to offer greater flexibility to its customers and expand its operating footprint related to its Oklahoma assets, APL expects to take advantage of the location of its existing Elk City-Sweetwater gathering andprocessing system in southwest Oklahoma by connecting these facilities to the Chaney Dell system. Additionally, APL plans to construct a new processing facility between the Elk City-Sweetwater system and the Chaney Dell system. All of these planned strategies should materially benefit cash flow past 2008. \u001d  Robert R. Firth, President of Atlas Pipeline Holdings, general partner of APL, added, \"We anticipate the opportunity to create operating flexibility by assimilating these processing and gathering assets into our existing systems. Also, these assets are strategically placed in the Anadarko and Permian Basins which have seen significant drilling activity, and this will allow us to expand these systems to meet the growing production demands in these areas. Lastly, we expect to benefit from substantial capital improvements that the previous owner invested in these assets in late 2006.\" \u001d  Transaction Highlights:--  $1.85 billion for control of Anadarko's interests in the Chaney \bDell system (100% owned by Anadarko) and the Midkiff/Benedum system \b(approximately 73% owned by Anadarko), subject to certain adjustments and \bsubject to certain legal rights of the minority shareholder in the \bMidkiff/Benedum system \b--  APL expects to receive the equivalent of a stepped up tax basis in the \b    acquired assets \b--  Acquisition financing fully committed through: \b    --  a private placement to institutional investors of $1.125 billion, \b        consisting of approximately 25.6 million limited partner units of \b        APL at $44.00 per unit \b    --  up to a $900 million term loan, which matures in 2014 \b    --  a $250 million revolving credit facility, from which it expects to \b        draw approximately $60 million for the closing \b--  APL intends to hedge its commodity exposure to natural gas and natural \b    gas liquid prices on incremental production volumes from this \b    transaction. The Partnership expects to hedge approximately 80% of its \b    projected processing volumes from the date of the transaction through \b    June 2010. \b--  Upon execution of this transaction, our general partner, Atlas Pipeline \b    Holdings, L.P. (NYSE: AHD), holder of all the incentive distribution \b    rights in APL, will allocate a portion of its future incentive \b    distribution rights to APL once specified distribution levels are met \b    in the following manner: \b    --  up to $5 million per quarter for the first 8 quarters immediately \b        following the closing of the transaction; and \b    --  up to $3.75 million per quarter after the initial 8 quarter period \b \u001d  Pro forma impact on Atlas Pipeline:--  APL anticipates that its cash distributions to common unitholders will \b    be approximately $1.78 to $1.85 for the second half of 2007, and between \b    $3.80 and $4.00 per common unit for full year 2008. \b--  Available distributable cash flow to the Partnership is expected to be \b    approximately $2.14 to $2.22 per unit for the second half of 2007, and \b    between $4.56 and $4.80 per unit in 2008 \b--  Beginning in the third quarter of 2007, Atlas Pipeline intends to \b    increase its targeted coverage ratio (distributable cash flow to \b    distributions declared) to approximately 1.2x \b--  Atlas Pipeline expects its total natural gas processing capacity to \b    increase from approximately 350 Mmcf/d to approximately 750 Mmcf/d \b \u001d  Affiliates of the Partnership and Anadarko will effect the transaction through the creation of two separate joint ventures which will own the respective systems. \u001d  Wachovia Securities acted as sole financial advisor and provided commitments for the Partnership's new revolving credit facility and term loan financing arrangements. UBS Investment Bank acted as sole private placement agent. \u001d  APL also announced today that as of June 1, 2007, the Partnership activateda newly acquired gathering and compression system that will service the Sweetwater facility.

Spors \u001d  It's hard enough for a small business to attract talent. It's even more difficult when that business is located hundreds of miles from a major job market. \u001d  About three years after its founding in 1997, RightNow Technologies Inc., a Bozeman, Mont., firm that sells customer-relationship management software, had tapped out the local supply of talent. Sales at the company, which had about 100 employees, were climbing. And Greg Gianforte, the firm's founder and chief executive, knew RightNow needed to grow to keep up with sales and mounting competition. \u001d  But being six hours away from the nearest urban hub, Salt Lake City, and in a town of about 30,000 residents made finding local, qualified software engineers and sales and marketing professionals challenging. \u001d  \"Bozeman isn't like Silicon Valley, where you have hundreds of start-ups and people constantly looking to change jobs,\" says the 46-year-old Mr. Gianforte. \u001d  Finding minimal success with job ads placed in major Western city newspapers, Mr. Gianforte felt he would have better luck appealing to people who had already lived in Montana -- and might be itching to return. \u001d  The CEO says he knew from experience that many successful hires were those who enjoyed outdoor winter sports like skiing and also had a Montana connection -- particularly those who left the state after college and returned. \u001d  To find such people, Mr. Gianforte contacted the Montana State University Alumni Association and asked for a list of the computer-science alumni who had graduated in the past decade. The association agreed to give him the list of 565 graduates, the company says. \u001d  RightNow then began sending postcards to those alumni with photos of backpackers in summer and skiers in winter, with the message \"We'd like you to consider coming home.\" The message also promised jobs that would give them a rewarding experience at a fast-growth company in Bozeman. \u001d  While the postcards, sent about every six months, produced far fewer resumes than the classified ads, the candidates were better qualified and knew enough about Bozeman to know whether they wanted to live there. \u001d  Over time, RightNow refined the approach, swapping postcards for letters from Mr. Gianforte, which allowed for more room to talk about the firm and its job opportunities. \u001d  The letters worked for 29-year-old Sam Ortega, RightNow's revenue accounting manager. After graduating with a master's degree in accounting from Montana State University in 2000, Mr. Ortega moved to Portland, Ore., to work as an auditor with a major accounting firm. But he hoped to someday return to Montana to be near relatives and start his own family. \u001d  In the summer of 2005, Mr. Ortega received a letter from Mr. Gianforte announcing job openings at RightNow. At first, he didn't jump, not feeling ready to return.

To avoid inundating alumni with job ads, it monitors how often it gives out lists to companies and requires them to sign a contract agreeing to not sell the list and to destroy it after one use. \u001d  \"We really want to respect the privacy of our alumni,\" says Rose Hanson, the association's program manager. \"But we also want to provide them with the opportunity to move back to Montana.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 20:48 ET (00:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2566f02d8724c2851170ae87edc1070f","symR":["WAD.LN","GB00B1CQN147"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for West African Diamonds Plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WAD.LN","GB00B1CQN147"],"IndustryCodes":["DIA","PCS"],"Story":"\u001d  West African Diamonds Plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B1CQN147 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:37 ET (09:37 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2597a070166856a54d1d778539994d83","symR":["SDR.LN","GB0002405495"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Schroders plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SDR.LN","GB0002405495"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\u001d  Schroders plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0002405495 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:11 ET (09:11 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"25cbc51a15cffa421199686d8f2d9b1e","symR":["IPR","IPR.LN","GB0006320161"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for International Power PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T08:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IPR","IPR.LN","GB0006320161"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  International Power PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0006320161 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 04:16 ET (08:16 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"26140bd6d15a468c153c419f425b088a","symR":["MTO.LN","GB0004657408"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for MITIE Group PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T08:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MTO.LN","GB0004657408"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  MITIE Group PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0004657408 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 04:42 ET (08:42 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"262fe430c5780c32205d92fba9f4030e","symR":["EPC","EPC.XE","DE0005128003"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Epcos AG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EPC","EPC.XE","DE0005128003"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","XDJGI","XNMP","XNYA","XTDX"],"Story":"\u001d  Epcos AG: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0005128003 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:52 ET (07:52 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"264a5f2a058fb2d1c39f18445ef5ae31","symR":["12777.FR","DJDAY","EMI.LN","EMIPY","TFCP.YY","WMG","FR0000127771","GB0000444736"],"date":"2007-06-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(6/4)Heard On The Street: Warner Music Still Considers EMI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-04T03:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12777.FR","DJDAY","EMI.LN","EMIPY","TFCP.YY","WMG","FR0000127771","GB0000444736"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","FIS","MED","MOV","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Ethan Smith \u001d  Despite appearances to the contrary, the seven-year mating dance between EMI Group PLC and Warner Music Group Corp. is far from over. \u001d  Warner and EMI have tried to merge at least four times in recent years, never clinching a deal. Then in May, EMI's board recommended that shareholders accept Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.'s offer of 265 pence ($5.25) a share, or GBP 2.4 billion ($4.76 billion) -- five pence a share higher than Warner's most-recent, GBP 2.1 billion effort. \u001d  But despite the apparent victory of the private-equity buyers, Warner's executives and investors are still deliberating over two courses of action they believe could get them what they have wanted from EMI all along: the British music giant's recorded-music assets, including the storied labels Capitol Records in the U.S. and Parlophone in Britain. \u001d  EMI's labels, which produce and distribute CDs and digital downloads from artists such as Coldplay, Norah Jones and the Beatles, are distinct from its giant music-publishing house, which controls catalogs of song copyrights that are licensed to others for use. \u001d  Warner's shares have dropped more than 45% from a high of more than $30 last summer, when EMI offered to buy Warner for $4.6 billion. EMI's shares have rebounded from a February low of 201 pence -- when it issued a profit warning -- on news of London-based Terra Firma's offer and speculation that others might be imminent. \u001d  In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Warner Music's shares fell five cents to $16.76. EMI's stock closed down 25 pence to GBP 274.25 in London trading. Warner's shares trade at about 17 times analysts' estimated per-share earnings for this year, according to Thomson First Call. That is slightly richer than EMI's price/earnings ratio of 15. \u001d  The simplest course of action for Warner is to counter Terra Firma's bid. But people close to Warner say they believe the firm is unlikely to go much higher than its original GBP 2.4 billion offer. Even if Warner acquired EMI, antitrust reasons mean it would almost certainly need to sell the publishing house. That unit remains the largest music-publishing house in the world based on market share, although it is soon to be eclipsed by Vivendi SA's Universal Music Publishing, which is about to close an acquisition that will vault it past EMI. Warner's Warner/Chappell publishing unit for the moment is the second-largest in the world. \u001d  But Warner Music, whose artists include Madonna, Linkin Park and Led Zeppelin, has an alternate route to capturing EMI's record labels. It could do that by striking a deal with Terra Firma to buy the record labels after the buyout firm's transaction closes. \u001d  There are risks and benefits associated with both paths, people close to Warner say, and they expect to decide which is more appealing. Indeed, a third option, these people say, is for Warner to do nothing with EMI -- on the theory that record labels have been losing revenue and value so rapidly that resources might be best deployed in other kinds of deals, such as investing in new businesses altogether. \u001d  The main upside to waiting and making a deal with Terra Firma, these people say, is that the regulatory scrutiny in Europe of a deal to buy only EMI's record labels would probably be much less intense than scrutiny of a deal to buy the entire company -- even if Warner said up front that it intends to resell the publishing house. \u001d  The main risk to a wait-and-see approach is uncertainty. People close to Warner say they are confident that Terra Firma would be willing to part with EMI's record labels. But there is always the possibility that a stronger bid than Terra Firma's could emerge, and there is no guarantee that bidder would be willing to sell. And it is possible that Terra Firma could change its mind, or make its own changes at EMI before selling to Warner. \u001d  \"If I was Terra Firma, I'm not sure I'd be in a huge rush to sell this to Warner,\" says Richard Greenfield, an analyst at New York's Pali Research. \"How much more desperate does Warner become to buy EMI in a year or two?\" Mr. Greenfield in February downgraded his rating on Warner to \"sell\" from \"neutral\" and has since said he would recommend selling a combined Warner-EMI. Pali and Mr. Greenfield don't follow EMI or own shares in or do business with either company. \u001d  Warner and EMI have been eager to merge their recorded-music operations for years, amid precipitously declining CD sales and a weaker-than-anticipated rise in digital downloads. The two companies are each about half the size of the two much larger companies that dominate the recorded-music landscape: Universal Music Group and Sony BMG, a joint venture of Sony Corp. and Bertelsmann AG. A Warner-EMI merger could save an estimated $200 million to $300 million in overhead. But four rounds of talks since 2000 have faltered on issues of price and control. \u001d  If Warner bids for the whole company, it faces a lengthy regulatory review process in Europe that carries some risk of disapproval, though people involved in the talks say they have been heartened by a recent decision by regulators to allow Vivendi's acquisition of BMG Music Publishing. The regulators also are in the process of reconsidering the 2004 merger of Sony's and Bertelsmann's recorded-music operations. People in the music industry believe an approval could come soon. \u001d  As added insurance, Warner has struck a deal to gain the blessing of a coalition of independent European record labels -- the same body that brought the original complaint about the Sony BMG merger. Warner has also added a \"breakup fee\" of about $100 million to the terms of its offer, according to people familiar with the matter, payable to EMI if the deal falls apart. \u001d  Further complicating the situation: Bad blood persists between top executives at Warner and EMI. It is unclear how much of EMI's current management would be left in place if Terra Firma were to close the deal. But both sets of executives have historically resisted any deal that would make them subordinate to the other side. \u001d  Increasing the pressure on Warner to get a deal done: The overall music market has underperformed compared with the expectations of investors who bought Warner from Time Warner Inc. in 2003. In a presentation to financial analysts that was made public in a recent lawsuit, Warner's owners offered what they called a \"conservative\" prediction that sales of CDs would increase 1% between 2006 and 2008, Mr. Greenfield pointed out in a research note. In fact, they have declined 20% this year alone. \u001d  People close to the company note that the projections were made by consultants who aren't connected with the company's current management, and that in any case digital sales have exceeded the projections in the same report. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 23:00 ET (03:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"265b3b6161298c0b8b1f2904a8019237","symR":["ROC"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Rothmans Inc.

While the deal also officially opened up Heathrow to new carriers, U.S. Airways says in its objection to the request that in reality, new landing spots at the airport are so scarce that allowing BA new routes would \"exacerbate the competitive distortion,\" the paper says. \b \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.timesonline.co.uk \b \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9320 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 09:21 ET (13:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"27083fbd43da08cc85f821ea773c7857","symR":["GCS"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Scudder Global Commodities Stock Fund (GCS)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GCS"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Scudder Global Commodities Stock Fund (GCS): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=GCS or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:26 ET (09:26 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2709b5a9293660bcdb13d433e71c221e","symR":["FUM.LN","GB0033278473"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Futura Medical PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T08:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FUM.LN","GB0033278473"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG"],"Story":"\u001d  Futura Medical PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0033278473 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 04:01 ET (08:01 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"271663aeb4e718ddeef0f41e17c1e643","symR":["MSQ.LN","GB0009636977"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Media Square PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T08:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MSQ.LN","GB0009636977"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","MED"],"Story":"\u001d  Media Square PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0009636977 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 04:38 ET (08:38 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2723d96ee0990b39bc3afccea3758877","symR":["GLBL"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Global Industries, Ltd.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T08:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GLBL"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Global Industries, Ltd.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=GLBL or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 04:18 ET (08:18 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"272d063421d0ae7f356bc8223eb47924","symR":["28896.AE","NL0000288967"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for CORIO N.V.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["28896.AE","NL0000288967"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XENX"],"Story":"\u001d  CORIO N.V.: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=NL0000288967 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:38 ET (07:38 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"272d2deeb98e8cb3ddb0c7f9f0e4ad66","symR":["MLL.XE","DE0006214687"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Mueller -

Berman \u001d  As representatives of both companies prepare to meet today, News Corp. is willing to go further than it has gone before in acceding to tighter editorial-independence controls to win Dow Jones & Co., people close to News Corp. said yesterday. \u001d  But Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corp., made clear in an interview Friday that he isn't willing to yield to what may be a key demand from the Bancroft family, Dow Jones's controlling shareholder: that the family control any editorial-oversight board created to protect Dow Jones's editorial independence in the event of a deal. \u001d  Such a board should comprise \"people with absolutely no business connections to me nor the family,\" Mr. Murdoch said, adding that the family \"can't sell [Dow Jones] and keep it\" by joining a newly created board. \"I can't put down $5 billion of my shareholders' money and not be able to run the business,\" Mr. Murdoch said. He stressed, however, that he has \"no plans to change anything\" on the editorial or news sides of the paper. \u001d  The issue of editorial independence for Dow Jones and its flagship title, The Wall Street Journal, will be paramount when Mr. Murdoch and his second-oldest son, James Murdoch, the CEO of News Corp. affiliate company British Sky Broadcasting, meet today with three members of the Bancroft family. The meeting is the first since News Corp. submitted an offer of $60 a share, or $5 billion, for Dow Jones in April. A majority of the family initially said they weren't interested but last Thursday shifted position, acknowledging a willingness to talk to News Corp. and consider any other suitors as well. \u001d  Mr. Murdoch's guarantees of editorial independence are meant to convince the Bancrofts to sell the company without feeling they have betrayed the family's generations-old commitment to the integrity of the journalistic enterprise. Some family members have made clear they don't approve of Mr. Murdoch's approach to newspapers; they are considering a sale only because they feel Dow Jones can't operate effectively on its own, and no third parties have appeared to compete with Mr. Murdoch's bid. \u001d  Mr. Murdoch has suggested creating an independent board like that which is supposed to guarantee the editorial independence of the Times of London and the Sunday Times, which he acquired in 1981. That board must approve appointment of editors. However, some critics have said the board has proved ineffective, failing to stop Mr. Murdoch from forcing out editors he didn't like -- most famously Harold Evans in 1982. The Bancroft family, however, isn't expected to try to re-create the Times board, according to people familiar with the discussions. Among Mr. Murdoch and his advisers -- JPMorgan, Centerview Partners and law firm Skadden, Arps -- there is a growing view that the \"Times of London\" structure won't be adequate to convince the Bancrofts to sell. \u001d  They would be willing to propose a structure similar to that historically used by Reuters PLC, according to people close to News Corp. This arrangement gave the Reuters trustees veto power over any deal, something they will maintain in the newly combined Thomson-Reuters company. The arrangement also granted trustees broad rights and privileges. No shareholder could own more than 15% of the company's shares without the trustees' consent. As part of the deal with Thomson Corp., Reuters trustees must be \"consulted\" before any editor-in-chief of Reuters is appointed or removed. \u001d  The meeting, which will be held at the offices of family legal adviser Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, is designed as part social gathering and part business meeting, according to people familiar with the plans. One of its main goals is to get the three Bancroft family members attending the meeting -- Christopher Bancroft, Leslie Hill and Elizabeth Steele, who are also Dow Jones directors -- comfortable with Mr. Murdoch and his family. The Bancrofts will be accompanied by Dow Jones Chairman M. Peter McPherson, family trustee Michael Elefante and attorney Martin Lipton, who is advising the family. Also attending on the News Corp. side will be Chief Financial Officer David DeVoe and General Counsel Lawrence Jacobs. At the meeting, Mr. Murdoch is expected to do more listening than talking, people close to News Corp. said. \u001d  To prepare for today's meeting, Mr. Elefante held two conference calls with Bancroft family members also on the Dow Jones board and representatives of Dow Jones's news operations on Thursday night and Friday afternoon. The calls were set up at the family's request to get guidance on how best to preserve Dow Jones's journalistic integrity and included representatives from the company's news divisions, including Marcus Brauchli, the Journal's new managing editor; L. Gordon Crovitz, the Journal's publisher; Paul Gigot, editorial-page editor of the Journal; Clare Hart, president of Dow Jones's Enterprise Media Group, which includes Dow Jones Newswires and Factiva, an aggregator of news and information; Neal Lipschutz, managing editor of Dow Jones Newswires; and John Wilcox, president of Dow Jones's Community Media Group, which comprises the Ottaway group of local newspapers. Several news executives have prepared memos for the family to give them guidance in their negotiations with Mr. Murdoch, according to people familiar with the matter. \u001d  Mr. Brauchli said in a statement: \"No asset is more important to the Journal than its editorial independence, including the freedom to decide what and whom the Journal covers, how and in what media, and with what resources. Our integrity is the wellspring of our value to readers, and we're grateful that both the Bancroft family and Rupert Murdoch appreciate this and are focused on preserving it. I will do everything I can to ensure that the Journal's news department remains independent and vital.\" \u001d  Some of the advice given to the family went beyond simply protecting the Journal and sought to protect The Wall Street Journal brand by limiting how Mr. Murdoch could use the Journal name, these people said. The Journal already has strict controls over the use of its name with licensees. That could be a sticking point with Mr. Murdoch, who is expected to want to use the Journal's name to promote his other media properties. \u001d  --- \u001d  Martin Peers and Steve Stecklow

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Yukari Iwatani Kane \u001d  More than four years ago, Japan's Toshiba Corp. began working on a top-secret electronic device. The $830 machine -- which some say resembles a tiny spaceship -- had a powerful vacuum pump to suck all the air out. It was designed to withstand 264 pounds of pressure, and it made use of silver and powdered diamonds. Production of the contraption, which takes about 30 people to assemble, started last year. \u001d  Toshiba's creation is the \"Vacuum Pressure Cooker,\" the company's most expensive rice cooker ever. The pressure makes it possible to boil the water in the cooker at a higher temperature, thus making for fatter, shinier and sweeter grains of rice. The air-sucking filter creates a vacuum causing the rice to absorb water more quickly while it soaks. The silver and diamond dust are used to coat the cooking vessel so as to distribute heat evenly, so every grain of rice has the same texture. \u001d  \"It was a lot of work,\" says Noriko Saito, one of Toshiba's chief rice-cooker developers. She test-cooked as much as 330 pounds of rice a week to determine the best cooking process, using both the vacuum and pressure technologies. \u001d  Such an all-out effort might seem bizarre for something as mundane as cooking rice, which is easy to do in a pot on the stove or in a $10 electric rice cooker of the sort used throughout the world. \u001d  But many Japanese, who are fiercely proud to be obsessed with rice, wouldn't dream of anything so simple. After all, they're connoisseurs. While Japan imports a small percentage of rice from countries such as the U.S. and China, most of it is processed into foods like rice crackers and soybean paste for soup. The vast majority of the rice that is eaten is grown in Japan, which has about 300 different varieties of rice, some with romantic names like \"Dream of Stars\" and \"Love at First Sight.\" Rice aficionados subscribe to rice-of-the-month clubs and are willing to pay about $5.50 a pound for premium rice. Japanese consumers spend an average of $150 for their rice cookers, the highest price in the world. \u001d  To many Japanese, who consume nearly five times as much rice as Americans do and who consider it the most important part of a meal, it makes sense to go to great lengths to bring out the flavor of rice. Good rice cooked properly, is sweet, shiny and fragrant, experts say, and has just the right amount of stickiness to clump together between chopsticks. \u001d  \"The ideal rice can be enjoyed first with the eyes, then with the nose and finally with the tongue as the sweetness spreads upon chewing,\" says Toyozou Nishijima, a certified rice expert in Japan. \u001d  Now, as Japan's economy improves and a boom in health-consciousness draws more favorable attention to traditional rice-centered meals, more Japanese consumers are willing to pay as much as $1,000 for ultra high-end rice cookers. In a $100 million a year market that has remained mostly flat for years, high-end rice cookers helped increase total rice-cooker sales by 12% last year, according to the Japan Electrical Manufacturers' Association. Manufacturers make these rice cookers only for the Japanese market because they say very few people outside of Japan appreciate the taste of plain, white rice enough to pay such high prices. \u001d  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Japan's largest rice-cooker maker in revenue, touts a $600 rice cooker that promises to give rice exactly 2.4 times as much oligosaccharide -- a kind of sugar -- as its previous models. It uses a two-step soaking process and a steam function. Hitachi Ltd.'s $600 model has a Teflon-coated stainless bowl with gold flecks on the inside to seal in the heat and make extra-sweet rice.  Zojirushi Corp. put artificial-intelligence technology into its rice cooker, to adjust the cooking process automatically according to seasonal differences in air and water temperature. \u001d  Toshiba's high-end rice cooker, which is available in two sizes, has sold more than 70,000 since its launch in September, making it the best-seller in the super-expensive category, according to an estimate by GfK Marketing Services Ltd., which tracks such data. \u001d  One recent convert is Yuki Ando, a 33-year-old housewife in western Japan. Ms. Ando bought Toshiba's vacuum-pressure device in December, after her husband complained that her old rice cooker -- which itself had cost $320 -- made the rice taste dry. Even a discounted price of $490 gave Ms. Ando pause, but she took the plunge because she knew she would be using the cooker every day. One favorite feature: the ability to keep rice warm in the pot for 32 hours in a vacuum that preserves flavor. \u001d  \"I'm not exaggerating. The rice was shiny, standing upright and fluffy,\" says Ms. Ando. \"My husband, who is particularly picky about rice, has never complained.\" \u001d  The latest rash of technology is a bit much for Mr. Nishijima, the rice expert. \"Just because you pay 70,000 yen [about $575] or 110,000 yen doesn't mean that there's a drastic change in taste,\" says Mr. Nishijima, who adds that good rice can be made with the simplest of rice cookers if it is to be eaten right away. He thinks consumers might be too susceptible to hype. \"It almost seems like anything is OK as long as it's expensive,\" he says. \u001d  Still, the race for incremental improvements in rice cooking is a serious business for companies like Toshiba. The company struggled with making the combination of pressure and vacuum technologies work because the two opposing forces put such a strain on the rice cooker that the lid would warp or crack. It wasn't until six months before launch that the company came up with a solution -- a heavy steel frame for the lid. \u001d  For the past 13 years, Ms. Saito, the rice cooker developer, has been devoted to rice cookers and testing batches of rice. The 37-year-old sniffs each batch she makes for sweetness, checks its appearance for shine and fluffiness, and then cuts into it with a scoop to make sure the texture is the same all the way down to the bottom of the bowl. \"If the rice is cooked badly,\" Ms. Saito says, \"you might feel resistance or mushiness when you insert the rice scoop, but if it's cooked well, it goes in very smoothly.\" \u001d  The latest rice cookers have come a long way since Toshiba in 1955 sold the world's first automatic electric rice cooker and freed Japanese housewives from having to cook their rice in heavy pots on wood-fire stoves. The first machine simply had a heating element beneath the bowl in which the rice cooked. Since then, rice-cooker manufacturers have improved the cooking process, employing everything from a small computer chip, induction heating coils around the bowl to make the rice cook evenly, and most recently pressure technology to make the rice more moist and fluffy. \u001d  While Toshiba's rice cooker has been the best-selling in the high-end category, it was actually one persistent developer at Mitsubishi Electric Corp. who triggered the race for upscale rice cookers with a $1,000 model with an inner cooking bowl made of graphite, which heats up quickly and evenly -- ideal qualities for making rice uniformly fluffy. But it was also fragile and porous. It took Mitsubishi two years to develop a bowl that was sturdy enough, and the bowl is still so difficult to make that the company can only make 50 of them a day. \u001d  Mitsubishi has sold more than 20,000 of the rice cookers since they went on sale in March 2006, twice as many as it had expected. \u001d  Toshiba's Ms. Saito says Mitsubishi's initial success was encouraging for the entire industry. \"We only put so much money into research and development if rice cookers can't sell for more than 30,000 yen,\" or about $245, says Ms. Saito, who believes there's still room for improvements. \"But if we know that consumers will pay 100,000 yen [$820], it changes the picture.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  Miho Inada contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones

Anti-Tumor Activity Also Seen in Advanced Liver Cancer \bCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 03, 2007-- \u001d  Pfizer announced today that single-agent, oral SUTENT(R) (sunitinib malate) prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) across all patient risk groups, including those with the poorest prognoses for survival versus interferon-alfa (IFN-a), according to new data from the Phase III trial in the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). These data, along with Phase II studies of SUTENT in several tumor types, including liver cancer, were presented at the 43rd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. \b \u001d  Advanced renal cell carcinoma, a rare but serious type of kidney cancer, is among the most treatment-resistant tumors. More than 200,000 people in the United States live with kidney cancer and approximately 12,890 people will die from this disease this year. \b \u001d  \"SUTENT research is helping to reshape the treatment landscape in advanced kidney cancer,\" said Dr. Robert Motzer, attending physician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and lead investigator on the SUTENT Phase III trial in RCC. \"The longer progression-free survival benefit seen across all patient subgroups studied builds on an extensive body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy and safety of SUTENT in the treatment of advanced kidney cancer.\" \b \u001d  SUTENT is a multi-kinase inhibitor which works by inhibiting angiogenesis, one of the processes by which tumors acquire blood vessels bringing oxygen and nutrients needed for growth, and proliferation, the process by which cells multiply. The updated analysis from the randomized Phase III trial of 750 previously untreated patients with advanced RCC also demonstrated that: \b \b   --  The progression-free survival benefit of SUTENT vs. IFN-a \b        extended across all Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center \b        (MSKCC) prognostic risk factor groups as follows: \b \b        -- Favorable risk (0 risk factors): 14.5 mo vs. 7.9 mo \b        -- Intermediate risk (1-2 risk factors): 10.6 mo vs. 3.8 mo \b        -- Poor risk (greater than or equal to 3 risk factors): \b           3.7 mo vs. 1.2 mo \b \b   --  SUTENT more than doubled PFS versus IFN-a (11 months vs. 5.1 \b        months) \b \b   --  SUTENT was associated with a significant improvement in \b        objective response rate (ORR), a measurable response in tumor \b        size, compared with IFN-a, according to both investigator \b        assessment (46 percent vs. 12 percent) and independent central \b        review (39 percent vs. 8 percent). \b \u001d  Additionally, data from an ongoing, multi-center, open-label, expanded access study of single-agent SUTENT in more than 2,000 patients with RCC were also presented today at ASCO. These data include difficult-to-treat patients such as those with brain metastases, non-clear cell kidney cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status greater than or equal to two, and confirm the safety profile of SUTENT. \b \u001d  Results were also presented today from a pooled analysis of two single-arm Phase II trials in patients with cytokine-refractory advanced kidney cancer. Data from a study of 168 cytokine-refractory patients treated with single-agent, oral SUTENT showed an ORR of 45 percent, median PFS of 8.4 months, and median overall survival of 19.9 months. Forty-seven percent of patients were still alive at two-year follow-up. \b \u001d  Pfizer is committed to further exploring the effect of SUTENT in additional advanced kidney cancer populations. Currently underway are two Phase III trials studying the role of SUTENT as an adjuvant therapy, immediately after surgery, in patients at risk for cancer recurrence. \b \u001d  \"The promising results we continue to see with SUTENT, as both a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy, further highlight the role that SUTENT may play in the treatment of numerous cancers,\" said Charles Baum, MD PhD, head of oncology development at Pfizer. \"Based on this evidence, Pfizer is exploring the potential utility of SUTENT through Phase III clinical trials in some of the most prevalent and difficult to treat forms of cancer, including breast, liver, colorectal and lung cancer.\" \b \b   Phase II Study in Advanced Liver Cancer \b \u001d  As part of Pfizer's commitment to exploring new options for people living with cancer, clinical trials of sunitinib malate are also underway in other tumor types, including advanced liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Advanced liver cancer, or hepatocellular carcinoma, is one of the most common cancers globally, with approximately one million cases reported each year. \b \u001d  Positive data from an open-label Phase II trial evaluating 37 patients with advanced liver cancer were also presented this week at ASCO. Findings demonstrate anti-tumor activity with single-agent sunitinib malate. Decreased tumor density or tumor size was seen in 68 percent of patients treated with sunitinib malate. In addition, both the blood flow and volume (amount of blood reaching the tumor) were decreased by an average of 39 percent. Such results in this setting are encouraging and Pfizer intends to initiate Phase III studies in advanced liver cancer to fully understand the role of sunitinib malate in this setting. \b \b   About SUTENT(R) (sunitinib malate) \b \u001d  SUTENT is a multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib meylate. \b \u001d  Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT. \b \u001d  Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. \b \u001d  Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with standard antihypertensive therapy. CBCs with platelet count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with SUTENT. \b \u001d  The most common adverse reactions are fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspensia, abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding. \b \u001d  For more information on SUTENT and Pfizer Oncology please visit www.pfizer.com. \b \u001d  DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information contained in this release is as of June 3, 2007.

and Kenneth Maxwell \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  ROME (Dow Jones)--The city councils of Milan and Brescia have hammered out a political settlement that paves the way for the boards of Milan municipal power utility AEM SpA (AEM.MI) and Brescia peer ASM SpA (ASM.MI) to approve a long-expected merger Monday, according to a person familiar with the situation. \u001d  The deal, under discussion since last fall, is expected to be announced after meetings of the respective city councils and the utilities' boards Monday. It would create Italy's third-largest power company by market value. \u001d  Trading in shares in the utilities - which will have a combined market capitalization of over EUR8.7 billion at last Friday's closing share prices - is likely to be suspended pending the meetings and publication of subsequent statements detailing the terms of the merger, the person familiar with the situation said. \u001d  The boards of AEM and ASM were on standby to meet Saturday to approve the deal. But wrangling between the respective city councils over terms and conditions mean the meetings will now take place Monday, barring last-minute hitches. \u001d  One person familiar with the matter told Dow Jones Newswires the new combined company would have a dual corporate governance structure with a supervisory board and a management board. ASM Chairman Renzo Capra is expected to head the supervisory board, while AEM Chief Executive Giuliano Zuccoli is likely to head the management board. \u001d  The city halls of Brescia and Milan would hold a majority stake in the combined utility. \u001d  The person said the share swap ratio still had to be finalized, but should see each ASM share being offered for about 1.6 AEM shares. The person also said ASM shareholders would receive an extraordinary dividend, but said the amount depends on the finalized share swap ratio. \u001d  -By Liam Moloney and Kenneth Maxwell, Dow Jones Newswires; +39 02 5821 9901; kenneth.maxwell@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 12:42 ET (16:42 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3239610ae57d065171f9bc6ae0d1e162","symR":["600900.SH","CN0007845992"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"China Yangtze Power Sold CNY2.5B 1-Year Bills At 3.46% Tues","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T23:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["600900.SH","CN0007845992"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SHANGHAI (Dow Jones)--China Yangtze Power Co.

 DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Trade unions across the world are uniting to fight the thousands of job cuts that would result from the takeover of ABN Amro Holding NV (ABN), the Dutch bank at the center of the world's biggest bank bid battle, according to the Guardian in London on Monday. \u001d  A meeting is to be held Monday at the office of Unite, the newly formed union created by the merger of T&G and Amicus, to try to develop a cross-border response to the attempts to acquire ABN Amro, according to the Guardian. The bank has agreed a GBP45 billion takeover by Barclays PLC (BCS) but also received an unsolicited approach from a consortium led by the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.LN). \u001d  The gathering at the Unite headquarters comes as executives from the bidders prepare to meet the ABN Amro works council, essentially the staff forum which liaises with management, according to the newspaper. \u001d  Barclays has admitted it would ax 23,600 jobs from the 216,000 combined workforce if it was successful in taking over ABN Amro, according to the Guardian. The RBS consortium, which includes Santander Central Hispano SA (STD) of Spain and the Dutch-Belgian financial group Fortis NV (FORSY), has said fewer employees would lose their jobs if its bid was successful and it had no plans for \"significant\" offshoring of jobs, the newspaper said. The consortium has also said that not all the jobs lost would affect ABN Amro, according to the newspaper. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://guardian.co.uk \u001d  -Dow Jones Newswires;

(NYSE: AHD) (\"Atlas Holdings\"), which owns 100% of the general partner and 12.6% of the common units of Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. (NYSE: APL) (\"APL\"), announced today that APL has signed definitive agreements to acquire control of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's (NYSE: APC) (\"Anadarko\")interests in the Chaney Dell and Midkiff/Benedum natural gas gathering and processing systems for $1.85 billion, subject to customary closing conditions and other adjustments. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Partnership APL and is expected to close on or about July 11, 2007, subject to certain approvals. \u001d  As a result of this transaction, Atlas Holdings expects to distribute between $0.58 and $0.65 per common unit for the second half of 2007, and between $1.60 and $1.80 per common unit in 2008. At the mid-point of the 2008 range, this payout would represent a 70% increase over Atlas Holdings' current distribution rate of $0.25 per quarter, or $1.00 on an annualized basis. \u001d  APL expects to distribute between $3.80 to $4.00 per limited partner unit in 2008, while at the same time intends to increase its distribution coverage ratio to 1.2x. \u001d  \"This acquisition will immediately convey remarkable value to our Atlas Holdings unitholders,\" said Edward E. Cohen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Atlas Holdings. \"The addition of these profitable natural gas gathering and processing systems will more than triple the cash flow at the Atlas Pipeline level.  We are pleased to be able to pass along this strong growth in the form of a significant accretion in distributions to our common unitholders, and we look forward to similar opportunities for growth in the future.\" \u001d  Upon execution of this transaction, Atlas Holdings, which owns all the incentive distribution rights paid by Atlas Pipeline, will allocate a portion of their future incentive distribution rights to Atlas Pipeline in the following manner:--  up to $5 million per quarter for the first 8 quarters immediately \b    following the closing of the transaction; and \b--  up to $3.75 million per quarter after the initial 8 quarter period \b \u001d  The Chaney Dell natural gas processing and gathering system, currently 100%owned by Anadarko, is located in northwest Oklahoma and southern Kansas, near the center of the Anadarko Basin. Throughput on the Chaney Dell system averaged 226 million cubic feet per day (\"Mmcf/d\") in 2006, and is centered within an active drilling area. The Midkiff/Benedum natural gas processing and gathering system, which is approximately 73% owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko, is located in the Spraberry Trend of the Permian Basin, near Midland, Texas. In 2006, the Midkiff/Benedum system had approximately 139 Mmcf/d of average throughput. \u001d  The Midkiff/Benedum system is subject to a third-party's preferential right, the exercise of which, if any, would occur prior to the expected closing.  The information in this release assumes no exercise of the preferential right. \u001d  APL will partially finance the acquisition through a private placement of $1.125 billion of its common units, of which approximately $168 million of common units, or 3.8 million APL common units, will be purchased by Atlas Holdings. Atlas Holdings will finance the purchase of the APL units throughits own private placement of approximately $168 million with 6.25 million of its own common units at $27.00 per unit. In order to maintain its 2% general partner interest in APL, Atlas Holdings will contribute $23 million to APL and it will fund its contribution with an advance against its existing $50 million credit facility, which matures in 2010. \u001d  Affiliates of the Partnership and Anadarko will effect the transaction through the creation of two separate joint ventures which will own the respective systems. \u001d  Please see today's Atlas Pipeline Partners' press release announcing the Chaney Dell and Midkiff/Benedum asset acquisition for further details regarding the transaction. \u001d  Interested parties are invited to access the live webcast of the conferencecall hosted by Atlas Pipeline to discuss the acquisition on Monday, June 4,2007 at 11:00 am Eastern Time by going to the Investor Relations section ofAtlas Pipeline's website at www.atlaspipelinepartners.com.

(From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Susan Warren \u001d  Minnesota businessman Irwin Jacobs filed a defamation lawsuit against a fired Wal-Mart marketing executive who alleged in a court filing that Mr. Jacobs offered special deals to Wal-Mart Chief Executive Lee Scott. \u001d  Julie Roehm, who was fired by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in December for allegedly violating the retailer's ethics rules, claimed in a federal-court filing in Michigan last week that Mr. Scott obtained \"a number of yachts\" and \"a large pink diamond\" at preferential prices from Mr. Jacobs, whose companies do a range of business with Wal-Mart, including selling it boats and buying its unsold goods. \u001d  In the court fight over her dismissal, Ms. Roehm accused Wal-Mart of a double standard that allowed top executives to get away with accepting favors from suppliers. In several examples, she cited alleged transactions involving Mr. Jacobs that went \"beyond a business relationship\" and violated the company's conflict-of-interest standards. \u001d  Mr. Jacobs and Wal-Mart said Ms. Roehm's allegations are untrue. Lawyers for Mr. Jacobs sent Ms. Roehm and her attorneys a letter May 29 demanding a retraction. When they didn't receive a reply by a Thursday deadline, they filed a defamation suit Friday against Ms. Roehm and the two Michigan law firms that represent her. The lawsuit was filed in a Benton County, Ark., court. \u001d  \"Irwin Jacobs is an ethical, upstanding businessman who has many business constituencies, and the purpose of the lawsuit is to clear his name of these allegations that tarnish his reputation,\" said his attorney, Barry Gersick. \u001d  Sam Morgan, one of Ms. Roehm's attorneys named in the defamation suit, questioned the legal validity of the claim. He said the law generally shields plaintiffs from liability for statements made in court filings as part of a legal argument. \u001d  \"Lawyers run into this type of situation sometimes when they represent the little guy going after the big guy, and the big guy wants to pulverize you,\" he said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 19:36 ET (23:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c)

(Nasdaq: IMGN), a biopharmaceutical company that develops targeted anticancer therapeutics using its Tumor-Activated Prodrug (TAP) technology, today announced that encouraging clinical findings with TAP compounds for the treatment of solid tumors were reported at the 43rd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting taking place in Chicago, IL. \b \u001d  Clinical findings with three different TAP compounds - trastuzumab-DM1, huN901-DM1, and huC242-DM4 - were reported. Highlights include: \b \b   --  4 of the 10 patients who received 2.4 or 3.6 mg/kg of \b        trastuzumab-DM1 had an objective response (abstract #1042). \b        These patients all had HER2-expressing metastatic breast \b        cancer that had progressed on a chemotherapy regimen that \b        included Herceptin(R) (trastuzumab). \b \b   --  Marked tumor shrinkage was seen with huN901-DM1 in patients \b        with relapsed small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) or other \b        CD56-expressing small-cell carcinoma (abstract #18084). \b \b   --  HuC242-DM4 has not been associated with dose-limiting toxicity \b        in Phase I evaluation at doses expected to demonstrate \b        activity in Phase II testing (abstract #3062). \b \u001d  Mitchel Sayare, Chairman and CEO, commented, \"These findings demonstrate the activity and tolerability of TAP compounds for the treatment of solid tumors, and complement findings we've reported for hematological, or liquid, tumors. Genentech has now announced plans to advance trastuzumab-DM1 into Phase II testing for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and we'll start a Phase II trial of huC242-DM4 in the treatment of gastric cancer in the next few weeks. Later this year we expect to announce the next steps in the development of our huN901-DM1 compound.\" \b \b   Clinical Findings Reported \b \b   Trastuzumab-DM1 \b \u001d  Trastuzumab-DM1 consists of ImmunoGen's cell-killing agent, DM1, attached to Genentech's HER2-binding antibody, trastuzumab. The compound is in development by Genentech. The poster, \"A phase I study of trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1), a first-in-class HER2 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), in patients (pts) with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (BC),\" presented at ASCO, included information on the trial design, patient profile, and study findings. \b \u001d  To be eligible for enrollment in this trial, patients must have HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has progressed on treatment with Herceptin plus chemotherapy. Increasing doses of trastuzumab-DM1 - given once every three weeks - were administered to new patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the compound was established, and then nine additional patients were dosed at the MTD. \b \u001d  Eighteen patients had been enrolled in this ongoing study, with an average (median) age of 50. In addition to prior treatment with Herceptin, these patients had received multiple prior chemotherapy regimens (median of 7.5). \b \b   Interim results reported include: \b \b   --  The MTD of trastuzumab-DM1, given every three weeks, is 3.6 \b        mg/kg. \b \b   --  Four ongoing partial responses have been observed at doses at \b        or below the MTD. \b \b   --  Adverse events more severe than Grade 1 have been infrequent \b        and manageable. \b \b   --  Rapidly reversible Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was dose limiting \b        at 4.8 mg/kg. At the MTD, any thrombocytopenia seen was \b        generally Grade 1 and rapidly reversible. There were no \b        reports of neutropenia or leukopenia. \b \b   --  No cardiac toxicity was observed. \b \u001d  Additionally, in conjunction with the ASCO meeting, Genentech has announced that it plans to initiate a Phase II clinical trial of trastuzumab-DM1 in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. \b \b   HuN901-DM1 \b \u001d  HuN901-DM1 is wholly owned by ImmunoGen. The findings reported in the abstract, \"Phase II trial of huN901-DM1 in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and CD56-positive small cell carcinoma,\" are from the Company's Study 001. \b \b   Among the 30 patients receiving huN901-DM1 in this study: \b \b   --  2 patients had a partial response. One was a patient with \b        relapsed SCLC whose partial response lasted for eighteen \b        weeks; the other patient received just one treatment cycle, \b        and her response was not sustained. \b \b   --  5 patients had stable disease lasting for six to eighteen \b        weeks. \b \u001d  Objective responses, including a complete remission, also have been reported in the two other ongoing huN901-DM1 studies - Study 002 Phase I trial in SCLC and other CD56-positive solid tumors and Study 003 Phase I trial in multiple myeloma. \b \b   HuC242-DM4 \b \u001d  HuC242-DM4 also is wholly owned by ImmunoGen. The poster presented at ASCO, \"A phase I study of a CanAg-targeted immunoconjugate, huC242-DM4, in patients with CanAg-expressing solid tumors,\" reports on the findings to date in an ongoing Phase I study designed to assess the tolerability of the compound and establish its MTD. Most of the patients enrolled in this study to date had colon cancer that had failed treatment with multiple prior therapies. \b \b   Findings to date include: \b \b   --  Dose-limiting toxicity has not been seen with huC242-DM4 at \b        doses up to and including 168 mg/m(2), administered once every \b        three weeks. The MTD of the compound has not yet been \b        established. \b \b   --  The half-life of huC242-DM4 is five days in patients with low \b        plasma levels of CanAg. In contrast, the Company's earlier \b        huC242-DM1 compound had a half-life of approximately two days. \b \u001d  The Company will assess the activity of huC242-DM4 in a Phase II study in gastric (stomach) cancer. Study center initiation is underway and patient dosing is expected to begin in June/July 2007. Many cases of gastric cancer express CanAg and there is no standard front-line chemotherapeutic treatment for this disease. Gastric cancer has been found to be highly sensitive to huC242-DM4 in preclinical studies. The American Cancer Society estimates that, in 2007 alone, 21,260 new cases of gastric cancer will be diagnosed in the US and 11,210 people will die from the disease. \b \b   About ImmunoGen's TAP Technology \b \u001d  ImmunoGen created its TAP technology to enhance the anticancer activity of tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies while maintaining a favorable tolerability profile. ImmunoGen attaches to an antibody one of the Company's proprietary cell-killing agents (DM1, DM4). The antibody serves to deliver the agent specifically to cancer cells and the agent serves to kill the cancer cells. The agent is attached using one of the Company's \"linkers.\" ImmunoGen has developed alternative cell-killing agents and linkers so the best product design can be achieved for each antibody and its target. \b \u001d  ImmunoGen uses its cell-killing agents with its wholly-owned antibodies to create its own anticancer compounds. ImmunoGen also outlicenses its technology for use by other companies with their proprietary antibodies. A number of major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have licensed access to the Company's technology. \b \b   About Trastuzumab-DM1 \b \u001d  Trastuzumab-DM1 comprises ImmunoGen's cell-killing agent, DM1, and Genentech's HER2-binding antibody, trastuzumab. It is in development by Genentech under an agreement that provides Genentech with exclusive rights to use ImmunoGen's maytansinoid TAP technology with antibodies that target HER2. In the Phase I study presented at ASCO, the most common side effects at doses at or below the MTD were fatigue (Grade 1) and thrombocytopenia (Grade 1). Severe (Grade 3/4) adverse events considered related to study drug at any dose level consisted of thrombocytopenia. Other severe adverse events reported were muscular weakness, musculoskeletal chest pain, dyspnea and pleural effusion. \b \b   About HuN901-DM1 \b \u001d  HuN901-DM1 is wholly owned by ImmunoGen. This TAP compound consists of ImmunoGen's DM1 cell-killing agent attached to the Company's huN901 antibody, which targets CD56. CD56-positive cancers include multiple myeloma and certain other hematological malignancies, SCLC, and other cancers of neuroendocrine origin. ImmunoGen is giving highest priority to the development of this compound for the treatment of multiple myeloma as this is expected to be its fastest route to market. In the Phase II study reported at ASCO, three patients had a severe headache after the initial infusion of huN901-DM1; their symptoms improved markedly after 24 hours and then resolved completely. Severe headache did not occur in subsequent patients who were premedicated with steroids. A patient with a history of diabetic neuropathy and prior cisplatin treatment had Grade 4 hyperesthesia. \b \b   About HuC242-DM4 \b \u001d  This TAP compound also is wholly owned by ImmunoGen. It consists of the Company's DM4 cell-killing agent attached to its huC242 antibody, which targets CanAg. CanAg is expressed on gastric, pancreatic, colorectal and other gastrointestinal tumors as well as on many non-small-cell lung cancers. In the Phase I study reported at ASCO, two patients experienced decreased visual acuity (Grade 2 and Grade 3) associated with corneal infiltrate and keratitis at 223 mg/m(2). Both patients were subsequently treated with lubricating eye drops and have returned to baseline. \b \b   About ImmunoGen, Inc. \b \u001d  ImmunoGen, Inc. develops targeted anticancer biopharmaceuticals.

Versace, Fashion Is So Last Century","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-04T03:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VRS.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["CLO","TEX"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Stacy Meichtry \u001d  Milan -- When Italian fashion house Gianni Versace SpA recently threw a cocktail party in the courtyard of its 16th-century palazzo to promote its latest creations, designer Donatella Versace ducked out of the soiree early, flanked by bodyguards. \u001d  Instead, Giancarlo Di Risio, Versace's bespectacled chief executive, presided over an evening that highlighted luxury goods: Parked at one end of the courtyard was a half-million-dollar Lamborghini Murcielago with a black-and-white leather interior by Versace. A huge poster showed an AgustaWestland helicopter with a Versace-designed cabin. Stacked nearby was luggage embossed with the brand's Greek motif, with pieces starting at about $4,000. \u001d  Mr. Di Risio is trying to shift Versace's attention away from clothes and to accessories, home interiors and other lifestyle products that will bring in new streams of revenue and offset fickle fashion cycles. \"Fashion does not exist at Versace,\" he said, describing his strategy in an interview before the reception. \u001d  The new approach is bearing fruit. Versace swung back into the black last year, posting a $25.4 million profit after years of losses, and has shaken off millions in debt. Driving that turnaround were rising sales in the lucrative accessories Mr. Di Risio is pushing. \u001d  Yet the effects of the makeover have touched the core of the company's identity. Ms. Versace has begun taming the flamboyant clothing designs that once set her and the fashion house apart from the crowd. \"I no longer recognize myself in that kind of woman,\" the 52-year-old Ms. Versace said in a telephone interview. \u001d  The culture shift at Versace highlights how an increasingly competitive fashion industry is forcing even the most freewheeling players to embrace a corporate culture. Many labels, including LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton's smaller brands like Celine and Marc Jacobs, have also been toning down their looks to appeal to a wider swath of consumers. Designers who once called the shots are ceding authority to executives who run the numbers. \u001d  \"In the beginning, it was a shock for me,\" Ms. Versace said. \"When you tell a person who is used to being in power -- to saying yes or no on everything -- to take a step back, it's not easy. But it was necessary.\" \u001d  Tweaking a label's aesthetics carries risks. If pushed too far, transformations risk alienating loyal customers, says Robert Burke, head of New York-based luxury-goods consultancy Robert Burke Associates and the former fashion director at Bergdorf Goodman. \"You will always want to see a fashion edge to Versace,\" he says. \u001d  Yet for family-owned fashion labels like Versace, pressure to make more money is high. They compete with publicly traded conglomerates such as LVMH and PPR SA's Gucci Group, which have the financial heft to expand with stores in the emerging markets of China, India and Russia -- seen as fueling the industry's growth. \u001d  A number of Italy's top family-owned fashion houses, including Versace, Prada SpA and Salvatore Ferragamo SpA, are considering stock-market listings in the next couple of years. \"An IPO would be the best way to raise money and implant in these countries,\" says Peter Farren, a luxury-goods analyst at the French investment firm Bryan Garnier. \u001d  At Versace, a sobering realization is spurring Mr. Di Risio's moves: The clothes that once made the brand are now struggling to make money. \u001d  In its heyday in the early 1990s, Versace stayed ahead of the fashion mainstream with lavish catwalk shows that celebrated the racy designs of founder Gianni Versace. The label amassed collections of real estate and artwork that enhanced the family's jet-setter status. \u001d  The company found it increasingly tough to squeeze profits out of highly perishable fashions as production costs rose in Italy. In 1997, Mr. Versace was murdered outside his Miami villa. The firm's finances went into a tailspin, and it was forced to shelve plans to go public. Mr. Versace's 50% stake in the label went to his niece, Ms. Versace's then-preteen daughter Allegra Versace Beck, shifting the balance of power. Though Ms. Versace owns only 20% of the company, she was seen to exert huge influence because of her daughter's stake. A third sibling, Santo Versace, owns the remaining 30% of the company. Ms. Versace Beck, now 20 years old, manages her stake with the help of advisers. \u001d  The Versace stakeholders decided the company needed a CEO who could turn the company around. Fabio Cacciatori, at one time an outside financial consultant for the company, became CEO in September 2003 but resigned in December. The company named Versace's then-Chief Financial Officer Daniele Ballestrazzi interim CEO as it searched for new leadership. \u001d  When Versace recruited Mr. Di Risio from LVMH's Fendi label in the summer of 2004, the house was saddled with more than $146 million in debt and heading to a net loss of $124 million for the year, on revenue of $416 million. High-end retailers like Bergdorf Goodman had stopped carrying the brand. \u001d  Bergdorf Chief Executive Jim Gold recalls that Versace was distributing too widely, diluting its exclusivity, and was overly consumed with making a splash on the runway. While many labels had started delivering retailers fresh designs more frequently, ahead of the runway collections, Versace resisted. \u001d  Mr. Di Risio arrived with a new mantra. Clothing that is too fashionable, he told his lieutenants, is bad for business because it eats up capital and goes out of style quickly. Accessories and other leather goods are a better bet because they have a longer shelf life and fatter profit margins. \u001d   To reduce Versace's dependence on fashion, Mr. Di Risio shut down lines such as Versace Intimates lingerie and Versace Young, a children's line. The company sold its unprofitable perfume, jewelry and watchmaking divisions, replacing them with lucrative licensing agreements with U.S. watch group Timex Corp. and Italian perfume and cosmetics maker EuroItalia Srl. \u001d  Mr. Di Risio homed in on the company's shoes and handbags, which have higher profit margins because they cost less to produce than clothes but are easier to sell to a wide array of customers. Last year, more than 30% of Versace's $383 million in revenue came from accessories, compared with 4% when Mr. Di Risio arrived. \u001d  He also expanded the label's push into home furnishings -- a business that generated sales of $82.5 million in 2006, up 55% from the year before. Versace recently unveiled its \"Jet Seat,\" an aerodynamically-styled leather chair in a high-tech ceramic frame that is sold in Europe for <euro>38,000 (about $50,000). \u001d   \"It was like taking a blank page and rewriting everything,\" Mr. Di Risio says. \u001d   To succeed, however, he had to get Ms. Versace on board. She had hoped to resurrect the costly haute-couture fashion shows the label had discontinued before Mr. Di Risio's arrival. But he argued she could more effectively enhance the line's exclusivity by holding showings for individual clients. \u001d  \"I said to Di Risio, 'This is not going to work. This is going to die,'\" recalled Ms. Versace. But, she said, \"I was wrong, and he was right. We sell more now.\" \u001d   Ms. Versace had to become more conscious of how much time and money the label invests in promoting designs at events like the Oscars. Last year, the designer dressed actresses Hilary Swank, Uma Thurman and Salma Hayek and director Robert Altman's wife, Kathryn Reed Altman, who donned a navy-blue sequin gown. \u001d  This year, however, Ms. Versace limited herself to one gown, designing a rose-colored dress with a sweeping train for best-actress nominee Penelope Cruz. \u001d   For Versace's ready-to-wear line, Ms. Versace is going for looks she calls \"a little more understated.\" Bergdorf Goodman will carry her designs in the fall for the first time in years. \u001d   Ms. Versace is also working more closely with retailers, adding four more collections beyond the traditional spring and fall runway collections. These are shown to retailers in private visits, giving them a preview of what to expect. \u001d  On the financial side, Mr. Di Risio has untangled the company's assets from those of the family, selling property he deemed \"nonstrategic\" to pay the company's debts.  The family's Manhattan townhouse was sold for about $35 million, and its contents went up for auction in 2005. The paintings alone -- including works by artists Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Roy Lichtenstein and Julian Schnabel -- fetched more than $11 million dollars. \u001d   Flagship stores in New York, London and Milan that Mr. Di Risio described as \"decadent and sad,\" were redone with sleek, minimalist designs. \u001d   The label, which operates 82 stores and has 35 franchise operations, plans to open more than 10 boutiques by the end of the year, including seven stores in China alone. When Versace opened the doors of its updated Moscow boutique in April, an array of leather bags, belts and shoes greeted customers at the store's lacquered ground-floor entrance. The label's ready-to-wear collection was relegated to the upper floor. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 23:09 ET (03:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4372f78243965a9bd9299b269f6637d2","symR":["BAF.LN","GB0000653112"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for British & American Inv Trust","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BAF.LN","GB0000653112"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  British & American Inv Trust: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0000653112 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:23 ET (07:23 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4379dc2f120469b57b59fa434551bd99","symR":["GB0009584771"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Close Finsbury EuroTech Tst Plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GB0009584771"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  Close Finsbury EuroTech Tst Plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0009584771 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:35 ET (07:35 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"43841910a1e559d489d0e467d6a6cb21","symR":["BG.LN","BRG","GB0008762899"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for BG Group PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BG.LN","BRG","GB0008762899"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  BG Group PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0008762899 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:19 ET (07:19 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4388a968bb909ca87ae37cd10add2894","symR":["SNCL.LN","GB0009665661"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for William Sinclair Holdings plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SNCL.LN","GB0009665661"],"IndustryCodes":["HPD","HPR"],"Story":"\u001d  William Sinclair Holdings plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0009665661 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:38 ET (09:38 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"438af613926bc772168edeb4b9fe7451","symR":["CDN.LN","GB00B1GJZT14"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Caledon Resources","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CDN.LN","GB00B1GJZT14"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS"],"Story":"\u001d  Caledon Resources: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B1GJZT14 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:26 ET (07:26 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"43adc1781fa89eb06409c6c7e9c29965","symR":["INT.LN","GB00B035PZ17"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for International Medical Devices","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T08:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["INT.LN","GB00B035PZ17"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV"],"Story":"\u001d  International Medical Devices: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B035PZ17 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 04:16 ET (08:16 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"43b7828f6244dc543f08182bb49a3ee6","symR":["DCA.LN","GB0031539561"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Detica Group plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DCA.LN","GB0031539561"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Detica Group plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0031539561 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:43 ET (07:43 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"43bc20729d398c065db79a1cc0183914","symR":["RLU.LN","GB0030794050"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Royal London UK Equi & Inc.

Gross Tops $148 Million \b \b \u001d  BURBANK, Calif., June 3 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Disney's swashbuckling blockbuster, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,\" from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski, continued to rule the high seas at the box office in its second weekend of release, boosting its worldwide gross- to-date to a sensational $625.3 million, it was announced today by Mark Zoradi, president of Walt Disney Studios Marketing and Walt Disney Studios Distribution.  Riding an enormous wave of success at theatres all over the world, the film added $148.6 million in its second smash weekend of release. The film already ranks as the 31st highest grossing film in industry history and the 8th film in Disney history to reach this box office level (more than any other studio). \b \u001d  Internationally, the film added $105.4 million to its coffers in its second weekend of release for a 12-day gross-to-date of $408.8 million. \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" now has the distinction of reaching the $400 million plateau faster than any other film ever released at the international marketplace. \b \u001d  On the domestic front, the latest installment in the \"Pirates\" trilogy added $43.2 million in its second weekend of release, and raised its cume to an impressive $216.5 million.  After just two weekends of release, the film already ranks as the 57th highest grossing film of all time. \b \u001d  Commenting on the announcement, Zoradi said, \"'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' is continuing to captivate and enthrall audiences all over the world and to perform like the champion that it is.  Word-of-mouth continues to be fantastic and the returns at the global box office reflect the film's phenomenal popularity.  We're thrilled with the film's performance so far and have high hopes for its continued success at the box office. \b \u001d  \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" picks up where the record- breaking 2006 smash hit left off, with our heroes Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) allied with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in a desperate quest to free Captain Jack Sparrow ( Johnny Depp) from his mind-bending trap in Davy Jones' locker.  With the terrifying ghost ship, The Flying Dutchman, and its commander Davy Jones under the control of the East India Trading Company, there is havoc on the Seven Seas.  Navigating through treachery, betrayal and wild waters, the heroic trio must forge their way to exotic Singapore and confront the cunning Pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun- Fat).  Now headed beyond the very ends of the earth, each must ultimately choose a side in a final titanic battle - as not only their lives and fortunes, but the entire future of the freedom-loving Pirate way hangs in the balance. \b \bSOURCE  The Walt Disney Studios \b \u001d    /CONTACT: Heidi Trotta of The Walt Disney Studios, Communications, +1-818-560-7280 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones

(T), made his mark by assembling several pieces of the original Ma Bell to form a $250 billion telecommunications behemoth. \u001d  New Chief Executive Randall Stephenson will make his by taking the challenge of putting those parts together. \u001d  \"Moving forward, the emphasis on operational excellence and making these assets sing is what will define us,\" Stephenson said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  Stephenson takes the reins of the nation's largest telecom company at a time when the industry faces increasing competitive pressure from the cable providers. In response, the 47-year-old executive said he will continue to look for potential acquisitions like his predecessor. He is also eyeing new revenue opportunities such as advertisements, and will push to build the company around the fast-growing wireless area. \u001d  \"(AT&T) is going to be a company that's wireless-centric,\" Stephenson said. \"Every aspect of growth and positioning will center around wireless.\" \u001d  AT&T gained full control of Cingular Wireless, the nation's largest wireless carrier by subscriber base, after it acquired BellSouth Corp. The company is bringing both businesses under the AT&T umbrella, and expects to have a unified brand by the end of June. Stephenson said the next phase will involve positioning AT&T as a wireless business \"first and foremost.\" \u001d  Many believe Stephenson comes in at a fortunate time for AT&T. \"The opportunities are nice,\" said Timothy Horan, an analyst for CIBC World Markets Corp. \"But the biggest challenge is on the consumer front with cable competition.\" \b \b   Future In Ads \b \u001d  Stephenson previously served as chief operating officer of AT&T. Like Whitacare, he has spent a majority of his life in the Bell system, beginning his career at Southwestern Bell Telephone's information technology organization in 1982. \u001d  His international experience is seen as a boon to AT&T. He oversaw the finances for SBC International Inc., based in Mexico, and has strong ties to Telefonos de Mexico S.A. de C.V. (TMX) and billionaire investor Carlos Slim Helu. Before becoming chief operating officer, he served as the chief financial officer for the company. \u001d  \"He is considered to have strong financial discipline,\" Horan said. \u001d  Stephenson doesn't foresee many changes as he takes over. \"No radical left turns,\" he said. \u001d  But the executive said he envisions the business eventually migrating to an advertisement-supported model over the current subscription-based one. \u001d  He identifies the areas of wireless, high-speed Internet, and Web-based television services as three area where ads can be place. \"Ads are a large revenue opportunity for the business,\" he said. \"Especially when you start to accumulate that scale of customer base.\" \u001d  As a result, AT&T will likely keep its customers. It is the opposite strategy Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) has taken, which has been to sell or spin-off assets not directly tied to its core business of providing wireless, phone, TV, and high-speed Internet services to consumers and businesses. \u001d  In the past year, Verizon sold its several overseas assets and spun out its directories business and New England assets. \u001d  Stephenson, however, is sticking with size. He said the larger customer base will allow AT&T to push ads for higher revenue. \"I really like owning customers,\" Stephenson said. AT&T has covered nearly all of its customers with high-speed access at around 85% of its footprint. He added he wouldn't sell the directories business, since it brings in a large amount of cash. \u001d  Stephenson said he plans to focus more on the original AT&T Corp. business, which houses the potentially lucrative corporate and government-services business. He added he expects to make small acquisitions to fill product holes in the segment. In October, the company acquired privately held USinternetworking for $300 million to bolster its service offerings. \u001d  Despite the torrid pace of large acquisitions, AT&T is still looking for the next deal. \"You've got to be cautious, but there are opportunities for us,\" he said. \u001d  The Bells have been reduced to just AT&T, Verizon and Qwest Communications International Inc. (Q), but there remain a large number of smaller independent phone companies. The industry will likely continue to see consolidation, he said. \"You're in an industry where scale matters.\" \u001d  -By Roger Cheng, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2020; roger.cheng@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 00:01 ET (04:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4a09cf8253d7a36ae89ca85e092343b3","symR":["CKN.LN","GB0002018363"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Clarkson PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CKN.LN","GB0002018363"],"IndustryCodes":["TRS"],"Story":"\u001d  Clarkson PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0002018363 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:35 ET (07:35 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4a33627bc43b1547ca537a983dbcbfe7","symR":["SLB"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Schlumberger Limited","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLB"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  Schlumberger Limited: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=SLB or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:25 ET (09:25 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4a58e26a209863538b43b8d78a076495","symR":["RUG.LN","GB0007325185"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Renaissance US Gwth Inv.

JOURNAL) \b   By Yvonne Ball \u001d  Some deals were cut in size and investor reaction was difficult to predict, but the health-care sector took top billing in the market for new stock listings last month. \u001d  Health-care companies accounted for more than one-third of all companies that went public last month, raising a combined $1.2 billion, according to data tracker Dealogic. That includes Jazz Pharmaceuticals Inc., whose $108 million offering was priced at $18 a share late Thursday. The stock fell 1.5% on its debut Friday to $17.73 in Nasdaq Stock Market 4 p.m. composite trading. \u001d  The prominent role of a sector known for development-stage, unprofitable companies helped ensure May was the busiest month for initial public offerings by both number and money raised so far this year. \u001d  Twenty-nine companies went public, excluding real-estate investment trusts and special-purpose acquisition companies. It is almost double the number of companies that went public the year earlier and falls only three deals short of November 2006, the busiest month of last year, when 32 companies stepped into the limelight. \u001d  Beyond the 10 health-care companies, the computer and electronics industry accounted for four deals and the telecommunications sector for two. \u001d  The steady flow of IPOs takes the number so far this year to 89, 25% more than this time last year. Overall, however, this year's crop of IPOs is just slightly ahead of last year's pace. Companies this year through May have sold $18.9 billion in stock, compared with $18 billion for the first five months of 2006. \u001d  But in the latest month, the sharp increase in the number of deals from a year earlier wasn't matched by the amount of money raised.Last month's 29 IPOs raised $5.5 billion compared with $6.1 billion raised by 16 deals in May 2006. The year-ago total was boosted by MasterCard Inc's. $2.4 billion offering. \u001d  \"The deal size in May is smaller, for sure, and last year we had MasterCard,\" said Linda Killian, portfolio manager of Renaissance Capital LLC's IPO Plus Fund in Greenwich, Conn. \"There just weren't any huge deals [last month].\" \u001d  But one of the largest deals of the year is expected in the coming weeks when private-equity giant Blackstone Group goes public. It plans to raise as much as $4.75 billion and list on the New York Stock Exchange. \u001d  In May, the average offering was about $188 million, and the stock-market value of those companies was quite small. \u001d  David DiPietro, president of specialty investment bank Signal Hill in Baltimore, says about 60% of the stocks had a post-IPO value of less than $500 million.\"I think we are seeing a return to the IPO market of more traditional growth companies in addition to larger, more established companies coming out of private-equity portfolios,\" he said. \u001d  More than half of last month's IPOs were backed by private-equity firms that were at least partially cashing out of investments. Just five IPOs had private-equity ties in May 2006. \u001d  The rate of public offerings isn't expected to ease this summer. As of Wednesday, the number of companies that have filed plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission stood at 103, with a combined value of $18.9 billion, according to Dealogic. MF Global, the brokerage unit of London-based Man Group PLC, added its name to the list Thursday with plans for an offering that could be worth $1 billion. \u001d  \"The pipeline is up; it looks very active,\" Renaissance's Ms. Killian said. \"Technology is going to be strong. We are starting to see more retail and restaurant companies and we will still see these biotechs. A lot of them are investing heavily in their clinical trials and looking to raise more money.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 19:50 ET (23:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007

LONDON (Dow Jones)--Oxford BioMedica and Sanofi-Aventis announced Sunday encouraging new data from two Phase II trials of TroVax in renal cancer. \u001d  TroVax is Oxford BioMedica's lead cancer immunotherapy product, which is being developed in collaboration with Sanofi-Aventis. \u001d  The Phase II data were presented by Oxford BioMedica and its clinical collaborators from the Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, Illinois. \u001d  Fifty-three patients with progressive metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) have been enrolled and 48 patients are currently evaluable in the Methodist Hospital's two non-randomised phase II trials of TroVax. \u001d  The trials are designed to evaluate TroVax either as a single agent, or in combination with either interleukin-2 or interferon-alpha. \u001d  The treatment regimen in the two trials comprises seven intramuscular injections of TroVax over 41 weeks. The patients had previously failed various anti-cancer treatments before entering the trials. \u001d  TroVax was well tolerated with no serious adverse events attributable to the treatment. TroVax induced anti-5T4 antibody responses in 91% of patients. In patients with clear cell RCC, which is the most common subtype of renal cancer and is the patient group for the Phase III TRIST study, 24 of 35 (68%) evaluable patients showed disease control. Two patients had complete responses, three had partial responses and 19 had stable disease for periods exceeding three months, including three patients that have been stable for more than 17 months. \u001d  These studies provide further support for the ongoing randomised Phase III TRIST study in renal cancer. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 09:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\u001d

(NASDAQ: ATLS) (\"the Company\" or \"Atlas America\"), which owns 17.5 million limited partner units of Atlas Pipeline Holdings, L.P. (NYSE: AHD) (\"Atlas Holdings\") representing an 83% limited partner interest, announced today that Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. (NYSE: APL) (\"Atlas Pipeline\") has signeddefinitive agreements to acquire control of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's (NYSE: APC) (\"Anadarko\") interests in the Chaney Dell and Midkiff/Benedum natural gas gathering and processing systems for $1.85 billion, subject to customary closing conditions and other adjustments. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Partnership and is expected to close on or about July 11, 2007, subject to certain approvals. \u001d  \"This purchase of Anadarko assets is the second major acquisition announcement for the Atlas companies in the last two weeks,\" said Edward E. Cohen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Atlas Holdings. \"Between Atlas Energy Resources' (NYSE: ATN) announced acquisition of DTE Gas and Oil Company for over $1.2 billion and Atlas Pipeline's agreement with Anadarko, our companies have generated over $3 billion in new acquisitions in this brief period.  Atlas America will benefit from the ongoing growth in cash distributions anticipated from Atlas Holdings and Atlas Energy. We expect total common unit cash distributions to Atlas America in 2008 to reach approximately $95 million to $100 million, which is about a 43% increase from the distribution that Atlas America currently receives. And perhaps best of all, distributions from the Anadarko assets will generate substantial tax relief for Atlas America.\" \u001d  As a result of this transaction, Atlas Pipeline expects to distribute between $3.80 to $4.00 per limited partner unit in 2008, while at the same time intends to increase its distribution coverage ratio to 1.2x. \u001d  Based on Atlas Pipeline's distribution projection, Atlas Holdings expects to distribute between $0.58 and $0.65 per common unit for the second half of 2007, and between $1.60 and $1.80 per common unit in 2008. At the mid-point of the 2008 range, this payout would represent a 70% increase over Atlas Holdings' current distribution rate of $0.25 per quarter, or $1.00 on an annualized basis. Atlas America expects to receive approximately $28 million to $31 million in cash distributions from Atlas Holdings in 2008 based on this projection. Through its distributions from Atlas Holdings, Atlas America will also benefit from the stepped up tax basis Atlas Pipeline expects to receive from the acquired assets. \u001d  Upon execution of this transaction, Atlas Holdings, which owns all the incentive distribution rights paid by Atlas Pipeline, will allocate a portion of their future incentive distribution rights to Atlas Pipeline in the following manner:--  up to $5 million per quarter for the first 8 quarters immediately \b    following the closing of the transaction; and \b--  up to $3.75 million per quarter after the initial 8 quarter period \b \u001d  The Chaney Dell natural gas processing and gathering system, currently 100%owned by Anadarko, is located in northwest Oklahoma and southern Kansas, near the center of the Anadarko Basin. Throughput on the Chaney Dell system averaged 226 million cubic feet per day (\"Mmcf/d\") in 2006, and is centered within an active drilling area. The Midkiff/Benedum natural gas processing and gathering system, which is approximately 73% owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko, is located in the Spraberry Trend of the Permian Basin, near Midland, Texas. In 2006, the Midkiff/Benedum system had approximately 139 Mmcf/d of average throughput. \u001d  The Midkiff/Benedum system is subject to a third-party's preferential right, the exercise of which, if any, would occur prior to the expected closing.  The information in this release assumes no exercise of the preferential right. \u001d  Affiliates of the Partnership and Anadarko will effect the transaction through the creation of two separate joint ventures which will own the respective systems. \u001d  Please see today's Atlas Pipeline Partners' press release announcing the Chaney Dell and Midkiff/Benedum asset acquisition for further details regarding the transaction. \u001d  Interested parties are invited to access the live webcast of the conferencecall hosted by Atlas Pipeline to discuss the acquisition on Monday, June 4,2007 at 11:00 am Eastern Time by going to the Investor Relations section ofAtlas Pipeline's website at www.atlaspipelinepartners.com.

\b   By Peter Loftus \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--An experimental Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) drug modestly improved a measure of survival in women with advanced breast cancer when used in combination with a common chemotherapy, according to a study released Sunday. \u001d  The drug, ixabepilone, is part of a new class of chemotherapies known as epothilones. New York-based Bristol-Myers has said it hopes to submit it for U.S. regulatory approval by the end of this year. \u001d  Bristol tested ixabepilone with capecitabine, which is sold under the brand Xeloda by Roche Holding AG (RHHBY), in patients with breast cancer that is spreading, and who have previously been treated with other chemotherapies. \u001d  About half of the 752 patients received Xeloda plus ixabepilone, while half received only Xeloda. Progression-free survival, which measures time until patient death or tumor growth, was 5.8 months among those taking ixabepilone plus Xeloda, versus 4.2 months in the Xeloda-only group. There was a greater rate of tumor response in the ixabepilone group. \u001d  Ixabepilone was associated with certain side effects. Some 23% of patients in the ixabepilone group had neuropathy, a condition involving nerve pain or numbness, while no patients receiving Xeloda alone had neuropathy. \u001d  \"It's nice to know we have a new class of drugs that can perhaps tackle the problem when the cancer comes back,\" Linda Vahdat, an oncologist at Weill Cornell Medical Center who led the Bristol-funded study, said in an interview. She was scheduled to present the data Sunday morning at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. \u001d  Separately, researchers presented data Saturday showing another Bristol experimental drug, vinflunine, wasn't significantly better than Sanofi-Aventis's (SNY) Taxotere in treating a form of lung cancer. The study of about 550 patients compared vinflunine with Taxotere in patients who had gone through previous chemotherapy, and found that median progression-free survival was identical at 2.3 months in both groups. Different toxicities were seen in both groups, but researchers concluded they were manageable. \u001d  Bristol-Myers hasn't disclosed whether, or when, it would file for regulatory approval of vinflunine as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. However, the company has said it plans to submit the drug for Food and Drug Administration approval as a treatment for bladder cancer by early 2008. Bristol is developing the drug with Pierre Fabre Medicament SA (PFA.YY). \u001d  Bristol also plans to submit a third experimental oncology drug, ipilimumab, for regulatory approval as a melanoma treatment. Bristol is developing the drug with Medarex Inc. (MEDX). \b \u001d  -By Peter Loftus, Dow Jones Newswires; 215-656-8289; peter.loftus@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 10:00 ET (14:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c)

CHICAGO, June 3 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN) today announced details of two new investigational cancer therapies at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting. \b \u001d  AZD2281 (KU-0059436) is a small molecule inhibitor of Poly-ADP Ribose Polymerase (PARP). PARP is an enzyme involved in Base Excision Repair which is a key pathway in the repair of DNA single-stranded breaks. Inhibiting this DNA repair mechanism, in tandem with a defective DNA repair gene like BRCA1 or BRCA2, is thought to lead to double-stranded DNA breaks that tumor cells are unable to repair, resulting in tumor cell death. \b \u001d  AZD2281 has been studied in a range of tumor types in Phase I studies. The study presented today at ASCO showed that treatment with AZD2281 led to inhibition of PARP functional activity in both surrogate and tumor tissue, and reported that strong signals were detected in hereditary ovarian cancer. \b \u001d  Between 5% and 10% of all breast and ovarian cancers are believed to be associated with mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Women with BRCA mutations are reported to have up to an 87% risk of developing breast cancer, and up to a 44% risk of developing ovarian cancer by the age of 70. \b \u001d  Professor James Carmichael of AstraZeneca said, \"We are delighted to be working with The Royal Marsden Hospital and Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) on this study, which is at the forefront of research into new targeted treatments for cancer. The early results we have seen in patients with hereditary ovarian cancer have encouraged us to move rapidly into the next phase of development for this compound.\" \b \u001d  AZD0530, another investigational compound in Phase II clinical development is an inhibitor of Src in tumours.  Src was the first cancer-causing gene to be discovered in the 1970s. Src kinases are a family of molecules that play an important role in cancer growth, spread, apoptosis and cell proliferation. By inhibiting Src it is hoped that cancer progression may be delayed. \b \u001d  Preclinical studies have identified AZD0530 as a selective inhibitor of Src activity.  In the study data presented today, biomarkers confirmed inhibition of Src in human cancers for the first time. \b \u001d  Principal Investigator for the study(1) presented today at ASCO, Jose Baselga MD, Chairman and Professor of Medicine, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain commented, \"The AZD0530 clinical trial program was exceptionally well-designed allowing full evaluation of the optimal methodology for measuring Src activation prior measuring its inhibition by AZD0530.  By collecting as much information early on in our clinical trials we give ourselves the best chance of identifying those patients who could benefit most from treatment with AZD0530 in the future.\" \b \b    About AstraZeneca \b \u001d  AstraZeneca is a major international healthcare business engaged in the research, development, manufacture and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals and the supply of healthcare services.

In March, Apax Partners led a team that agreed to buy Hub International Ltd., a Chicago-based broker, and two months before that, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s private-equity group agreed to pay $1.4 billion to acquire USI Holdings Corp. of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. \u001d  A small number of large insurance brokers tower above rivals in the industry. Beneath them the field quickly widens to include a broad array of small to medium-sized companies, some of which are strong in a particular niche or part of the country. That can create circumstances that make deals look attractive. \u001d  Alliant, for instance, specialized in arranging insurance coverage for public entities and law firms, while the unit of Jardine Lloyd Thompson that it bought was experienced in providing coverage for the energy and health care industries. \u001d  Blackstone, led by Stephen Schwarzman, will purchase the company in partnership with Alliant's management and employees, buying it from a Lindsay Goldberg, a New York investment firm which also held a stake with management and employees. \u001d  In a statement accompanying the announcement, Tom Corbett, Chairman and CEO of Alliant said, \"Blackstone's financial resources and commitment to work strategically with management teams will enable our firm to continue to expand.\"

No serious adverse events related to the study drug or to the administration procedure were reported and the treatment was well-tolerated. The majority of related adverse events were localized to the treatment site, with the most frequent being mild injection site pain. \b \u001d  Individual tumor responses were seen in 12 of 39 (31%) evaluated tumors after injection of different escalating doses (0.5 to 5 mg per tumor). Treated tumors (7 of 18, or 38%) showed local responses more frequently than did untreated tumors (5 of 21, or 24%). No overall clinical responses by standard RECIST criteria were observed among the 19 subjects evaluated following one or two cycles of treatment. Two subjects (11%) showed activity in distant, untreated tumors, including one subject showing shrinkage and disappearance of lung tumors. The data were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Chicago, June 1 - 5) by Jon M. Richards, M.D., Ph.D., Lutheran General Hospital Division of Hematology/Oncology. \b \u001d  \"The primary objective of our ongoing IL-2/electroporation study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of electroporation,\" said Ronald B. Moss, M.D., Vical's Vice President of Clinical Research, \"and the interim results appear to support its potential value in advanced cancer or other serious diseases. The need for premedication would limit the use of the current electroporation technology in less serious disease applications. We will monitor data from additional subjects, some of whom are already enrolled but have not yet completed therapy, as well as the secondary efficacy endpoints in this study on a longer-term basis, and evaluate whether further development of the IL-2 product is warranted.\" \b \b    Additional IL-2 pDNA Research \b \u001d  A recent publication by Vical researchers (Cancer Therapy, Vol. 5, 125-132, 2007) reported that mice bearing melanoma tumors below the skin and receiving electroporation following intratumoral administration of IL-2 pDNA had significant reductions in tumor growth compared with mice treated by IL-2 pDNA alone. In addition, 60% of the mice receiving IL-2 pDNA with electroporation became tumor-free, compared with 20% of the mice receiving IL-2 pDNA without electroporation. In a separate study reported in the same publication, mice bearing sarcoma tumors in the skin were evaluated for subsequent metastatic tumors in the liver. IL-2 pDNA treatment of the primary tumor with electroporation resulted in a significant reduction in subsequent metastatic tumor growth compared with IL-2 pDNA treatment alone. Among mice whose primary tumor was treated with IL-2 pDNA with electroporation, 65% had two or fewer subsequent metastatic tumors in the liver. Among mice treated with IL-2 pDNA without electroporation, none had two or fewer subsequent liver metastases, and 55% had liver metastases that were too numerous to count. \b \b    Phase 1 Trial Design \b \u001d  The Phase 1 study is evaluating an investigational method of delivering IL-2, a potent immune system stimulant, to subjects with recurrent metastatic melanoma. Intravenous delivery of IL-2 protein is approved as a treatment for metastatic melanoma, but frequently causes severe systemic toxicities. The novel treatment approach being studied in this Phase 1 trial involves direct injection into a tumor of pDNA encoding IL-2 followed by electroporation, the local application of electrical pulses designed to enhance the uptake of the pDNA into tumor cells. The pDNA is designed to cause cells within the tumor to produce high levels of IL-2 protein locally and stimulate the immune system to attack the tumor without the associated systemic toxicities. \b \u001d  Treatments in the trial are administered once a week in two four-week cycles, with each cycle followed by an observation period. The initial dose-escalation phase of the trial enrolled three subjects each at doses of 0.5 mg, 1.5 mg and 5 mg delivered to a single tumor per subject, with a final group receiving 5 mg in each of three tumors per subject. Additional subjects are treated at the highest dose of 5 mg per tumor in up to three injectable tumors. \b \b    About Vical \b \u001d  Vical researches and develops biopharmaceutical products based on its patented DNA delivery technologies for the prevention and treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases. Potential applications of the company's DNA delivery technology include DNA vaccines for infectious diseases or cancer, in which the expressed protein is an immunogen; cancer immunotherapeutics, in which the expressed protein is an immune system stimulant; and cardiovascular therapies, in which the expressed protein is an angiogenic growth factor. The company is developing certain infectious disease vaccines and cancer therapeutics internally. In addition, the company collaborates with major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that give it access to complementary technologies or greater resources. These strategic partnerships provide the company with mutually beneficial opportunities to expand its product pipeline and address significant unmet medical needs. Additional information on Vical is available at http://www.vical.com. \b \u001d  This press release contains forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Forward-looking statements include statements about the potential advantages of using Vical's DNA delivery technology followed by electroporation to cause local production of IL-2 by tumor cells and stimulate the immune system to attack the tumor and the potential value of this approach in advanced cancer or other serious diseases; as well as the company's focus, collaborative partners, product candidates, and developmental status. Risks and uncertainties include whether Vical or others will pursue continued development of electroporation-enhanced pDNA delivery; whether treatment by electroporation-enhanced delivery of pDNA encoding IL-2 will be shown to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and ultimately be developed and approved; whether results from any further clinical trials will be consistent with the interim data from this Phase 1 study; whether such treatment will provide sustained local expression of IL-2 at therapeutic levels without the toxicity associated with systemic delivery; whether electroporation-enhanced pDNA delivery will be useful for additional cancer or other serious diseases, or for broader therapeutic or prophylactic applications; the timing, nature and cost of clinical trials; whether Vical or others will seek or gain approval to market any product candidates; whether Vical or others will succeed in marketing any product candidates; and additional risks set forth in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements represent the company's judgment as of the date of this release. The company disclaims, however, any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements. \b \b \b    Contacts: Investors:                          Media: \b              Alan R.

In contrast to traditional triple- quadrupole mass spectrometers which are limited in the number of targets they can screen per LC run, the micrOTOF TargetAnalysis solution can easily handle several hundred compounds in a single LC run. This easy and robust workflow saves significant time when running multi-target applications like drugs/metabolites in urine, food safety analysis, forensic toxicology or environmental testing. \b \u001d  Dr. Ian Sanders, Executive Vice President of Bruker Daltonics, commented: \"With the launch of TargetAnalysis, Bruker Daltonics opens up an exciting application area for our unique ESI-TOF micrOTOF and micrOTOF-Q systems. With this novel screening software, our customers can now automatically create their own application-specific accurate mass libraries, for example, for pesticides in food or in doping control. Our unique AMIC (accurate mass ion chromatogram) technique, with a tolerance down to +/- 0.002 Da, dramatically reduces chemical background interference and greatly improves specificity. In addition, retrospective in silico screening for new or unexpected compounds is possible because unlike in triple-quad based MRM methods, we retain the full molecular information content in addition to the target library specific information.\" \b \b   ABOUT BRUKER BIOSCIENCES (NASDAQ: BRKR) \b \u001d  Bruker BioSciences Corporation in Billerica, Massachusetts, is the publicly traded parent company of Bruker Daltonics Inc., Bruker AXS Inc. and Bruker Optics Inc.

\b   By Jennifer Corbett Dooren \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--The risk of heart failure associated with adding Herceptin to chemotherapy drugs to treat women with early-stage breast cancer doesn't increase over time, according to a study scheduled to be presented Sunday at a major cancer meeting. \u001d  Herceptin, by Genentech (DNA) of South San Francisco, is designed to inhibit a protein known as HER2 that's present in about 20% to 25% of breast-cancer cases. The drug has been on the U.S. market since 1998 and is part of a treatment regimen that includes other chemotherapy drugs. \u001d  While the drug has been shown to significantly cut the chances of the cancer returning, Herceptin is also associated with a higher rate of heart failure. \u001d  Previous data from National Cancer Institute clinical trials involving Herceptin in women with early-stage, HER-2 positive cancer showed that while Herceptin reduced the risk of having the cancer return or spread to another part of the body by 52%, the three-year incidence of heart failure was 4.1% in the group of women who received Herceptin compared to 0.8% of women who received chemotherapy alone. \u001d  Now researchers, who are set to present data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting, say the heart-failure incidence among women treated with Herceptin over five years is 3.8%, or essentially unchanged from the three-year mark. The researchers also said some women on Herceptin who initially experienced a decline in heart function showed some improvement over time. \u001d  -By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9294; Jennifer.Corbett@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 10:30 ET (14:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"67bfe5776871a5982b1128d4f135ff0a","symR":["DB1.XE","DE0005810055"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Eurex May Trading Volume Down To 156M Contracts Vs 174M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T11:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DB1.XE","DE0005810055"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","SCR","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse AG said late Friday that in May 2007 trading volumes on the international derivatives exchange Eurex reached 156 million contracts versus 174 million in May 2006.

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \b   By Romit Guha and John Satish Kumar \u001d  Mumbai -- INDIA'S STOCK MARKET may be headed for a drop after running up more than 18% in the past 11 weeks, as shares get pricey and investors worry that higher costs could squeeze corporate earnings this financial year. \u001d  But a correction -- if it comes -- might be only a temporary setback. Although many fund managers expect the Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark Sensitive 30 index, or Sensex, to fall 10% to 15% from Friday's close of 14570.75 over the next three to four months, they are upbeat about the market's long-term prospects in the world's second-fastest-growing major economy. \u001d  \"We are circumspect about the near term. Valuations aren't cheap and [corporate] earnings will be under pressure from rising interest, wage and input costs,\" says Anoop Maheshwari, head of equities and corporate strategy at DSP Merrill Lynch, which manages 118.54 billion rupees ($2.94 billion) in assets. \u001d  The Sensex now trades at about 18 times projected earnings for this year. Other emerging markets such as South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand trade at an average 13 to 15 times projected earnings, analysts say. \u001d  The Indian market already has taken investors on a roller-coaster ride this year. The Sensex touched an all-time high of 14723.81 on Feb. 9, then skidded to the year's low of 12316.10 on March 16. Its rise since then has been helped by increased interest from foreign investors. The Sensex is up 5.7% so far in 2007. \u001d  One of the market's main speed bumps in the near term will likely be a slowdown in corporate earnings, say fund managers. Mr. Maheshwari expects earnings to grow 15% to 17% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008, down from about 30% in the previous fiscal year. \u001d  \"Interest costs have been rising, along with input costs such as wages and raw material,\" says Mihir Vora, head of equities at HSBC Asset Management (India). \u001d  Since January 2006, the Reserve Bank of India has raised its key overnight lending rate by 1.5 percentage points to 7.75% as part of efforts to check inflation, which eased to an annual rate of 5.06% in the week ended May 19 after staying above 6% between January and March. Higher interest rates can cut into economic growth and corporate earnings. \u001d  \"Until inflation ticks down a bit and interest rates head back down, I think it is going to cap the upside,\" says Jacqueline Aldhous, fund manager of the Forsyth Indian Opportunities Fund. \u001d  Indian exporters, including the information-technology sector that has been a main driver of the Sensex rally, are facing a threat to revenue and operating margins because of the rupee's appreciation against the dollar. \u001d  The rupee hit its strongest level against the dollar in nine years last Monday, at 40.28 per dollar. It closed at 40.61 Friday, putting it up about 9% this year. \u001d  Still, some fund managers say shares in big IT companies -- Infosys Technologies, Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services, which get more than 90% of their revenue from overseas -- are worth buying because they can raise prices and cut the cost of operations to offset the impact of the stronger rupee and pressure for higher wages. \u001d  Other sectors may be less resilient in the short term. HSBC's Mr. Vora regards shares in companies that make two- and three-wheeled vehicles, cement and fast-moving consumer goods as \"best avoided for the time being.\" \u001d  Vehicle makers like Hero Honda Motors, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor are facing \"serious earnings erosions\" thanks to higher costs and lack of pricing power amid strong competition, he says. Government-controlled prices for cement won't rise for a year. \u001d  Forsyth's Ms. Aldhous is \"wary\" of the oil-and-gas sector as global oil prices have climbed about 16% in the past three months. The Indian government will find it difficult to keep oil prices subsidized for long, she says, adding that any rise will push up inflation. \u001d  The Indian government fixes a level at which state-owned oil-marketing firms have to sell in the retail market. This level is tied to, but below, prevailing global oil prices. (The government won't end subsidies because this would increase retail prices and push up inflation.) \u001d  There is some risk, of course, that the Indian stock market could see a prolonged slide. If world oil prices shoot up and stay high for a long time, that would naturally push up inflation, lead to higher interest rates and further slow corporate earnings. If the fervor that foreign funds have for India cools, that could hurt liquidity. If leftist parties in the governing coalition gain strength, that could slow economic overhauls and privatization. \u001d  But many fund managers say that for investors with the patience to wait for returns, staying invested in Indian equities should pay off over a two- to three-year period. \u001d  The economy expanded 9.4% in the fiscal year ended March, its fastest pace in 18 years, driven by a boom in manufacturing and services. Though growth is expected to ease in coming quarters, the level should remain high. According to official estimates, India is poised to grow about 8.5% in the current fiscal year, second in Asia only to China. \u001d  And corporate-earnings growth of 15% to 17% is still \"among the highest in the world,\" says N. Sethuram, chief investment officer at SBI Mutual Fund. \u001d  Also, analysts expect many more individual Indians to buy stocks. With only about 3% of household savings in shares, \"equity ownership is still very low in India,\" Ms. Aldhous says. \"There is immense potential with disposable income rising among the Indian middle class. I think [the Sensex] could go to 16000\" by the end of 2007. \u001d  DSP Merrill's Mr. Maheshwari also is a longer-term bull, expecting the Sensex to rise 15% to 20% each year for the next three years, in line with his projections for corporate-earnings growth. He pegs sectors like capital goods, infrastructure and retail as offering strong potential. \u001d  He predicts construction companies such as Larsen & Toubro and IVRCL Infrastructures & Projects will benefit from government plans to increase spending to improve bad roads, inadequate airport and port facilities, and the severely crippled power sector in order to sustain economic growth. \u001d  Mr. Vora favors companies involved in power generation and transmission such as ABB Ltd. (India), Siemens India and state-controlled Bharat Heavy Electricals. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 17:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

Of foreign-focused funds tracked by Morningstar Inc., American Funds EuroPacific Growth stands at nearly $110 billion in assets, with sister fund Capital World Growth and Income not far behind, at $95 billion. Across the category, 25 others top $10 billion, and approximately 200 more exceed $1 billion. \u001d  The number of funds focused on foreign stocks has jumped to 822 from 713 since December 2003, according to Morningstar. And along the way, some that financial advisers and analysts find praiseworthy have managed to go unnoticed. So this month we hunted for a relatively undiscovered foreign offering, trolling among those with outstanding performance. \u001d  Smaller funds are more attractive to some investment professionals, like Walter S. Frank, editor of Moneyletter, a mutual-fund newsletter, because a tiny asset base allows for \"great flexibility in choosing investments.\" Managers generally need fewer great ideas for winning results, and smaller funds usually are more nimble in moving in and out of positions, buying and selling without causing an unfavorable price change. \u001d  Forward International Equity is one such fund he likes. It has about $50 million under management, while Forward Management LLC, San Francisco, has a total of $600 million in various accounts following strategies like that of the fund. \u001d  Other than a few advertisements, \"we haven't had major campaigns,\" says Alan Reid, Forward Management's president. \u001d  \"We are clearly in a very sweet spot and are not thinking of closing the fund, because [there is] a lot of capacity to move forward,\" he says, referring to the strong performance of international markets and the strength and experience of the fund's sub-adviser, Pictet Asset Management Ltd, a London-based division of Pictet & Cie., one of Switzerland's oldest banks. Forward hired Pictet Asset Management, with more than $100 billion under management, in September 2005 to run the fund. \u001d  Morningstar classifies Forward International as a foreign large-growth stock fund, but it can invest in large-, mid- or small-cap companies, says fund co-manager Fabio Paolini. It looks at individual companies more than the economies they are in. Good management, future prospects and low stock valuations are among the features that the fund's managers put a premium on. \u001d  \"The first year was very good [for Forward International's new management], but they had the wind at their backs\" in Europe, notes Mr. Frank, the newsletter editor. In 2006, the fund finished in the top 5% of its Morningstar category, up 34%. \u001d  So far this year, through May 31, it is up 13.2%, in the top 9% of performance for its peer group, and for the trailing 12 months, it is up 35.5%, putting it in the top 4%. For those periods, it also is ahead of its benchmark indexes. Morningstar rates the fund four stars, its second-highest rating. \u001d  Co-manager Richard Heelis joined Pictet in 1999 and has headed its regional equities team since 2003. Prior to joining Pictet, he was responsible for the Japanese stock funds of Norwich Union, now a part of big U.K. insurer Aviva Co. Mr. Paolini joined Pictet in 1994, initially as part of the economics team. \u001d  The two also are subadvisers to Accessor International Equity, a foreign large-blend fund with $235 million in assets that finished 2006 in the top 1% of its category, up 33%. \u001d  Mr. Frank says the new management is experienced and benefits from a \"large back-up team of analysts. Pictet is a huge, highly regarded, firm\" with an \"extremely thorough\" investment process, he says. \u001d  Another plus: Forward International's expense ratio as of May 1 was 1.24%, according to a Forward spokesperson. That's less than the average 1.60% for international funds, according to Morningstar. \u001d  Big holdings as of March 31 included Danieli & C., an Italian metals supplier; German steel distributor Kloeckner & Co., French oil giant Total SA, National Bank of Greece and UniCredito Italiano SpA. \u001d  The fund had 63% of its money invested in the U.K. and Europe, with Italy and Germany especially prominent. Japanese shares represented about 13%. Financial stocks dominated, at about 30% of the fund. The next biggest sector was industrial materials, at about 15%. \u001d  Emerging markets such as Russia, South Korea and Egypt have been represented in recent months, too. The fund considers Turkey a very interesting market, and one of its big positions is Aksigorta AS, a leading Turkish insurer. \u001d  The fund can be purchased through funds supermarkets of most major brokerage firms or directly through www.forwardfunds.com. \u001d  --- \u001d  Ms. Little is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Berman \u001d  As representatives of both companies prepare to meet today, News Corp. is willing to go further than it has gone before in acceding to tighter editorial-independence controls to win Dow Jones & Co., people close to News Corp. said yesterday. \u001d  But Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corp., made clear in an interview Friday that he isn't willing to yield to what may be a key demand from the Bancroft family, Dow Jones's controlling shareholder: that the family control any editorial-oversight board created to protect Dow Jones's editorial independence in the event of a deal. \u001d  Such a board should comprise \"people with absolutely no business connections to me nor the family,\" Mr. Murdoch said, adding that the family \"can't sell [Dow Jones] and keep it\" by joining a newly created board. \"I can't put down $5 billion of my shareholders' money and not be able to run the business,\" Mr. Murdoch said. He stressed that he has \"no plans to change anything\" on the editorial or news sides of the paper. \u001d  The issue of editorial independence for Dow Jones and its flagship title, The Wall Street Journal, will be paramount when Mr. Murdoch and his second-oldest son, James Murdoch, the CEO of News Corp. affiliate company British Sky Broadcasting, meet today with three members of the Bancroft family. The meeting is the first since News Corp. submitted an offer of $60 a share, or $5 billion, for Dow Jones in April. A majority of the family initially said they weren't interested but Thursday shifted position, acknowledging a willingness to talk to News Corp. and consider any other suitors as well. \u001d  Mr. Murdoch's guarantees of editorial independence are meant to convince the Bancrofts to sell the company without feeling they have betrayed the family's generations-old commitment to the integrity of the journalistic enterprise. Some family members have made clear they don't approve of Mr. Murdoch's approach to newspapers; they are considering a sale only because they feel Dow Jones can't operate effectively on its own, and no third parties have appeared to compete with Mr. Murdoch's bid. \u001d  Mr. Murdoch has suggested creating an independent board like that which is supposed to guarantee the editorial independence of the Times of London and the Sunday Times, which he acquired in 1981. That board must approve appointment of editors. Some critics have said the board has proved ineffective, failing to stop Mr. Murdoch from forcing out editors he didn't like -- most famously Harold Evans in 1982. The Bancroft family isn't expected to try to re-create the Times board, according to people familiar with the discussions. Among Mr. Murdoch and his advisers -- JPMorgan Chase, Centerview Partners, Allen & Co. and law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP -- there is a growing view that the \"Times of London\" structure won't be adequate to convince the Bancrofts to sell. \u001d  News Corp. would be willing to explore a structure similar to that historically used by Reuters PLC, according to people close to News Corp. This arrangement gave the Reuters trustees veto power over any deal, something they will maintain in the newly combined Thomson-Reuters company. The arrangement also granted trustees broad rights and privileges. No shareholder could own more than 15% of the company's shares without the trustees' consent. As part of the deal with Thomson Corp., Reuters trustees must be \"consulted\" before any editor-in-chief of Reuters is appointed or removed. \u001d  The meeting, which will be held at the offices of family legal adviser Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, is designed as part social gathering and part business meeting, according to people familiar with the plans. One of its main goals is to get the three Bancroft family members attending the meeting -- Christopher Bancroft, Leslie Hill and Elizabeth Steele, who are also Dow Jones directors -- comfortable with Mr. Murdoch and his family. The Bancrofts will be accompanied by Dow Jones Chairman M. Peter McPherson, family trustee Michael Elefante and attorney Martin Lipton, who is advising the family. Also attending on the News Corp. side will be Chief Financial Officer David DeVoe and General Counsel Lawrence Jacobs. At the meeting, Mr. Murdoch is expected to do more listening than talking, people close to News Corp. said. \u001d  To prepare for today's meeting, Mr. Elefante held two conference calls with the Bancroft family directors and representatives of Dow Jones's news operations on Thursday night and Friday afternoon. The calls were set up at the family's request to get guidance on how best to preserve Dow Jones's journalistic integrity and included representatives from the company's news divisions, including Marcus Brauchli, the Journal's new managing editor; L. Gordon Crovitz, the Journal's publisher; Paul Gigot, editorial-page editor of the Journal; Clare Hart, president of Dow Jones's Enterprise Media Group, which includes Dow Jones Newswires and Factiva, an aggregator of news and information; Neal Lipschutz, managing editor of Dow Jones Newswires; and John Wilcox, president of Dow Jones's Community Media Group, which comprises the Ottaway group of local newspapers. Several news executives have prepared memos for the family to give them guidance in their negotiations with Mr. Murdoch, according to people familiar with the matter. \u001d  Mr. Brauchli said in a statement: \"No asset is more important to the Journal than its editorial independence, including the freedom to decide what and whom the Journal covers, how and in what media, and with what resources. Our integrity is the wellspring of our value to readers, and we're grateful that both the Bancroft family and Rupert Murdoch appreciate this and are focused on preserving it. I will do everything I can to ensure that the Journal's news department remains independent and vital.\" \u001d  Some of the advice given to the family went beyond simply protecting the Journal and sought to protect The Wall Street Journal brand by limiting how Mr. Murdoch could use the Journal name, these people said. The Journal already has strict controls over the use of its name with licensees.

-- Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MLNM) today presented results of research on a new oncology molecule, MLN4924, a first-in-class, small molecule inhibitor of the Nedd 8 Activating Enzyme (NAE).  NAE is a novel Millennium-discovered target in the protein homeostasis pathway.  NAE acts upstream of the proteasome, the target of VELCADE(R) (bortezomib) for Injection, the Company's market-leading therapy for patients with previously treated multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.  The data on NAE were presented at the 43rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago. \b \b    (LOGO: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/19991220/MLNMLOGO ) \b \u001d  \"Millennium is a leader in protein homeostasis research, and our discoveries of NAE and MLN4924 demonstrate our strength and innovation in this unique area,\" said Joe Bolen, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Millennium. \"Building on the clinical and commercial success of VELCADE, we believe that MLN4924 has the potential to deliver enhanced efficacy with an improved safety profile in a broad range of solid and hematological tumors.  The preclinical work conducted to date has shown that MLN4924 has substantial and durable anti-tumor activity.\" \b \u001d  Data presented by Mark Rolfe, Ph.D., Vice President, Millennium Oncology Discovery, showed: \b \b \b    -- NAE is a novel target in the protein homeostasis pathway that \b       specifically controls a subset of proteins which regulates survival of \b       cancer cells \b    -- NAE has been validated as an oncology target in hematological and solid \b       tumors \b           - Molecular pathology studies have shown elevated NAE expression in \b             primary human tumors including colon, lung and ovarian as well as \b             colon metastasis to the liver \b           - Conversely, NAE expression is low in normal human tissues \b    -- MLN4924 has shown substantial activity in a broad range of preclinical \b       solid and hematological tumor models \b \b \u001d  The Company is currently conducting investigational new drug (IND) enabling work for MLN4924 and expects to enter human clinical trials with the molecule in advanced cancer patients in 2008. \b \b    About VELCADE \b \u001d  VELCADE is being co-developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C. Millennium is responsible for commercialization of VELCADE in the U.S., Janssen-Cilag is responsible for commercialization in Europe and the rest of the world. Janssen Pharmaceutical K.K. is responsible for commercialization in Japan. For a limited period of time, Millennium and Ortho Biotech Inc. will co-promote VELCADE in the U.S.  VELCADE is approved in more than 80 countries worldwide. \b \u001d  In the U.S., VELCADE is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. VELCADE is indicated for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy. VELCADE is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, or mannitol. VELCADE should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic therapy. In the European Union and many other countries worldwide, VELCADE is approved for patients with multiple myeloma after first relapse. \b \u001d  Risks associated with VELCADE therapy include new or worsening peripheral neuropathy, hypotension observed throughout therapy, cardiac and pulmonary disorders, gastrointestinal adverse events, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and tumor lysis syndrome. Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with VELCADE. Cases of severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported. The long-term outcome of peripheral neuropathy has not been studied in mantle cell lymphoma. Acute development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and/or new onset of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction has been reported, including reports in patients with few or no risk factors for decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. There have been rare reports of acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease of unknown etiology such as pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, lung infiltration and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in patients receiving VELCADE. Some of these events have been fatal. A higher proportion of these events have been reported in Japan. There have been rare reports of RPLS in patients receiving VELCADE. RPLS is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present with seizure, hypertension, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances. VELCADE is associated with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. There have been reports of gastrointestinal and intracerebral hemorrhage in association with VELCADE. Transfusions may be considered. Complete blood counts (CBC) should be frequently monitored during treatment with VELCADE. Rare cases of acute liver failure have been reported in patients receiving multiple concomitant medications and with serious underlying medical conditions. \b \u001d  Safety Data: In 1163 patients in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma studies, the most commonly reported adverse events were asthenic conditions (64%), nausea (55%), diarrhea (52%), constipation (41%), peripheral neuropathy (39%), thrombocytopenia (36%), appetite decrease, including reports of anorexia (36%), pyrexia (34%), vomiting (33%) and anemia (29%). Twenty percent of patients reported at least one episode of grade 4 toxicity; the most common grade 4 toxicities were thrombocytopenia (5%) and neutropenia (3%). Fifty percent of patients reported serious adverse events. The most commonly reported serious adverse events were pneumonia (7%), pyrexia (6%), diarrhea (5%), vomiting (4%), and nausea, dehydration, dyspnea and thrombocytopenia (each 3%). \b \u001d  For more information about VELCADE clinical trials, patients and physicians can contact the Millennium Medical Product Information Department at 1-866-VELCADE (1-866-835-2233). \b \b    About Millennium \b \u001d  Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a leading biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Mass., markets VELCADE, a novel cancer product, and has a robust clinical development pipeline of product candidates.

Median survival for the TELCYTA arm was 4.6 months as compared with 6.1 months for the active control arm. Median progression-free survival was 2.2 months for the TELCYTA arm as compared with 2.3 months for the gefitinib arm. \b \u001d  TELCYTA was very well-tolerated with infrequent hematologic or non- hematologic adverse events in a heavily pretreated population. \b \u001d  \"We thank the patients, investigators and staffs who participated in this large clinical trial,\" said Gail L.

-- Telik, Inc. (Nasdaq: TELK) reported results of the TELCYTA (canfosfamide HCl, TLK286) ASSIST-1 trial today at the 43rd annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). \b \u001d  The Phase 3, international, randomized, active control study enrolled 461 women with advanced, platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer whose disease had progressed following first-line platinum-based therapy and second- line treatment with either liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan.  Two hundred thirty-two women were randomized to TELCYTA treatment and 229 women were randomized to treatment with one of the active control drugs (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) or topotecan), depending upon their second-line treatment.  The two arms of the study were balanced for key ovarian cancer disease characteristics, platinum refractory or resistant status, and other prognostic or predictive factors. \b \u001d  The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of demonstrating superiority in overall survival or the secondary endpoint of demonstrating superiority in progression-free survival on the TELCYTA arm as compared with the active control arm. Median survival on the TELCYTA arm was 8.5 months compared with 13.6 months on the active control arm (p <0.01). Median progression-free survival was 2.3 months on the TELCYTA arm compared with 4.3 months on the active control arm. \b \u001d  The performance of the drugs on the active control arm, PLD or topotecan, was unexpected based on reported data, and no known prognostic or predictive factors accounted for this result. In addition, patients treated with PLD tended to have superior overall survival as compared with patients treated with topotecan, also an unexpected result as published reports suggest that survival outcomes in platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer patients are similar for both agents. \b \u001d  TELCYTA was very well-tolerated with infrequent hematologic or non- hematologic adverse events in a heavily pretreated population. \b \u001d  \"The known in vitro synergism with carboplatin, paclitaxel and anthracyclines and the excellent tolerability profile of canfosfamide in heavily pretreated, third-line ovarian cancer patients support further studies with canfosfamide in combination regimens in second line therapy,\" said Professor Dr. Ignace Vergote, Chairman, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium, principal investigator for the ASSIST-1 trial. Dr. Vergote also is principal investigator for the ongoing ASSIST-5 Phase 3 trial which is evaluating the combination of TELCYTA plus PLD to PLD alone in second-line platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer. \b \u001d  Telik, Inc. of Palo Alto, CA is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel small molecule drugs to treat serious diseases. The company's most advanced drug development candidate is TELCYTA, a tumor-activated small molecule product candidate in clinical development for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. A second drug development candidate, TELINTRA(TM) (TLK199), is in clinical development for myelodysplastic syndrome. Telik's product candidates were discovered using its proprietary drug discovery technology, TRAP(TM), which enables the rapid and efficient discovery of small molecule drug candidates. Additional information is available at www.telik.com. \b \u001d  This press release contains \"forward-looking\" statements, including statements regarding the potential for TELCYTA to treat one or more types of cancer.  There are important factors that could cause Telik's results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, including, among others, that none of Telik's product candidates have been determined to be safe or effective in humans or been approved for marketing, clinical trials of Telik's product candidates may take several years to complete and may not be successful, success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful and interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict final results.  Detailed information regarding factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by statements in this press release may be found in Telik's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the factors described in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in its annual report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007.

Roche also markets Herceptin overseas. Tykerb, a pill taken orally, is designed to treat women with advanced breast cancer that test positive for a protein known as HER2, which accounts for about 20% to 25% of all breast cancer cases. \u001d  Dr. Angelo Di Leo, of the Hospital of Prato in Italy, is scheduled to present the first look at Phase III data of women with advanced breast cancer treated with Tykerb in combination with the commonly used chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, sold under the brand name Taxol by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY). \u001d   Women in the study had breast cancer that had spread to other parts of the body or cancer that returned after previous treatment. None of the patients had previously been treated with Herceptin, a Genentech drug approved for use in women with HER2-positive cancer. \u001d   The study included 580 women who were enrolled in the study from January 2004 to July 2005. Patients were either HER2 negative or untested for HER2. Overall, the addition of Tykerb to paclitaxel didn't provide a treatment benefit. \u001d  But the company said an analysis of 91 patients who were later identified as having HER2-positive disease showed that Tykerb was beneficial. Of the 91 patients, 52 received Tykerb and paclitaxel while 39 received paclitaxel alone. The median progression-free survival was 7.9 months fpr those receiving Tykerb compared to 5.2 months for those not receiving the drug. Progression-free survival measures the time before cancer starts advancing or getting worse. \u001d  A complete or partial response occurred in 60% of patients who received Tykerb compared to 36% who did not. A complete response is when the cancer can't be detected by standard tests, and a partial response is when a tumor shrinks. \u001d  The company said there was a \"trend\" toward better survival based on data available after 39 patients who were HER2 positive died, but said the data aren't fully mature. Those who had received Tykerb had a median survival of 24 months compared to 19 months among those receiving paclitaxel alone. \u001d  The study showed that deaths related to drug side effects was higher in the Tykerb arm at 2.6% than in the chemotherapy alone arm at 0.6%. \u001d   Glaxo said several additional studies looking at Tykerb in combination with chemotherapy drugs are being conducted in patients with HER2 positive disease. \u001d  -By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, Dow Jones Newswires;

(IBM), which now runs subsidiary IBM Japan Ltd. through its supervisory firm for the Asia-Pacific region, plans to take direct control of the local unit in October to better meet the needs of Japanese clients, The Nikkei reported in its Monday morning edition. \u001d  The computer products and services giant currently has four supervisory firms for global operations, and IBM Japan reports such figures as sales and demand trends to the Asia-Pacific supervisory firm.  The regional supervisory firm then conveys the information to the U.S. parent and draws up business strategies. \u001d  But the Japanese unit is to be separated from the Asia-Pacific supervisory firm, and Japan is to become its own region.  Starting in October, IBM Japan will report directly to officials in charge at the U.S. parent. \u001d  Although the Japanese market for information-technology-related goods and services isn't expected to grow significantly because of a maturing market, Japanese automakers and other manufacturers are expanding production and sales networks in such emerging markets as Russia and Brazil.  IBM believes that by having new data on such clients conveyed directly to headquarters, it will be able to better tap demand for information systems abroad. \u001d  According to research firm IDC Japan and others, the domestic IT-related market - which includes servers, software and information systems - is expected to grow at only an annual 2% or so over the next few years.  In such areas as China and Southeast Asia, however, double-digit growth is projected. \u001d  But many Asia-Pacific countries, such as China and Southeast Asian nations, lack the advanced corporate information infrastructure of Japan.  So corporate demand for information systems differs, and drawing up a common business strategy for the region is difficult. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 15:43 ET (19:43 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"86aca699d107f8bdaf9b3a6ec4f4a7d0","symR":["STEI"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Stewart Enterprises, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["STEI"],"IndustryCodes":["CSV","XDJGI","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Stewart Enterprises, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=STEI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:32 ET (09:32 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"86c30b8498f6d8bbd1d6eb3a26d12f4b","symR":["5004.FR","FR0000050049"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Viel & Cie","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5004.FR","FR0000050049"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR"],"Story":"\u001d  Viel & Cie: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=FR0000050049 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:35 ET (09:35 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"86ce34a5af4d0c601aa57908a574f6f0","symR":["RNJ"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Blackrock NJ Quality Inv Trust, Inc (RNJ)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RNJ"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Blackrock NJ Quality Inv Trust, Inc (RNJ): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=RNJ or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:31 ET (07:31 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"86ce6128ab6845158a9babd3fd6266dc","symR":["BTE","BTE.UN.T","CA0731761098"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Baytex Energy Trust","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BTE","BTE.UN.T","CA0731761098"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  Baytex Energy Trust: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BTE or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:16 ET (07:16 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"86d6bf1b825968469ad7b6c81a2a4050","symR":["2409.TW","AUO","TW0002409000"],"date":"2007-06-04","ret":[-0.00099,1.003713,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.082302,-0.00099],"Headline":"Taiwan AU Optronics Plans To Boost Flat-Panel Capacity-Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-04T03:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["2409.TW","AUO","TW0002409000"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TAIPEI (Dow Jones)--Taiwan's AU Optronics Corp.

Motor Co. (7267.TO) will not introduce a hybrid model of the Accord when the popular sedan undergoes a full design change in autumn for the North American market, The Nikkei reported in its Sunday edition. \u001d  The automaker has decided to change its plan to produce hybrid models in the Accord series, and will instead release gasoline-electric versions only of the Civic and another subcompact currently under development. \u001d  Midsize and large vehicles such as the Accord will be equipped with a new type of clean diesel engine that is slated to be introduced in 2009. \u001d  The decision is in line with Honda's announcement that it will offer different eco-friendly technologies in its subcompacts and larger vehicles. The company plans to promote the clean diesel engine it is developing as its key environmental technology, differentiating itself from Toyota Motor Corp., which is concentrating on hybrid vehicles. \u001d  In Europe, Honda sells the Accord equipped with conventional diesel engines. \u001d  In and after 2009, it plans to install its new, clean diesel engine in the Accord, the CR-V sport utility vehicle and the Odyssey minivan. \u001d  In 2004, Honda started marketing hybrid versions of the Accord in North America, selling about 24,600 of them through the end of 2006. \b \u001d  (END) Dow

Roche also markets Herceptin overseas. Tykerb, a pill taken orally, is designed to treat women with advanced breast cancer that test positive for a protein known as HER2, which accounts for about 20% to 25% of all breast cancer cases. \u001d  Dr. Angelo Di Leo, of the Hospital of Prato in Italy, presented the first look at Phase III data of women with advanced breast cancer treated with Tykerb in combination with the commonly used chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, sold under the brand name Taxol by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY). \u001d   Women in the study had breast cancer that had spread to other parts of the body or cancer that returned after previous treatment. None of the patients had previously been treated with Herceptin, a Genentech drug approved for use in women with HER2-positive cancer. \u001d   The study included 580 women who were enrolled in the study from January 2004 to July 2005. Patients were either HER2 negative or untested for HER2. Overall, the addition of Tykerb to paclitaxel didn't provide a treatment benefit. \u001d  But the company said an analysis of 91 patients who were later identified as having HER2-positive disease showed that Tykerb was beneficial. Of the 91 patients, 52 received Tykerb and paclitaxel while 39 received paclitaxel alone. The median progression-free survival was 7.9 months for those receiving Tykerb compared to 5.2 months for those not receiving the drug. Progression-free survival measures the time before cancer starts advancing or getting worse. \u001d  A complete or partial response occurred in 60% of patients who received Tykerb compared to 36% who did not. A complete response is when the cancer can't be detected by standard tests, and a partial response is when a tumor shrinks. \u001d  The company said there was a \"trend\" toward better survival based on data available after 39 patients who were HER2 positive died, but said the data aren't fully mature. Those who had received Tykerb had a median survival of 24 months compared to 19 months among those receiving paclitaxel alone. \u001d  The study showed that deaths related to drug side effects was higher in the Tykerb arm at 2.6% than in the chemotherapy alone arm at 0.6%. \u001d   Glaxo said several additional studies looking at Tykerb in combination with chemotherapy drugs are being conducted in patients with HER2 positive disease. \b \b    Researchers Looking At Tykerb For Brain Tumors \u001d  A Phase 2 study involving 241 women with HER2 positive breast cancer that had spread to the brain looked at whether Tykerb would have any impact on the advancement of the disease. The study is ongoing but researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, part of Harvard Medical School, presented the first look at data from the study. \u001d  Tykerb was given to women in the study who enrolled between December 2005 and November 2006. The women were followed until May 2007. They had previously received several other drugs including Herceptin. \u001d  The study showed brain tumors shrank in 19 patients, which is considered a partial response to the drug. Across all 241 patients, there was a period averaging 15 weeks before the disease progressed, or got worse. About one-fifth of patients did not experience any worsening of their disease within the first 6 months on therapy. \u001d  \"Results of this study indicate that (Tykerb)...has modest but real activity against brain metastases in women who have had multiple prior treatments for their breast cancer,\" said Nancy Lin, the study's lead author. \u001d  -By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, Dow Jones

JOURNAL) \u001d  Australia's Macquarie Bankhas enjoyed success managing specialist infrastructure funds, which invest in everything from toll roads to airports. Yet its business model has attracted criticism. Recently its stock fell by some 10% after a well-known investor questioned the bank's valuation methods. The market reaction suggests Macquarie Bank needs to address a credibility problem. \u001d  Macquarie Bank's funds, many of which are publicly listed, tend to pay generous dividends. But these aren't always paid from profits, or even from cash flows of the businesses. Instead, Macquarie Bank revalues its investments every quarter, reporting increases in valuation as revenue. The funds sometimes borrow against these gains to finance their dividend payments. The Macquarie Infrastructure Group, a 9.5 billion-Australian-dollar (US$7.9 billion) fund that is listed in Australia and manages toll roads around the world, shows how this works. \u001d  Last year, Macquarie Infrastructure reported fiscal-year revenue of more than A$1 billion. Yet around 40% of this revenue came from revaluations of its toll-road stakes. Without these, Macquarie Infrastructure wouldn't have reported a profit. Furthermore, cash distributions to shareholders exceeded the fund's net cash flow by A$231 million. This shortfall was made up by borrowing money and selling new securities. According to Merrill Lynch, dividends exceeded operating cash flow at several other Macquarie Bank funds. \u001d  There's nothing illegal here. Revaluation profits on investments are allowed under so-called fair-value accounting rules. When assets have a market price, this practice is uncontroversial. But at Macquarie Bank's funds, the bank controls the valuation models that generate much of the profits. The models contain forecasts of future revenues, which are discounted back to the present. Although Macquarie Bank makes public the discount rate used in the models and provides updates on operations, the revenue projections remain secret. As a result, the models remain something of a black box. \u001d  This was the subject of recent criticisms lodged by hedge-fund manager Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates. He alleges they allow Macquarie Bank to generate profits at will and can be used to justify overpaying for assets. Mr. Chanos, a professional short-seller, has an interest in seeing Macquarie Bank's stock fall. \u001d  Nevertheless, there are grounds for concern. Last year, Macquarie Bank and its Spanish partner Cintra acquired the concession to run the Indiana Toll Road for $3.8 billion, paying nearly $1 billion more than the runner-up. In this instance, Macquarie Bank used an Australian consultant, Maunsell, part of U.S. engineer Aecom Technology, to produce the traffic and revenue forecasts. Maunsell has a long relationship with Macquarie Bank and sometimes receives success fees when Macquarie Bank wins a toll-road deal. Such payments might seem to create a potential conflict of interest. Macquarie Bank says it often pays success fees to advisers. \u001d  In any event, Maunsell's forecasts for the Indiana Toll Road were higher than the projections of independent consultants employed by the state and by the banks financing the deal. Macquarie Bank says traffic consultants for creditors tend to be overly cautious. There's another concern. Macquarie employed a lot of debt in this deal, some of which came with low initial interest payments. The interest on these loans is set to rise over time, which could create a problem if the toll road's revenue forecasts are too optimistic. \u001d  Macquarie Bank defends its valuation models, which are signed off by its accountants and overseen by the independent directors at its funds. Macquarie Bank Chief Executive Allan Moss responded to Mr. Chanos's criticisms by saying that \"informed investors\" weren't concerned. The fall in Macquarie Bank's stock price suggests otherwise. There's one way to lay this issue at rest. Macquarie Bank should publish its models. The bank says they contain sensitive information and would overwhelm investors with detail. But infrastructure businesses have few secrets. As for information overload, investors are the best judge of that. \u001d  -- Edward Chancellor and Lauren Silva \u001d  --- \u001d  This column is written by breakingviews.com, an online financial commentary site. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 20:26 ET (00:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"93d3b054085252970911862a3ecd8d19","symR":["NGO"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen CT Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 (NGO)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T08:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NGO"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen CT Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 (NGO): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NGO or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 04:49 ET (08:49 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"945dc338832cfa463a8f75db71d27918","symR":["GCH"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Greater China Fund Inc.

/PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Telik, Inc. (Nasdaq: TELK) reported results of the TELCYTA (canfosfamide HCl, TLK286) ASSIST-3 trial today at the 43rd annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). \b \u001d  The Phase 3, randomized, active control study enrolled 247 women with advanced, platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer whose disease had progressed following first-line platinum-based therapy.  One hundred twenty- three women were randomized to treatment with the combination of TELCYTA and carboplatin and 124 women were randomized to treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD).  The two arms of the study were balanced for key ovarian cancer disease characteristics, platinum refractory or resistant status, and other prognostic or predictive factors. All patients had platinum refractory or resistant disease, with a platinum-free interval (PFI, from the date of last treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy to the date of documented disease progression) of six months or less. \b \u001d  Patients were treated until disease progression, as determined by radiologic evaluations at each site, or unacceptable toxicity. A central, blinded independent radiology review also was conducted. \b \u001d  Assessment of the primary endpoint, objective response rate by RECIST, may have been compromised because approximately 25% of patients were prematurely discontinued from the study for disease progression, as assessed by the independent radiology review. Median progression-free survival, the secondary endpoint of the trial, assessed by independent radiology review, was 3.5 months on both arms. \b \u001d  As expected with a platinum-containing regimen, there were more hematologic toxicities on the TELCYTA plus carboplatin arm as compared with the PLD arm. These toxicities were well managed with growth factor support or dose reductions as clinically appropriate. Febrile neutropenia occurred only on the PLD arm. Non-hematologic toxicities were more common on the PLD arm, also as expected. Patient-reported quality of life outcomes consistently favored the TELCYTA plus carboplatin arm over the PLD arm, although the differences were not statistically significant. \b \u001d  A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors was conducted including all prespecified patient characteristics and stratification factors. There were statistically significant differences between the two arms of the study in patients who had a drug-free period (DFP, from the date of last treatment with any anti-cancer treatment to the first study treatment) of greater than or equal to six months. Thirty-eight patients, 19 on each arm, had a DFP of six months or more. In this group, median progression-free survival was 3.5 months on the PLD arm versus not yet reached on the TELCYTA plus carboplatin arm (p . 0.01). Median survival was 11.1 months on the PLD arm versus not yet reached on the TELCYTA plus carboplatin arm. The objective response rate (as assessed by the independent radiology review) was 31.6% on the TELCYTA plus carboplatin arm, as compared with 10.5% on the PLD arm. \b \u001d  \"The combination of TELCYTA and carboplatin has demonstrated promise and is an active regimen in platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer, a significant unmet need,\" said Peter Rose, M.D., Section Head, Gynecologic Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, and principal investigator for the ASSIST-3 trial. \"Survival follow-up in the overall trial and in the patients with a DFP of six months or more is in progress.\" \b \u001d  \"New agents to treat women with advanced ovarian cancer are greatly needed, particularly for women whose disease is platinum refractory or resistant,\" said Sherry Salway Black, Executive Director of the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance. \"While it is disappointing that this trial did not meet its primary endpoint, we are encouraged by the ongoing Phase 3 study of TELCYTA plus standard chemotherapy in the second-line therapy of ovarian cancer.\" \b \u001d  \"We thank the patients, investigators and staff who participated in this trial,\" said Gail L. Brown, M.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer. \"We are exploring the biology of platinum resistance and resensitization to identify optimal drug-free periods following platinum exposure,\" said Dr. Brown \b \u001d  Telik, Inc. of Palo Alto, CA is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel small molecule drugs to treat serious diseases. The company's most advanced drug development candidate is TELCYTA, a tumor-activated small molecule product candidate in clinical development for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. A second drug development candidate, TELINTRA(TM) (TLK199), is in clinical development for myelodysplastic syndrome. Telik's product candidates were discovered using its proprietary drug discovery technology, TRAP(TM), which enables the rapid and efficient discovery of small molecule drug candidates.

(From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Jed Horowitz \u001d  Mark Werner, head of global markets at Bank of America Corp. for the past three years, has left the company along with three senior aides, the bank said. \u001d  Thomas White, who was in charge of trading credit products such as bonds, will succeed Mr. Werner and also assume his title as chief executive of Banc of America Securities, a spokeswoman said. Brian Brille, who heads the investment-banking side of the securities unit and was Mr. Werner's co-equal, remains at the company. \u001d  Mr. Werner, who couldn't be reached to comment, is leaving \"to pursue other opportunities,\" the Charlotte, N.C., bank said. \u001d  \"We thank Mark for his contributions to our business and wish him well in his future endeavors,\" said Gene Taylor, president of global corporate and investment banking. \u001d  Tom Berkery, who was chief operating officer of the securities unit, also has left, along with institutional sales head Pat Coleman and Tom Connor, who was in charge of trading liquid products such as currencies, commodities and interest-rate derivatives. \u001d  Rich Prager, who ran commodities and reported to Mr. Connor, will take his role as head of the liquid-products unit, the spokeswoman said. The bank hasn't yet named successors for Messrs. Berkery and Coleman. \u001d  Mr. Werner joined the New York-based securities unit of the bank in the summer of 2004 from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and is believed to have had a three-year contract, said a headhunter familiar with the bank. The spokeswoman declined to comment. \u001d  Bank of America has lagged behind competitors in sales and trading of stocks, bonds and derivatives-areas that have fueled record profits the past two years at Wall Street powerhouses such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch & Co. and that also flourished at commercial banks. \u001d  Bank of America this year ranks 10th as a global underwriter of securities based on value of deals, with a 2.1% market share, according to Dealogic. J.P. Morgan ranks first, followed by Citigroup Inc., UBS AG, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 19:51 ET (23:51 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow

Now, Nokia is going to painstaking lengths to produce new phones with style. \u001d  Nokia is pinning its hopes on the Nokia 6500 classic, which the company says is one of its five key products this year. The world's largest cellphone maker hopes the phone, which it expects to go on sale later this year in many markets globally but not the U.S., will be an important weapon in its battle to reclaim the title as king of design from a host of contenders, including Motorola, Samsung Electronics Co., and Sony Ericsson, a joint venture between Sony Corp. and Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson. Meanwhile, the entrance of Apple Inc.'s high-end iPhone, with its well-known brand and easy-to use software, has further put pressure on Nokia. \u001d  The effort that Nokia put into the phone reflects the increasingly competitive world facing cellphone makers as their main markets are saturated with people who already own handsets. Phone makers make difficult trade-offs between design and function, agonizing over the smallest details in hope of winning over customers who have an ever-expanding array of choices. \u001d  For 18 months, a Nokia design team here fretted: Should it be metal or plastic? Silver or black? Could they make it even slimmer? For example, to make the 6500 classic a fraction of a millimeter thinner, Nokia's design team ordered its suppliers to build a new antenna and spent several weeks doing additional tests. \u001d  \"Slimness is key,\" says Christian Riise, 36 years old, a Nokia product manager who shepherded the phone. \u001d  One of the first handset makers to grasp the importance of design in the 1990s, Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, has stumbled in recent years by missing several important trends including clamshell-shaped phones, sharp color screens, and, most recently, thin phones. That opened the way for competitors. The company's products, while reliable and easy to use, remain, in many cases, bulky and boring-looking, analysts and customers say. Fixing its design organization is a top priority of Nokia's chief executive, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, who took the helm last summer. \u001d  \"To some extent we lost the quality of design,\" says Kai Oistamoe, head of Nokia's mobile-phone unit that makes low- and mid-priced handsets. Nokia had placed more emphasis on the technical features of the phones and ensuring they were easy to use. \u001d  Around August 2005, Nokia assigned Mr. Riise to produce a new mid-priced phone. Nokia has about a dozen profiles that it uses to identify and group customers, including \"family providers\" (who just want phones for calling) and \"technology leaders\" (who want the latest bells and whistles). Mr. Riise teamed up with marketing specialist Dominic Fried-Booth to identify the target audience as \"life builders,\" young professionals launching their careers and family life. The group is important, Nokia executives say, because it influences the broader population with its purchasing choices from phones, to fashion and cars. \u001d  According to Nokia's consumer studies, this group is looking for a stylish phone with decent features, like long battery life, but isn't necessarily looking for all the latest bells and whistles. For the Nokia 6500 classic, Mr. Riise decided several features were particularly important: the phone should be slim and work with high-speed wireless networks, known as 3G. Nokia also set a price of about $430, before taxes and subsidies, for the phone. \u001d  Mr. Riise brainstormed with designer Anton Fahlgren and technical expert Mads Lindborg about how the phone should look and which technical features it should include. The team pored over sketches and made wax models to gauge different dimensions and proportions. \u001d  Mr. Fahlgren dismissed one design, saying it had too big a \"forehead.\" That is the space between the screen and the top of the phone. A big forehead leaves less room for the key pad and can make a phone look dated. \u001d  \"It gives a very different expression to the phone,\" says Mr. Fahlgren, 31, who wears black skinny jeans and his dark hair in a trendy shaggy style. \u001d  Early on, Mr. Riise gave up his plan to include a video-calling feature because the video-camera lens would add a couple of millimeters to the length of the phone. \u001d  The team worried the phone could go from slim to flimsy. One technical expert suggested using an aluminum tube for the outer casing. It would be sturdier than a traditional phone's plastic front and back, and the designers loved the metal's distinctive look and feel. \u001d  Mr. Lindborg, however, pushed back. Putting metal in phones is difficult because it blocks the signals between the network and the handset. \u001d  So Mr. Riise settled on a compromise. He would keep metal for the upper half that consumers handle most, but put plastic on the lower half of the phone. And to help reception, he would move the antenna to the bottom plastic part instead of the typical top position. The plan required reworking the guts of the phone because moving any of the roughly 450 components in a cellphone -- particularly major ones such as the battery, antenna or screen -- can cause reception difficulties. \u001d  By the beginning of 2006, after months of meeting daily, and sometimes several times a day, the team had a mock-up of a silver-colored, 10-millimeter-thick phone. During January and February of that year, Nokia showed the phone to focus groups in London, Boston, Mumbai, Moscow, Bangkok and Shanghai. Nokia plans to sell the phone in markets around the world including Europe, Asia and Latin America, but not in the U.S. because much of the U.S. uses different cellphone standards among other issues. \u001d  The reaction generally was positive. But some consumers -- particularly women -- said the silver color made the phone feel sober and \"a little bit too cold,\" Mr. Riise says. They ended up ditching silver for black metal on portions of the phone, but added accents such as a silver border around the screen. The team also added features like a tiny bar to the bottom of each key on the dial pad in an effort to make the small keys easier to use. \u001d  Mr. Riise ordered up the smaller antenna to help slim the phone down to 9.6 millimeters thick. He asked his team how to make the phone even slimmer. One technician suggested a smaller battery to shrink the phone to 9 millimeters, but it would cut the battery life by about 20%. \"I said that is simply way too big a compromise,\" Mr. Riise says. \u001d  Presenting the work to senior executives in what Nokia calls \"sanity-check\" presentations, Mr. Riise asked for and got a few weeks' extension to continue testing the antenna. \u001d  The risk of not moving fast enough is that a product \"is outdated before it hits the market,\" says Mr. Riise. But, \"the absolutely worst thing to do is to rush a product out, and it be a failure.\" \u001d  After more tests, the team signed off on the Nokia 6500 classic. The number identifies it as part of a high-profile Nokia line and classic indicates it is a modern twist on its traditional design, Nokia says. Nokia's often dry names contrast to some rivals, such as Motorola's Razr line of phones or the Shine and Chocolate phones from LG Electronics Inc. \u001d  A hot design can make a company's fortunes, just as Motorola staged a comeback on the Razr and more recently has floundered as it has struggled to come up with a successor phone. \u001d  While the 6500 classic won't be available in the U.S., Nokia has been increasing its efforts to design cellphones that cater to the tastes of U.S. consumers, who tend to prefer clamshell-shaped and slider phones over candy-bar-shaped phones which are popular elsewhere in the world. Nokia recently carved out a team at its San Diego research facility dedicated to developing phones specifically for the U.S. market, which the handset maker says it typically hasn't done. Innovations used in the 6500 process would likely be applied in developing other phones. \u001d  Nokia trumpeted the 6500 classic to analysts last week. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at research firm Gartner Inc., likes the new phone because it provides a much-needed boost to Nokia's portfolio, it is slim and it has solid technical features. But after all that, she says simply, \"as far as design is concerned, it is still quite conservative.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 23:08 ET (03:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright

\u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--British Airways PLC (BAIRY) will be guaranteed the right to take over Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana S.A. (IBLA.MC) under an agreement among the consortium bidding for the Spanish flag carrier, the Sunday Telegraph reports citing sources close to the U.K. airline. \u001d  The airline has agreed with its partners that it should have the option to take sole control of its Spanish rival in three to five years, the newspaper said. \u001d  British Airways is thought to be keen to postpone a potential takeover of Iberia while it restructures its business and completes its move into Terminal 5, according to the Sunday Telegraph.   Although the consortium led by private equity group TPG Inc. has tabled an indicative bid of EUR3.60 for the airline, it has not yet been given access to Iberia's books. \u001d  A spokeswoman for

At Friday's closing level of 1829.50, the index is down 4.8% so far this year, easily making it the worse-performing of the four so-called BRIC markets that also include Brazil, India and China. Analysts blamed a glut of stock offerings, political tensions with Europe and the U.S., and a worsening outlook for an oil and gas sector that has powered a six-year bull market. \u001d  The pullback is reminiscent of spring corrections in each of the past two years, both of which lasted for about six weeks amid wider international turbulence. \u001d  This time, global turbulence has been minimal. Even the Chinese market, which plunged 6.5% Wednesday, began recovering a day later. Major U.S. indexes go from record to record, and European markets are nearing all-time highs. \u001d  But international investors have been dumping Russian stocks, in part because they are more bullish on other emerging markets or are searching for deal-fueled gains in more developed ones. Lofty oil prices, which in the past have helped propel Russian share prices, have been little help. \u001d  \"The market mood [has been] nasty, global investors are wary, while local investors have been caught long and wrong,\" said Eric Kraus, portfolio manager at the Nikitsy Russia Fund in Moscow. \u001d  But Mr. Kraus said he believes the recent weakness was largely unjustified, citing a booming macro picture, declining inflation, a stable ruble and impressive corporate earnings growth in many sectors. He said Russian stocks are now cheap, but he expects that discount to quickly disappear. \"Past experience suggests that this will not last,\" Mr. Kraus said. \u001d  UBS analysts also think Russian stocks are attractive, highlighting a 7% to 10% discount to global emerging markets based on expected 2007 earnings multiples. \u001d  James Fenkner, a managing partner at the Russia-focused fund Red Star Asset Management in Moscow, said the market could recoup a big chunk of recent losses during the summer and could gain 15% by year end. \"We see value opening up in Sistema, UES and some oil and gas names,\" he said. \u001d  Problems in the oil sector, which makes up about 60% of the index, are partly to blame for the market's recent woes. Worsening earnings there are more than offsetting healthy growth at banks such as Sberbank, miners, retailers and mobile-phone companies. \u001d  Oil output has been stagnating in Russia and big firms like OAO Lukoil and OAO Rosneft are being forced to significantly raise capital spending to access more complex developments to drill in farther-flung areas of the country. \u001d  Analysts have also highlighted rising costs at gas monopoly OAO Gazprom, whose future developments -- including the huge Shtokman field in the Barents Sea -- promise to be no less tricky than those in the oil sector. Gazprom, which soared to $13 from $1.50 between 2002 and 2006, closed Friday at $9.44, down 27% from its peak. \u001d  Observers also cite the recent deterioration of Russian-European relations, particularly concerns over the reliability of oil and gas supplies and negative media coverage relating to the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London, as a reason for the market selloff. Negative political headlines often stoke perceptions of country-specific risk, even if they have no direct link to investments. \u001d  \"If, every day, you read on the front page about polonium or energy security, you start to reconsider. Russia is not in fashion right now,\" said Anton Tabakh, chief strategist at investment bank UralSib in Moscow. \u001d  Next year's presidential elections -- when incumbent Vladimir Putin is due to step down as his second term draws to an end -- are likely to become a major issue toward the winter, Mr. Tabakh said. \u001d  In addition to politics and financials, the sheer volume of Russian companies coming to market in 2007 has represented an unprecedented challenge. \u001d  \"The pace of IPOs and secondary offerings this year in Russia is extreme,\" investment bank Credit Suisse Group said in a research note. It said $24.8 billion of shares have been sold so far and an additional $5.1 billion to $12.8 billion is likely to be sold before year end. That compares with $21.8 billion for all of 2006, a figure that, in turn, was more than the combined issuance of the prior eight years. \u001d  Aggressive valuations by banks managing these placements have hardly helped, leaving limited demand in the secondary market in some cases. Shares of AFI Development PLC plunged more than 10% on the first day of trading in London last month after the property developer priced its IPO above the indicative range. AFI closed Friday at $11.90, down 15% from its $14 offering price. \u001d  Food retailer OAO Dixy was forced to slash the price range of its $360 million IPO after meeting little demand -- and then priced at the bottom of the revised range last month. The stock ended at $14 in Moscow on Friday, down 2.8% from its $14.40 offering price. \u001d  Excessive valuations, increasing political risk and a general drift in asset allocation away from emerging markets will make investors more selective about Russian stocks in coming months, says Ian Mukherjee, chief investment officer at Amiya Capital in London. Mr. Mukherjee declined to comment on his own portfolio moves. \"Why buy companies in emerging Europe when you have strong growth nearer home?\" he said. \u001d  But Russian-based strategists at Credit Suisse say the RTS index could end the year at 2200, implying a 14% gain for the full year. Chris Weafer, chief strategist at Alfa Bank in Moscow, last week affirmed his year-end target of 2150. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 19:02 ET (23:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright

McKay \u001d  As stock-market indexes hit one record after another, there is something else to remind investors of the heady days of 1999 and early 2000: Nearly half the companies that have gone public so far this year have been unprofitable at the time of their debut. \u001d  That is a bigger percentage than any year since the dot-com bubble burst seven years ago. \u001d  There are differences this time around, however. The number of initial public offerings of stock is far below the bubble years, and the list of unprofitable companies selling stock for the first time is more diverse. It includes listings in energy, health care and other sectors, in addition to technology companies like those that drove the bull market of the 1990s. \u001d  Investors now want more than pie-in-the-sky promises of future profits. They are looking at revenue and cash flow and want specific timetables for profitability before buying shares. \u001d  \"People were measuring dollars per eyeball on a Web site back then,\" says Allison Thacker, portfolio manager for RS Investment Management Co.'s growth-focused Information Age Fund. \"There's none of that now.\" \u001d  Ms. Thacker's fund has bought IPOs from unprofitable companies, such as last year's offering by business-software provider Omniture. But she says her firm generally avoids companies that don't seem likely to turn a profit in 12 to 18 months. \u001d  Still, there are risks. \"Traditionally, there have been some rules of thumb about when to go public, and one of them was that you should have profits,\" says Brian Hamilton, chief executive of research firm Sageworks, which analyzed IPO filings at the request of The Wall Street Journal. He calls some of the latest offerings \"troubling\" because of the absence of net income. \u001d  Of 84 offerings this year, more than 46% of the companies were unprofitable at the time of their listing, according to the Sageworks data. That is the biggest percentage since 2000, when 71% of the 406 companies that went public were unprofitable, but about on par with 44% of 310 offerings in 1998. \u001d  The percentage bottomed at 20% in 2002, when the broader stock market hit its post-bubble lows, and it was about 35% last year, according to Sageworks. \u001d  The tallies exclude special-purpose acquisition companies, essentially shell companies that issue stock to raise money for buyouts. Such offerings, which were rare in the dot-com era, usually show no revenue and no profit at the time of their listings. \u001d  Although executives give various reasons for their decisions to take a company public, broad market rallies like the current one encourage stock offerings as investors look for new opportunities and companies hope to get higher prices for their shares. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit records last week, leaving the Dow up 9.7% this year and the S&P 500 ahead 8.3%. \u001d  While the latest crop of unprofitable companies to go public has attracted investors, the companies haven't enjoyed the same pricing power as during the bubble years, a sign that investors have become more selective. \u001d  One recent, high-profile example was the IPO of Clean Energy Fuels, which offers natural gas as an alternative fuel for trucks and other vehicles. The company reported a net loss of $870,179 for the first quarter, while revenue rose 34% to $28.2 million, according to regulatory filings. \u001d  The shares were initially priced at $12, below the expected range of $13 to $17. This prompted several company insiders to take their stock off the table, cutting the size of the overall offering in half, to 10 million shares. \u001d  The biggest stake withdrawn from the offering belonged to company co-founder and hedge-fund manager T. Boone Pickens, who had planned to sell 4.86 million shares. If those shares had sold in the price range originally expected, Mr. Pickens would have pocketed at least $63.2 million. \u001d  Since the offering, Clean Energy shares are up $1.11, or 9.3%, to $13.11. \u001d  Mr. Pickens didn't return calls seeking comment. However, a person familiar with the situation characterized Mr. Pickens's decision to withdraw his shares from the IPO as a sign of conviction that the stock is indeed worth a higher price. \u001d  According to research firm Thomson Financial, the average IPO this year has risen 10% on its first day of trading and is up nearly 14% year-to-date, compared with jumps of more than 100% at the height of the dot-com bubble. \u001d  \"You have more institutional money and more fund managers looking over these deals on a case-by-case basis now,\" says Thomson Financial analyst Richard Peterson. \"The retail investor is still not jumping in there, because he was burned last time.\" \u001d  The sector breakdown of companies going public has changed. Companies in the Internet, computer, semiconductor and telecommunications sectors accounted for more than 62% of all new U.S. offerings in 1999, according to research firm IPO Vital Signs. By contrast, the three biggest sectors this year are finance, biotechnology and energy, which together represent about half of new offerings. \u001d  Some say drug companies may have good reason to go public before posting a profit. \"It's expensive to bring a new drug to market,\" says Jonathan Lieber, chief financial officer of Altus Pharmaceuticals, which has no drugs on the market but is developing several to treat pancreatic disease, growth disorders and other illnesses. \"When you go into late-stage testing, your costs rise exponentially,\" as the number of patients and doctors participating in studies swells into the thousands from perhaps a few hundred. \u001d  Altus posted a net loss of $15.8 million for this year's first quarter, 50% wider than the year-earlier period. Meanwhile, its shares have languished, down about 8% from their IPO price in late January 2006. \u001d  \"I hate to have lived through the dot-com boom and bust, but there were valuable lessons that everyone learned from it,\" says Ken Crittenden, chief financial officer of Salary.com, a compensation-software company that went public in February, despite being unprofitable. \u001d  At $11.28 in trading Friday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Salary.com is up 7.4% from its offering price, but still nearly 10% below the closing price on its first day of trading. Mr. Crittenden says the firm hopes to turn a profit within three years. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 23:00 ET (03:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

(Nasdaq: ISIS) today announced encouraging preliminary data from a Phase I/II clinical trial of OGX-011 in first-line combination therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data were presented by Janessa Laskin, M.D., a medical oncologist at the BC Cancer Agency, at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago. \b \u001d  In this single-arm, open-label study, 81 patients with Stage IIIB (18 percent) or Stage IV (82 percent) NSCLC were treated with OGX-011, 78 of whom were treated at the Phase II dose of 640 mg per week by intravenous infusion, in combination with a standard first-line NSCLC chemotherapy regimen that included gemcitabine and either cisplatin or carboplatin. \b \b \b    Survival Results: \b    -   At the time of analysis, the estimated median overall survival was 14 \b        months, with follow up ongoing. For comparison, published studies \b        using a platinum-based regimen plus gemcitabine as first-line \b        chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC report median survivals of 8 to 11 \b        months. \b    -   The one-year survival rate for the 46 of 81 patients who had been \b        followed for at least one year was 54 percent; published data \b        document one-year survival rates in the 33 to 43 percent range. \b    -   The 18-month survival rate for the 22 patients who had been followed \b        for at least 18 months was 36 percent, with follow up ongoing. \b \b    Objective Response Results: \b    -   Among the 81 patients in the study, 26 percent experienced objective \b        tumor responses, 40 percent experienced disease stabilization, 28 \b        percent experienced disease progression, and response was not \b        assessable in 6 percent. \b \b \u001d  \"The one-year survival rate of 54 percent and the estimated median overall survival of 14 months compare favorably with previously reported studies and support further evaluation of the potential for OGX-011 as an additional combination therapy for advanced NSCLC,\" said Dr. Laskin. \b \u001d  \"The progression and survival data are very encouraging. As we've previously communicated, we plan to convene an expert NSCLC advisory panel to discuss these data, and we will consider both the data and the panel's recommendations in our planning for upcoming pivotal studies to confirm the efficacy of OGX-011,\" said Scott Cormack, president and CEO of OncoGenex. \b \u001d  The investigators concluded that the treatment with OGX-011 was generally well tolerated in combination with this chemotherapy regimen. The most common grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities were hyponatremia (23 percent), fatigue (15 percent), infection (10 percent), nausea (10 percent) and vomiting (10 percent). The most common grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities were neutropenia (47 percent in combination with cisplatin and 60 percent in combination with carboplatin), lymphopenia (35 percent in combination with cisplatin and 20 percent in combination with carboplatin), thrombocytopenia (25 percent in combination with cisplatin and 45 percent in combination with carboplatin) and anemia (9 percent in combination with cisplatin and 20 percent in combination with carboplatin). In general these toxicities were consistent with the adverse event profile for gemcitabine in combination with a platinum-based regimen in this population. The addition of OGX-011 to gemcitabine/platinum-containing regimen may have increased the frequency of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia compared with published data, but with the addition of OGX-011 there was no increase above the expected frequency of treatment with growth factors and platelet transfusions or the expected incidence of infection and febrile neutropenia. \b \u001d  OGX-011 is designed to specifically inhibit the production of the cell-survival protein, clusterin. Clusterin production is associated with treatment resistance in many cancers and in response to various cancer treatments, including hormone ablation therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Preclinical studies have shown that inhibition of clusterin can disable the tumor cells' adaptive defences, render the tumor cells susceptible to attack with a variety of cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, and facilitate tumor-cell death. OncoGenex and Isis are collaborating on development of OGX-011. \b \b    The study was sponsored by OncoGenex Technologies Inc. \b \b    About OncoGenex \b \b \u001d  OncoGenex is committed to the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients. OncoGenex currently has three product candidates in development: OGX-011, OGX-427 and OGX-225. These product candidates are designed to selectively inhibit the production of proteins that are associated with treatment resistance and that are over-produced in response to a variety of cancer treatments. OncoGenex' aim in targeting these particular proteins is to disable the tumor cells' adaptive defenses, render the tumor cells susceptible to attack with a variety of cancer therapies including chemotherapy, and facilitate tumor cell death.

(QIA.XE) said Sunday it and Digene Corp. (DIGE) have reached an agreement to combine the two companies to create market- and technology-leadership in molecular diagnostics. \u001d  The Boards of Directors of both companies unanimously approved the transaction in which QIAGEN is to acquire 100% of Digene's stock for a combination of cash and QIAGEN common stock. This strategic transaction combines QIAGEN's leading portfolio of sample and assay technologies, including a broad panel of molecular diagnostic tests, with Digene's leadership in HPV targeted molecular diagnostic testing, creating a global leader in molecular diagnostics outside blood screening and viral load monitoring. \u001d  It is anticipated that the combined company will have over US$350 million of molecular diagnostics revenues and more than US$800 million in revenues overall in 2008. \u001d  Under the terms of the agreement, the transaction will be effected as an exchange offer, followed by a merger of Digene into a subsidiary of QIAGEN. \u001d  The acquisition consideration will consist of cash and QIAGEN stock, and Digene shareholders may elect to receive for each Digene share either $61.25 in cash or 3.545 shares of QIAGEN stock, subject to pro-ration so that the total consideration issued for Digene stock consists of 55% cash and 45% QIAGEN stock. \u001d  Based on the companies' closing stock prices on June 1, 2007, the $61.25 per share of consideration to be received by Digene shareholders represents a premium of 37% and total equity consideration of approximately US$1.6 billion, which includes US$170 million in cash. \u001d  It is anticipated that the stock portion of the consideration will be tax-free to Digene shareholders and QIAGEN shareholders will own approximately 78% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, and Digene shareholders will own approximately 22%. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007

will buy Alliant Insurance Services Inc., a medium-sized Newport Beach, Calif., insurance brokerage, in a deal announced yesterday that echoes other recent acquisitions and may herald further consolidation in the industry. \u001d  The deal is valued in excess of $1.1 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. \u001d  The move will link one of the largest privately held brokers in the country to Blackstone, a private-equity giant, just nine months after Alliant announced plans to buy the U.S. operations of London-based Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group PLC. \u001d  Major players in the world of private equity have already announced two purchases of insurance brokers this year. In March, Apax Partners led a team that agreed to buy Hub International Ltd., a Chicago-based broker, and two months before that, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s private-equity group agreed to pay $1.4 billion to acquire USI Holdings Corp. of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. \u001d  A small number of large insurance brokers tower above rivals in the industry.

(Nasdaq: PCYC) today announced final results from an open-label multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial, which indicated that Xcytrin(R) (motexafin gadolinium) Injection may improve the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery by providing more accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) treatment-planning and better defining the treatment field in patients with brain metastases from solid tumors. Xcytrin allowed physicians to identify occult brain metastases in 24% of patients that were missed with standard MRI contrast agents and were amenable to stereotactic radiosurgery. The data were presented at the 2007 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting (ASCO) in Chicago. \b \u001d  \"This study suggests that Xcytrin may be used both to enhance the effectiveness of radiation and to improve detection of occult lesions in patients with brain metastases,\" said Minesh P. Mehta, M.D., professor and chairman of Human Oncology and professor of Neurological Surgery at the University of Wisconsin Medical School, who presented the data. \"It appears that a significant number of patients are being under-treated since current imaging and stereotactic radiosurgery techniques fail to identify and treat all the tumors. The efficacy results in this study are promising with a median time to neurologic progression exceeding 18 months.\" \b \u001d  Brain metastases occur in 20-25% of patients with solid tumors, affecting up to 200,000 patients per year in the U.S. Brain metastases occur when cancer cells spread to the brain and grow, causing major neurologic complications and, in many cases, death. Patients with brain metastases usually suffer serious deterioration of neurologic and neurocognitive function such as loss of motor function, impaired balance, loss of vision, change in mental status, loss of short-term memory, compromised verbal skills, and reduction in cognitive performance. Most patients with brain metastases are treated with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). In some patients with a limited number of lesions, radiosurgery can be performed in an attempt to improve local tumor control. The primary goal of radiation therapy to the brain is to reverse or prevent neurological deterioration and prevent death due to tumor progression in the brain. There are virtually no other treatment options available to patients today other than this. A New Drug Application for use of Xcytrin in combination with WBRT for treatment of brain metastases from NSCLC was filed with the Food and Drug Administration in April 2007. \b \u001d  \"These results further underscore the potential versatility of Xcytrin in treating a broad range of cancers,\" said Richard A. Miller, M.D., president and CEO of Pharmacyclics. \"The study demonstrates the potential for Xcytrin to improve neurologic outcomes by enhancing both the efficacy of radiation and detection of the tumors -- 24% of the patients in this study were found to have lesions that were missed using standard MRI scans and therefore would have had tumors that remained untreated. Particularly within the context of brain metastases for which there are limited alternative treatments, developing this kind of next-generation drug is a vital step forward -- not only to improve neurologic outcomes, but to also improve diagnostic accuracy.\" \b \u001d  The Phase 2 single-arm trial evaluated the safety, radiologic response and time to neurologic progression in 45 patients. Patients with brain metastases from cancers of the lung (34), breast (5) and other cancers (6) were enrolled at 14 academic medical centers and treated with Xcytrin plus WBRT followed by stereotactic radiosurgery boost therapy to tumor sites in the brain. The study was also designed to evaluate if the MRI scan obtained with Xcytrin improved detection of tumors compared to standard contrast enhanced MRI procedures. In 11 of 45 patients (24.4%) with MRI data available, lesions were detected with Xcytrin that were not seen with standard MRI. The Xcytrin-based treatment planning MRI detected one occult lesion in seven patients, two occult lesions in one patient, and three occult lesions in three patients. The median survival for patients in this study was nine months, and the median time to neurologic progression or radiologic progression was not reached at 18 months. Xcytrin was well tolerated in this study. One patient in the study suffered radionecrosis of the tumor. The most common treatment related serious adverse events were deep vein thrombosis (13%) and pneumonia (9%). \b \u001d  The trial enrolled patients with one to four brain metastases from solid tumors. Patients in the Phase 2 trial were treated with WBRT in combination with 10 daily doses of 5mg/kg of Xcytrin, followed by stereotactic radiosurgery boost to the tumors with another dose of Xcytrin. MRI scans were obtained at baseline and again after the Xcytrin treatment regimen. Because Xcytrin is designed to localize in tumors and enhance the MRI signal, the post-Xcytrin MRI scan was used to define the field for stereotactic radiosurgery. MRI scans were also obtained at three month follow-up intervals to evaluate radiologic tumor response and safety of the radiosurgery procedure. Follow up assessments of patients included use of neurologic testing and determination of time to neurologic progression. \b \b    Stereotactic Radiosurgery and Imaging \b \u001d  Stereotactic radiosurgery involves the delivery of a high dose of radiation to a limited, well-defined treatment volume. This form of radiation usually follows treatment with WBRT to ensure that all tumors within the brain are treated. The delivery of stereotactic radiation requires precise definition of the tumor size, location and adjacent structures. MRI scanning or computerized tomography is typically used to define the treatment field so that the tumors are adequately treated and adjacent normal structures are not injured by the high radiation dose. Xcytrin, in addition to having cooperative activity with radiation, is designed to be MRI detectable and may potentially be used to enhance the tumor image and better define the treatment field. \b \b    About Xcytrin \b \u001d  Pharmacyclics is developing Xcytrin as an anti-cancer agent with a novel mechanism of action that is designed to selectively concentrate in tumors and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death). Xcytrin is a redox-active drug that has been shown to disrupt redox-dependent pathways in cells and inhibit oxidative stress related proteins. Its multifunctional mode of action, including its MRI detectability, provides the opportunity for Xcytrin to be used in a broad range of cancers. \b \b    About Pharmacyclics \b \u001d  Pharmacyclics is a pharmaceutical company developing innovative products to treat cancer and other serious diseases.

 DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Southern Water is up for sale with a GBP4 billion price tag in what promises to be the first of a flurry of deals in the U.K.'s privatized water industry, according to The Times in London on its Web site Monday. \u001d  Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN) has hired Deutsche Bank AG (DB) to sell the water group four years after it was sold to a consortium of RBS and Vivendi Environmental, of France, for GBP2.2 billion, according to The Times. RBS now owns just under 50% of the equity in Southern's holding company, but 94% of the economic interest after it bought out the French company's 25% holding - trading by now as Veolia Environnement (VE) - for between GBP250 million and GBP300 million last year, according to The Times. \u001d  The move comes barely six weeks after the Serious Fraud Office called off its criminal investigation into the water and sewerage utility's failure to repay customers and its misreporting of customer performance targets, according to the newspaper. \u001d  A source close to RBS said that the bank wanted to sell Southern \"after a significant rerating in the sector.

\b   By Romit Guha and John Satish Kumar \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  MUMBAI (Dow Jones)--India's stock market may be headed for a drop after running up more than 18% in the past 11 weeks, as shares get pricey and investors worry that higher costs could squeeze corporate earnings this financial year. \u001d  But a correction - if it comes - might be only a temporary setback. \u001d  Although many fund managers expect the Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark Sensitive 30 index, or Sensex, to fall 10% to 15% from Friday's close of 14570.75 over the next three to four months, they are upbeat about the market's long-term prospects in the world's second-fastest-growing major economy. \u001d  \"We are circumspect about the near term. Valuations aren't cheap and [corporate] earnings will be under pressure from rising interest, wage and input costs,\" says Anoop Maheshwari, head of equities and corporate strategy at DSP Merrill Lynch, which manages 118.54 billion rupees ($2.94 billion) in assets. \u001d  The Sensex now trades at about 18 times projected earnings for this year. Other emerging markets such as South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand trade at an average 13 to 15 times projected earnings, analysts say. \u001d  The Indian market already has taken investors on a roller-coaster ride this year. The Sensex touched an all-time high of 14723.81 on Feb. 9, then skidded to the year's low of 12316.10 on March 16. \u001d  Its rise since then has been helped by increased interest from foreign investors. The Sensex is up 5.7% so far in 2007. \u001d  One of the market's main speed bumps in the near term will likely be a slowdown in corporate earnings, say fund managers. \u001d  Maheshwari expects earnings to grow 15% to 17% in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008, down from about 30% in the previous fiscal year. \u001d  \"Interest costs have been rising, along with input costs such as wages and raw material,\" says Mihir Vora, head of equities at HSBC Asset Management (India). \u001d  Since January 2006, the Reserve Bank of India has raised its key overnight lending rate by 1.5 percentage points to 7.75% as part of efforts to check inflation, which eased to an annual rate of 5.06% in the week ended May 19 after staying above 6% between January and March. Higher interest rates can cut into economic growth and corporate earnings. \u001d  \"Until inflation ticks down a bit and interest rates head back down, I think it is going to cap the upside,\" says Jacqueline Aldhous, fund manager of the Forsyth Indian Opportunities Fund. \u001d  Indian exporters, including the information-technology sector that has been a main driver of the Sensex rally, are facing a threat to revenue and operating margins because of the rupee's appreciation against the dollar. \u001d  The rupee hit its strongest level against the dollar in nine years last Monday, at INR40.28 per dollar. It closed at INR40.61/dollar Friday, putting it up about 9% this year. \u001d  Still, some fund managers say shares in big IT companies -- Infosys Technologies (500209.BY), Wipro (507685.BY) and Tata Consultancy Services (532540.BY), which get more than 90% of their revenue from overseas -- are worth buying because they can raise prices and cut the cost of operations to offset the impact of the stronger rupee and pressure for higher wages. \u001d  Other sectors may be less resilient in the short term. HSBC's Vora regards shares in companies that make two- and three-wheeled vehicles, cement and fast-moving consumer goods as \"best avoided for the time being.\" \u001d  Vehicle makers like Hero Honda Motors (500182.BY), Bajaj Auto (500490.BY)and TVS Motor (532343.BY) are facing \"serious earnings erosions\" thanks to higher costs and lack of pricing power amid strong competition, he says. Government-controlled prices for cement won't rise for a year. \u001d  Forsyth's Aldhous is \"wary\" of the oil-and-gas sector as global oil prices have climbed about 16% in the past three months. The Indian government will find it difficult to keep oil prices subsidized for long, she says, adding that any rise will push up inflation. \u001d  The Indian government fixes a level at which state-owned oil-marketing firms have to sell in the retail market. This level is tied to, but below, prevailing global oil prices. (The government won't end subsidies because this would increase retail prices and push up inflation.) \u001d  There is some risk, of course, that the Indian stock market could see a prolonged slide. If world oil prices shoot up and stay high for a long time, that would naturally push up inflation, lead to higher interest rates and further slow corporate earnings. \u001d  If the fervor that foreign funds have for India cools, that could hurt liquidity. If leftist parties in the governing coalition gain strength, that could slow economic overhauls and privatization. \u001d  But many fund managers say that for investors with the patience to wait for returns, staying invested in Indian equities should pay off over a two- to three-year period. \u001d  The economy expanded 9.4% in the fiscal year ended March, its fastest pace in 18 years, driven by a boom in manufacturing and services. Though growth is expected to ease in coming quarters, the level should remain high. According to official estimates, India is poised to grow about 8.5% in the current fiscal year, second in Asia only to China. \u001d  And corporate-earnings growth of 15% to 17% is still \"among the highest in the world,\" says N. Sethuram, chief investment officer at SBI Mutual Fund. \u001d  Also, analysts expect many more individual Indians to buy stocks. With only about 3% of household savings in shares, \"equity ownership is still very low in India,\" Aldhous says. \"There is immense potential with disposable income rising among the Indian middle class. I think [the Sensex] could go to 16000\" by the end of 2007. \u001d  DSP Merrill's Maheshwari also is a longer-term bull, expecting the Sensex to rise 15% to 20% each year for the next three years, in line with his projections for corporate-earnings growth. He pegs sectors like capital goods, infrastructure and retail as offering strong potential. \u001d  He predicts construction companies such as Larsen & Toubro (500510.BY) and IVRCL Infrastructures & Projects (530773.BY) will benefit from government plans to increase spending to improve bad roads, inadequate airport and port facilities, and the severely crippled power sector in order to sustain economic growth. \u001d  Vora favors companies involved in power generation and transmission such as ABB Ltd. (India) (500002.BY), Siemens India (500550.BY) and state-controlled Bharat Heavy Electricals (500103.BY). \b \u001d  -By Romit Guha and John Satish Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; (91 22) 2288 4212; romit.guha@dowjones.com and john.kumar@dowjones.com \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 22:46 ET (02:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b53942789db4bd81d93e6c67575e7840","symR":["AKR"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Acadia Realty Trust","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AKR"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Acadia Realty Trust: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=AKR or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:01 ET (07:01 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b546042c35003eade1f333e16de15447","symR":["MEN"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock MuniEnhanced Fund, Inc.

(AWC.AU) said Monday it expects growth in world demand for aluminum to double by 2020, providing a significant opportunity for its AWAC joint venture with Alcoa Inc. (AA) to expand capacity. \u001d  \"When we look forward, we expect that global growth in consumption of aluminum will double by 2020. Much of that will come from emerging economies, particularly China,\" Alumina Chief Executive John Marlay told CNBC Asia cable television. \u001d  \"And in that scenario, the AWAC joint venture has quite significant opportunities to expand capacity to supply this significant growth in global consumption.\" \u001d  Marlay also said a joint government and business report recommending the introduction of a carbon trading system is far reaching and sensible. \u001d  The recommendation that Australia should be in a position to implement a domestic emissions trading scheme by 2011 is \"quite far reaching.\" \u001d  \"It clearly does demonstrate a signal that CO2 and particularly other greenhouse gas emissions will need to be priced, and it will have an impact for all of us, both consumer and industry alike,\" Marlay told CNBC. \u001d  Marlay, who was on the task group that put together the report handed down to the government last week, said the scheme would be a \"cap and trade scheme.\" \u001d  \"And our recommendation is that work should start immediately,\" he said. \u001d  The proposed regime would allow Australia to link in with other emissions trading schemes as they emerge around the world. \u001d  \"It will have an impact, it will cost more for energy, it will potentially have an economic impact and so therefore, all those issues need to be treated very

 NEW YORK (AP)--Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) highly anticipated iPhone will be available June 29, according to TV commercials broadcast Sunday night and posted on the company's Web site. \u001d  The combination cell phone, media player and wireless Web-surfing device will retail for $499 and $599, depending on configuration. It will be offered exclusively by AT&T Inc.'s (T) wireless division, formerly known as Cingular. \u001d  The iPhone, which sports no keypad but instead a touch-sensitive screen, was unveiled with great fanfare in early January by Apple CEO Steve Jobs. He said it would appear in stores in June but gave no specific date. \u001d  Sunday night's ads showed off several of the gadget's features and ended with the pronouncement that the phone will be available \"Only on the new AT&T\" and \"Coming June 29.\" One aired on the CW network before a 7 p.m. broadcast of \"7th Heaven.\" \u001d  Apple and AT&T spokespeople did not immediately return phone calls. \u001d  In recent months, the company's stock has been served by speculation and excitement over the iPhone. Shares of Apple's stock rose May 25 after a media report said that the iPhone would go on sale June 20. Neither AT&T nor Apple would confirm or deny that date at the time. \u001d  On the Net: \u001d  Apple ads: http://www.apple.com/iphone/ads \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 21:27 ET (01:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c59a77762a88e6b04dea50b2ee65a271","symR":["AGT","APG.T","CA03761E1025"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Apollo Gold Corporation","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AGT","APG.T","CA03761E1025"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS"],"Story":"\u001d  Apollo Gold Corporation: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=AGT or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:10 ET (07:10 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c59c1d439802da294c194c4beb4ba1c8","symR":["VTI"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VTI"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\u001d  Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=VTI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:50 ET (09:50 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c5e03a8dca77a7c41c751cd11383bfa8","symR":["PAA.T","PAAS","CA6979001089"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Pan American Silver Corp.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T09:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PAA.T","PAAS","CA6979001089"],"IndustryCodes":["PCS","PPM","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  Pan American Silver Corp.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=PAAS or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c60d67d8657fdd2c04bdd953d3c8a1ba","symR":["ACZ.LN","GB00B0N59376"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Autoclenz Holdings PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACZ.LN","GB00B0N59376"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC"],"Story":"\u001d  Autoclenz Holdings PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B0N59376 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:14 ET (07:14 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c6174998a2b5ba802f388ebdb13830b7","symR":["EEF"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Blackrock Enhanced Equity Yield Fund, Inc.

 When Best Buy Co. approached H-P about making a new notebook exclusively for the Richfield, Minn., store chain last year, Mr. Bradley jumped at the offer. H-P design engineers began working closely with Best Buy, and the two companies ultimately created a white-and-silver notebook computer -- the soft colors aimed at attracting female customers, Best Buy says. Best Buy featured the machine, priced at $1,100, on the cover of its Sunday newspaper inserts, and says it ended up as one of its top-selling notebooks priced above $1,000 during the 2006 holiday season. \"H-P dedicated a good amount of resources,\" says Jason Bonfig, a Best Buy executive in charge of notebooks. \u001d  At H-P, as at palmOne, Mr. Bradley instituted weekly progress reports to track operations and find fixes. For instance, he demanded weekly rundowns of notebook-computer deliveries to U.S. stores down to the hour they arrived. The reports allowed Mr. Bradley to see where bottlenecks were -- and whom to blame. He set up a weekly call between employees ordering parts and employees taking PC orders, and updated the software that helps the company forecast supply and demand globally so the company could speed up or slow down manufacturing of certain models. \u001d  Mr. Bradley pushed to find ways to consolidate H-P's PC manufacturing plants. By closing seven plants, leaving 23, H-P reduced the time and cost of building PCs, helping to improve its operating margins, the company says. The rate of on-time deliveries rose 30% in the company's 2006 fiscal year ended Oct. 31, 2006, the company says, but declined to give details. \u001d  Steven Giblin, merchandise manager for J&R Music & Computer World in New York, says he previously never knew when H-P's deliveries would show up at his stores and what would be in them. Now an H-P representative calls him weekly to exchange information on J&R's sales and H-P's available products, and to adjust orders. J&R gets H-P's deliveries punctually, he adds. They've done a \"pretty good job in communicating,\" Mr. Giblin says. \u001d  Mr. Bradley's shifting of the battlefield has been met with some resistance. When he launched the \"personal\" PC ad campaign, he got phone calls and emails from alarmed H-P employees who complained that that the message was too focused on consumer PCs, ignoring the corporate business. One engineer griped the campaign was too loud for H-P's conservative image, says a marketing executive. \u001d  Mr. Bradley says he shrugged off the criticism. \"I wasn't holding an election,\" says the executive. \u001d  For direct PC sales, where Dell remains dominant, Mr. Bradley reviewed customer survey data that showed H-P had too many PC models on its Web site, and reduced the number to 10 from 15. In January H-P cut the time it takes to reach a sales rep by phone to 22 seconds from 50 seconds. H-P increased its share of direct PC sales world-wide to 12.3% in the first quarter from 9.2% a year ago, according to Gartner. Dell's share dipped to 43.6% from 47.8%. \u001d  Mr. Bradley is now pushing his teams to work with retailers to display H-P products such as wireless TVs alongside its PCs, to show the devices working together and stimulate more sales. Mr. Bradley also is meeting with retailers and resellers in India and China in an effort to expand H-P's retail shelf space outside of the U.S. \u001d  Dell hasn't stayed on the sidelines. Dell launched its own ad campaign to remind consumers of the benefits of customizing computers. In July, Dell also opened its first retail store in a Dallas mall, acknowledging that some customers prefer to see the PCs before buying. Dell has described  performance of the Dallas store as \"good,\" but declined to elaborate. In April, it scrapped plans to open an additional store in New York. A spokesman said the company has no current plans to open other stores. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 23:05 ET (03:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

Increase in Complete Responses \bCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 03, 2007-- \u001d  Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) announced today that data presented at the 43rd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting showed that adding Zevalin(R) (Ibritumomab tiuxetan) radioimmunotherapy to a short course first-line treatment followed by rituximab weekly for four weeks doubled the rate of complete response in patients with follicular lymphoma, from 44 percent with a standard treatment regimen to 88 percent. Additionally, the response rate (complete and partial responses) for patients in the study was 100 percent based on PET scan assessment. \b \u001d  \"The increase in complete response rates when adding ZEVALIN radioimmunotherapy is promising,\" said Samuel A. Jacobs, M.D., associate director for clinical investigations at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and UPMC Cancer Centers. \"These data add to the growing body of evidence that using radioimmunotherapy as part of front-line treatment may increase complete response rates.\" \b \b   About The Trial \b \u001d  In this Phase II study, patients with symptomatic, stages II-IV and grades 1-3, untreated follicular lymphoma received three cycles of R-CHOP, a standard treatment regimen, followed by ZEVALIN. One week after ZEVALIN treatment, patients received rituximab weekly for four weeks. The primary endpoint of the trial was complete response rate, which was determined by CT scan, the conventional methodology, and PET scan. Of 56 evaluable patients, 50 completed both phases of therapy and were evaluated for response. \b \u001d  Results evaluated by CT scan showed that 44 percent of patients had a complete response following the R-CHOP phase of treatment. After treatment with ZEVALIN and extended dose rituximab, complete response rate increased to 88 percent. Results evaluated by PET scan, a newer method of evaluation, showed a complete response rate of 68 percent with R-CHOP and 96 percent after treatment with ZEVALIN and extended dose rituximab. The response rate in patients who completed the treatment regimen was 100 percent based on PET scan assessment. Median time to progression has not yet been reached; to date, five patients have experienced disease progression. Adverse events included myelosuppression and there was one episode of febrile neutropenia after ZEVALIN and rituximab treatment. \b \u001d  \"We believe that ZEVALIN may play an important role in the treatment of lymphoma in the front-line setting and are encouraged that data continues to underscore the impact that radioimmunotherapy can have,\" said David Parkinson, M.D., senior vice president, Oncology Research and Development, Biogen Idec. \"In order to further understand the potential of ZEVALIN as a first-line treatment, we have recently initiated a phase III trial that will evaluate ZEVALIN as part of first-line treatment with CVP, a commonly-used chemotherapy regimen.\" \b \b   ZEVALIN Safety Profile \b \u001d  Rare deaths have occurred within 24 hours of rituximab (RITUXAN) infusions. These fatalities were associated with an infusion reaction symptom complex that included hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation or cardiogenic shock. Yttrium-90 ZEVALIN administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. Patients experiencing severe cutaneous and mucocutaneous reactions should not receive any further components of the ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen and should seek prompt medical evaluation. In safety data based upon 349 patients, the most serious adverse reactions of the ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen were primarily hematologic, with grade 3/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurring in 60 percent, 63 percent and 17 percent respectively. Infusion-related toxicities were typically grade 1 or 2 and were associated with pre-administration of rituximab. The risk of hematologic toxicity correlated with the degree of bone marrow involvement prior to ZEVALIN therapy. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were reported in 5.2% (11/211) of patients enrolled in clinical studies and 1.5% (8/535) of patients included in the expanded-access trial, with median follow-up of 6.5 and 4.4 years, respectively. ZEVALIN should only be used by health care professionals qualified by training and experience in the safe use of radionuclides. \b \b   About ZEVALIN \b \u001d  On February 19, 2002, the ZEVALIN (Ibritumomab tiuxetan) therapeutic regimen was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory low grade, follicular or transformed B-cell non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), including patients with rituximab (RITUXAN) refractory follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Determination of the effectiveness of ZEVALIN in a relapsed or refractory patient population is based on overall response rates. The effects of ZEVALIN on survival are not known. Radioimmunotherapy offers an option to patients with certain types of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed to adequately respond to other cancer therapies. \b \u001d  The ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen combines a monoclonal antibody with a radioisotope. The monoclonal antibody in ZEVALIN recognizes and attaches to a particular cell-surface protein on B-cells called the CD20 antigen. This allows ZEVALIN to specifically target B-cells, destroying malignant NHL B-cells and also normal B-cells. \b \b   About Biogen Idec \b \u001d  Biogen Idec creates new standards of care in oncology, neurology and immunology.

on TPI 287 at the 43rd ASCO Annual Meeting","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TPPH"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BOULDER, Colo., June 3 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Tapestry Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: TPPH) today presented data from two Phase I clinical trials of TPI 287, the Company's leading drug candidate, at the 43rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, Ill.  In these two Phase I studies, TPI 287, the Company's proprietary taxane, was found to be both safe and well-tolerated in heavily pretreated patients with advanced, incurable cancers. The studies were performed on two classic taxane schedules: a weekly for three weeks with a one week rest (TPI 287-01); and a once every three weeks (TPI 287-02). Anti-tumor activity was observed in two patients on each schedule. \b \u001d  \"We are encouraged by the results of these two Phase I trials.  The data provide a strong rationale for the further development of TPI 287,\" commented Dr. Sandra Silberman, Chief Medical Officer of Tapestry Pharmaceuticals.  \"The early signals of anti-tumor activity and the fact that we observed this activity without the emergence of significant myelosuppression, a common side effect associated with taxane therapy, was of particular interest.  We look forward to evaluating TPI 287 in a comprehensive Phase II development plan being initiated this year.\" \b \u001d  The Phase I studies on TPI 287 were carried out in clinics and hospitals in the United States and in Israel.  Patients were required to have failed at least one previous treatment regimen and were either no longer candidates for standard therapy, had no standard therapy available to them, or chose not to pursue standard therapy. \b \b    Results of Study TPI 287-01 \b \u001d  In the first study (TPI 287-01), 30 patients were enrolled: 17 were male and 13 were female, with a variety of tumors, including cancers of the prostate, colon, pancreas, breast, liver, kidney, and lung.  All patients had received prior therapy for their disease, with most having been exposed to multiple different regimens. All of these patients received TPI 287, and 29 of them were able to be assessed for safety and efficacy. \b \u001d  TPI 287 administered weekly for three weeks followed by a one week rest was started at 7 mg/m(2) and given in increasing doses to groups of three or four patients, up to a dose of 185 mg/m(2).  A majority of patients experienced at least one adverse event, generally mild in severity, with the most frequently cited being fatigue, peripheral neuropathy and gastrointestinal upsets.  There was a trend toward more patients experiencing these toxicities at the higher doses. Of note was the general lack of neutropenia (decreased white blood counts) in this study. \b \u001d  A dose limiting toxicity of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was seen after escalation from 127.5 mg/m(2) to 185 mg/m(2), the highest dose administered. Clinically significant neutropenia and myelosuppression were not seen, a dose limiting toxicity of the other approved taxanes.  Also of note, two of the patients with peripheral neuropathy as a dose limiting toxicity had entered the study with this as a pre-existing condition. The study is in the process of exploring an intermediate dose of TPI 287 at 150 mg/m(2). \b \u001d  Although the primary objective of the study was to find a safe, well- tolerated dose of TPI 287 on this schedule, it was noted that two patients treated at doses of 85 mg/m(2) and 185 mg/m(2) showed evidence of anti-tumor activity.  One patient with lung cancer had a significant decrease (greater than 50 percent) in the size of his tumor while on treatment, and another patient with pancreatic cancer had no growth of her tumor for over four months while receiving TPI 287. \b \b    Results of Study TPI 287-02 \b \u001d  In the second study (TPI 287-02), 21 patients were enrolled: seven were male and 14 were female.  These patients had a variety of tumor types, including cancers of the colon, pancreas, and breast.  All patients had received prior therapy for their disease, with most having been exposed to multiple different regimens.  All of these patients received TPI 287 and were able to be assessed for safety and efficacy. \b \u001d  TPI 287 administered on a once every three week schedule was started at a dose of 56 mg/m(2), based on the safety of this dose administered in the more frequent schedule in TPI 287-01 already in progress, and escalated up to a maximum dose of 185 mg/m(2). The most common side effects were anemia, peripheral neuropathy and gastrointestinal upsets.  One patient experienced a severe allergic reaction after infusion of the drug, with shortness of breath due to constriction of the airways.  This patient was treated immediately for this reaction and completely recovered. This study established a maximum tolerated dose for TPI 287 of 160 mg/m(2) administered in a once every three week schedule. Again of note was the general lack of neutropenia in patients treated with TPI 287. \b \u001d  Although the primary objective of the study was to find a safe, well- tolerated dose of TPI 287 on this schedule, two patients treated at doses of 160 mg/m(2) and 185 mg/m(2) showed evidence of anti-tumor activity.  One patient with pancreatic cancer metastastic to the liver had a significant decrease (greater than 50 percent) in the size of her tumors.  This benefit lasted for over 10 months.  In the other patient who had breast cancer that had been progressing for the four months prior to entry into the study, there was no further progression for over eight months while being treated with TPI 287. \b \u001d  \"Because TPI 287 is a taxane, we anticipated that peripheral neuropathy would be a toxicity associated with this compound.  What we were surprised to see was the anti-tumor activity of TPI 287 without evidence of extensive myelosupression.\" observed Dr. Silberman.  \"In addition, other approved taxanes have not demonstrated activity in pancreatic cancer.  This suggests that we may have a taxane which has broader single agent activity and furthermore, may be able to be combined quite differently with other chemotherapeutic agents,\" she added. \b \b    Phase II Program \b \u001d  Last month, Tapestry announced it will open three Phase II clinical trials for TPI 287 by the end of this year.  The first Phase II trial, in hormone refractory prostate cancer has already begun and is accruing patients.  The second Phase II trial, which will begin in the second half of this year will be an open label exploratory trial for patients with glioblastoma multiforme, a primary cancer of the central nervous system that has progressed after primary surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.  The third Phase II trial will be in pancreatic cancer, after failure of first line therapy in advanced disease. In all of these studies, TPI 287 will be administered as an intravenous dosage form.  In addition to these Phase II studies, the Company will be initiating a Phase Ib/2 study evaluating the safety of the combination of TPI 287 and temozolomide in primary brain cancer patients. Exploratory Phase II trials in other tumor types may be initiated as well, based on preclinical and clinical data. \b \u001d  On a parallel track, Tapestry is developing an oral formulation of TPI 287.  Data presented at this year's AACR demonstrated the oral bioavailability and concurrent activity in pre-clinical rodent xenograft models and suggested that TPI 287 may also be orally bioavailable in man.  Therefore, the Company plans to initiate a Phase I pharmacokinetic trial of TPI 287 beginning in the summer of 2007 to evaluate the drug's oral bioavailability in humans. No other taxane is currently approved for oral administration. \b \u001d  \"TPI 287 appears to be a unique taxane, with a different side effect profile, showing activity in tumors both sensitive to other taxanes as well as in tumors not currently treated with taxanes.  In addition, TPI 287's chemical structure may also allow for oral administration.  We are looking forward to exploring many of the distinctive characteristics and expanded potential of this next generation taxane in upcoming clinical trials,\" concluded Dr Silberman. \b \b    About TPI 287 \b \u001d  TPI 287 is a proprietary next-generation taxane being studied for the treatment of multiple cancer indications. In preclinical in vitro tests, TPI 287 has exhibited activity across multiple cell lines, including cell lines that either have developed resistance to taxane therapy or are innately resistant to taxane therapy. In addition, in preclinical in vivo animal xenograft models, TPI 287 has exhibited greater tumor growth inhibition activity compared to standard comparative agents in taxane sensitive and taxane resistant tumor cell lines, including cell lines derived from breast and colon cancers and neuroblastoma tumors. \b \u001d  TPI 287 is currently in clinical studies in the United States. Tapestry plans to initiate multiple Phase II trials for TPI 287 in 2007. \b \b    About Tapestry Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \b \u001d  Tapestry Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of proprietary therapies for the treatment of cancer.

YORK (Dow Jones)--David Thursfield, the head of Cerberus Capital Management LP's auto group, may be leaving the private equity giant, just weeks after the company agreed to purchase the Chrysler Group from DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX), The Detroit News reported on its Web site Sunday. \u001d  Reached at his home in London late Thursday, Thursfield would neither confirm nor deny that he was leaving Cerberus, the paper reported. Cerberus spokeswoman J.J. Rissi also declined to comment on Thursfield's status, it said. \u001d  Thursfield, the former head of Ford Europe and the automaker's global purchasing division, joined Cerberus in May 2004 after retiring from the Dearborn automaker. \u001d  Cerberus agreed last month to purchase 80.1% of Chrysler in a $7.4 billion transaction expected to close in the third quarter of this year. Thursfield, 61, was not involved in that deal, in part because his severance agreement with Ford, which governs his pension, doesn't allow him to work for another auto manufacturer, people familiar with the situation told the newspaper. \u001d  Thursfield was a key player in Cerberus' unsuccessful bid to purchase a major stake in bankrupt Troy-based supplier Delphi Corp. (DPHIQ), according to the paper. He was involved in complex talks with Delphi, its former parent General Motors Corp. (GM) and the United Auto Workers in an effort to work out a labor agreement. Ultimately, Cerberus dropped out of the deal over disagreements about the supplier's value. \u001d  Thursfield also is executive chairman and interim CEO of one of Cerberus' auto suppliers, Farmington Hills-based GDX Automotive, a position he has held since August 2005. In April, The Detroit News reported that GDX was in financial turmoil and telling its major customers that the company may be broken up or sold. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 08:56 ET (12:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d7f3e15aef5137992122c9cc97927e43","symR":["ASFI"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for ASTA Funding","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T07:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ASFI"],"IndustryCodes":["CFN","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  ASTA Funding: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=ASFI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 03:12 ET (07:12 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d7fb41d3b6ab1bf6c8271f771146cd91","symR":["JPZ"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen Equity Premium Income Fund (JPZ)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-03T08:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JPZ"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen Equity Premium Income Fund (JPZ): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=JPZ or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 04:50 ET (08:50 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d86b0761a02cd6bdf48041532c3aa3f9","symR":["12085.FR","FR0000120859"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Imerys -

In a phase II study of patients with advanced melanoma, median overall survival was 10.3 months (10 mg/kg monthly dose) and 11.2 months (15 mg/kg quarterly dose). In the open label, phase I portion of the study, an estimated 21.7 month median overall survival was observed across several dose groups of CP-675,206 (3, 6, and 10 mg/kg) in 28 melanoma patients. \b \u001d  \"The five year overall survival rate of patients with metastatic melanoma remains among the poorest of any cancer type,\" said Charles Baum, MD PhD, head of oncology development at Pfizer. \"Despite decades of research, no therapy has emerged that has conclusively offered these patients a meaningful improvement in overall survival. These studies show that CP-675,206 may be an efficacious compound as a single-agent treatment, which would potentially benefit melanoma patients who have few treatment options beyond surgery. These data further support the ongoing research with CP-675,206 as a single agent therapy for first line metastatic and refractory melanoma patients.\" \b \u001d  The number of objective responses, defined as partial or complete tumor shrinkage by radiological scan, was comparable in both the quarterly and monthly dosing regimens (three vs. four objective responses in each arm, respectively). There was, however, a trend towards a lower incidence of Grade III and IV adverse events in patients who received quarterly versus monthly doses of CP-675,206 (31 per cent vs. 41 per cent; P = 0.42). \b \b   CP-675,206 Study Details \b \u001d  The multi-dose phase I/II trial was conducted in patients with histologically confirmed stage IIIc (unresectable) or stage IV recurrent metastatic melanoma. The study consisted of a phase I, open-label, multidose study (3, 6, and 10 mg/kg) with a phase I/II expansion cohort. The primary endpoint was safety in phase I and immune monitoring in the expansion cohort. The phase I study was followed by a phase II open-label portion of the study of 10 mg/kg monthly and 15 mg/kg quarterly dosing regimens. The primary endpoint in this study was response rate, and survival was analyzed as a secondary endpoint. \b \u001d  In the Phase II study, two patients at the monthly dose and five patients at the quarterly dose continued on the study beyond a year. To date, six patients at monthly dosing have been discontinued due to toxicity (three diarrhea/colitis (1 requiring colectomy), one Grave's ophthalmopathy, one pancreatitis, one hypersensitivity reaction) and two patients at the quarterly dose (colitis and pancreatitis, diarrhea) (P = 0.14). There were no drug-related deaths in this study. \b \u001d  Pfizer Oncology is investigating a new generation of immunotherapies that aim to overcome tumor induced immune suppression. These novel agents target specific regulatory checkpoints in the immune cascade. CP-675,206 is a fully-human anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody that blocks a negative signal that down-regulates immune cells (known as T-cells). This is believed to help the immune system to seek out and destroy tumors. \b \u001d  For more information on Pfizer Oncology please visit www.pfizer.com. \b \u001d  DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information contained in this release is as of June 3, 2007.

In contrast, managers at U.S.-focused funds could end up with a second-best or even third-best idea in their portfolio if the top picks have foreign addresses. \u001d  \"Why not let a good manager make the decision of which one to buy?\" says Gregg Wolper, an analyst at Chicago-based fund tracker Morningstar Inc. \u001d  Owning a world-stock fund last year would have paid off for many investors, given the strong rallies of many international markets. The average world-stock fund returned 19.6% in 2006, according to Morningstar. That was slightly behind the 20.1% return of Morgan Stanley Capital International's benchmark World Index. But it beat the 16.9% return for an investor who had 75% of savings in the average U.S. large-blend stock fund and 25% in a large-blend international fund, a common split. In particular, world funds can be sensible choices for small investors who may not be able to meet the minimum investment requirements for several funds at the same time. \u001d  There are some things to watch for, though. One of the biggest concerns among financial planners is the overlap that can result from owning a world-stock fund along with U.S. and international-stock funds. But Morningstar analysts note that overlap isn't confined to world-stock funds, which as a group recently had about 40% of their money invested in U.S. stocks. For example, 89 of the 661 funds in Morningstar's U.S. large-blend category recently had international exposure of 20% or more. (Investors can visit www.morningstar.com to view a fund's 25 biggest holdings.) \u001d  Also, Mr. Wolper cautions that it is important for investors to focus on management style in choosing a world fund. At some funds, stock picking is split between a U.S. manager and one focused overseas. \"That takes away the advantage of one person comparing everything together,\" he says. \u001d  World funds recommended by Morningstar are American Funds New Perspective, Oakmark Global, Oppenheimer Global and T. Rowe Price Global Stock, all with five-year annualized returns above the category average of 13.4% a year and expense ratios below the category average of 1.64% of assets. \u001d  To get a better look at the category, we turned to three managers who Morningstar says represent different and smart ways of approaching a world fund -- Oliver Kratz at DWS Global Thematic, Bernard Horn Jr. at Polaris Global Value and Robert Gensler at the T. Rowe fund. \u001d  Mr. Kratz looks at the globe and sees investment themes, not continents. Mr. Horn uses proprietary screening software to crunch out the cash-flow-generating powers of companies in far corners of the world. And Mr. Gensler keeps a heavy travel schedule to grill managements world-wide about their growth strategies, while also drawing on the expertise of a big stable of analysts and portfolio managers. \u001d  Mr. Kratz, a managing director at the Deutsche Asset Management unit of Deutsche Bank AG, invests based on about a dozen long-term concepts, such as \"talent and ingenuity,\" which identifies companies with strong intellectual property, and \"disequilibria,\" which identifies producers of \"disruptive\" technologies or products that challenge existing systems, such as radio-frequency identification chips replacing bar codes and other older methods of inventory management. \u001d  Mr. Kratz, 35 years old, works with four analysts, who tap into the expertise of the firm's 700 investment professionals around the world. The DWS Global Thematic fund's $2.06 billion in investments are spread across about 140 holdings. \u001d  \"I learn by connecting and collecting information and ideas from many different sources,\" says Mr. Kratz. He travels extensively to scour for stocks and new themes, visiting as many as 500 companies a year and up to 10 companies a day while he is on the road. He also talks constantly to journalists, economists, regulators and politicians. \u001d  Introducing a new theme typically requires as much as six months of research. Mr. Kratz and his team compile a shopping list of about 150 companies that might fit potential thematic criteria, zeroing in on 40 to 50 for deeper analysis, and ultimately settling on eight to 12 for investment. \u001d  Themes are based on long-term trends, such as growing wealth in China and India leading to the revival of the ancient Silk Road trade route connecting the Asian and European continents. But \"the investment thesis has to materialize\" in less than a decade, he says, adding that a \"10- or 15-year trade is too long.\" \u001d  For example, he says, investing in Monsanto Co., which develops strains of crops that can be converted into ethanol, is a good play on the growing demand for alternative fuels. But betting on companies whose sales are based largely on preparing for climate change may not be. \u001d  The fund often has larger emerging-markets stakes than category rivals. Mr. Kratz explains that many of the companies that fit his fund's \"supply chain dominance\" theme happen to be in those economies. That theme focuses on businesses, such as container-terminal operator Santos Brasil SA, gaining market share along the global trade and production supply chain. \u001d  \"It's the biggest story out there in global economics since the Industrial Revolution,\" he says. \u001d  As of March 31, U.S. shares totaled about a quarter of the fund's stock holdings, and those from the U.K. and Western Europe totaled about 38%. Among European countries represented were Germany, Switzerland, France and Sweden. About 5.5% was in Japan, and other parts of Asia represented about 14%. The Latin American stake stood at about 9%. \u001d  The fund ranked in the top 1% of its Morningstar category in 2005 and 2006, with returns of 23.3% and 30.4%, respectively. \u001d  At the $865.5 million Polaris Global Value fund, stock selection begins with massive data crunching. Using proprietary software, computers continually screen thousands of stocks from around the world, zeroing in on free cash flow, a measure of a company's available cash. Currency risk and country-specific data like economic growth and demographics are incorporated. Of the several hundred stocks that emerge from that process as candidates for investment, dozens end up in the fund at any one time based on further research. They typically span about 15 countries and 15 industries and are held for three to five years. \u001d  \"Everything we do is focused on cash flow,\" says Mr. Horn, 52, who launched the Polaris mutual fund in 1998. \"Our job is to find the most undervalued streams of cash flow in the world, and that defines what the best values in the world are.\" \u001d  As of Dec. 31, U.S. shares totaled about 35% of the stock portfolio. Mr. Horn says the U.S. market is \"still dramatically overvalued relative to the rest of the world,\" noting that the average share-price-to-cash-flow multiple in the U.S. is about 13, compared with nine elsewhere. Western European and U.K. stocks totaled about 40%. Another 14% was in Japan, and exposure to Latin America was 1.3%. Among his top picks are miners BHP Billiton Ltd., of Australia, and Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., of South Africa. \u001d  Mr. Horn's studies at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led him to believe he would have a competitive advantage as an investor if he looked at stocks outside of the U.S., which was \"the most efficient market at the time.\" Less efficient markets tend to create more opportunities to buy undervalued stocks. \u001d  Today, his Polaris Capital Management Inc. manages about $3.4 billion overall. It remains relatively small, with eight investment professionals working with Mr. Horn. \u001d  The fund ranks in the top 7% of the world-stock category for the past five years through May 31, with an average 18.3%-a-year return. \u001d  Like managers at some other world funds offered by big fund firms, Mr. Gensler, 49, gets a lot of help keeping track of the 74 stocks in the T. Rowe Price Global Stock portfolio. While about 40% of his work time is spent traveling -- he recently visited 20 companies over four days in Japan -- he also taps T. Rowe Price Group Inc.'s 80 analysts and 30 portfolio managers to share ideas. \u001d  The $565.4 million fund adopts a \"go anywhere, do anything\" approach, he says, meaning it can swing from bargain-hunting value mode to scouting for growth stocks of rapidly expanding companies, from small to large-cap stocks. He focuses on measures such as a company's pricing power and expected revenue and earnings growth over one to three years. He owns only those stocks he thinks will appreciate at least 15% a year. \u001d  He insists on hearing corporate management's strategies for their businesses and industries and has sold shares if, say, a CEO's budget for research and development isn't as high as he thinks it should be. \u001d  Once in real-estate development, he sees stocks through the prism of that experience. \"Here's the secret sauce,\" he says. \"The neighborhood creates the opportunity in a piece of real estate, and the industry creates the opportunity in a company. But in stock picking, change is when you get your opportunities. I love things that are changing.\" \u001d  Of the three managers, Mr. Gensler has been most bullish on the U.S. recently; U.S. shares represented about 43% of the fund's stock position as of March 31. Shares from the U.K. and Western Europe represented about a third. The Latin America stake stood at about 11%, and 3% was in Japan. \u001d  The fund's relatively large U.S. allocation stems from his belief that some industries have been hit disproportionately hard by concerns about a slowing economy. He thinks that has knocked stock valuations lower than they ought to be for home builders and construction-equipment manufacturers, among others. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 21:02 ET (01:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d920a3de283002a82e2512c8f92e1513","symR":["RE.LN","GB0002349065"],"date":"2007-06-03","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for R.E.A.

Findings from the \"SPIRITS\" study, a Japanese multicenter, randomized, open label phase III trial, were presented today at the 43rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago, IL. \b \u001d  The overall survival with a two-year follow-up was significantly higher in the S-1/cisplatin combination arm over S-1 alone (in median, respectively 13 months versus 11 months, p=0.036). The overall Response Rate (RR) is also significantly better among patients treated with S-1 and cisplatin (54% of patients treated with the combination responded to treatment compared with 31.1% with S-1 alone, p=0.001). \b \u001d  There were more grade 3/4 hematological and gastro-intestinal (anorexia/nausea) toxicities when cisplatin was combined with S-1, and there were much lower incidences of the same side effects with S-1 alone. \b \u001d  \"This study demonstrates that the combination of S-1 and cisplatin brings to the patient with advanced gastric cancer an acceptable benefit/risk ratio,\" presented Dr. Hiroyuki Narahara, study investigator. \"The results confirm previous data we've seen in Japan, where S-1 has been on the market for the treatment of gastric cancer for eight years now.\" \b \b    About the \"SPIRITS\" Study \b \u001d  The \"SPIRITS\" study is part of an investigational ongoing program testing S-1 in combination with different anti-cancer drugs in advanced gastric cancer.  This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of S-1 combined with cisplatin compared to S-1 alone in patients with unresectable or recurrent advanced gastric cancer who have never been treated with chemotherapy. \b \u001d  Three hundred and five patients were randomized to receive either oral S-1 twice daily for 28 days followed by a 14-day rest period, or oral S-1 twice daily for 21 days plus IV cisplatin on the eighth day of treatment, followed by the 14-day rest period.  The dose of S-1 was the same for both patient groups, 40 mg/m2 twice daily. \b \u001d  The primary endpoint of the SPIRITS study was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included Response Rate, Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) and toxicity. The trial was designed to have 90% power to detect an improvement in median overall survival from 8 to 12 months. \b \b    About S-1 \b \u001d  S-1 is a novel oral fluoropyrimidine that combines 3 pharmacological agents: Tegafur, which is a pro-drug of 5 fluorouracil; gimeracil (5-chloro- 2,4 dihydropyridine, CDHP) which inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme; and oteracil (potassium oxonate, Oxo) a gastrointestinal side effects corrector. \b \u001d  S-1 is currently marketed in Japan for the treatment of gastric, colorectal, head and neck, non-small cell lung, metastatic breast and pancreas cancers. In the United States, Europe and other countries, the product is in phase III clinical development. Taiho commercializes and develops S-1 in Japan and in a few other countries of Asia. Sanofi- aventis collaborates on the current clinical development and is leading the future clinical development and commercialization of the product in the United States, Europe, and other countries in the world, except certain Asian countries. \b \b    About Gastric Cancer \b \u001d  Gastric (or stomach) cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer worldwide with more than 934,000 new patients every year. It is also the second most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with more than 700,000 deaths annually. There were about 22,800 new cases of gastric cancer in the United States in 2005. In Europe, this number is over 143,000 patients. \b \b    About Taiho \b \u001d  Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Taiho) is a company engaged in discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products, with headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. Taiho is one of the leading companies focused on oncology. More information is available at the company's website at www.taiho.co.jp/english/index.html. \b \b    About sanofi-aventis \b \u001d  Sanofi-aventis is one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, ranking number one in Europe.

(4568.TO) has begun phase I clinical trials in Japan on an antibody drug for the treatment of a wide range of solid cancers, The Nikkei Business Daily reported in its Monday edition. \u001d  Code-named DE-766, the antibody drug binds to the EGF receptor on cancer cells, blocking the receptor so they don't receive a signal that promotes proliferation. \u001d  Daiichi Sankyo imports DE-766 from CIMYM BioSciences Inc., a subsidiary of Canadian firm YM BioSciences Inc. (YM.T). Daiichi Sankyo has development and marketing rights to this antibody drug in Japan and began the phase I safety trials in April. \u001d  An antibody drug that blocks the EGF receptor is already being sold for the treatment of malignant colon cancer, so Daiichi Sankyo plans to test DE-766 against a variety of solid tumors to determine what cancer the drug is most effective against.  It will then proceed into phase II trials with a focus on this application. \u001d  Meanwhile, the company is progressing with development of another antibody drug, code-named CS-1008, that binds to the DR5 receptor on cancer cells and triggers cell suicide.  It is developing CS-1008 in cooperation with an American university and began phase I trials in Europe and the U.S. last year. \u001d  Daiichi Sankyo's main products are for hyperlipidemia and hypertension.

H-P's PC operations were barely profitable, morale was foundering and some investors were suggesting H-P get out of PCs altogether. \u001d  H-P owes that remarkable turnabout to something Mr. Bradley concluded within weeks of arriving at the Palo Alto, Calif., company: H-P was fighting on the wrong battlefield. H-P was concentrating its resources to fight Dell where Dell was strong, in direct sales over the Internet and phone. Instead, he decided, H-P should focus on its strength, retail stores, where Dell had no presence at all. H-P was neglecting that advantage, Mr. Bradley found as he visited retailers and H-P factories, hearing complaints about late or incomplete deliveries. He worked hard to fix the logistical snafus and build better relations with the retailers, helping H-P surpass Dell in world sales late last year for the first time since 2003. \u001d  Now, Dell is trying to shift the battlefield again. On May 24, Dell inked its first major deal to sell through a retailer -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. -- since the company pulled out of stores in 1993, and said the deal was just the first step of a broader retail push. Dell said it would offer two desktop PCs in more than 3,500 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores starting June 10. \u001d  Dell's move into stores shows how swiftly strategies can evolve in the PC business these days. Amid relentless competition and fast-changing consumer tastes, PC makers have had to learn to rapidly shift their distribution strategies. Dell's latest tack could spell trouble for H-P, as retail shelf space is tight and retailers often like to play vendors off each other to get better margins for themselves. H-P also faces U.S. marketing pushes from other retail-PC rivals such as Sony Corp., Gateway Inc. and Acer Inc. \u001d  Still, Mr. Bradley has carved out a big advantage by emphasizing store sales just as PC growth was moving from corporate desktops to personal laptops which consumers like to test out in person. The 48-year-old executive previously helped lift another technology company out of the doldrums by surfing a market trend: As chief executive of palmOne Inc., he moved the company's emphasis from its widely copied Palm data devices to smart phones just as those sales took off. \u001d  For H-P, Mr. Bradley laid out a 100-day road map to help make the company's deliveries to stores reliable again. He cozied up more to retailers and pushed attention-getting products such as touch-screen PCs that would show well in store displays and command a premium price. He pushed to design exclusive PCs for specific retailers -- like fashion designers making exclusive lines of clothing -- to help stores differentiate the computers they sell from those of their competitors. \u001d  H-P commands about 45% of PC sales in U.S. stores and has increased its leading share in the growing laptop business in the past two years, according to NPD Group Inc. Last year H-P rose 50 spots on a list Circuit City Stores Inc. keeps of its 100 most reliable vendors, grabbing the top spot among PC makers. \"Our relationship [with H-P] has improved significantly since 2005,\" says John Kelly, a Circuit City senior vice president. \u001d  H-P's operating margins on its PCs rose to 4.8% in its fiscal second quarter from 3.6% a year earlier. Dell's margin, while still bigger than that of H-P, dipped slightly to 6.5% in its fiscal first quarter from 6.7% a year earlier. H-P's stock has doubled in the past two years while Dell's is down about 33% over the same period. \u001d  All of this has forced Round Rock, Texas-based Dell into an unfamiliar underdog role. In the first quarter, H-P's global PC market share jumped to 17.6% from 14.9% a year ago, while Dell's share slipped to 13.9% from 16.4%, according to market researcher Gartner Inc. \u001d  A spokesman for Dell, Bob Pearson, said the company would be aggressively taking on H-P and other competitors in every sales venue. \"The bell for round two is about to ring and it will be heard directly and indirectly . . . in all distribution channels,\" he said in an email. On Thursday, Dell announced its first layoffs since 2001 in its effort to increase profits. \u001d  For years, H-P tried to copy Dell's approach. Under former CEO Carly Fiorina, H-P slashed its PC prices, but that landed it with deep losses. Then it hacked at its own costs by laying off thousands of workers in order to compete with Dell's low-cost structure. \u001d  That's how Mr. Bradley found things when H-P's new CEO, Mr. Hurd, hired him in June 2005 to fix the PC operations. Mr. Bradley, the first senior executive that Mr. Hurd recruited from outside, was known at palmOne as detail-oriented and a stickler for efficiency -- a reputation Mr. Hurd shares. \u001d  In some ways, Mr. Bradley faced a similar situation at palmOne. There, he helped sort through too many confusing models of similar products, and trimmed bloated inventory in the company's supply chain, according to people who worked with him. PalmOne had just come off of several good years during the tech bubble where demand was high and the company faced little competition. After the bubble burst, Mr. Bradley helped cut costs. \u001d  The executive also likes to have fun: He's known widely around palmOne for setting up a cubicle mini-golf game around the office, helping to get people from different departments talking to each other. He's so engaged in the San Francisco Giants and local theater that he tried commuting around 45 miles to H-P's PC-group offices in Cupertino from a condo in San Francisco's trendy SoMa district, but recently gave up the long trip and bought a house closer by in Palo Alto. \u001d  Mr. Bradley began refocusing on retail within weeks of joining H-P. In October, Mr. Bradley toured H-P's manufacturing sites in Europe and Asia. He found the factories had multiple hubs for collecting components, and that manufacturing, engineering and operations teams didn't communicate frequently enough. The resulting logistics problems made H-P often deliver late or partial PC orders to stores, Mr. Bradley concluded. \u001d  He learned the PC group had no marketing of its own -- the profitable printer division had charge of consumer marketing and advertising for PCs, a relic of the company's structure under Ms. Fiorina. So Mr. Bradley started forming his own marketing group. Meanwhile, he saw internal H-P research showed 58% of PC buyers had no preference for whether they bought computers online or in stores. Mr. Bradley decided H-P needed to convince more shoppers that retail was the better choice. \u001d  PCs \"aren't just a commodity that you run out and buy on the Internet,\" he says. \"People are going to want to touch it and feel it and understand how it connects.\" Mr. Bradley approved a new PC ad campaign aimed at consumers. Unlike previous H-P ads that simply listed a PC's technical product features next to the product's price, the new \"The Computer is Personal Again\" campaign featured celebrities such as hip-hop mogul Jay-Z and fashion designer Vera Wang talking about what they use their computers for. \u001d  Dell had thrived largely by shipping desktop computers with customized components, which clients can choose from its Web site. But that process was often confusing for individual consumers, who represented the potential growth in the market. Meanwhile, a drive toward bigger and more powerful laptops in place of desktops made features such as weight, size, keyboard feel and screen brightness just as important in making purchases as many internal components. According to NPD Group, 61% of PCs sold to consumers in the first quarter were bought in a store, up from nearly 54% two years ago. \u001d  In January 2006, Mr. Bradley met with Mr. Hurd and H-P's board to lay out a broad plan that included increased marketing of the H-P brand within retail outlets, pumping new PCs with fresh designs -- such as imprinted decorations -- into stores, and getting deliveries to clients on time by cleaning up the supply chain. \u001d  Last year H-P spent 55% of its U.S. marketing funds on merchandising and promotions in stores, up from 40% in 2005. The company's online advertisements now always include a message to \"visit your local retailer,\" something it had done inconsistently in the past. \u001d  Meanwhile, Mr. Bradley revamped H-P's PC product lineup. Though the company spends $3.5 billion on research and development projects a year, little of that was leading to products for Mr. Bradley's group. So in November 2005, Mr. Bradley brought in the chief technology officer of H-P's wireless business, Phil McKinney, to identify promising projects in H-P labs and get them into retail stores. \u001d  Mr. McKinney found a model that combined a CPU and monitor into one unit, somewhat like recent Apple Inc. designs. He also adapted some new touch-screen software from H-P labs for the machine, making a one-piece unit meant to be used in family rooms or kitchens as a PC with a touch-screen calendar and message board. H-P says demand for the \"TouchSmart PC\" has surpassed its internal sales forecasts since it was introduced in January, and it sells at $1,800, about three times the average desktop PC price. The company declined to release sales figures. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 23:05 ET (03:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

Jones)--Alliance Boots PLC's (AB.LN) pension trustees are preparing to go to court to block the GBP11 billion takeover of company by private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Sunday Telegraph reports without citing sources. \u001d  The move could result in a lengthy delay until the pensions regulator forces a compromise between the two sides, the newspaper said. \u001d  According to the paper, the trustees have argued that KKR needs to top up the pension scheme by GBP1 billion in cash and securities, because the GBP8 billion of debt borrowed to carry out the takeover will make the company a less reliable guarantor of future contributions. \u001d  KKR has offered to inject GBP900 million over several years. Shareholders approved the takeover, which is backed by Alliance Boots management, last week. \u001d  The Boots pension trustees and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts couldn't be immediately reached for a

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By William Echikson \u001d  BRUSSELS -- Some of Europe's biggest industries are in the midst of a cross-border merger frenzy, but a midsize firm in Belgium is betting -- in telecommunications at least -- that home is the place to be. \u001d  Instead of seeking tie-ups abroad, Belgacom SA is moving to slash costs, boost its dividend and jazz up its fixed-line telephone business by using it to offer broadband Internet access, cable television and on-demand movies. Chief Executive Didier Bellens said this strategy, rather than purchases, makes sense in an industry where Europe's different languages, cultures and infrastructure legacies make it difficult to combine telecom services across borders. \"Nobody yet has been able to see the synergies\" behind cross-border telecom mergers, he said. \u001d  The moves by the Belgian firm have produced results. Belgacom's shares are up 34% during the past year, much more than gains of telecom firms in other small European nations with similar issues. Shares of Portugal Telecom SGPS SA were up 17% in the past year; Telekom Austria AG's rose 14% and Swisscom AG's 9.6%. \u001d  Earnings also look good. Belgacom's first-quarter net profit was up 48% to 319 million euros ($428.9 million) from 215 million euros a year earlier. Net profit for all of 2006 was 959 million euros, up 4% from 922 million euros in 2005. \u001d  What surprised analysts was how revenue from fixed-line services rose 0.8% in the period to 916 million euros. The figures show a 3.4% drop in revenue from voice calls was offset by broadband Internet revenue growth of 12%. \u001d  \"If people say the fixed-line guys are dinosaurs, they are wrong,\" Mr. Bellens said. Belgacom TV -- which the company sells using its fixed-line network -- has about 150,000 subscribers and will become profitable next year, he added. \u001d  \"Belgacom is a safe haven,\" said Rob Goyens, an analyst with Belgian-French bank Dexia SA. \"It is a pretty dull company in terms of growth, but scores pretty well in shareholder remuneration and share buybacks.\" \u001d  Not everyone supports the strategy -- including some Belgacom directors, who say the company must seek growth outside. \u001d  That is what other midsize European telecom firms have done. Swisscom recently bought Italian broadband operator Fastweb SPA for 3 billion euros. Telekom Austria has expanded into Eastern Europe. Portugal Telecom jointly owns Brazil's largest cellphone company Vivo Participacoes with Spain's Telefonica SA. \u001d  Cross-border acquisitions haven't always paid off, and Belgacom's stay-at-home attitude could change, Mr. Bellens said. New Internet-based telecom networks will be rolled out in the next five to 10 years, making it easier to link infrastructure. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 03, 2007 19:44 ET (23:44
