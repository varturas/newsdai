(AAPL), Vivendi SA's (12777.FR) Universal Music Group is set to notify the Cupertino, Calif. company that it is not renewing a long term contract to sell digital music downloads through the increasingly powerful iTunes Store, according to people familiar with the situation, The Wall Street Journal has learned. \u001d  The move does not mean, however, that Universal will remove its vast catalog - including Eminem, 50 Cent and Sting - from iTunes in the foreseeable future. Instead, Universal, which is the world's largest music company by market share, expects to go to a short-term sales agreement. \u001d  Though it is unlikely to have sweeping effects immediately, the change could give Universal more flexibility in its dealings with competitors to iTunes - for instance enabling the company to offer other digital download stores parts of its catalog exclusively. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  Universal's move comes against a backdrop of dramatic change in the way music is sold. As traditional music retailers have fallen by the wayside, Apple has gained an outsize influence in music sales, recently becoming the No. 3 seller of recorded music to the public, behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Co. Inc. Its power has made record label executives increasingly uneasy, as it has generally refused to comply with labels' desire for flexibility on matters such as pricing. \u001d  As a result, the record labels and Apple have traded barbs with one another over the past year or so, with Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs, for instance, calling record labels \"greedy.\" \u001d  An Apple spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment \"rumors and speculation.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 21:58 ET (01:58 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

  By Amol Sharma and Nick Wingfield \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--AT&T Inc. (T) said it was working to resolve problems preventing some buyers of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iPhone from activating the device, illustrating the complexities Apple faces in working with a partner and in offering a consumer product that plugs into a cellular network. \u001d  The hiccup for one of the most eagerly awaited electronics products in years affected about 2% of those who purchased an iPhone, according to a person familiar with the situation. Phone activation also activates the iPhone's other features, such as playing music or movies and Web surfing. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  The problems likely would have to linger or broaden to blunt the overall impact of the iPhone for the two companies. Neither disclosed sales, although industry observers - citing crowded stores, media buzz and strong consumer interest - expect the new product to be a strong seller. Apple developed the iPhone device and its software, and AT&T has an exclusive, multiyear contract with Apple to provide cellular service for the device. \u001d  In blog postings and emails to The Wall Street Journal, some consumers who lined up at Apple and AT&T stores complained of problems and delays as they tried to get the phone running via Apple's iTunes computer software. \u001d  Some AT&T customers said their existing cellphones had been deactivated while they were still waiting for their iPhone to be activated, leaving them without any working phone. \u001d  AT&T spokesman Michael Coe said the vast majority of iPhone buyers were able to activate the device \"within minutes.\" He added, \"We're working to get those problems resolved. It's getting better and better.\" \u001d  \"There are a small percentage of iPhone customers who have had a less-than-perfect activation experience,\" Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris said. \"We're working hard to resolve any issues quickly.\" \u001d  Sheer volume appeared to cause general delays in AT&T's sign-up process, but there were some more specific problems. Some people who tried to port their numbers from rival carriers such as Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile USA got error messages and had to go through hours of customer support calls to fix the problem. \u001d  Some existing AT&T subscribers with business accounts said that, after hours of unsuccessfully trying to activate their iPhones, they found out belatedly that they would have to start entirely new personal accounts to use it. \u001d  Jared Gurfein, president of spirits company Viridian Spirits LLC, bought his iPhone at an Apple store Friday evening on New York's Long Island, Nassau County, N.Y., but hasn't been able to use the device since then. When he attempted to activate service with the iPhone online through iTunes, AT&T immediately stopped voice and email service for his existing BlackBerry phone, but Mr. Gurfein said the iPhone still wouldn't work, leaving him without a working cellphone. Mr. Gurfein said he had spent several hours on the phone with AT&T and Apple customer support representatives, to no avail.\"Both sides were passing the problem onto the other,\" he said. \u001d  \"I'm at the point of frustration where, as much as I'd like to get the device to work, I'd just like to get my BlackBerry working again.\" \u001d  The problems for Jaci Russo, senior partner at the Russo Group, an advertising agency in Lafayette, Louisiana, also began when she attempted to switch to an iPhone she purchased Friday night from a BlackBerry she already had through AT&T. During the process, she received a message through iTunes that said her iPhone couldn't be activated because she had a business, not a personal, account with AT&T. \u001d  In the meantime, Ms. Russo lost voice and email service from her BlackBerry, until she finally got service through her iPhone turned on Saturday night after lengthy customer support calls to AT&T. There are still problems with service: Ms. Russo said two out of three phone calls she had received on her iPhone by Sunday, including one with a reporter, dropped out in mid-conversation. Calls to her iPhone number were answered by an automated message saying the phone number wasn't in service, before the phone began working again. \u001d  \"I can't have that for work,\" she said. \"My clients will freak out.\" She added, \"IPhone is still a great thing, but it appears the service doesn't live up to the equipment.\" \u001d  The sign-up problems weren't the only glitch for AT&T in the iPhone launch. On Friday, its in-store sales systems temporarily stalled in areas up and down the East Coast because of an overload of activity. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 21:14 ET (01:14 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0b46d9467c9488d2a63463a5fd99a0f4","symR":["CLP"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Colonial Properties Trust","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CLP"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Colonial Properties Trust: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=CLP or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:48 ET (07:48 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"0b47a6aa62bc58601462514796ff2800","symR":["WPC"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for W.

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Carolyn Cui \u001d  Even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit some bumps on its way to rise 8.5% in the second quarter, there were stocks that racked up hefty gains. \u001d  Some benefited from rising oil prices or renewed interest in technology while others had company-specific stories to tell. \u001d  Among the quarter's best-performing companies was Flotek Industries Inc., a supplier of oil-field specialty chemicals and drilling tools, which more than doubled during the three months. \u001d  The Houston company made several acquisitions to expand its drilling-tool production capacity and said first-quarter revenue and earnings per share more than doubled from the previous year. \u001d  Foster Wheeler Ltd., which builds oil-and-gas processing facilities and natural-gas receiving terminals, saw its shares rise 83%, as the Clinton, N.J., company announced several construction contracts in China, Europe and Saudi Arabia. \u001d  The energy sector benefited from the 16% rise in oil prices this year. Although below their record high of about $77 a barrel last July, crude prices hit $70 during the latest quarter and ended the three-month period at $70.68 a barrel. \u001d  \"The consensus believes that we are in a long-term chronic shortage of oil and energy,\" said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. \"We have to build up new capacity, and new infrastructures.\" He said oil companies may be turning hefty profits earned in the past several years into new facilities. \u001d  The oil-and-gas sector rose 14%, the third-best performing sector in the quarter, after construction and materials and autos and auto parts, both of which rose more than 14%. The component oil-equipment and services industry gained 20%. \u001d  Parts of the technology sector also posted solid gains, with computer hardware up 15%. In the telecom sector, mobile telecommunications was up 10%. \u001d  American depositary shares of Nortel Inversora SA rose 83%. The Buenos Aires company's principal asset is a majority stake in a telecommunications-service provider in Argentina. Canadian wireless-modem maker Sierra Wireless Inc. surged 59% after it was awarded a contract from Fujitsu Siemens Computers BV, a venture between Fujitsu Ltd. and Siemens AG, and predicted stronger second-quarter earnings. \u001d  \"Corporations are now flush with cash, and typically when that happens, companies will look for places to invest,\" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co. \"Capital spending is likely to increase as the year goes forward, and a lot of that will find its way into information-technology-type products.\" \u001d  It wasn't only companies serving businesses that posted gains. Rural Cellular Corp., an Alexandria, Minn., wireless-communication-services provider with a market value of $680 million, more than tripled after it restructured its balance sheet, expanded its coverage area in central and Midwestern states, and posted a narrower first-quarter loss than last year. \u001d  Investors in emerging markets also fared well, although some strategists see reasons for caution. Shares of Synutra International Inc., a Chinese maker of dairy-based nutritional products and infant formula, gained 74% after moving from the OTC Bulletin Board to the Nasdaq Stock Market in April. JA Solar Holdings Co., a solar-cells maker in China, surged 86% in the second quarter, after its February initial public offering of ADSs. \u001d  Among company-specific stories, Amazon.com Inc., rose 72% after its first-quarter earnings beat Wall Street expectations. The Seattle online retailer increased its profit margins by offering items from other retailers on its Web site, said Mayuresh Masurekar, an analyst following Internet and e-commerce with CIBC World Markets. \u001d  Seattle online-ad concern aQuantive Inc. more than doubled in the quarter after its share price shot up 78% in one day in late May, when Microsoft Corp. said it agreed to acquire the company for $6.3 billion. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 21:00 ET (01:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

Lafayette and Italy's La Rinascente SpA. \u001d  Debenhams Chief Executive Rob Templeman has also been talking to private equity groups, the Sunday Times reports, adding that Templeman refused to comment on the plans. Any deal would need the support of Icelandic investment company Baugur Group, which holds a 4.87% stake in Debenhams and is also seen as a possible bidder for the company, the newspaper adds. \u001d  Debenhams was not immediately available to comment. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.timesonline.co.uk \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9320 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 07:25 ET (11:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1dc5142edd2e36e793771c81d3cbfb19","symR":["US01903Q1085"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Allied Capital Corporation","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["US01903Q1085"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  Allied Capital Corporation: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=US01903Q1085 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:07 ET (07:07 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1dcc5dcc333e6eb468e92d71b3a35297","symR":["LOR.T","LRP","CA5441911099"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Lorus Therapeutics Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LOR.T","LRP","CA5441911099"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG"],"Story":"\u001d  Lorus Therapeutics Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=LRP or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:36 ET (08:36 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1e32fd8c9c80b60a1c88b10525cdff6e","symR":["F"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Arab Invest Funds To Bid For Land Rover, Jaguar - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T12:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["F"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Arab investment funds are drawing up bids for Land Rover and Jaguar, the U.K. car brands of Ford Motor Co.

 By William Wright and Luke Jeffs \u001d  Of FINANCIAL NEWS \b \u001d  Clearing and settlement organizations in Europe have started talks with each other about mergers, cooperation and alliances as they brace themselves for a wave of consolidation. \u001d  The talks have been prompted by regulatory pressure on the industry from the European Commission to end restrictive practices, an increase in competition between clearing and settlement organizations, and pressure from users to cut the high cost of what are collectively known as post-trade services, or the \"plumbing\" behind the financial markets. \u001d  The prospect of consolidation is important because the complex structure of clearing and settlement costs investors billions of euros a year and is a factor in holding up the creation of an integrated European cross-border financial market. \u001d  One senior clearing house executive said: \"There is a febrile atmosphere over consolidation in the industry. Everyone is talking to everyone else at the moment.\" \u001d  Another said: \"Consolidation has moved to the top of everyone's agenda. Organizations that were reluctant to talk to each other as recently as a few months ago are engaging in discussions. Regulation and the threat of competition have fundamentally changed the mindset of the industry.\" \u001d  At last week's Federation of European Securities Exchanges conference in Brussels, consolidation in post-trade services was one of the most keenly-discussed topics. Speculation focused on potential deals involving U.S. clearing house DTCC, Euroclear, the international clearing and settlement group, and LCH.Clearnet. All three declined to comment on any talks. \u001d  On the regulatory side, the European Commission is forcing the industry to end restrictive practices and open access to each other under a self-regulated code of conduct, which will be implemented at the beginning of next year. \u001d  This will allow clearing and settlement organizations to compete for each other's business and is a key part of the London Stock Exchange's plans for Borsa Italiana if its EUR1.6 billion acquisition, announced last week, goes through. \b \u001d  Web site: http://www.efinancialnews.com \b \u001d  (END)

JOURNAL) \b   By Susan Carey \u001d  Northwest Airlines Corp., facing a string of more than 1,000 flight cancellations because of bad weather and a pilot shortage, said it plans to try to rectify the problem by cutting its summer capacity, redoubling efforts to increase its pilot ranks and modifying the way it schedules trips to minimize the effects of storms and air-traffic congestion on the rest of its network. \u001d  The airline began preemptively canceling large numbers -- 100 or more a day -- of its 1,400 daily mainline flights, or those with big jets, excluding commuter units and affiliates, late last month. From June 22 though Thursday, the carrier said it canceled 12% of its mainline flights. A normal rate would be 1% to 2% for all causes. Passengers fumed, even those who were contacted in advance and rebooked. \u001d  On Friday, Doug Steenland, Northwest's chief executive, said in a letter to employees the cumulative effect of the pilot shortage, storms and air-traffic congestion \"left us no choice\" but to cancel flights. Pilot absenteeism was up 40% in June compared with May and up 80% from a year earlier, with the increases primarily involving a minority of the airline's narrowbody aircraft pilots, he said. \u001d  The Eagan, Minn., carrier stepped out of bankruptcy-court protection a month ago with new, more productive labor contracts. It has been careful not to accuse the pilots of engaging in a concerted job action, and hasn't sought a court injunction to halt sick calls. \u001d  The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents Northwest's 5,000 active pilots, denied that its members are engaged in a job action. It blamed short staffing and an aggressive flight schedule that pushes pilots to fly a high number of hours, close to the maximum allowed under U.S. rules. A spokesman said he couldn't comment on the absentee numbers the chief executive cited. \u001d  Mr. Steenland said Northwest will drop its second daily flight on July 18 from Detroit to Frankfurt. In August, it will cut its domestic mainline capacity by 3% by reducing the maximum hours pilots will be asked to fly that month. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 19:50 ET

(Adds background) \b \b   By Andrew Harrison \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  MELBOURNE (Dow Jones)--Amcor Ltd. (AMC.AU), the world's largest maker of plastic soft drink bottles, said Monday it has agreed to sell its European PET business to Spain's La Seda de Barcelona SA (SED.MC) for an estimated EUR425 million (US$575.4 million). \u001d  The sale is expected to be finalized in the third quarter of calendar 2007, the Melbourne-based company said in a statement. \u001d  Melbourne-based Amcor has sold A$420 million of assets and closed 10 plants as part of a three-year program to \"fix, close or sell\" non-performing units. It flagged the sale of all or part of its European PET unit in February, saying it would raise up to A$580 million. \u001d  Amcor became the world's largest maker of plastic soft drink bottles when it bought the European business from Schmalbach-Lubeca AG in 2002 for A$2.8 billion along with other assets in North and South America. \u001d  The company has been restructuring its business because its earnings have been crimped by higher costs for transport, energy, pulp and resin, while it has been trying to maintain its share of markets, which rivals have targeted. \u001d  As part of its three-year restructuring program, Amcor has been improving the efficiency of its Latin American soft drink bottle unit, European flexibles and Australasian fiber packaging businesses. \u001d  Barcelona-based Seda is one of Europe's largest producers of artificial and synthetic fabrics and yarns, such as polyester, polythene and viscose. \u001d  The company, which has founded in 1925 in order to produce silk for Ray&#243;n Viscosa, is also involved in pharmaceutical fields, such as the production of oxyacetylene and its derivatives. \u001d  Earlier this year Seda acquired Eastman Chemical Co's Spanish business for EUR40.5 million to boost its annual production PET capacity to 1 million tonnes. \u001d  Amcor's PET business in the year ended June 30 had unaudited sales of EUR545 million, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of EUR60 million and earnings before interest and tax of EUR38 million, the company said. \u001d  The book value of the net assets sold plus transaction costs will be finalized after an audit in August and is expected to be about EUR260 million, Amcor said. \b \u001d  -By Andrew Harrison, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9671-4323;

\u001d  By Nitin Luthra \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  TAPUKARA, India (Dow Jones)--Japan's Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (7267.TO) may review its current year's profit forecast announced in April as the yen has weakened against the U.S. dollar, Honda Chairman Satoshi Aoki said Sunday. \u001d  \"We may want to review our forecast. I'm not saying we will revise but we may review if we need to revise our forecast,\" Aoki said in response to a query on the company's statement in April that Honda may suffer a 2.9% fall in profit in the current fiscal year to March 2008. \u001d  Honda earns about 70% of its profit from the U.S., so a weaker yen boosts its earnings by increasing the value of sales made outside Japan. \u001d  Aoki is in India to participate in the ceremony for the laying of the foundation stone of Honda's second car plant in the country, in the western state of Rajasthan. \u001d  The Japanese automaker operates in India via Honda Siel Cars India Ltd., in which it owns a 99.9% stake while the remaining 0.1% is held by Siel Ltd. (523371.BY). \u001d  Honda had based its forecast on an assumed average dollar rate of Y115 against the then-prevailing rate of Y117, Aoki said. \u001d  \"Now that the yen since then has been trading weaker than Y115, that should give us some favorable impact,\" he said. \u001d  When asked about rising prices of commodities, which have eaten into margins of automakers globally, Aoki said \"some amount of negative impact\" is coming from rising costs of materials such as aluminum and copper. \u001d  He added that Honda was taking steps to boost internal efficiencies and save costs, but didn't elaborate. \u001d  Honda Siel, which sells the City, Civic and Accord sedans and the CR-V sports utility in India, earlier said it will invest up to $460 million to build and expand its second plant as it tries to garner more market share in the country's booming automobile industry. \u001d  But initially only 10 billion rupees ($230 million) will be invested to build a startup annual production capacity of 60,000 units, the company said Sunday, adding that annual capacity could be increased to 200,000 units on strong demand. \u001d  Honda will use the plant to mark its foray into India's high-volume small or compact car segment, which according to industry officials dominates overall car sales with a nearly 80% market share. \u001d  Honda's small car, which is expected to roll out of the Rajasthan plant in late 2009, will boast local content of up to 90%, Honda Siel's President and Chief Executive Masahiro Takedagawa said. \u001d  Passenger vehicle sales in India are forecast to nearly double to 2 million units by 2010 due on rising incomes and new launches including that of cars costing just INR100,000 ($2,500) - which is about half the price of the cheapest car currently sold in India. \u001d  Companies like Tata Motors Ltd. (500570.BY) have already begun work on such ultra-low cost car projects. Last week, Nissan Motor Co. (7201.TO) Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said India's Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (500520.BY) will likely be its partner for a low-price car project for India. \u001d  However, Aoki said it will be a challenge to make cars at such low prices. \u001d  \"A 660-cubic-centimeter mini car in Japan costs around $9,000...to make something at one third this cost is rather challenging,\" he said. \"Personally, I'd be surprised to see such a kind of model.\" \u001d  Honda Siel is also doubling manufacturing capacity at its plant near New Delhi to 100,000 units by the end of this year and expects to make 150,000 units a year beginning in 2010, on the combined capacity offered by both plants. \u001d  However, the company has no plans to export small cars from India. \u001d  \"We don't have any plan on that as our philosophy is to make cars wherever the demand is. But it is possible that we may export certain components of a small car as it will be a global model,\" Takedagawa said. \b \u001d  -By Nitin Luthra, Dow Jones Newswires; +91-98100-65468;

  (Adds comment by Wesfarmers, detail) \b \b   By Susan Murdoch \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  MELBOURNE (Dow Jones)--Australia's Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES.AU) is locked in talks Monday about a potential solo bid for retailer Coles Group Ltd. (CGJ.AU), which could be valued at up to A$20.8 billion. \u001d  Wesfarmers, an industrial conglomerate, was forced to go it alone in its bid for Coles after London-based partner Permira (PR.YY) pulled out, citing the state of U.S. financing market. \u001d  Permira, along with local buyout company Pacific Equity Partners and Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd., had planned to take a 50% stake in Coles' core \"Everyday Needs\" business; supermarkets, liquor stores and discount chain Kmart. \u001d  The last minute withdrawal of Permira ahead of Saturday's bid deadline means Wesfarmers will now increase the planned scrip component of its offer to help fund the deal, a person familiar with the situation told Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  If it succeeds, the takeover would be the biggest in Australia's history. \u001d  Without citing its sources, the Australian Financial Review reported Monday that Wesfarmers has offered a A$20.8 billion cash and scrip proposal, which, depending on the level of shares investors take, values Coles between A$16.00 a share and A$17.00-A$17.25 a share. \u001d  Wesfarmers paid A$16.47 a share for a 12.8% stake in Coles in April. \u001d  A spokesman for Wesfarmers said it remains in talks with Pacific Equity Partners, but the buyout company is unlikely to take an equity stake. \u001d  Macquarie remains an adviser to Wesfarmers. \u001d  Pacific Equity Partners' continuing role is important, as its director Steven Cain is a former head of Coles' supermarket division. Cain was expected to play a key role in resurrecting the business. \u001d  Shares in Wesfarmers and Coles are in trading halts pending the outcome of takeover talks. Wesfarmers shares have been rising in recent weeks on expectations it had the upper hand in the Coles bargaining process following the exit of its main bidding rival, a buyout consortium led by TPG Inc. \u001d  Wesfarmers closed Friday at A$45.73, Coles shares ended at A$16.12. \u001d  Some traders expressed concern over the large portion of risk Wesfarmers would shoulder following the exit of the Permira. \u001d  \"It has raised the stakes since private equity has pulled out - A$12 billion of equity and A$8 billion of debt - it's all on their shoulders,\" said one trader, who declined to be named. \"I would have thought this is a big bite for Wesfarmers and I'd be shocked if its (shares) keep pushing up. I think the share price should go down. It won't be an easy turnaround if it's all on the balance sheet.\" \u001d  Woolworths Ltd., Coles' main rival, also lodged a bid for parts of the Coles business. Competition rules would prevent Woolworths from bidding for Coles' core food and liquor assets, with the two companies controlling around 70% of Australia's supermarket industry. \u001d  Wesfarmers was the only company bidding for the whole company following the exit of the TPG consortium last week. TPG also blamed the rising cost of the U.S. debt market for its decision. \u001d  Concerns of a global credit squeeze were heightened last week by the near-collapse of two hedge funds run by U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns. \b \b   -By Susan Murdoch, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9671-4393; susan.murdoch@dowjones.com \b   -Edited by Graham Morgan \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 23:58 ET (03:58 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2cdee8f3c81e06137ea257a193d67270","symR":["ARCI"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Appliance Recycling Centers","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ARCI"],"IndustryCodes":["POL","SVC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Appliance Recycling Centers: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=ARCI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:10 ET (07:10 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2d0126467df9865eb1e83fa0fb296718","symR":["ACF"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Americredit Corporation","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACF"],"IndustryCodes":["CFN","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Americredit Corporation: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=ACF or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:07 ET (07:07 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2d3890384535c18525cb1d502e500212","symR":["VDE"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VDE"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\u001d  Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=VDE or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:48 ET (09:48 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2d52be2f732124fa4ca2707ef0b311d0","symR":["WPF.LN","GB00B03HDJ73"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for The Westbury Property Fund Ltd","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WPF.LN","GB00B03HDJ73"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI"],"Story":"\u001d  The Westbury Property Fund Ltd: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B03HDJ73 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:28 ET (09:28 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2d61f962cf989a286def72781635c74a","symR":["2768.TO","FLX.AU","AU000000FLX1","JP3663900003"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Sojitz To Invest About Y14B In Australia Coal Devt Ops-Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T23:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["2768.TO","FLX.AU","AU000000FLX1","JP3663900003"],"IndustryCodes":["COA","ICS","SVC","X225","XDJGI","XISL","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei/Dow Jones)--Sojitz Corp.

Phone activation also activates the iPhone's other features, such as playing music or movies and Web surfing. \u001d  The problems likely would have to linger or broaden to blunt the overall impact of the iPhone for the two companies. Neither disclosed sales, although industry observers -- citing crowded stores, media buzz and strong consumer interest -- expect the new product to be a strong seller. Apple developed the iPhone device and its software, and AT&T has an exclusive, multiyear contract with Apple to provide cellular service for the device. \u001d  In blog postings and emails to The Wall Street Journal, some consumers who lined up at Apple and AT&T stores complained of problems and delays as they tried to get the phone running via Apple's iTunes computer software. \u001d  Some AT&T customers said their existing cellphones had been deactivated while they were still waiting for their iPhone to be activated, leaving them without any working phone. \u001d  AT&T spokesman Michael Coe said the vast majority of iPhone buyers were able to activate the device \"within minutes.\" He added, \"We're working to get those problems resolved. It's getting better and better.\" \u001d  \"There are a small percentage of iPhone customers who have had a less-than-perfect activation experience,\" Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris said. \"We're working hard to resolve any issues quickly.\" \u001d  Jared Gurfein, president of spirits company Viridian Spirits LLC, bought his iPhone at an Apple store Friday on New York's Long Island, but hasn't been able to use the device since then. \"I'm at the point of frustration where, as much as I'd like to get the device to work, I'd just like to get my BlackBerry working again.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow

in Blackstone Group (BX) since the private equity group's flotation has highlighted the unintended consequences of well-intended regulation. \u001d  After an initial public offering in the U.S., the lead banks are not allowed to publish research for 40 days and other banks in the syndicate must keep their mouths shut for 25 days. \u001d  The regulations are designed to prevent a false market because investors would face a barrage of redundant buy recommendations from the banks leading the deal. It is also best practice for banks not involved in the deal not to publish research during this blackout. However, in a world in which research has been \"Napsterized\" by the Internet, as the head of research at Merrill Lynch famously said this year, something will fill that vacuum. \u001d  In the case of Blackstone, it has been filled by unremittingly negative and often ill-informed coverage in the media and the blogosphere. In a post-Spitzer world of separation between investment banking and research, it seems absurd to continue to apply this blackout. \u001d  Analysts who are not allowed to publish research are no doubt talking to their preferred clients on it - the sort of behavior the rules are designed to prevent. U.S. authorities are considering a reduction in the blackout to 25 days. They should go further. They should encourage - perhaps force - companies to provide access to independent research firms before and immediately after they list. \u001d  editor@efinancialnews.com \b \u001d  Web site:

China Fund?","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-02T03:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OBCHX"],"IndustryCodes":["ZFU"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Carolyn Cui and Tom Lauricella \u001d  The Chinese stock market has been on a tear the past year, but China-focused mutual funds are lagging far behind. \u001d  The average China stock fund is up 25% so far this year, according to fund researcher Lipper Inc. That is pretty good, except the Shanghai Composite Index is up almost twice as much -- 46% -- despite having fallen 10% in recent weeks from its May record. \u001d  The reason for the discrepancy speaks volumes about the limits put on foreign-investor access in the booming economy. It also highlights the importance for investors to understand what they are getting in funds like these. \u001d  Most China funds invest the vast majority of their money -- and in at least one case, 100% of the portfolio -- in Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong and other markets outside the mainland. Those markets tend to more closely track movements in the U.S. stock market than in the mainland Chinese exchanges. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index is up 9.9% this year. \u001d  Chinese-government regulations tightly limit the amount of money foreign investors can put into mainland stocks. In addition, fund managers have their own reasons for not diving too deeply into China shares: They cite concerns about lax regulation on mainland exchanges, lofty prices and a tendency for the shares to have huge swings in prices. \u001d  \"There are many types of Chinese stocks, but most investors don't quite understand the difference\" between them all, said Richard Gao, portfolio manager of the $1.24 billion Matthews China Fund. \u001d  China's mainland market consists of two classes of shares. A large majority are Class A shares traded in yuan, the Chinese currency. Most A shares are traded by local investors; non-Chinese investors must apply for permission to own them, and then the government places strict limits on foreign ownership. \u001d  A smaller market of Class B shares, denominated in dollars, is open to non-Chinese investors. Shares of mainland-Chinese companies that are traded in Hong Kong are known as H shares, or \"red chips\" if the companies are both listed and incorporated in Hong Kong. \u001d  Fund companies don't make it easy for investors to figure which kinds of stocks their funds own. They often simply categorize investments as in \"China\" or \"Hong Kong\" -- although sometimes \"China\" investments actually trade on Hong Kong's stock exchange. For example, the $90 million AIM China Fund lists 66% of its assets as in China and 25% in Hong Kong, but only 8% are A or B shares trading on mainland exchanges. \u001d  \"Every time we have a company incorporated in China and doing business in China, even though they are listed in Hong Kong, we list those companies as being in China,\" a spokesman for AIM said. \u001d  It is a similar story for the Dreyfus Premier Greater China fund -- this year's best-performing China fund, up 39% so far in 2007. It tells investors that 57% of the portfolio is in China and 28% in Hong Kong. Portfolio manager Hugh Simon says the fund actually has only 19% in China's B-share market. The fund holds just one A-share stock. \u001d  Mr. Simon said the fund's focus is on each company's fundamentals, not where it trades. \"We invest in greater China.\" \u001d  The $801 million Oberweis China Opportunities Fund doesn't own a single stock traded on the mainland exchanges, according to manager James Oberweis. \"Many higher-quality Chinese companies list their shares in Hong Kong,\" he said. \u001d  In general, fund managers prefer to invest in Hong Kong-listed companies because of the city's more stringent regulatory oversight of the market. \u001d  \"The overall quality of Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies is higher than that of A-share companies,\" Mr. Gao said. \u001d  Then there is volatility. In late May, mainland Chinese stocks tumbled a total of 15% in four sessions, while Hong Kong stocks edged up 2%. Although volatility can benefit investors when stocks shoot higher, sharp swings in price can make it difficult for a fund to trade. \u001d  Such swings are the result of a market dominated by more than 100 million individual investors, accounting for about two-thirds of the daily volume. \"We expect high volatility to persist in the . . . A-shares markets,\" said Samantha Ho, manager of the AIM China Fund. \u001d  In part because of such concerns, some funds have restrictions built into their prospectuses that limit their holdings. Matthews China can invest only 10% in B shares, and AIM China is restricted to no more than 10% of the fund in A shares. \u001d  Having missed out on the big run-up, many fund managers now worry that mainland stocks are overvalued and as a result it isn't a good time for them to buy. \"Valuations of A shares are somewhat stretched,\" says Ms. Ho. \"We believe there are good buying opportunities in [Hong Kong-listed stocks] where valuations are reasonable.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 23:02 ET (03:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"393b6282a2fbef86698ee86cf67c2634","symR":["PG","US7427181091"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Procter & Gamble Co.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PG","US7427181091"],"IndustryCodes":["HPN","HPR","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  Procter & Gamble Co.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=PG or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:13 ET (09:13 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"393f174bc7eb557c4ac85dce22559173","symR":["GB0004327226"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Huntsworth plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GB0004327226"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  Huntsworth plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0004327226 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:11 ET (08:11 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"394e3a42def32a1e3c6dac50f7e20e6c","symR":["INSU"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Insituform Technologies, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["INSU"],"IndustryCodes":["CON","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Insituform Technologies, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=INSU or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:28 ET (08:28 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"394fa3c76d54d7a0b7d2293865fdf830","symR":["CPO"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Corn Products International Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CPO"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Corn Products International Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=CPO or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:50 ET (07:50 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"395798b25e4c4ee812cab3c1986c406b","symR":["AGFB.BT","BE0003755692"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Agfa-Gevaert N.V.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AGFB.BT","BE0003755692"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XB20","XDJGI","XENX"],"Story":"\u001d  Agfa-Gevaert N.V.: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=BE0003755692 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:04 ET (07:04 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"397f62001514fb26f3fdd96438d8deba","symR":["JEF"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Jefferies Group, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JEF"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Jefferies Group, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=JEF or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:32 ET (08:32 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"399c051800da25fffa1eeb3fe6ed6697","symR":["ZF"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Zweig Fund, Inc.

Geronzi as head of one of its two boards. \u001d  By switching from a single board to a dual-governance structure - with a supervisory board and a management board - Mediobanca's management hopes to

Fat Ban, Calorie Display Rule Take Effect In NYC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-02T00:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BKC","MCD","SBUX","US5801351017"],"IndustryCodes":["RES","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  NEW YORK (AP)--The city's ban on trans fat-laden cooking oils, the first of its kind in the nation, went into effect Sunday. \u001d  Along with the ban, fast-food restaurants in New York City now must post calories on their menu. Few eateries, however, were complying with the calorie rule. \u001d  Most fast-food chains reversed their initial opposition to the trans fat ban and implemented it ahead of Sunday's deadline, the city Health Department reported. \u001d  The first phase applies to oils, shortening and margarine used for frying and spreading - not to baked goods or prepared foods, or oils used to deep-fry dough or cake batter. These are covered by the second phase of the regulation, which takes effect on July 1, 2008. \u001d  Since New York passed the ban last year, Philadelphia, Montgomery County in Maryland and the Boston suburb of Brookline have followed its lead with similar measures that take effect later this year or in 2008. Several other states and cities including California and Chicago are also considering trans fat prohibitions. \u001d  Leaflets tacked onto the wall at one McDonald's said, \"0 Grams Trans Fat and Still Loving the Taste!\" But the restaurant kept the nutritional information off the menus, relegating it to a chart on the back of the fliers: 740 calories for a Quarter Pounder with cheese, 620 for a McFlurry. \u001d  Even the leaflets were not in evidence at nearby McDonald's restaurants in midtown Manhattan. \"I have no comment,\" said a manager at 10th Avenue and 34th Street. \u001d  McDonald's Corp. (MCD) and Burger King Holdings Inc. (BKC) were among the chains refusing to follow the new rule requiring certain fast food restaurants to list calorie counts next to menu items in type that is at least as large as the price. \u001d  With city officials not planning to issue fines for violations of the new rules until Oct. 1, most chains seem to be holding out in the hopes that a New York Restaurant Association federal lawsuit will get the calorie rule thrown out. \u001d  In the lawsuit, the eateries argue that their First Amendment rights were being violated, and complained that the rule would turn each of their menu boards into a cluttered mess. \u001d  At one Burger King restaurant on Sunday, the nutritional information including calories was posted on a wall where few customers waiting to order their food appeared to notice it. \u001d  If they had, they could have learned that a triple Whopper with cheese has 1,230 calories - 1,070 without mayonnaise - and a king-size chocolate shake has 1,260. The recommended daily calorie intake for an adult woman is about 1,800. \u001d  Lowell Stephens, a manager at the Burger King, said the information had been posted in the restaurant for at least a year and a half. \u001d  \"A lot of people know that it's there,\" he said. \"They can read it any time.\" \u001d  But when the city does start cracking down, posting the calories on a chart on the wall won't be good enough. \u001d  \"It needs to be at the point of purchase,\" Health Department spokesman Andrew Tucker said Sunday. \"The point being that customers can actually see it when they're deciding what to order.\" \u001d  Starbucks (SBUX) was offering a compromise. The chain's 220 New York City coffee shops will offer nutritional information on spiral-bound flip books set up on the counters where customers get their milk and sugar, spokesman Brandon Borrman said. \u001d  Borrman said putting calorie counts on the menu would be problematic. \u001d  \"The menu boards become very visually complex when you do that,\" he said. \u001d  Subway, which has marketed itself as a healthier alternative to other types of fast food, is complying with the regulation and began putting up new menus including calorie counts at its 340 New York City locations in the past few days. \u001d  \"We've always been upfront about our nutritional information,\" said Les Winograd, a spokesman with the chain, which is owned by the Milford, Conn.-based Doctor's Associates Inc. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 20:30 ET (00:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"402c6a16ffb817244c77d1c1b6fc96b2","symR":["US0341641035"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for The Andersons Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["US0341641035"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  The Andersons Inc.: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=US0341641035 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:25 ET (09:25 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4075890068ff0d878529cda8968d09a3","symR":["PCW.XE","DE0006910904"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for PC-Ware Info Technologies AG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PCW.XE","DE0006910904"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX"],"Story":"\u001d  PC-Ware Info Technologies AG: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0006910904 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:54 ET (08:54 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"40c9259228dd12faa8c6c92a82dfa3e1","symR":["FEO"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for First Trust Aberdeen Emerging Opp Fund","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FEO"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  First Trust Aberdeen Emerging Opp Fund: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=FEO or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:12 ET (08:12 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"40f874ecd35c0bad2a7522104ac5c622","symR":["RB.LN","GB0007278715"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Reckitt Benckiser Plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RB.LN","GB0007278715"],"IndustryCodes":["HPN","HPR","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  Reckitt Benckiser Plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0007278715 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:03 ET (09:03 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"40ff8781accc66da13307e620542ce91","symR":["CAY.XX","VMED"],"date":"2007-07-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Carlyle Group In Talks To Acquire Virgin Media -

The website is tracking visitors on the site and then redirecting repeat visitors to a different, clean webpage in efforts to thwart security researchers as well as using XOR encryption to obfuscate the attack. \b \u001d  \"This yet again confirms the expanding trend in web-borne malware,\" said Paul Henry, vice president of technology evangelism for Secure Computing. \"This threat is particularly insidious in that scripts within the HTML code returned to the user contain exploit code for multiple vulnerabilities to improve the malicious hacker's chances of gaining the necessary access to install the rootkit /spam bot malware. While most organizations fully inspect the traffic directed to their Internet facing web servers, many do not inspect the traffic that is returned to their internal users when visiting Internet web sites.\" \b \u001d  The initial activity of the rootkit/spam bot malware is to incorporate the compromised PC into a spam sending botnet. Because the malware is rootkit- based, it would be a simple matter for the malicious hacker to at any time update the malware to include other nefarious tasks, such as key logging on the compromised PC to capture the user's financial credentials for use in ID theft. \b \u001d  Viruses, worms, Trojans and other malware have traditionally been distributed over email with further propagation through each compromised users' email address books and made to look like messages coming from them. \"With this threat, we again see the addition of a web attack component to traditional email-based malware,\" said Henry. \"Secure Computing has recently seen other evidence of web-borne malware propagating through the use of fake video-hosting sites and fake greeting card messages.\" \b \u001d  \"Because of the popularity of the iPhone brand this is the first in what's bound to be a series of scams involving the iPhone,\" added Henry. \b \u001d  Customers using Secure Computing's Webwasher(R), the industry's first and only reputation-based Web gateway security solution, are protected against this.

Browning \u001d  Investors in two Bear Stearns hedge funds will have to wait until as late as July 16 to learn how much money they have lost. \u001d  The Wall Street firm has had difficulty calculating the funds' fair value, apparently because many of the mortgage-related securities they hold are thinly traded and the market for them has been volatile. \u001d  \"In light of the Funds' circumstances, this process is more time-consuming than in prior periods,\" Bear's asset-management arm said in a \"Dear Investor\" letter dated Friday. It told investors that net asset values as of May 31 would be calculated \"on or before July 16,\" and that it would make its best effort to calculate an estimate of the June 30 value of the two funds by the same time. \u001d  It \"has determined not to release an estimated NAV in the interim,\" Bear Stearns Asset Management Inc. said in the letter. \u001d  A Bear Stearns official declined to comment on the letter. \u001d  Investors are watching the process closely because they believe that other hedge funds also are holding thinly traded mortgage-related securities, and they want to see how far Bear thinks their value has fallen. \u001d  Last month, the more indebted of the two funds, the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage fund, reported that its value fell 6.75% in April. Two weeks later, it put the loss at 18%. Values are believed to have fallen further since then, and the declines have caused some investors to flee funds that make such investments. \u001d  As of March 31, the Enhanced Leverage fund had $638 million in investor capital and at least $6 billion in borrowings. It used the money to make $11.5 billion in bullish bets and $4.5 billion in bearish bets, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \u001d  Its sister fund, the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies fund, had $925 million in investor money, and made $9.7 billion in bullish bets and $4 billion in bearish bets. \u001d  In an effort to support the latter fund, which has fewer loans and is considered easier to salvage, Bear Stearns has announced that it would take over $1.6 billion of the fund's debt, which Bear said is collateralized. \u001d  In June, the two funds were forced to sell about $4 billion of assets to meet margin calls, which are calls to repay debt to brokers. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 19:44 ET (23:44

ASIA) \b   By James Hookway \u001d  When GE Money, the consumer-finance unit of General Electric Co., completed its $626 million investment in Thailand's sixth-largest bank this year, it seconded dozens of executives to help build up the business of its new strategic ally, Bank of Ayudhya PCL. Among them was Tan Kong Khoon, the bank's new president and chief executive. \u001d  With GE Money's 25.4% equity stake and a brief to help the family-controlled Bank of Ayudhya expand beyond its strong corporate base and increase its consumer lending, Mr. Tan, 50 years old, took over the helm of the bank in March. His goal: to draw on his long experience in Asian banking, including stints in China with Citigroup's Citibank unit and in Hong Kong with Standard Chartered Bank, to help prime the Thai market for a new wave of consumer-credit products as it emerges from a period of political uncertainty that crested last September when a military coup ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. \u001d  Prior to the investment, GE Money and Bank of Ayudhya had been in a credit-card-issuing joint venture since February 2001. But of the Thai bank's customer base of more than 4.5 million people, only 14% of its loan portfolio currently comes from retail consumers. \"Consumer banking is still in its infancy in this country. The opportunities are huge,\" Mr. Tan says. \u001d  Mr. Tan, a Singaporean, says his compulsory two-and-a-half-year stint in his homeland's armed forces as a young man also helped him see the bigger picture. \"One of the things I picked up was the sense that to be successful, one has to be part of a bigger whole, which means everyone is part of a team,\" Mr. Tan says. It is something he is especially attuned to as a foreign chief executive working in a sector still tightly controlled by Thailand's banking authorities. \u001d  James Hookway spoke with Mr. Tan at Bank of Ayudhya's offices in Bangkok. \b \u001d  WSJ: When you were setting out in business, who gave you the best business advice? \u001d  Mr. Tan: Often, it's your customers who give you the best advice. As a banking professional, we speak our own language and we're proud of it when we're young. Everything we do is so micro, and we're so drilled in our own profession that we often forget what it is that the customer needs. I can remember time and time again when we suddenly stopped and said, \"Hey, wait a minute, this product we just designed isn't exactly what our customers want.\" That's why we believe in things like customer councils, spending time with clients. Friday in this bank is customers' day, which means no meetings: all seniors go out there and meet your clients. \b \u001d  WSJ: What about the master's degree in business administration? Is an M.B.A. worthwhile, or is it better to learn on the job? \u001d  Mr. Tan: No preference. I still believe that people should work before they do an M.B.A., to milk the most out of it. I'm persuading my daughter, who is a law graduate, to do an M.B.A. But she has to work a few years first, in the fund-management line. Having said that, I've gone out of my way to hire people without M.B.A.s. When I was at a Citibank, I brought in a chemist. I brought in an engineer. And I brought a genetic engineer into my product-development team for derivatives. It's about mixing the molecules to form a whole. \b \u001d  WSJ: What piece of knowledge do you wish every prospective employee knew? \u001d  Mr. Tan: Before we go into knowledge, I think that for banking, the most important criterion is integrity. That comes before knowledge. But for knowledge, hopefully they come in with a bit of entrepreneurial drive so it makes it easier for them to understand -- conceptually -- the difference between a balance sheet and a profit-and-loss statement, so they know how to run a business. \b \u001d  WSJ: What's your relationship with technology? Is there any particular gadget you depend on? \u001d  Mr. Tan: I've actually stopped using a BlackBerry. I was chained to a BlackBerry for the last five years. I simply refuse to have one. My boss called my secretary and said, \"Can you get him a BlackBerry?\" So I told my secretary to get one for Japan, because it doesn't work here. The most critical thing in technology is the mobile phone. I use SMS [text messaging] more often than the BlackBerry because it's instantaneous. And it forces you to keep your message short and to the point. \b \u001d  WSJ: Have you ever had a difficult boss, and what's the best way of dealing with that situation? \u001d  Mr. Tan: I'm sure we've all come across that. But it's important to understand where they are coming from. Once you understand their rationale, it's a lot easier to deal with the situation and hopefully find a solution to it. \b \u001d  WSJ: What's the most difficult decision you've had to make as a manager? \u001d  Mr. Tan: I feel awkward talking about this. It was a decision on whether I should spend time with my mum in her last few days, while at the same time dealing with a retrenchment of more than 200 people in Hong Kong. My decision still haunts me today. The decision I made was that the doctors were the best people to help my mother, and I was needed by my 200 staff because they needed to be outplaced. I called my contacts in the industry and I tried to get them employed. Within three weeks we had 40% of the 200 placed out. Within six months, I think we only had two guys left without a job, and one of them had set up his own consultancy. \b \u001d  WSJ: How difficult is it to keep costs under control and foresee the end of a business cycle? \u001d  Mr. Tan: Everybody wants their fair share of departmental growth during a boom period, even if the managers know they're going to have to retrench. But if I'm tightening my belt [during good times] and my neighbor is not, when it comes to indiscriminate retrenchment, my guys will be hit as well. Why should they suffer during the good days and suffer during the bad days, when the neighboring department enjoys the good days? So that is the mindset we need to break. There are processes we should adopt to do that: a capacity-planning model to manage the growth of our businesses in relation to predicted future growth. \u001d  The moment that predicted future growth takes place, there are steps we need to put into place. You keep tweaking your organization chart. It's important to work on the productivity side too, so that less manpower is required. We can automate some processes and simplify, simplify, simplify. That, I think, could help prevent this ballooning, as we call it. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 17:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

`Widgets'","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T23:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NLN.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","MOV"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Emily Steel \u001d  A study of attitudes about online advertising shows that, not surprisingly, preteens and teenagers don't like banner ads and other interruptions from marketers. But the study found that in the right circumstances kids enjoy playing with ad-related features on their personal pages in social-networking Web sites. \u001d  The study is likely to prove useful for marketers trying to reach today's generation of children. It is likely to fuel a push by digital ad agencies to get marketers to experiment with new ways to advertise on social-networking sites such as Facebook and News Corp.'s MySpace. \u001d  In particular, the study's findings may boost advertisers' use of \"widgets,\" which are small, easily downloaded computer programs that allow Web pages to be more sophisticated and interactive, with, say, animated graphics, videos, photo sharing, music or live chats. Media companies are rapidly recognizing the value of offering widgets to young people to make their content available online. And advertisers are starting to sponsor widget-based content as a way of spreading their marketing message or luring people to their Web sites. \u001d  Based on responses to an online survey of more than 1,200 children ages 9 to 17 and about 1,000 parents across the country, the study found that children don't want ads posted on their social-network profiles without their permission, says Samantha Skey, executive vice president of strategic marketing at Alloy Media + Marketing. Alloy based its research on a study conducted by Bethesda, Md., market researcher Grunwald Associates LLC. \u001d  \"Kids have come to view [social-network profile pages] as their yearbook page. It's their collage. It's very personal,\" says Ms. Skey. \u001d  Children will, however, choose to post logos or promotions from advertisers on their personal pages if marketers give them an incentive, whether it is coupons and giveaways or entertaining tools, such as games, video, and animated characters. The study found that 20% of teens added content from a marketer onto their personal Web sites in the last month. \u001d  Widgets don't give advertisers any control over the type of content they'll appear alongside. But because they give consumers control, they likely fit what kids are looking for, based on the Grunwald study's findings. \"The concept [of widgets] is simple. We are not going to push something in front of your screen. We are not going to annoy you. You choose what you want to engage with,\" says Chris Cunningham, vice president of advertising sales at Freewebs, a Silver Spring, Md.-based company that makes widgets for advertisers. \u001d  To promote the film \"The Golden Compass,\" scheduled to hit theaters in December, New Line Cinema is running a site that lets users create a virtual \"daemon\" -- an animal spirit discussed in the film -- to post to their blog or MySpace pages, to add to their instant-message profile or to share with friends. Thus far, 200,000 people have created daemons and four million people interacted with them online, according to New Line Cinema, a Time Warner company. \u001d  Widgets have \"so much buzz now and every advertiser wants to do a widget,\" says Marc Fireman, head of digital media for Reebok, which sponsored a widget six months ago. Widgets can include a link back to the advertiser's Web site, which adds to their attractiveness for marketers. \u001d  Still, popularity of widgets doesn't always translate into sales. To promote the film \"Hoot,\" about middle-school students who take on land developers trying to build in an area where owls live, New Line Cinema last year created a program that let people download an animated pet owl to their desktops from the movie's Web site. Web users downloaded more than a million of the critters, which walk around the desktop screen, but the film was a disappointment at the box office. \u001d  \"The first thing you want to do is somehow engage a consumer. Does engagement equal conversion? Not necessarily,\" says Gordon Paddison, executive vice president of new media marketing at New Line. \"But just as with any component of marketing, media promotion, publicity and online strategy you have to find the magic sauce.\" \u001d  For social-networking sites, widgets have a big downside. Because of the way widgets are used -- by consumers posting the applications wherever they want -- the social networking sites can miss out on any ad revenue even when the widgets are on the site's pages. Advertisers pay only the widget maker, usually technology firms. \u001d  Indeed, MySpace says it can block widgets from its site for \"commercial endeavors except those that are specifically endorsed or approved by MySpace.com.\" This includes carrying ads -- as well as for other reasons such as infringing copyrights. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 19:44 ET (23:44

product up front. \u001d  A spokesman for the OFT said Sunday that a letter was sent to companies last week \"expressing concern about advertising and pricing.\" \u001d  The letter followed a failure by travel companies to comply with an OFT ruling to ensure all advertised prices included hidden costs such as supplementary fuel or flight charges by an agreed deadline of the end of May. \u001d  The deadline has now been extended to the end of July after the OFT wasn't satisfied with the response to the ruling. A spokesman said the OFT had been hoping firms would sign up to a voluntary agreement to comply with the ruling, but that it would pursue court proceedings if necessary. \u001d  It is awaiting responses from the travel industry and will make a decision as to whether or not to pursue court action next week. \u001d  The Sunday Telegraph reported Sunday that Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYA.DB) and Thomas Cook Group PLC (TCG.LN) were among the firms who weren't yet complying with the ruling. \b \u001d  -By Molly Dover, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-207-842-9358; molly.dover@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 06:49 ET (10:49 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5c5de364a04d7b1fc4f73974092c252f","symR":["1024251.FR","ATK.LN","BBD.A.T","BBD.B.T","BBY.LN","BDRBF","CA0977511017","CA0977512007","FR0010242511","GB0000608009","GB0000961622"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Ferrovial Could Replace Metronet As Tube Operator - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T12:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1024251.FR","ATK.LN","BBD.A.T","BBD.B.T","BBY.LN","BDRBF","CA0977511017","CA0977512007","FR0010242511","GB0000608009","GB0000961622"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","CON","ELC","ICS","SVC","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Spanish infrastructure company Ferrovial could replace the Metronet consortium as operator of the London Underground transport system, the Independent on Sunday reports citing Ferrovial chairman Rafael del Pino. \u001d  Del Pino said Ferrovial has held talks with Transport for London about taking on Metronet projects, the newspaper says.

Hurt by high commodity prices, growth has lately stalled. Last year's profit was up less than 1% from a year earlier. Colgate's stock price is flat compared with the beginning of the year after soaring 34% from May 2005 to the end of 2006. \u001d  On Wall Street, some investors are worried about the company's ability to sustain growth in developing markets such as Latin America and whether it has enough new products under development. The last big breakthrough was the high-end toothpaste Colgate Total, introduced in 1997. \u001d  So far, the 55-year old Mr. Cook -- Mr. Mark's chief lieutenant for the past couple of years -- has done little to assuage their concerns. His message to Wall Street has been that he will maintain business as usual, hardly what some observers hoped to hear. \u001d  \"We were disappointed,\" said Ali Dibadj, senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. \"In any company there are improvements to be made, and you always want to hear those.\" \u001d  He noted Mr. Cook won't have the same opportunities as did Mr. Mark to generate growth by expanding overseas. \"Eastern Europe is full of other competitors, and so is China and India -- Colgate doesn't have open green fields to build in anymore,\" Mr. Dibadj noted. The company said Mr. Cook wasn't available for an interview. \u001d  Colgate is facing a re-energized competitor in Crest toothpaste parent Procter & Gamble Co., whose purchase of Gillette in late 2005 added the Oral-B toothbrush brand to its portfolio. P&G has been spending heavily on marketing new oral-care products, such as Crest Pro-Health, aimed squarely at Total. \u001d  Mr. Cook has had other issues to grapple with. Colgate's premium pet-food products Hill's Science Diet and Hill's Prescription Diet were included in the recall of dog-and-cat foods contaminated with melamine. Last month, counterfeit versions of Colgate toothpaste tainted with the poison diethylene glycol appeared in discount stores in a handful of U.S. states. Counterfeit toothpaste has also turned up in Canada, the Associated Press reported during the weekend. Testing didn't find the chemical but did show high levels of harmful bacteria. \u001d  Despite these challenges, analysts have noted the transition has been underway for a while, helping to minimize any disruptions. Mr. Cook, who is British, has spent more than 30 years at Colgate and became chief operating officer in 2004. He was picked to succeed Mr. Mark in February of last year, over two internal rivals. Colgate's four-year restructuring plan, which has included job cuts, factory closures and an increase in marketing, is understood by many to be the work of Mr. Cook. \"Ian has been warming up the car for a while,\" said Dave Hardie, a managing director at Herbert Mines Associates. \u001d  During the past few years, Mr. Mark, who will remain chairman for as long as 18 months, has increasingly let Mr. Cook take the spotlight in investor presentations and earnings conference calls, building the perception that he has been largely running the day-to-day operations. \u001d  Mr. Cook has a reserved, soft-spoken demeanor -- a stark contrast with the rapier wit of Mr. Mark -- though he is known for an occasional wry, deadpan remark. While Mr. Mark relished the role of corporate cheerleader, Mr. Cook's leadership style is quiet but forceful, said people who have worked with him. \u001d  That a gentler-mannered leader is replacing a loudly charismatic one follows a broader leadership trend emerging in corporate America, said Melanie Kusin, a vice chairman at executive-search firm Heidrick & Struggles, noting other well-known, mild-mannered chief executives including Mike Ullman of J.C. Penney Co., Jim McNerney of Boeing Co. and A.G. Lafley of P&G. \u001d  \"Reuben is an icon, he's brilliant, and he's earned the right to have his own idiosyncricity,\" said Ms. Kusin. \"Now we're in an era of humility.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 19:47 ET (23:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5ebd7950f61ddca1e1f25c9ef9295d43","symR":["FWY.LN","GB0003324794"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Fayrewood plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FWY.LN","GB0003324794"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR"],"Story":"\u001d  Fayrewood plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0003324794 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:54 ET (07:54 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5eeddaa09c11f7a5cc2855c026b1c1df","symR":["JSAIY","SBRY.LN","GB00B019KW72"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for J Sainsbury plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JSAIY","SBRY.LN","GB00B019KW72"],"IndustryCodes":["FDR","RTS","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\u001d  J Sainsbury plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B019KW72 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:21 ET (08:21 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5efa35f437fdda0075827418d4fe644b","symR":["SU","SU.T","CA8672291066"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for ProShares UltraShort Industrials (SU)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SU","SU.T","CA8672291066"],"IndustryCodes":["CHC","CHM","OIL","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  ProShares UltraShort Industrials (SU): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=SU or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:19 ET (09:19 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5f44ebee78c2b5066a914132da3bf6d3","symR":["CLST.LN","GB00B1H0K107"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Collins Stewart Tullett plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CLST.LN","GB00B1H0K107"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Collins Stewart Tullett plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B1H0K107 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:36 ET (07:36 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5f6b722b5957e7f2b969cf3568f8bce6","symR":["GB0008280538"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Corus Group PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GB0008280538"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  Corus Group PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0008280538 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:37 ET (07:37 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5f9a3464bf37296cdca0c67d0950a73a","symR":["ECF"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Ellsworth Fund Ltd.

CFRA, with just 45 employees and undisclosed revenues, is small but well regarded for providing early warning signals about companies that later have fallen into financial trouble, for instance subprime mortgage lender New Century Financial Corp. and telecommunications company Worldcom. \u001d  The deal is the latest for RiskMetrics, a New York risk management firm that was spun off from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) in 1998 and is building a stable of research and analysis services for institutional investors. Last November, RiskMetrics paid $553 million to buy ISS, the largest U.S. firm advising shareholders how to vote on corporate matters like mergers and board elections. \u001d  \"Ultimately this is about doing research for institutional clients,\" said Ethan Berman, chief executive officer of RiskMetrics. \"At the core, RiskMetrics Group is a research organization. CFRA is truly a research organization, and they are targeting same client base of institutional investors and asset owners.\" \u001d  RiskMetrics, with 900 employees and annual revenue of $210 million, has been in talks with investment bankers in recent months about the possibility of taking the company public. \u001d  CFRA is majority owned by private-equity firm TA Associates, which invested $60 million in the company in 2003. Berman wouldn't discuss the details of the acquisition, but a person familiar with the situation said RiskMetrics paid cash and stock worth slightly more than $65 million. Officials from TA Associates couldn't be immediately reached for comment. \u001d  Berman said RiskMetrics is thinking of further expanding with services that would help investors understand opaque investments such as hedge funds, real estate and private equity, which have been attracting greater commitments of resources from investors such as pension funds. \u001d  \"I think there are areas of financial markets that can become more transparent. I think I see more and more products from us providing that transparency,\" said Berman. \u001d  -By Kaja Whitehouse, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2243; kaja.whitehouse@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END)

\u001d  (This article was originally published Saturday.) \b \u001d  PATTAYA (Dow Jones)--Star Petroleum Refining Co., or SPRC, is expected to launch its initial public offering by the end of this year, said Prasert Bunsumpun, president of PTT PCL (PTT.TH), Thailand's oil and gas giant, adding that PTT plans to partially divest its 36% stake in the company. \u001d  \"We've decided we would divest some stake in SPRC via the share offering,\" Prasert told reporters late Friday. \u001d  Earlier, PTT considered selling its stake to U.S.-based Chevron Corp. (CVX), which currently owns a 64% stake in SPRC, or swap its stake for a share of Chevron's upstream petroleum business overseas. \u001d  SPRC is expected to raise THB20 billion from the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Its market capitalization is estimated to be worth THB60 billion, Prasert said. \u001d  After the IPO, PTT's ownership in SPRC would decline to 25%, while that of Chevron will be cut to 45%. PTT would further divest its stake in its refinery affiliate afterwards, Prasert said. \u001d  Under its agreement with the government, SPRC is required to list on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in an exchange for obtaining a refinery license. \u001d  SPRC is operating a 150,000 barrel-per-day refinery in the country's eastern seaboard area. \b \u001d  -By Supunnabul Suwannakij, Dow Jones

moved a step closer to opening offices outside of Europe after its secondary buyout of global satellites operator Intelsat for $16.4 billion last month. \u001d  People close to the U.K.-based private equity firm, which declined to comment, said it had the capability to operate globally but had not decided whether it needed a network of offices in the wake of the Intelsat deal. \u001d  Such a move would be similar to those by local peers Apax Partners, Permira and CVC Capital Partners, which in January hired Chris Stadler to head up its U.S. office. \u001d  Led by managing partner Raymond Svider, Bermuda-based Intelsat is BC's largest deal and the fifth-biggest by a single financial sponsor. \u001d  Out of the $5 billion payment for the equity value, BC is leading a group taking 76% of Intelsat but will invest less than $1 billion of its funds. Credit Suisse, which also advised Intelsat, and Banc of America Securities are arranging an equity bridge facility for part of the deal's funding. \u001d  These two banks plus Morgan Stanley are arranging $5.1 billion debt to support the secondary buyout. After $1.26 billion of existing debt is retired, Intelsat's net debt will increase by about $3.85 billion to more than $15 billion. Its debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization is expected to be less than nine times. \u001d  BC is understood to want to continue with the stated integration of Intelsat and PanAmSat, which are seen as having too many satellites, and maintain the agreed capital spending program set by David McGlade, the portfolio company's well-regarded chief executive. \u001d  Web

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Tom Wright \u001d  JAKARTA -- Altria Group Inc.'s Philip Morris International will launch a clove-flavored cigarette in Indonesia under the Marlboro name as part of an effort by the U.S. tobacco company to push its premium brand in the world's fifth-largest cigarette market by volume. \u001d  In 2005, Philip Morris bought a controlling stake in PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna, a firm founded in East Java in 1913 and a leading producer of sweet clove, or kretek, cigarettes that account for 90% of the Indonesian market. The deal, valued at $5.2 billion, was the largest done in Indonesia by a foreign investor. \u001d  Since the 1980s, Philip Morris has been selling traditional cigarettes, known in Indonesia as \"whites,\" under the Marlboro brand. Despite carving out a 50% share of the small market for white cigarettes, the Marlboro name remains less known than many popular kretek brands. \u001d  Philip Morris is hoping to give a boost to the Marlboro brand through kreteks. The new product, called Marlboro Mix 9, will be unveiled tomorrow by Sampoerna. \u001d  Like many big tobacco firms, Philip Morris has been looking to diversify revenue away from core markets in the U.S., Europe and Japan. While fewer people are smoking in many Western nations, amid tighter advertising regulations on cigarettes and widespread smoking bans in public places, developing markets such as Indonesia remain a flourishing market for tobacco firms. \u001d  There are almost no restrictions on tobacco advertising in Indonesia. While ads in the media can't show people actually smoking, there are few rules banning the use of brand names in campaigns on television, print or at music concerts. There is no law setting a minimum age for smokers. \u001d  About two-thirds of adult males smoke in Indonesia according to some estimates, compared with 24% in the U.S. Indonesians last year smoked 228 billion sticks, putting the country behind China, the U.S., Russia and Japan. \u001d  Kretek, named for the crackling sound cloves make when burned, was developed in the late 19th century in Central Java. Modern kretek contain significantly higher levels of nicotine and tar than white cigarettes. The Marlboro kretek contains 1.8 milligrams of nicotine and 30 milligrams of tar; by comparison, a regular full-flavored Marlboro cigarette in the U.S. contains 1.1 milligrams of nicotine and 15 milligrams of tar. \u001d  Philip Morris says there is no evidence that kretek are more harmful than regular cigarettes, but it adds there is no such thing as a safe cigarette. \u001d  Subash Salunke, acting head of the World Health Organization's office in Indonesia, says the launch of new brands shows there is a growing market for cigarettes in a nation where the high number of smokers already is a concern. \"Anything that is going to increase the number of smokers is not good for the public health,\" he said. \u001d  With a huge number of kretek brands available, Martin King, Sampoerna's president director, acknowledges it will be tough for the Marlboro product to carve out market share. Last year, 500 brands were launched in Indonesia, but they took only 1% of the market, according to Mr. King. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 19:45 ET (23:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"69126502a64a258c2ce98ae36d2727ed","symR":["PDLI"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for PDL BioPharma Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PDLI"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  PDL BioPharma Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=PDLI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"692bc95e19d149e083d15a9e1adb7f68","symR":["ETV"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunity Fund (ETV)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ETV"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunity Fund (ETV): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=ETV or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:04 ET (08:04 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"6934dffeb2f321c428d92e721bb21fdd","symR":["CSH.LN","GB00B0358H47"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Caspian Holdings PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CSH.LN","GB00B0358H47"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS"],"Story":"\u001d  Caspian Holdings PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B0358H47 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:28 ET (07:28 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"69a31e091deb3ebc22646cb7c3349ea5","symR":["5232.TO","5411.TO","8002.TO","8267.TO","8591.TO","9003.TO","9020.TO","9513.TO","AONNY","IX","MARUY","JP3200450009","JP3316400005","JP3386030005","JP3388200002","JP3400900001","JP3551200003","JP3783600004","JP3877600001"],"date":"2007-07-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9920635,0.9909989,0.9994012,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.921164,0.9254299,1.098802,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Germany KfW, JR East, Others Register Bond Shelf At Japan MOF","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-02T00:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5232.TO","5411.TO","8002.TO","8267.TO","8591.TO","9003.TO","9020.TO","9513.TO","AONNY","IX","MARUY","JP3200450009","JP3316400005","JP3386030005","JP3388200002","JP3400900001","JP3551200003","JP3783600004","JP3877600001"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","DIB","ELC","FIS","RTB","RTS","STL","SVC","TAT","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, AIG-FP Capital Funding Corp., East Japan Railway Co.

The two unions have called for wage increases of up to 7% for some 134,000 employees. \u001d  Deutsche Bahn last week offered a more modest 2% increase next January, followed by another 2% in July 2009, and one-time extra payments of EUR300 ($400) to cover the rest of this year. The unions promptly rejected the offer. \u001d  Deutsche Bahn has argued that as many as 9,000 jobs would be endangered by an excessive wage increase. \u001d  The third union, GDL, is seeking wage increases of up to 31% for some of its members. It wants a separate deal with Deutsche Bahn, which has rejected that idea. \u001d  The German government is currently preparing plans to sell up to half of Deutsche Bahn in what would be the country's last big privatization. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 08:21 ET (12:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Matthew Karnitschnig \u001d  The Bancroft family may own a controlling stake in Dow Jones & Co., but the final decision on whether to sell the publisher of The Wall Street Journal to Rupert Murdoch could well be made by a small circle of longtime family lawyers in downtown Boston. \u001d  Lawyers from Hemenway & Barnes sit at the center of dozens of overlapping trusts that hold power over most of the Bancrofts' 64% voting stake in the company. Those lawyers occupy two of the three trustee seats on a number of key trusts, with the third held by a family member. On one of the biggest trusts, lawyers from the firm are the only trustees. And the fact that the large Bancroft clan is divided over whether to sell further deepens the firm's influence. \u001d  \"The vote really resides with them,\" says one family member who is leaning in favor of selling the company. \u001d  Hemenway & Barnes's involvement could make approval of the deal swift if negotiators for Mr. Murdoch's News Corp. and Dow Jones agree on price. Even with 35 adult Bancroft family members still squabbling over whether to sell, less than half of the family's shares would likely be required to win approval for a deal. \u001d  That's because holders of most of the shares not in family hands -- about 36% of Dow Jones's voting power -- will likely want to take advantage of the rich premium and cash out. Approval would require a simple majority of the outstanding shares. (The Ottaway family, which controls about 7% of the shareholder vote, is expected to oppose a sale. Some shareholders will likely not vote at all, meaning that Mr. Murdoch can probably count on non-Bancrofts for 20% to 25% of the total vote.) \u001d  Hemenway & Barnes lawyers sit as trustees on funds that control a majority of the family's stake in Dow Jones. The family's remaining share is held in other trusts or by individual family members. \u001d  Last week, Dow Jones and News Corp. agreed on a framework to safeguard the editorial integrity of the Journal and the company's other publications. Price negotiations remain to be completed, and the family is expected to be polled sometime after that. (Mr. Murdoch has said that he won't go above his $60-a-share offer, a 67% premium above the stock price before the offer became public.) \u001d  Michael B. Elefante, a senior Hemenway & Barnes partner who serves as the family's lead trustee and represents them on Dow Jones's board and in the News Corp. talks, is perceived as a \"seller\" by some other company directors. His position on the sale will be crucial because a number of family members rely on him for guidance. \u001d  \"If Elefante tells them that the agreement on editorial independence can be enforced and the principles are protected, they'll support him,\" said another family member who is leaning in favor of a sale. \u001d  Mr. Elefante has disputed the notion that he has already decided to sell, noting that there is a difference between listening to Mr. Murdoch's offer and supporting a sale to the media tycoon. \u001d  \"There are 35 adult family members who have 35 points of view,\" Mr. Elefante said. \"We've tried to be fair to all the family members by giving each of them all the information they need to make a good decision.\" \u001d  As the family's legal representative, Mr. Elefante likely would be reluctant to go against the family's wishes if a large portion of them oppose the deal. While trustees don't legally have to consult the beneficiaries of a trust before acting, ignoring their wishes might expose them to litigation. What's more, the Hemenway & Barnes trustees do not have to vote in concert. Mr. Elefante is expected to poll the family before deciding how the trusts would vote on a sale, a person close to him said. \u001d  The earliest Bancroft trusts date back to the mid-1930s. They were established for the three grandchildren of Clarence Barron, a Dow Jones correspondent in Boston who purchased the company in 1902 for $130,000. \u001d  In many cases, trusts are used to protect the property interests of minors until they reach maturity or to protect an asset from being sold. But they are also employed by wealthy families to pass businesses and other assets from one generation to the next without incurring a big tax bill. The legal instruments that hold most of the Bancrofts' shares in Dow Jones are so-called generation-skipping trusts, a structure used to protect assets from taxation. \u001d  Since Mr. Murdoch's offer, the original trusts and their offshoots are valued at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the situation. Over the years, the trusts have been diversified and today less than half of their assets are invested in Dow Jones. Each of the three branches holds about one-third of the supervoting Class B shares that ensure the family control of the company. \u001d  The children of the original beneficiaries, known as the \"upper generation,\" are entitled to automatic disbursements from the trusts, which come mainly in the form of annual dividends from Dow Jones stock and other investments. Eight of the nine original members of the upper generation are still living and range in age from their 50s to their 70s. \u001d  Much of the cash disbursed to the children of the upper generation, however, is at the discretion of the trustees. In most cases, this \"lower generation\" is entitled to the principal after their parents die and will be free to sell the assets. It is primarily the members of the lower generation, ranging from their 20s to their 50s, who have agitated for a sale of Dow Jones. They have chafed at the disparity in the income from the trusts and other money issues. \u001d  The family fortune is divided by branch so some heirs are entitled to a much smaller piece of the pie than others. For example, Leslie Hill, who has six siblings, will inherit just about 1/42nd of the total. Her cousin Hugh Griffiths, who has no siblings, stands to inherit 1/9th. \u001d  Some in the lower generation have been pushing for changes in the way the trusts are managed, according to people familiar with the matter. One issue is the composition of the trustees. For years, Charles A. Meyer, a now-deceased Sears executive and longtime family friend, served on the main trusts. That gave the Bancrofts a family member and an ally running many of the trusts. After Mr. Meyer's retirement in the 1980s, however, he was replaced by a Hemenway & Barnes trustee or not at all. No one complained at the time. \u001d  Hemenway & Barnes, which specialized in trusts, was hired by the family in the 1940s. The only way a trustee can be removed is through the courts. \u001d  While Mr. Elefante and his colleagues have shown a willingness to take the wishes of the lower generation into account, the voice of the upper generation has carried more weight, some in the family say. Members of the upper generation sit as trustees on the key trusts with the votes to decide Dow Jones's fate. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 23:08 ET (03:08 GMT)\u001d

Instead, Universal, the world's largest music company by market share, hopes to go to a short-term sales agreement rather than a contract that lasted more than a year. \u001d  Though it is unlikely to have sweeping effects immediately, such a change could give Universal more flexibility in its dealings with competitors to iTunes. For instance, it could enable the company to more easily switch gears and offer exclusive rights to parts of its catalog to other digital-download stores. \u001d  An Apple spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on \"rumors and speculation.\" \u001d  Universal's move comes against a backdrop of significant change in the way music is sold. Traditional music retailers have fallen by the wayside, and the major labels have seen sales declines accelerate. Meanwhile, Apple has gained greater influence in music sales, recently becoming the No. 3 seller of recorded music to the public, behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Co. Its power has made record-label executives increasingly uneasy, as it has generally refused to comply with labels' desire for flexibility on matters such as pricing. \u001d  As a result, the record labels and Apple have traded barbs with one another over the past year or so, with Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs, for instance, calling record labels \"greedy.\" \u001d  Practically since the launch of the iTunes store in 2003, Apple and the four major record labels have been at loggerheads over two critical issues: pricing and the lack of so-called interoperability between downloads sold by iTunes competitors and Apple's popular iPod. Apple from the start insisted on selling all downloads for 99 cents each. Record labels wanted to sell some music for more, other music for less. In an effort to break that standoff, EMI Group PLC, the No. 3 music company in the world, recently reached agreements with Apple and other digital-music sellers to sell for $1.30 downloads that are interoperable. None of EMI's competitors have followed suit. \u001d  In another illustration of the tension between Apple and the music industry, Apple doesn't currently offer wireless downloads to its new iPhone or other wireless handsets. Currently, the iPhone can store only music that is loaded by a physical connection to a computer, or \"side loaded.\" But when asked about such a service in a recent interview, Mr. Jobs said, \"There's a lot of things you can imagine down the road.\" \u001d  Music companies generally consider the mobile market the next frontier for their business, and are loath to let Apple dominate it that market the way it has digital downloads. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 23:42 ET (03:42 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"76f741199dcff75ad8ab7a9ad0b17ffc","symR":["FRA"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Floating Rate Income Strategies Fund (FRA)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FRA"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  BlackRock Floating Rate Income Strategies Fund (FRA): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=FRA or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:23 ET (07:23 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"770e0a3e48b33514bf50f4224ec92cf0","symR":["AHCI"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Allied Healthcare International","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AHCI"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Allied Healthcare International: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=AHCI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:05 ET (07:05 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"775ebcccfafe947b85d777be58a14d88","symR":["AFN.LN","GB0002789591"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for ADVFN PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AFN.LN","GB0002789591"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\u001d  ADVFN PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0002789591 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:03 ET (07:03 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"776111c040c8526a7ee6b25812e13e01","symR":["IPT.LN","GB0033674564"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for ISIS Property Trust Ltd","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IPT.LN","GB0033674564"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI"],"Story":"\u001d  ISIS Property Trust Ltd: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0033674564 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:19 ET (08:19 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"778d458b46618bf5b8954190448dd099","symR":["VGM"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade Munis (VGM)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VGM"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade Munis (VGM): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=VGM or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:47 ET (09:47 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"77bb5744dfac5fe73917b99e12bd3549","symR":["GAM"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for General American Investors Co.

STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Mike Esterl in Frankfurt and David Crawford in Berlin \u001d  As a former captain of Austria's national volleyball team, Peter Loescher is used to performing under pressure. \u001d  He will need all of that cool and more in his new role as chief executive officer of Siemens AG, which is at the center of Europe's biggest corporate-corruption scandal. Today, the 49-year-old former Merck & Co. executive takes charge of Europe's largest engineering company by sales. He will have his hands full as he grapples with criminal probes that have sullied Siemens's image and raised the specter of costly fines and lawsuits. \u001d  At the same time, he must field investors' calls to accelerate a restructuring of the German conglomerate's far-flung assets to meet lofty profit targets and keep a recent share-price rally alive. \u001d  Mr. Loescher has held senior-management jobs at large companies on several continents but has never been a CEO. He is taking the helm of one of the world's most complex corporations. Siemens, based in Munich, makes goods that range from light bulbs to high-speed trains and medical scanners to wind turbines. In the fiscal year ended September, it booked 87 billion euros ($117.76 billion) in revenue. \u001d  He also represents the first outsider to head Siemens in its 160-year history and hasn't had much time to prepare. He was plucked from Merck in May to succeed Klaus Kleinfeld amid the fallout from a bribes-for-business scandal that erupted in November. Few people in Germany had heard of Mr. Loescher. \u001d  \"He's a black box,\" says Theo Kitz, a longtime Siemens analyst at German bank Merck Finck & Co. in Munich. Siemens said Mr. Loescher was unavailable for an interview. \u001d  Mr. Kleinfeld, a 20-year Siemens veteran, said in late April he would step down as chief executive after losing the support of board members. He has denied any wrongdoing, and he hasn't been named a suspect in any of the investigations. He did face criticism that top management didn't do enough to stamp out corruption. \u001d  Siemens said in December it had identified 420 million euros in suspicious payments spanning the previous seven years. German prosecutors suspect employees set up slush funds to bribe customers, and they have arrested several former and current Siemens executives in recent months. The U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also have started investigations. \u001d  Siemens is cooperating with authorities and has promised to beef up compliance. Those efforts remain a major work in progress. The company said last week that Daniel Noa is resigning as chief compliance officer after just half a year on the job. \u001d  In a statement, Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser thanked Mr. Noa for making \"a substantial and valuable contribution\" to expanding internal controls. According to a company official, however, Mr. Noa's 20 years of experience as a prosecutor of white-collar crime in Stuttgart did little to prepare him for implementing compliance procedures at a sprawling multinational company. Siemens declined to make Mr. Noa available for comment. \u001d  Another person involved in the compliance review at Siemens said the company in recent years has been very slow to replace compliance managers who failed to clamp down on alleged criminal activity. Paul Hobeck, the head of Siemens's legal department, will serve as chief compliance officer temporarily. \u001d  During his two and a half years at the helm, Mr. Kleinfeld won accolades from investors by selling unprofitable businesses such as wireless-telephone handsets and increasingly shifting the focus to three main areas: energy, health care and factory automation. Shortly before his departure, Siemens introduced ambitious profit margin targets for 2010. \u001d  Shareholders say a lot more can be done to better focus the company's portfolio and increase performance after Siemens emphasized size and market share over profits for many decades. In a recent report, the bank Dresdner Kleinwort said Siemens \"remains the largest restructuring story in capital goods.\" \u001d  One of Mr. Loescher's immediate tasks will be deciding how to proceed with VDO, the company's electronic-auto-parts unit. Siemens announced in January that it would sell a large minority stake in the unit, which booked 10 billion euros in revenue in the most recent fiscal year, through an initial public offering. Since then, Germany's Continental AG has indicated it would like to buy the whole unit, and other buyers have expressed interest. Siemens is proceeding with the IPO plan, slated for this autumn, while listening to offers. \u001d  The new CEO is no stranger to restructurings or conglomerates. As head of corporate planning at Hoechst AG during the 1990s, he helped transform the sprawling German conglomerate into a pharmaceuticals company. He joined New Jersey drug giant Merck in May of last year after senior management stints at U.K. medical-diagnostics firm Amersham PLC and General Electric Co. \u001d  Already, he is trying to limit expectations of rapid change at Siemens. Last week, Mr. Loescher told journalists there would be no \"revolution\" after he takes over. The company, he said, \"needs evolution.\" \u001d  Mr. Loescher will need to negotiate with many factions. Division heads at Siemens long have enjoyed more power than in most companies. He also will have to win the support of the nonexecutive supervisory board, which vets major decisions. Half of the board's 20 members are labor representatives.

And that could give the company's share price a nice run. \u001d  Known for its skate and surf wear, the Huntington Beach, Calif., company last month posted its first quarterly loss since 1992. The main reason: a foray into the ski business via the company's 2005 acquisition of Rossignol. The European brand, once seen as a growth opportunity, now seems to be dragging the company under the waves. \u001d  Rossignol, a mature company known for snowboards, skis and other so-called hard goods, was always viewed as an odd choice for Quiksilver, whose growth has thrived on apparel and lifestyle sportswear. What hope there was for the $305 million deal hinged on the combined company's bid to gain traction in the $47 billion-a-year outdoor market. \u001d  Then the weather changed for the worse. Last winter saw record-low snowfalls in both North America and Europe, drawing few skiers to the slopes and even fewer into stores. \u001d  Sales plummeted along with the stock price: Shares hit a 52-week low of $10.90 in March. The price has since recovered, with investors returning after solid performances by the company's apparel ventures, which include Roxy and DC shoes. \u001d  On Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Quiksilver's shares were up 44 cents to $14.13. The stock currently trades at about 16 times estimated per-share earnings for 2008, considered in line with its peers. \u001d  But the stock's recovery isn't enough to quell analysts who believe the Rossignol brand remains a near-certain liability for investors and the company. \u001d  Quiksilver is considering whether to backtrack completely by selling Rossignol. Any sale would undoubtedly be at a loss to what the company paid, but observers say it would nonetheless boost interest in the stock by removing a cloud hanging over the company, which has a market value of about $1.7 billion. \u001d  \"They are probably going to sell something, either all or part of Rossignol,\" says Jeff Mintz, a sportswear analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities. While Mr. Mintz agrees that the weather was a factor in the brand's seasonal stumble, he says the company would be better to leave the ski business rather than chance another bad winter. He gives the stock a \"hold\" rating. \u001d  Quiksilver itself has hinted that it may be looking for a pathway off the slopes. During a conference call last month, Quiksilver Chief Executive Robert McKnight Jr. indicated that he is now considering \"all the strategic possibilities\" for its flagging brand. \u001d  \"We're looking at every possible alternative concerning the hard goods,\" he said. \"Everything is on the table.\" \u001d  Regardless, Quiksilver already has made other moves meant to curtail the damage. It has set in motion significant production cuts for Rossignol, and, even before the difficult winter, it had begun steps to close a major factory in Europe, a move set to be finished this summer. Mr. McKnight also has trimmed Rossignol's presence on the Continent significantly, bringing its offices down to just three from 17. \u001d  Rossignol isn't the only Quiksilver brand that has been getting a bad rap on Wall Street. Cleveland Golf, the company's division that produces golf clubs among other products, had a revenue slump this quarter -- it was down 6% -- and it didn't go unnoticed. On Tuesday, Quiksilver announced that it would bring its stake in the company to 100% by acquiring remaining shares of Cleveland -- what analysts say is a likely prelude to a sale. \u001d  For Rossignol, Jeff Van Sinderen, an analyst at B. Riley, advocates selling the struggling hard-goods sector of Rossignol, but maintaining licensing rights to what Quiksilver does best: hawking apparel. Revenue growth was up across the board for Quiksilver's apparel brands, with Roxy showing 20% growth and DC shoes leaping forward 60%. Analysts see similar figures possible with better weather conditions and an apparel-only Rossignol. \u001d  If Quiksilver decides to sell off all of Rossignol, \"It certainly won't be what they paid for it,\" says Mr. Van Sinderen, who has a \"buy\" on the stock. \u001d  Quiksilver's equipment brands sustained a pretax loss of $50 million for the full fiscal year, ended Oct. 31. If the company were freed of Rossignol, however, retail analysts like Todd Slater of Lazard Capital Markets say they would be inclined to look on the stock more favorably. Mr. Slater already gives the stock a \"buy\" rating. \u001d  \"The risk-reward [ratio] would improve, the earnings would improve and the stock would likely appreciate on this type of news,\" Mr. Slater says. \u001d  Jennifer Black, an analyst with Jennifer Black & Associates of Portland, Ore., says any sale that would decrease the firm's vulnerability would make her feel more comfortable with the stock. \"The dependency of hard goods on the climate makes investors a bit nervous,\" she says. \"There are definite concerns out there about global warming and the question of if it's going to snow.\" She currently gives shares a \"buy\" rating. \u001d  Representatives of the firm wouldn't comment on potential decisions in the Quiksilver pipeline, though executives have publicly maintained support for the Rossignol brand. What is clear, however, is that the company's latest bid to expand beyond the horizons of its sun-drenched surfer crowd may have backfired. It caught the wrong wave. \u001d  \"I'm sure they'll never do something of this nature again,\" B. Riley's Mr. Van Sinderen says. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 23:00 ET (03:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

Full","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-02T02:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SI","SIE.XE","DE0007236101"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDAX","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Mike Esterl in Frankfurt and David Crawford in Berlin \u001d  As a former captain of Austria's national volleyball team, Peter Loescher is used to performing under pressure. \u001d  He will need all of that cool and more in his new role as chief executive officer of Siemens AG, which is at the center of Europe's biggest corporate-corruption scandal. Today, the 49-year-old former Merck & Co. executive takes charge of Europe's largest engineering company by sales. He will have his hands full as he grapples with criminal probes that have sullied Siemens's image and raised the specter of costly fines and lawsuits. \u001d  At the same time, he must field investors' calls to accelerate a restructuring of the German conglomerate's far-flung assets to meet lofty profit targets and keep a recent share-price rally alive. \u001d  Mr. Loescher has held senior-management jobs at large companies on several continents but has never been a CEO. He is taking the helm of one of the world's most complex corporations. Siemens, based in Munich, makes goods that range from light bulbs to high-speed trains and medical scanners to wind turbines. In the fiscal year ended September, it booked 87 billion euros ($117.76 billion) in revenue. \u001d  He also represents the first outsider to head Siemens in its 160-year history and hasn't had much time to prepare. He was plucked from Merck in May to succeed Klaus Kleinfeld amid the fallout from a bribes-for-business scandal that erupted in November. Few people in Germany had heard of Mr. Loescher. \u001d  \"He's a black box,\" says Theo Kitz, a longtime Siemens analyst at German bank Merck Finck & Co. in Munich. Siemens said Mr. Loescher was unavailable for an interview. \u001d  Mr. Kleinfeld, a 20-year Siemens veteran, said in late April he would step down as chief executive after losing the support of board members. He has denied any wrongdoing, and he hasn't been named a suspect in any of the investigations. He did face criticism that top management didn't do enough to stamp out corruption. \u001d  Siemens said in December it had identified 420 million euros in suspicious payments spanning the previous seven years. German prosecutors suspect employees set up slush funds to bribe customers, and they have arrested several former and current Siemens executives in recent months. The U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also have started investigations. \u001d  Siemens is cooperating with authorities and has promised to beef up compliance. Those efforts remain a major work in progress. The company said last week that Daniel Noa is resigning as chief compliance officer after just half a year on the job. \u001d  In a statement, Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser thanked Mr. Noa for making \"a substantial and valuable contribution\" to expanding internal controls. According to a company official, however, Mr. Noa's 20 years of experience as a prosecutor of white-collar crime in Stuttgart did little to prepare him for implementing compliance procedures at a sprawling multinational company. Siemens declined to make Mr. Noa available for comment. \u001d  Another person involved in the compliance review at Siemens said the company has been very slow to replace compliance managers who held compliance responsibilities in recent years, when the alleged criminal activity took place. Paul Hobeck, the head of Siemens's legal department, will serve as chief compliance officer temporarily. \u001d  During his 2 1/2 years at the helm, Mr. Kleinfeld won accolades from investors by selling unprofitable businesses such as wireless-telephone handsets and increasingly shifting the focus to three main areas: energy, health care and factory automation. Shortly before his departure, Siemens introduced ambitious profit margin targets for 2010. \u001d  Shareholders say a lot more can be done to better focus the company's portfolio and increase performance after Siemens emphasized size and market share over profits for many decades. In a recent report, the bank Dresdner Kleinwort said Siemens \"remains the largest restructuring story in capital goods.\" \u001d  One of Mr. Loescher's immediate tasks will be deciding how to proceed with VDO, the company's electronic-auto-parts unit. Siemens announced in January that it would sell a large minority stake in the unit, which booked 10 billion euros in revenue in the most recent fiscal year, through an initial public offering. Since then, Germany's Continental AG has indicated it would like to buy the whole unit, and other buyers have expressed interest. Siemens is proceeding with the IPO plan, slated for this autumn, while listening to offers. \u001d  The new CEO is no stranger to restructurings or conglomerates. As head of corporate planning at Hoechst AG during the 1990s, he helped transform the sprawling German conglomerate into a pharmaceuticals company. He joined New Jersey drug giant Merck in May of last year after senior management stints at U.K. medical-diagnostics firm Amersham PLC and General Electric Co. \u001d  Already, he is trying to limit expectations of rapid change at Siemens. Last week, Mr. Loescher told journalists there would be no \"revolution\" after he takes over. The company, he said, \"needs evolution.\" \u001d  Mr. Loescher will need to negotiate with many factions. Division heads at Siemens long have enjoyed more power than in most companies.

Entrepreneur Anil Agarwal and his family own 54% of Vedanta, a metals and mining company that's listed on the London Stock Exchange and has the bulk of its assets in India. \u001d  Vedanta owns a majority of Sterlite, India's biggest nonferrous metals and mining company by sales. Mr. Agarwal is Vedanta's executive chairman and Sterlite's nonexecutive chairman. One brother, Navin, is deputy executive chairman of Vedanta and executive vice chairman of Sterlite. \u001d  It's common for large Indian companies to be family-controlled. Technology giant Wipro is 81%-owned by Chairman Azim Premji and his family. Another metal company, Essar Steel, is 87%-owned by the Ruia family. \u001d  As long as the interests of a family and of other shareholders align, there's usually little conflict. In the case of the Vedanta group, many shareholders say Mr. Agarwal and family have delivered superb returns. The companies have also delivered surprises that not everyone welcomed. \u001d  When Vedanta listed in London in December 2003, it said one of its aims was to consolidate its group structure by increasing direct ownership in subsidiaries. Yet Sterlite in June listed $2 billion of American depositary shares on the New York Stock Exchange -- doing just the opposite and reducing direct ownership. When Vedanta unveiled the Sterlite fund-raising plan last November, Vedanta's share price dropped 7%, though it later recovered. Vedanta's pre-issue holding in Sterlite has dropped to slightly more than 60% from 75.9%. \u001d  \"It's certainly a change of strategy\" said Charles Kernot, a mining analyst at Seymour Pierce, a London-based investment bank and broker that hasn't done work for Vedanta or Sterlite and doesn't own shares in either. \u001d  A Vedanta spokesman said in an email that the company has delivered on its goal of consolidating the group structure, such as through an earlier Sterlite rights issue, and that consolidation remains a main element of its strategy. Vedanta bought shares in an earlier Sterlite rights issue, thereby increasing its holding. \u001d  Moreover, a Vedanta spokeswoman added, the Sterlite ADS was needed in order for the company to exercise an option to increase its shareholding in Indian zinc producer Hindustan Zinc and move into commercial power-generation. Both that option and the power business run under Sterlite, not Vedanta. \u001d  \"These investments will be value and earnings accretive to Sterlite shareholders and by extension Vedanta shareholders,\" she said. The spokeswoman added that Vedanta met major shareholders to explain the ADS rationale, and many \"decided to participate.\" The Agarwal family's holding company, Volcan Investments, doesn't own any Sterlite shares, so \"consequently the interests of the Agarwal family and public shareholders are totally aligned through their ownership of Vedanta,\" she noted. \u001d  \"You want to be sure that the family's interests are in line with the other shareholders,\" said Graham Birch, head of the natural resources team in London at BlackRock MLIM, a New York investment-management company. BlackRock owns Vedanta shares and the Sterlite ADS but Mr. Birch declined to say how many. He added that \"on the whole, we've seen reasonable alignment of interest\" with the family and their experiences \"have been good ones.\" \u001d  \"We like the entrepreneurial character of this management team and that's why we backed the Sterlite ADS issue,\" Mr. Birch added. He said his fund could buy Sterlite's New York issue, so \"our economic interest was unaffected.\" For those that couldn't buy, such as funds that aren't permitted to invest in stocks outside the U.K., \"you might feel that your interest had been slightly diluted,\" he said. \u001d  Shares of Vedanta closed Friday at 1,615 pence ($32.42) and have gained 32% so far in 2007. Since a year ago, Sterlite's shares have risen 44%, closing Friday at 585.10 rupees ($14.44). The Sterlite ADS, meanwhile, hasn't soared. Priced at $13.44, it ended its first day of trading at $14.70 and closed Friday at $14.67. \u001d  Both companies have prospered from the mining and metals boom fueled by growth in Asia's large economies. Vedanta's revenue rose 76% to $6.5 billion in the year ended March 31; Sterlite's rose 96% to 244 billion rupees. \u001d  \"We feel there's a lot of value left in the company,\" says Vishal Chandak, analyst at Emkay Share and Stock Brokers in Mumbai. He likes its plans for power production and management's record of reinvesting in the business. Mr. Chandak has a \"buy\" on Sterlite's shares and a 12-month target price of 670 rupees. Emkay has no investment-banking relationship with the company. \u001d  Not every opportunity Mr. Agarwal pursues has done well. Last year, Vedanta bought all of Sterlite Gold, a Toronto-listed company in which the Agarwals had a 55% stake. It hasn't produced gold since earlier this year after its mining operations were suspended in a disagreement with the Armenian government. Vedanta is now considering now selling the business. \u001d  \"This was not an ideal acquisition for the group,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note May 15. Still, Deutsche rates Vedanta shares a \"buy,\" saying after a recent iron ore deal \"Vedanta is emerging as a true global player, against the backdrop of a strong commodity price environment.\" Efforts to confirm if Deutsche Bank has an investment banking relationship with Vedanta or Sterlite, or own shares in either, weren't immediately successful. \u001d  Mr. Agarwal, 55 years old, has said he wants to turn Vedanta into the CVRD of India -- a reference to Brazilian mining company Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, which produces various commodities and is the world's biggest iron-ore producer. He also plans to move into nuclear power when the Indian government clarifies its policy on commercial production. In April, Vedanta bought 51% of Indian iron-ore outfit Sesa Goa for $981 million, adding to a suite that includes copper, aluminum and zinc. \u001d  Fans of the shares say expansion makes sense. Both Vedanta and Sterlite have low mining costs, analysts say. Amid a boom, most mining companies are grappling with rising costs, as they compete for supplies, such as tires for trucks. Equally, Vedanta and Sterlite have a strong record of delivering large construction projects -- such as smelters -- on time and on budget. \u001d  \"There's very, very few investment vehicles that we can use to get exposure to India,\" said Mr. Birch, adding \"We like the management of both companies, which is obviously very similar.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  Vibhuti Agarwal contributed to this

Stock Market Quarterly Review: Blackstone Leads Robust IPOs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-02T01:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BX","EMG.LN","FIG","GB00B16BRD58"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","FIS","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Yvonne Ball \u001d  Blackstone Group's $4.75 billion initial public offering highlighted a strong second quarter in the new-issues market as the number of deals and money raised exceeded last year's totals. \u001d  The private-equity giant's stock-market debut June 22 and last week's seven offerings took the number of companies that went public on U.S. exchanges in the second quarter, excluding real-estate investment trusts and special-purpose acquisition companies, to 56, according to data tracker Dealogic. That is a 22% jump from last year's second quarter. \u001d  It increases the number of IPOs this year to 104, up from 89 in the first six months of 2006. \u001d  Blackstone's IPO was among the largest on Wall Street and one of the most talked about, in part because of the eye-popping payday it delivered to its executives. The offering, which was increased from $4.1 billion by the purchase of additional shares known as overallotments, lifted the money raised from second-quarter IPOs to $16.2 billion, more than the $11.2 billion raised in the second quarter last year. Blackstone co-founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman's stake in the New York company was valued at more than $8.7 billion based on the stock's close on its first day of trading. \u001d  The third quarter could be just as lucrative. \"I would say the second half of this year is looking very good. I think it is going to be at least as strong as the first half assuming overall market conditions hold up,\" said David Topper, co-head of equity capital markets at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s securities unit. \u001d  Some 84 companies have filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public in the third quarter and beyond. Together, they plan to raise about $18.5 billion. \u001d  MF Global Ltd., a brokerage-firm spinoff of London hedge-fund manager Man Group PLC, could raise as much as $4.18 billion through its public offering, expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange this month. \u001d  The IPO market wasn't only strong in the U.S. World-wide, 340 deals raised $79.5 billion in the second quarter, up 28% from the 266 deals that raised $64.3 billion a year earlier. Financial stocks dominated the market with 55 deals and they raised the most money from investors, bringing in $27.4 billion. \u001d  The finance sector, thanks largely to Blackstone, also led the pack in terms of money raised in the U.S. Some $5.6 billion was raised by seven financial IPOs in the second quarter, up from last year's four such deals that raised $3 billion. \u001d  The sector will remain in the headlines in the third quarter as MF Global prepares to go public. Speculation is likely to continue about whether another private-equity behemoth, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., will go public, which it was reported to be considering last month. \u001d  Although the finance sector offered the biggest deals in terms of dollars raised, in terms of sheer numbers it was overshadowed by a resurgent technology sector. \u001d  Investors snapped up opportunities in high-expansion stocks that generally boasted solid business models, unlike many of the companies that went public during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s. \u001d  This year, 27 technology stocks have gone public, raising a total of $4.3 billion. In the second quarter, 15 tech companies raised $2.8 billion. \u001d  The sector accounts for some of the best-performing IPOs this year, including Sunnyvale, Calif., optical-communications equipment maker Infinera Corp., which surged nearly 52% on its first day of trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market in June. Data Domain Inc., a data-storage company in Santa Clara, Calif., gained 66% on its first day of trading. Limelight Networks Inc., of Tempe, Ariz., which went public the following day, surged 48%. \u001d  New York hedge fund Fortress Investment Group LLC remains the best-performing IPO this year after surging 68% on its first day of trading in February. \u001d  \"Technology volume is definitely more robust than it has been in quite some time and it will continue to grow, especially if investors continue to see strong returns on technology IPOs as they did [in the] second quarter of 2007,\" said Suzanne Skipper, managing director and head of equity capital markets at Merriman Curhan Ford & Co., a San Francisco investment bank. \u001d  The 15 technology stocks that went public in the past three months returned on average 22% after their first day of trading, above the 10% first-day return from all IPOs in the latest quarter and 7% in the second quarter of 2006. \u001d  Not far behind technology in terms of activity was health care. In the second quarter 14 biotechnology, pharmaceutical or medical-device companies have gone public. The typically smaller-size offerings mean the total amount raised was fairly low, at a total of $1.6 billion. The first-day returns also were low, averaging 3.6%. \u001d  The subdued performances aren't surprising. Many health-care companies go public before they receive regulatory approval for their products and thus don't yet generate revenue or turn a profit. \u001d  \"The prevalence of health-care and technology offerings . . . is a sign of an increasingly healthy IPO market,\" said David DiPietro, president of specialty investment bank Signal Hill in Baltimore. \"To venture capitalists and entrepreneurs in small-cap land with a very good story, it shows that at least for now, there appears to be a nice window for going public.\" \u001d  There also have been more public offerings from special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs. Also known as \"blank check\" companies, they are empty shells that promise to buy a business with the proceeds from their IPOs. \u001d  So far this year, 34 SPACs have gone public compared with 23 at this time last year. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 21:00 ET (01:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

\u001d  By James Mawson \u001d  Of FINANCIAL NEWS \b \u001d  The debt financing for Australian bank Macquarie's leveraged buyout of U.K. mobile phone mast owner National Grid Wireless has run into difficulties, reflecting nervousness over financial sponsor deals and the credit markets. \u001d  There was strong institutional interest but weak bank demand for a GBP3.4 billion (EUR5.1 billion) loan backing the merger of Wireless with Arqiva, Macquarie's broadcast towers business, which was acquired from the BBC in 2005, according to sources. \u001d  Macquarie, which declined to comment, had reportedly expected to close the financing two weeks ago. One person familiar with the situation said: \"The institutional tranche was 300% oversubscribed but the banking facility is taking longer.\" \u001d  Another person said the market had split between those buying into the combined broadcast business as a utility and those more skeptical about its risks. \u001d  Macquarie's struggle comes after the canceled $650 million (EUR483 million) bond issue for U.S. Foodservice's leveraged buyout from Dutch retailer Ahold last week. \u001d  Other bond deals were halted, including that of Misc, a tanker owner, which shelved a $750 million issue. Arcelor Mittal (MT), the world's largest steelmaker, postponed its EUR1.5 billion Eurobond sale as hedge fund losses in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector heightened volatility in the credit markets. \u001d  There are concerns the sharp fall in prices for subprime mortgages, affecting collateralized debt obligations and the hedge funds that own them, could spill over to the high-yield market. \u001d  Mehernosh Engineer, senior credit strategist at BNP Paribas, said: \"There is a real indication that there is a flight to safety. Quite a few new issue deals were pulled in Europe, the U.S. and Asia and those are big names with nothing to do with subprime.\" \u001d  A third debt market participant said: \"There is a wobble with some repricing of debt terms.\" A fourth observer added debt-arranging banks were struggling to syndicate other deals while sales of quasi-equity securities, such as payment-in-kind notes, were ailing. \b \u001d  Web site: http://www.efinancialnews.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 20:01 ET (00:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8e197cefb3d1acdb680ee381f96c2d73","symR":["MBL.AU","MCG.AU","AU000000MBL3","AU000000MCG1"],"date":"2007-07-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Australia's Macquarie Buys US Global Towers","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-02T01:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MBL.AU","MCG.AU","AU000000MBL3","AU000000MCG1"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","SCR","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\b   (Adds background, Blackstone comment) \b \b   By Lyndal McFarland \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Australia's Macquarie Communications Infrastructure Group (MCG.AU) said Monday it has agreed to acquire U.S.-based Global Tower Partners from Blackstone Group (BGP.XX) as part of a Macquarie Bank Ltd. (MBL.AU) consortium. \u001d  In a statement, Sydney-based Macquarie Communications said the acquisition has an enterprise value of US$1.43 billion. \u001d  \"Through this acquisition Macquarie Communications has gained a timely position in a familiar industry in the attractive U.S. market,\" Macquarie Communications chief executive Scott Davies said. \u001d  Macquarie Communications will take a 28.7% stake in GTP, while partner Macquarie Infrastructure Partners will take 56.2%. The remaining equity will be held by two other unlisted Macquarie Bank funds and by GTP management. \u001d  Macquarie said GTP owns 2500 towers and 4600 rooftop sites for wireless communications in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. \u001d  The significant majority of GTP's revenue base is derived from long-term contracts with major wireless operators, including AT&T, Sprint-Nextel, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. \u001d  \"It has been a privilege to be partnered with...the GTP management team as they built a world class tower company, more than quintupling revenues, increasing earnings sixfold and adding new employees and offices during our investment period,\" Blackstone senior managing director Ben Jenkins said in a separate statement. \u001d  \"This transaction demonstrates the significant value that has been created,\" he said. \u001d  The acquisition will be funded by a combination of US$906 million equity, existing GTP debt of US$521 million and subordinated debt of US$110 million. \u001d  Macquarie Communications investment totals approximately A$444 million, including a contribution of subordinated debt of A$115 million and transaction costs of approximately A$18 million. \u001d  Macquarie Communications was placed in a trading halt Monday ahead of a bookbuild of exchangeable bonds in connection to the acquisition, which is subject to U.S. regulatory approval. \b \b

Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) announced today that a subsidiary has completed the purchase of Coastal Carolina Medical Center, a 41-bed acute care hospital located in Hardeeville, S.C., from LifePoint Hospitals Inc. (NYSE: LPNT). The approximate purchase price is $35 million and is subject to normal post-closing adjustments. \b \u001d  Coastal Carolina Medical Center serves a vibrant market with a growing population of younger retirees in Jasper County. The area is poised to add more than 100,000 residents in the next 20 years, with much of the growth projected around Hardeeville. The hospital is located 27 miles from Tenet's Hilton Head Regional Medical Center. The company intends to continue operating Coastal Carolina Medical Center as a full-service community hospital and will seek to enhance services to meet the community's needs, in coordination with the nearby Hilton Head facility. \b \u001d  \"Tenet's growth strategy includes leveraging the strength of our current hospitals to grow in key markets where we already operate,\" said Trevor Fetter, Tenet's president and chief executive officer. \"This acquisition - our first in five years of an acute care general hospital -fits that strategy perfectly. We have served the coastal areas of South Carolina for many years both at Hilton Head Regional Medical Center and at East Cooper Regional Medical Center near Charleston - two of our most successful hospitals. We strongly believe that Coastal Carolina Medical Center will benefit significantly by partnering with Hilton Head and Tenet to serve one of the nation's most dynamic, rapidly growing communities.\" \b \u001d  Coastal Carolina Medical Center will become a part of Tenet's Southern States Region and will maintain a local management team. The hospital's chief executive officer will report to Elizabeth Lamkin, the chief executive officer at Hilton Head Regional Medical Center. Coastal Carolina Medical Center will continue to operate under its current name. This strategy builds on the hospital's existing brand equity and will streamline Tenet's operational efficiency. Through this integrated approach Tenet can provide comprehensive, cost-effective health care services to the Lowcountry, as that area is known. \b \u001d  Stephen L. Newman, M.D., Tenet's chief operating officer, said, \"We are strategically applying our capital to build upon our current market success in a highly desirable area, and will grow Coastal Carolina's services by linking it with our other nearby operations. Because we know the Lowcountry area of South Carolina so well and have served it for many years, we will hit the ground running with strategies to expand and enhance services at Coastal Carolina Medical Center.\" \b \u001d  Coastal Carolina Medical Center opened in November 2004. The hospital was acquired by LifePoint in April 2005. It was the only hospital that LifePoint operated in South Carolina. \b \u001d  As part of the agreement, Tenet has committed to offer employment to substantially all current employees in good standing who meet its condition of employment. \b \u001d  Tenet Healthcare Corporation, through its subsidiaries, owns and operates acute care hospitals and related health care services. Tenet's hospitals aim to provide the best possible care to every patient who comes through their doors, with a clear focus on quality and service. Tenet can be found on the World Wide Web at www.tenethealth.com. \b \u001d  Some of the statements in this release may constitute forward-looking statements.

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Ethan Smith and Nick Wingfield \u001d  Highlighting continuing tension between the music industry and Apple Inc., Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group is considering notifying the Cupertino, Calif., company that it isn't renewing a long-term contract to sell digital music downloads through the increasingly powerful iTunes Store, according to a person familiar with the situation. \u001d  The move doesn't mean Universal will remove its vast catalog, which includes Eminem, 50 Cent and Sting, from iTunes in the foreseeable future. Universal, which is the world's largest music company by market share, hopes to go to a short-term sales agreement instead of one that lasts a year or more. \u001d  Although it is unlikely to have sweeping effects immediately, the change could give Universal more flexibility in its dealings with competitors to iTunes. For instance, it could enable the company to offer other digital-download stores exclusive rights to parts of its catalog. \u001d  Universal's move comes against a backdrop of dramatic change in the way music is sold. As traditional music retailers have fallen by the wayside, Apple has gained an outsize influence in music sales, recently becoming the No. 3 seller of recorded music to the public, behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Best Buy Co. Its power has made record-label executives increasingly uneasy, as it has generally refused to comply with labels' desires for flexibility on matters such as pricing. \u001d  As a result, the record labels and Apple have traded barbs over the past year or so; Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs has called record labels \"greedy.\" \u001d  An Apple spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on \"rumors and speculation.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 22:52 ET (02:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"989eb8c6a2c1818ea913ca32610d29a9","symR":["8035.TO","JP3571400005"],"date":"2007-07-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Cuts Japan's Tokyo Electron To 2","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-02T00:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["8035.TO","JP3571400005"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","X225","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 20:25 ET (00:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"98b4b2ec6bb90a531bc23458dc34e1d1","symR":["NQI"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund (NQI)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NQI"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund (NQI): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NQI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:54 ET (08:54 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9901b26d9e656a1bdd66f5ff15b1563c","symR":["SSO.T","SSRI","CA82823L1067"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Silver Standard Resources Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SSO.T","SSRI","CA82823L1067"],"IndustryCodes":["PCS","PPM","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  Silver Standard Resources Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=SSRI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:31 ET (09:31 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9976ff3750f1321e812c2cd66d7be891","symR":["CBST"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBST"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=CBST or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:52 ET (07:52 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"99f746c8e21fd494fe88ca1edb6c62b5","symR":["HYV"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund, Inc.

The cash generated from this will allow the Duesseldorf-based company to spend up to EUR500 million on acquisitions, he added. \u001d  Versatel is monitoring the market for telephone companies that own network infrastructure, but may also take over smaller competitors to increase its customer base, Knauer said in the interview. \u001d  Knauer also didn't rule out taking over parts of freenet.de AG (FRN.XE) should the opportunity arise. \u001d  Freenet shareholders Drillisch AG (DRI.XE) and financial investor Florian Homm have argued the company should sell its internet operations to create more value. \u001d  Freenet recently merged with mobile phone network operator Mobilcom. \u001d  The CEO also confirmed the company's financial targets for 2007, saying it still expects sales to come in at between EUR740 million and EUR760 million, compared with EUR666 million a year earlier. Versatel's adjusted operating earnings margin is expected to be slightly lower in 2007, at 30% compared with 31.8% in 2006. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.versatel.de \b \u001d  -By Stefan

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Sarah Childress and Dennis K. Berman \u001d  The $32.6 billion buyout of Canadian telecommunications operator BCE Inc. -- the largest in the country's history and the telecom industry globally -- marks increasing interest from private-equity buyers in national telecom companies burdened by debt and competition from start-ups. \u001d  It also marks the latest big private-equity deal as buyout firms seek larger and larger targets, adding to their risk. \u001d  BCE said it agreed to be acquired by the investment arm of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Providence Equity Partners Inc. and Madison Dearborn Partners for $32.6 billion. The deal also includes an additional $15.9 billion in debt, preferred equity and minority interests, for a buyout package valued at an overall $48.5 billion. \u001d  In recent years, private-equity firms have pursued national telecom companies like BCE, which are often threatened by more-nimble rivals. Providence, for example, has been part of groups that acquired two national telecom companies in recent years: Ireland's Eircom in 2001 and the Danish company TDC in 2006. \u001d  This deal is another in a crescendo of buyouts in which private-equity companies take on increasingly greater risks, looking for profits in a matter of months, not years. \"The plan in private equity is to go after bigger and bigger deals, and this is yet another level,\" says Shahid Khan, a partner at Interactive Broadband Consulting Group. \u001d  \"The economics of the business are just amazing, but the timeline of the cycle is shrinking,\" Mr. Khan said. He added: \"I don't know how long this model is sustainable.\" \u001d  Under the deal, the buyout group will purchase each of BCE's shares for 42.75 Canadian dollars, or US$40.12, a 40% premium over the average first-quarter share price before it rose in late March amid rumors of a buyout. Friday, BCE's shares were priced at $37.79 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. \u001d  The deal still must be approved by BCE's shareholders and cleared by Canada's Competition Bureau. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan is already BCE's largest shareholder. \u001d  With a market capitalization of $30 billion, BCE dominates the telecom market in Eastern Canada, selling fixed-line, wireless, high-speed Internet and video services. The company's stock had stagnated in recent years as the company struggled to stay competitive. BCE had trouble signing up subscribers to its Bell Wireless cellphone unit and its land-line division lost access lines to cheaper cable providers. Meanwhile, smaller rivals Telus Corp. and Rogers Communications Inc. both saw overall growth. \u001d  Providence Equity Partners began looking seriously at BCE this spring, according to a person familiar with the matter. In March, Providence's chief executive, Jonathan Nelson, spoke with Michael Sabia, the head of BCE, about a potential buyout. Mr. Sabia said he wasn't interested, according to a person familiar with the matter. But shortly afterward, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan began pushing for a sale. \"That just kicked things off,\" this person said. \u001d  Despite interest from several private-equity groups, BCE was widely expected to be taken over by Telus, its leading rival. But last week, Telus decided not to submit a bid, citing \"inadequacies\" in the bidding process. It still could enter a friendly or hostile bid. \"For traditional companies like Telus, it's very difficult for them to go out and compete with private-equity shops,\" says Mr. Khan, of Interactive Broadband. Telus would have to expend much more capital and risk stock fluctuations, he says, and likely wouldn't return to the table unless it has an unbeatable deal. \u001d  A Telus spokesman declined to comment yesterday. \u001d  Telus's decision left three major bidders to submit plans to BCE's board Friday. Cerberus Capital Management and the Hospitals of Ontario Pension Plan submitted a bid, as well as the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board and buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., despite a last-minute pullout of partners Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec in Montreal and Onex Corp. All are major Canadian funds partnered with U.S. private-equity firms because, according to federal law, foreign companies can own no more than 46.67% of telecom providers. \u001d  Yesterday, the Cerberus group was still considering its options, a person familiar with the matter said. This person said the group was frustrated with what it felt was an expedited bidding process. The group had presented a plan that would have offered $44 a share -- $38 in cash with with an additional guarantee of $6 if BCE's price fell below $44. \u001d  Had BCE's advisers worked with Cerberus in an effort to improve that group's proposal, this person said, \"it could have made their shareholders an extra billion dollars.\" A BCE spokesman couldn't be reached. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones

Group (HWG.YY) Chairman Kim Seung-youn was sentenced to one year and six months in prison Monday over a sensational beating attack earlier this year against bar workers who had scuffled with his son. \u001d  The Seoul District Court handed down the ruling. Prosecutors last month sought a two-year prison term for Kim for ordering his bodyguards to attack the off-duty bar workers who had taken part in the scuffle with his 22-year-old son. \u001d  In his first trial session last month, Kim admitted to punching the bar workers during the attack in March but denied using a steel pipe or a stun gun as alleged by the victims. \u001d  The 55-year-old tycoon, one of South Korea's richest people, also said he was the one who \"mainly beat\" them and that his bodyguards took over when he \"got tired.\" \u001d  Kim has been in jail since his May 11 arrest. \u001d  The dramatic details of the case, which the media have likened to something out of a gangster movie, have drawn intense public interest in South Korea, where the heads of family controlled conglomerates wield great economic, political and social clout. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 21:43 ET (01:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

Jones)--Italian car maker Fiat SpA (FIA) and its Chinese partner Nanjing Automobile Corp. have agreed to increase their investments in a joint venture by about CNY3 billion each, the state-run Shanghai Securities News reported over the weekend. \u001d  The report, which didn't reveal its sources, said both parties reached the agreement with the moderation of the local authorities in Jiangsu province, adding that Nanjing Automobile will fund its investment with bank loans. \u001d  Fiat had planned to terminate its partnership with Nanjing Automobile after the Chinese company failed to make its promised investment in the joint-venture project, the newspaper reported in June. \u001d  The weekend report also said Nanjing Automobile had demanded Fiat not partner with another Chinese carmaker, Chery Automobile Co., but withdrew the condition later, adding that Fiat is expected to announce its partnership with Chery Automobile before August. \u001d  The state-run China Daily in February cited an unnamed industry source as saying Chery Automobile was in talks with Fiat on expanding their ties and among the options would be a joint venture in China to assemble Fiat cars. In October, Fiat signed an agreement with Chery to buy 100,000 engines for cars built in China and overseas. \b \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.cnstock.com \b \u001d  -By China Bureau, Dow

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Kris Hudson \u001d  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. hired former Kraft Foods Inc. executive Linda Hefner to oversee its ailing home-decor division. \u001d  Ms. Hefner, who left Kraft last year in an executive-suite shake-up, was named executive vice president and general manager of Wal-Mart's home division. She reports to Chief Merchandising Officer John Fleming and oversees the home division's strategy, brand management, product development and sourcing. \u001d  Wal-Mart doesn't disclose sales tallies for its home unit, which encompasses small appliances, furniture, bedding and decor, among other merchandise. However, the Bentonville, Ark., retailer has pinned much of the blame for its paltry sales gains at established stores in the past year on weak sales from its home division and, more so, its apparel division. The two units were cornerstones of Wal-Mart's failed effort in 2005 and 2006 to broaden its customer base to include more trend-conscious, affluent shoppers. \u001d  Ms. Hefner, previously an executive vice president at Kraft, left the Northfield, Ill., company in recent months after new CEO Irene Rosenfeld shuffled several top jobs. Prior to her work at Kraft, Ms. Hefner served in various executive roles at Sara Lee Corp., from 1989 to 2003. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman said Ms. Hefner was unavailable for comment. \u001d  Prior to a shake-up this year in which Mr. Fleming shifted from overseeing Wal-Mart's marketing to leading its merchandising, both the home and apparel divisions were the responsibility of Executive Vice President Claire Watts. She now oversees apparel only. \u001d  The home division has seen further changes: Lucy Cindric, previously a senior vice president of the division's soft goods, left Wal-Mart this year. Meanwhile, Beth Schommer arrived as a senior vice president over both soft goods and hard goods. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 19:53 ET (23:53 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b504fc8e456eb8d99796d8abfa898e6c","symR":["RDC"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Rowan Companies","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RDC"],"IndustryCodes":["DRL","OIE","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  Rowan Companies: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=RDC or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:27 ET (09:27 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b51b87d0bfee5c4c8a55c8e8fd54b12a","symR":["BX","DDUP","KKR.XX","SHOR","US23767P1093","US8252111054"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(7/2) Tech Led US IPO Market In June","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T23:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BX","DDUP","KKR.XX","SHOR","US23767P1093","US8252111054"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","CPR","FIS"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Yvonne Ball \u001d  It was a tale of two IPO markets in June as technology stocks proved a boon for investors, but private-equity firm Blackstone Group's public offering fell flat and a handful of deals were pulled on the eve of their scheduled debut. \u001d  Blackstone's $4.75 billion public offering failed to match the hype as Wall Street counted down the days to the firm's much publicized debut on June 22. \u001d  Despite reports the IPO was seven times oversubscribed, Blackstone rallied only 13% on its first day of trading. It closed Friday 5.6% below its $31-a-share offering price as analysts debate whether the stock is overvalued and wary investors wonder whether the IPO signaled a peak in the private-equity boom. \u001d  Whether the deal, which delivered a massive payday to Blackstone's executives, entices rival private-equity firms to go public, remains to be seen. Rival Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., the buyout firm that became famous for its takeover of RJR Nabisco in the 1980s, is planning an IPO. \u001d  \"I think the asset class remains to be an asset class that investors are going to be very intrigued by,\" said Mark Hantho, Deutsche Bank's vice chairman and head of equity and equity-linked capital markets for the Americas. \u001d  Blackstone was one of 18 companies that went public in June, according to Dealogic, after four deals on the calendar were postponed or withdrawn. \u001d  Among the casualties was telecommunications company ShoreTel Inc. which was hit by a lawsuit alleging infringement of four patents from Ottawa-based Mitel Networks Corp. on the eve of its scheduled debut last week. \u001d  The 18 public offerings, which exclude real-estate investment companies and special-purpose acquisition companies, matched the number of IPOs in June 2006 but fell short of the 27 companies that went public in May, the busiest month so far this year. \u001d  The volume of deals may have eased, but the money raised skyrocketed. \u001d  Blackstone's IPO, the fourth-largest in the U.S. ever, increased the value of all offerings in the past month to $7.4 billion, almost 40% more than the amount raised in May and almost three times that raised in June last year. \u001d  Indeed, the value of the 18 deals in June fell only 11% short of the total amount raised in November, when 32 deals raised $8.2 billion. \u001d  Overall, 104 IPOs have raised about $26.2 billion this year, compared with 89 deals that raised $20.9 billion in the first half of 2006. \u001d  \"There's everything to be very positive about,\" Mr. Hantho said. \"The access to capital from both companies that are already public and also for companies that want to go public has been very well received.\" \u001d  Technology was easily the best-performing sector in June, accounting for eight deals that gained an average of 25% on their first day of trading. It compares with an average first-day return of 15% for all IPOs. \u001d  Data-storage company Data Domain, which went public last week, soared 66%, making it the second-best IPO this year behind hedge-fund Fortress Investment Group, which rallied 68% on its first day of trading in February. \u001d  \"We have a two-tiered market going. One is technology, and then there are all the others,\" said John Fitzgibbon, an IPO analyst and founder of IPOScoop.com. \u001d  \"In terms of the IPOs that were postponed, it's a case-by-case situation. There's nothing to worry about from that standpoint.\" \u001d  While the IPO calendar is bare in early July, the week of July 16 is filling up quickly. Among those penciled in is MF Global Ltd.'s $4.18 billion offering. \u001d  \"We're going to be in for one great summer, and technology will be leading the way,\" Mr. Fitzgibbon said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 19:38 ET (23:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b53942789db4bd81d93e6c67575e7840","symR":["AKR"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Acadia Realty Trust","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AKR"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Acadia Realty Trust: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=AKR or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:01 ET (07:01 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b546042c35003eade1f333e16de15447","symR":["MEN"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock MuniEnhanced Fund, Inc.

A banker close to the deal said it was not necessary to lock in the banks. He said: \"We expect them to be long-term holders.\" \u001d  LSE chief executive Clara Furse is adamant the merger will go through, despite a fall in the exchange's share price and uncertainty over the position of its largest shareholder, Nasdaq, the U.S. exchange that was forced to abandon a hostile bid for the LSE in February. \u001d  It is understood Furse has sufficient backing to allow the deal to go through from shareholders controlling 30% of the company. \u001d  ABN Amro (ABN) last week emerged as the third largest shareholder in the LSE, having bought 6.1% of the stock on behalf of clients. The bank, the lead adviser on Euronext's (29064.AE) merger with the New York Stock Exchange, has bought 12.3 million shares in recent weeks, and over 6 million in two days at the end of last month, paying about GBP13.50 a share. \u001d  ABN Amro's buying spree came as the LSE said it was in merger talks with Borsa Italiana. The bank broke the 3% limit, above which investors are obliged to declare their holdings, on June 22, the day before the exchanges announced their agreement to merge. \u001d  The exchange said ABN Amro is not the owner and the bank has acquired the shares on behalf of a third party, possibly a hedge fund. ABN Amro confirmed it is holding the shares but gave no further information. \u001d  Italian newspapers suggested that Alessandro Profumo, chief executive of UniCredit, would back a merger between the LSE and Deutsche Boerse. He is a member of the supervisory board of the German exchange. \b \u001d  Web site: http://www.efinancialnews.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 20:01 ET (00:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b59a85be44d33fd5a12f7fa645637ea1","symR":["FEMSA.MX","FMX","MXP320321310"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for FEMSA S.A.

Neither disclosed sales, although industry observers -- citing crowded stores, media buzz and strong consumer interest -- expect the new product to be a strong seller. \u001d  Still, the wrinkle illustrates the complexities Apple faces in offering a consumer product that plugs into a cellular network, as well as working with a partner. Apple developed the iPhone device and its software, and AT&T has an exclusive, multiyear contract with Apple to provide cellular service for the device. \u001d  In blog postings and emails to The Wall Street Journal, some consumers who lined up at Apple and AT&T stores complained of problems and delays as they tried to get the phone running through Apple's iTunes computer software. \u001d  Some AT&T customers said their existing cellphones had been deactivated while they were still waiting for their iPhone to be activated, leaving them without any working phone. \u001d  AT&T spokesman Michael Coe said the vast majority of iPhone buyers were able to activate the device \"within minutes.\" He added, \"We're working to get those problems resolved. It's getting better and better.\" Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris said only, \"the response to iPhone has been incredible. We're thrilled there's so much excitement.\" \u001d  Jared Gurfein, president of spirits company Viridian Spirits LLC, bought his iPhone at an Apple store Friday evening on New York's Long Island, but hasn't been able to use the device since then. \u001d  \"I'm at the point of frustration where, as much as I'd like to get the device to work, I'd just like to get my BlackBerry working again.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 19:45 ET (23:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b6056bb5366485bb3ebaf1c557637e75","symR":["HDU.LN","GB0004109772"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Hardy Underwriting Group PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HDU.LN","GB0004109772"],"IndustryCodes":["INP","INS"],"Story":"\u001d  Hardy Underwriting Group PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0004109772 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:08 ET (08:08 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b632e1348af647867f82f5d39136243d","symR":["APS.LN","GB00B0CZZR45"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Alpha Strategic PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["APS.LN","GB00B0CZZR45"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\u001d  Alpha Strategic PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B0CZZR45 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:07 ET (07:07 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b654fa2e430f7aed3c1b81a6b1859ab5","symR":["BET.LN","GB0004126271"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Betinternet.com plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BET.LN","GB0004126271"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO"],"Story":"\u001d  Betinternet.com plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0004126271 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:18 ET (07:18 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b65ee220f912f58b6b93c7b321e38073","symR":["CTY.LN","GB0001990497"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for City of London Trust I.T.

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Dana Cimilluca \u001d  Storm clouds may be gathering on the horizon, but the sun is shining brightly on the mergers-and-acquisitions market. \u001d  Companies around the world struck $1.65 trillion of merger deals in the second quarter, eclipsing the first quarter of 2000 as the biggest three-month total, according to data tracker Thomson Financial. \u001d  That is a 90% increase from the same period in 2006, which racked up a full-year deal-making total of $3.6 trillion, the best on record. With deal volume in the first quarter of this year rising 28% to just under $1 trillion, that 2006 record would be easily shattered if the pace of the first half of 2007 is sustained. \u001d  The second quarter could end up being a high-water mark, as the flood of cheap credit that has lubricated the buyout boom shows signs of ebbing. \u001d  Bond and loan investors in recent days have forced a raft of companies that are going private to pay higher interest rates and agree to more lender-friendly contract terms. If the recent bout of volatility proves to be the beginning of a more drastic reduction in the availability of credit, bankers say, the days of the record merger run could be numbered. \u001d  \"We're starting to get to the point where we may not be able to sustain this breathtaking pace,\" says Paul J. Taubman, the head of the global M&A group at Morgan Stanley, the No. 2 adviser on deals in terms of value after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. this year. \"The M&A marketplace is going to have a meaningful correction if all of a sudden easy credit disappears.\" \u001d  After going into a deep freeze following corporate-governance scandals and the bursting of the technology-stock bubble early this decade, merger activity roared back in late 2003, with deals such as the $41 billion purchase of AT&T Wireless by Cingular Wireless, which is now part of AT&T Inc. \u001d  Besides the explosion of private-equity buyouts, the boom has been fueled by ample cash on corporate balance sheets and the rising confidence among executives that comes with increasing profits and share prices. \u001d  Fittingly for a quarter in which the value of deals struck in Europe exceeded those in the U.S., the largest acquisitions announced in the past three months were in Europe. \u001d  The biggest was the announced takeover of Dutch bank ABN Amro Holding NV by British bank Barclays PLC. That offer -- valued at about $91 billion when it was announced -- was later topped by a $97 billion bid by a group including Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC. It remains to be seen which of the two offers, both announced in April, will prevail. \u001d  Next on the list was the $31 billion acquisition of Spanish electricity company Endesa SA by Italian utility Enel SpA and Spanish conglomerate Acciona. The April 2 agreement ended an 18-month takeover battle that pitted Enel and Acciona against E.On AG of Germany and Gas Natural SDG SA of Spain. \u001d  The third-biggest deal was UniCredito Italiano SpA's May 20 merger pact with rival Italian bank Capitalia SpA for nearly $30 billion. \u001d  Underscoring the contribution of private-equity firms to the M&A boom in the U.S. were three leveraged buyouts valued at more than $25 billion each. They are the purchases of wireless-phone company Alltel Corp., student lender SLM Corp. and credit-card processor First Data Corp. \u001d  According to Thomson, buyout firms accounted for 40% of U.S. M&A activity in the quarter, the highest level ever. That is why the overall M&A market is sensitive to any interruption in easy credit. \u001d  Saturday, after Thomson closed its books for the quarter, one of the largest LBOs was announced. A group led by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan that includes two big U.S. private-equity firms agreed to buy Canadian telecommunications operator BCE Inc. for about $32.6 billion, excluding debt. \u001d  Amid fears that the subprime-mortgage meltdown will spill over and the near collapse of two Bear Stearns Cos. hedge funds, a number of high-yield, or junk, debt issuers have had to scrap features of their offerings that had become a hallmark of the good times for borrowers. \u001d  Companies including Ahold NV's U.S. Foodservice unit that have agreed to be acquired abandoned slices of debt offerings that were to be so-called pay-in-kind toggle notes. The bonds can pay cash interest or not, based on the issuer's preference. \u001d  Some bankers predict that such bonds are a thing of the past. \u001d  \"We've seen the froth come off private equity,\" says H. Rodgin Cohen, chairman of New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, which is the No. 1 law-firm adviser on deals in the first half by total dollar value, according to Thomson. \"But at the same time there are still a lot of good private-equity deals. There's no reason that should slow down. I suspect we'll see a pretty good third quarter.\" \u001d  A number of bankers agree that psychology among lenders will be crucial in determining how much longer the good times last. \u001d  A \"sentiment shift\" among credit investors could endanger the health of the credit markets, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said at a conference last week in New York sponsored by The Wall Street Journal. \u001d  Some bankers say it is too early to sound alarms about the end of the buyout boom. Jimmy Elliott, co-head of global M&A at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., says the credit-market tremors aren't enough to sap private equity's interest in buyouts. \u001d  \"There would need to be a significant shift in the cost of debt to dampen the spirits of financial sponsors,\" Mr. Elliott says, using bankers' parlance for private-equity firms. \u001d  He said share-price declines that accompanied losses in the debt market will lessen the cost of acquisitions for private-equity firms and might offset higher borrowing costs. \u001d  \"I don't think we're on the way down yet,\" he says. \"I believe we're on a plateau.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  Dennis K.

Westfield in a statement.

Risk Variant Aimed at the Prevention of Stroke \b \b \u001d  REYKJAVIK, Iceland, July 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- A paper published today in the journal Nature describes the discovery by scientists at deCODE genetics (Nasdaq: DCGN), in collaboration with academic colleagues in Iceland, the United States, Sweden and China, of two common single-letter variations in the genome (SNPs) conferring risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is also the leading cause of cardiogenic stroke. The variants, located on chromosome 4q25, confer an approximately 70% and 40% increase above average risk of AF, respectively, per copy carried. Approximately one third of people of European ancestry carry at least one copy of one of the risk variants, and deCODE's results show that those who carry two copies of the more powerful variant are at a more than 250% greater likelihood of AF than those who carry neither variant. The gene nearest to these SNPs, PITX2, is known to play an important role in the development of the heart. \b \u001d  deCODE also today launched deCODE AF(TM), a reference laboratory test for the variants. Because AF is the biggest risk factor for cardiogenic stroke, the company believes that testing for these variants will provide doctors with a targeted and cost-effective means of identifying those who should be intensively monitored for AF. Current best clinical practice recommends that stroke patients with AF can significantly reduce their risk of a second stroke by taking the anticoagulant drug warfarin. \b \u001d  \"This is an important discovery with an immediate clinical application. Transient AF is difficult to detect in many patients, and it is impractical and too costly to conduct extended cardiac monitoring on all patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack. With the discovery of these variants, and the availability of a test to detect them, doctors may now be able focus monitoring on those most likely to have transient AF and then match therapy to the etiology of an individual's disease. This study is also impressive in that it took us only seven months from the beginning of the search for AF variants to today's publication and the launch of the test. This speaks very clearly to the power of our gene discovery capabilities and our product development group,\" said Kari Stefansson, CEO of deCODE and a board-certified neurologist. \b \u001d  deCODE discovered the variants, the \"T\" alleles of SNPs rs2200733 and rs10033464, through analysis of more than more than 300,000 SNPs in a total of more than 5,000 Icelanders with atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter as well as healthy control subjects. These findings were subsequently replicated in case-control cohorts from Iceland, the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, including a total of 18,000 subjects. The stronger variant was also confirmed in a Han Chinese population from Hong Kong. In this group the variant conferred a slightly smaller increase in risk than in the other cohorts, but 75% of those studied carried at least one copy. Thus while the population-attributable risk (PAR) - roughly the proportion of cases that not exist were these variants not present - of the two variants in people European ancestry is approximately 20%, the first variant alone has a PAR of nearly 35% in Han Chinese. The article is published today in the online edition of Nature at www.nature.com and will appear in an upcoming print edition of the journal. \b \b    How to order deCODE AF(TM) \b \u001d  deCODE AF(TM) is performed in deCODE's Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory, and must be authorized by a qualified physician.

\u001d  MELBOURNE (Dow Jones)--Australia's Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES.AU) confirmed Monday that London-based buyout company Permira (PR.YY) has pulled out of the bidding for retailer Coles Group Ltd.

said. \u001d  Wesfarmers remains in talks to acquire Coles, with both companies' shares placed in trading halt. \u001d  Wesfarmers may raise the planned equity proportion of its offer to 60% from 40%, another person familiar with situation told Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  Permira was part of a leveraged syndicate which included local buyout company Pacific Equity Partners and Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd. \u001d  The spokesman said Wesfarmers remained in talks with PEP, but its role hasn't yet been defined. \u001d  Macquarie also remains an adviser to the consortium. \b \b   -By Susan

  (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Sarah Childress and Dennis K. Berman \u001d  The $32.6 billion buyout of Canadian telecommunications operator BCE Inc. represents the largest private-equity deal in history and a sign that despite some market jitters, the buyout route remains an active option for boards and managers. \u001d  BCE said it agreed to be acquired by the investment arm of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Providence Equity Partners Inc. and Madison Dearborn Partners for $32.6 billion. The deal also includes an additional $15.9 billion in debt, preferred equity and minority interests, for a total value of $48.5 billion, making it also the largest private-equity buyout package in history. The buyers are writing equity checks valued at $8 billion, according to a person familiar with the transaction. \u001d  In recent years, private-equity firms have pursued national telecom companies like BCE, which are often threatened by more-nimble rivals. Providence, for example, has been part of groups that acquired two national telecoms companies in recent years: Ireland's Eircom in 2001 and the Danish company TDC in 2006. \u001d  This deal is another in a crescendo of buyouts in which private-equity firms take on increasingly greater targets, looking for ways to spend ever-larger troughs of cash, collecting fat management and transaction fees along the way. \u001d  \"The plan in private equity is to go after bigger and bigger deals, and this is yet another level,\" says Shahid Khan, a partner at Interactive Broadband Consulting Group. \u001d  Under the deal, the buyout group will purchase BCE's shares for 42.75 Canadian dollars, or US$40.12, a 40% premium over the average first-quarter share price before it rose in late March amid rumors of a buyout. Friday, BCE's shares were priced at $37.79 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. \u001d  The deal puts leverage of about six times BCE's cash flow on the company, a relatively low figure by today's buyout standards, but still an aggressive number for a business with stagnant revenue and profits. A group of banks including Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC and TD Securities are arranging the debt financing. A person familiar with the matter said that only about $500 million of the debt would come via bridge loans by the banks, a relatively low number by current deal standards. Such loans, which are short-term until other financing can be arranged, have been a source of worry amid troubles in the debt markets. \u001d  The deal still must be approved by BCE's shareholders and cleared by Canada's Competition Bureau. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan is already BCE's largest shareholder. \u001d  BCE dominates the telecom market in Eastern Canada, selling fixed-line, wireless, high-speed Internet and video services. The company's stock had stagnated in recent years as the company struggled to stay competitive. BCE had trouble signing up subscribers to its Bell Wireless cellphone unit and its land-line division lost access lines to cheaper cable providers. Meanwhile, smaller rivals Telus Corp. and Rogers Communications Inc. both saw overall growth. \u001d  Despite interest from several private-equity groups, BCE was widely expected to be taken over by Telus, its leading rival. But last week, Telus decided not to submit a bid, citing \"inadequacies\" in the bidding process. It still could enter a friendly or hostile bid. \"For traditional companies like Telus, it's very difficult for them to go out and compete with private-equity shops,\" says Mr. Khan, of Interactive Broadband. Telus would have to expend much more capital and risk stock fluctuations, he says, and likely wouldn't return to the table unless it has an unbeatable deal. A Telus spokesman declined to comment yesterday. \u001d  Aside from Teachers, Cerberus Capital Management and the Hospitals of Ontario Pension Plan submitted a bid, as well as the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board and buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., despite a last-minute pullout of partners Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec in Montreal and Onex Corp. All are major Canadian funds partnered with U.S. private-equity firms because, according to federal law, foreign companies can own no more than 46.67% of telecom providers. \u001d  Yesterday, the Cerberus group was still considering its options, a person familiar with the matter said. This person said the group was frustrated with what it felt was an expedited bidding process. The group had presented a plan that would have offered $44 a share -- $38 in cash with an additional guarantee of $6 if BCE's price fell below $44. A BCE spokesman declined to comment. \u001d  BCE reported first-quarter net income of C$529 million on revenue of C$4.39 billion. \u001d  BCE was advised by Goldman Sachs, BMO Capital Markets, CIBC Capital Markets, and RBC Capital Markets. Greenhill & Co. advised a separate oversight board committee. Davies, Ward Phillips & Vineberg; Stikeman Elliott; and Sullivan & Cromwell provided legal advice. Citigroup was advised by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and TD Securities, with legal advice from Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Goodmans. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d

defended the natural-gas giant's aggressive foreign activity in an interview broadcast Sunday, dismissing European concerns about reliance on Russian gas and saying the company has reserves to match its wide-ranging plans. \u001d  Deputy Gazprom CEO Alexander Medvedev, the head of the state-controlled monopoly's export arm, said that European nations have little alternative to gas from Russia and other major sources over the next quarter-century or more. He suggested that talk of the need for diversification is misguided. \u001d  \"When in the long-term perspective only three countries in the world possess resources of gas that can satisfy demand over the next 25-30 years and on...I cannot quite imagine what kind of diversification we are talking about,\" he said. \u001d  In the interview with state-run Vesti-24 television, Medvedev said Russia is providing \"real diversification - diversification of transport routes, creation of underground storage capacity, where all risks - technological, transit-related, seasonal, weather-related - are, if not removed, then significantly lessened by this approach.\" \u001d  Russia currently supplies a quarter of Europe's oil and more than two-fifths of its gas. OAO Gazprom is seeking transit and distribution deals, including through the acquisition of shares in European energy companies, as part of a campaign to boost its presence in the region. \u001d  Moscow's reputation as an energy supplier was tarnished after sudden oil and gas shutdowns at the start of 2006 and 2007 amid politically charged price fights with ex-Soviet neighbors and led to shortfalls in supplies to the European Union. \u001d  Russia's increasing control of oil and natural gas supplies is causing concern in western European capitals, and both European and U.S. officials have accused Moscow of using its energy might as a political weapon. \u001d  Medvedev said Gazprom's strategy abroad was motivated by \"purely economic factors.\" \u001d  He also dismissed questions about whether the company has reserves to back its expansive moves. \u001d  \"We have enough gas for all contracts that are foreseen, both existing contracts and contracts that have not yet been signed, including gas for new markets - gas for supplies to China, Korea, gas for liquefaction and in general for supplies to the Asia-Pacific region and to the U.S. and Canadian markets,\" he said. \u001d  \"So our long-term gas balance is fully provided for by our reserves and our transport capabilities.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 10:50 ET (14:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"cd0e65ed64c5a18e57021d5b083101d6","symR":["LVD.LN","GB0005057541"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Lavendon Group plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LVD.LN","GB0005057541"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC"],"Story":"\u001d  Lavendon Group plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0005057541 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:29 ET (08:29 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cd1efa05a95b5eb1aff51eaff8e5ef34","symR":["KAMN"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Kaman Corporation","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KAMN"],"IndustryCodes":["DIB","SVC","XDJGI","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Kaman Corporation: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=KAMN or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:32 ET (08:32 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cd2720df2c3ebebc577e50fc1fb33328","symR":["EAR"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for HearUSA, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EAR"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  HearUSA, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=EAR or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:23 ET (08:23 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cd37b8f4ef88a4e4c9a151658fd5385e","symR":["CSQ"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Calamos Strategic Total Return Fund (CSQ)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CSQ"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Calamos Strategic Total Return Fund (CSQ): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=CSQ or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:38 ET (07:38 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cd462772e5b3448276cbc2c110c6e3a0","symR":["EDA.LN","NZNPVE0001S2"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Endace Ltd","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EDA.LN","NZNPVE0001S2"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX"],"Story":"\u001d  Endace Ltd: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=NZNPVE0001S2 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:50 ET (07:50 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cd53498a3503574918fa97a0dc5ee016","symR":["AFOP"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Alliance Fiber Optic Products","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AFOP"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Alliance Fiber Optic Products: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=AFOP or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:05 ET (07:05 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cd579fe456b31206e445e149dd0a758e","symR":["UKDAY","UKDAY"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Hometrack: UK June House Prices +0.3% On Mo, +6.4% On Year","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T23:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--U.K. house price growth slowed for the second straight month in June as the supply of available property increased and higher interest rates weighed on the market, property valuation company Hometrack said Monday. \u001d  The average U.K. house price rose 0.3% on the month in June, compared with growth of 0.6% in May, Hometrack said. The annual rise in prices eased to 6.4% from 6.7% in May. \u001d  \"The growth in supply comes at a time when demand is faltering on the back of recent increases in interest rates and widespread fears of further rate rises to come,\" said Richard Donnell, Hometrack's director of research. \u001d  \"With much of the new supply coming to the market from discretionary sellers looking to achieve close to the full asking price, it seems likely that the average time to sell property will increase in the months ahead with a slowdown in sales volumes and a switch to a buyers market,\" he said. \u001d  The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has delivered four 25-basis-point hikes since last August to bring its benchmark interest rate to 5.5% in a bid to slow inflation. \u001d  Earlier this month the bank's MPC voted 5-4 in favor of leaving rates steady, prompting many economists to bring forward their forecasts for the next rate hike to July and increasing market expectations for rates to rise to 6% by the end of the year. \u001d  The rate hikes have translated to higher mortgage payments for many homeowners and made buyers think twice before borrowing. In London, where house prices have risen strongly for 18 months, prices fell 3.5% in June from the corresponding month in 2006. On the month, prices in London rose 0.7% in June after increasing 1.3% in May. \u001d  \"The ratcheting up of interest rates since summer last year has finally caught up with the London market, which has been the engine for house price growth over the last 12 months,\" Donnell said. \"Housing market sentiment appears to be turning with buyers likely to become increasingly price sensitive over the second half of the year.\" \u001d  Nevertheless, Hometrack still expects U.K. house prices to rise 4% this year. \u001d  Elsewhere in the U.K., house prices rose 0.4% on the month in east Anglia and 0.3% in south east England. Prices were 0.2% higher in south west England, the west midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside. House prices rose 0.1% in northern England, the north west and in Wales and were unchanged in the east midlands. \u001d  The survey also showed the average time taken to sell a property had fallen for the third straight month to 6 weeks with an average number of viewings of 10.8. The sales price achieved as a percentage of the sellers asking price, meanwhile was 95.6%. \b \b                                   June           May \b                           On Mo   On Yr  On Mo   On Yr \b   Nationwide    +1.1%  +11.1%  +0.5%  +10.3% \b   Halifax                   N/A     N/A   +0.3%  +10.6% \b   Rightmove     +0.8%  +13.2%  +0.4%  +13.1% \b   Hometrack     +0.3%   +6.4%  +0.6%   +6.7% \b \u001d  Web site: www.hometrack.co.uk \b \u001d  -By Ilona Billington, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 7 842 9452; ilona.billington@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 19:01 ET (23:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"cd5de3be7363092b85ffbd950fa288c2","symR":["PACR"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Pacer International Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PACR"],"IndustryCodes":["TRS","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Pacer International Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=PACR or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:04 ET (09:04 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cd6f692a58ba95cfe06d01f9fbb4ac74","symR":["BELM"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Bell Microproducts","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BELM"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Bell Microproducts: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BELM or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:17 ET (07:17 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cd749844cdf2117f7d874f50a6a858cb","symR":["GB0004861505","GB00B00R3W36"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Topps Tiles Plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GB0004861505"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  Topps Tiles Plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0004861505 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:29 ET (09:29 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cd8527792a268f23179162dcab4d6a5b","symR":["UNIQ.LN","GB0030329253"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Uniq plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UNIQ.LN","GB0030329253"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Uniq plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0030329253 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:31 ET (09:31 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"cdd6ceca11b8b7ea01019c1e88b116bc","symR":["FEW.XE","DE0005753149"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Funkwerk AG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FEW.XE","DE0005753149"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI","XNMP"],"Story":"\u001d  Funkwerk AG: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0005753149 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"ce1d8bbd45ae411304256609cee6af48","symR":["GOOG"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(7/2) Finding The Best Measure Of `Corporate Citizenship'","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T23:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GOOG"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Phred Dvorak \u001d  Does good corporate behavior pay off in the stock market? Companies that track corporate governance and share performance say \"yes\" -- and investors agree. \u001d  But it's not always easy for investors to act on that notion. There's little consensus over what \"good governance\" is and how it should be measured. In the resulting muddle, it's sometimes hard to know who's a \"good\" corporate citizen. \u001d  Take Internet superstar Google Inc. The company made the 2007 \"World's Most Ethical Companies\" list of governance-tracker Ethisphere, because of its strong code of conduct and positive customer views of its behavior. But Audit Integrity Inc., which scrutinizes accounting behavior and litigation risk, ranks Google poorly. One recent red flag: Viacom Inc.'s copyright lawsuit against Google and its newly acquired YouTube video-sharing site. A Google spokesman says the strong Ethisphere rating reflects \"our unwavering commitment to serving our users\" but says he is unfamiliar with Audit Integrity. \u001d  The attention to governance and share performance comes in the wake of corporate shipwrecks such as Enron Corp., where shady accounting practices and lax oversight cost investors billions of dollars. GovernanceMetrics International Inc. began rating listed companies in 2002, in an attempt to assess their vulnerability to that sort of risk, says Chief Executive Howard Sherman. The company sells its ratings and research, as well as governance-consulting services. \u001d  GovernanceMetrics rates nearly 4,000 public companies globally, grading them on more than 400 variables, from financial restatements to training for directors. As of February, 40 companies had scored GovernanceMetrics' top grade of 10, including Chevron Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. \u001d  GovernanceMetrics says its highly ranked companies outperform others. \"Good governance translates into trust, and trust determines what you're willing to pay\" for a company's shares, says Mr. Sherman. \u001d  Analysts at Swiss private bank Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch & Cie. use GovernanceMetrics' ratings to assess the risks of investments and potential investments. \"Good corporate-governance practices will improve the value of a firm in the next years,\" says LODH analyst Jean-Cristophe Rochat. \u001d  Experts debate the importance of such ratings. Skeptics say studies of governance practices and share performance are skewed by other factors, such as an industry's results. Many studies are sponsored by companies that sell governance ratings or consulting services -- giving them a vested interest in showing their numbers are significant. \u001d  Moreover, once information about a company's governance practices is known, it is quickly priced into the stock. That means shares of companies with good governance ratings may not continue to post strong returns, says Shane Johnson, a finance professor at Texas A&M University and co-author of a recent paper on the subject. \u001d  Audit Integrity, another governance-tracking firm launched after the Enron scandal, says its ratings and research are used by insurers, auditors and asset managers. It also claims corporate good guys perform better than bad guys -- but uses very different measures than GovernanceMetrics to identify them. \u001d  It grades 8,000 companies on issues such as board independence and executive compensation, and  also analyzes the companies' accounting, penalizing murky bookkeeping methods. Audit Integrity then ranks companies' likelihood of being sued, restating results and underperforming the market. \u001d  The result: Audit Integrity and Governance Metrics offer very different lists of good guys. The only top GovernanceMetrics scorer that appears in Audit Integrity's top 100 is Louisiana-based energy company Entergy Corp. \u001d  Sabrient Systems LLC, which creates stock-picking models for professional investors, found Audit Integrity's ratings help boost performance by weeding out companies with risky governance practices, says director David Brown. Mr. Brown says he's now looking at other corporate-governance measures, although he finds the varied approaches confusing. \"I wish they all did it the same way,\" he says. \u001d  Audit Integrity Chairman and founder James Kaplan says the company tried -- and failed -- to find a connection between share performance and corporate governance alone. After including the accounting analysis, however, the firm's top-rated large companies posted better returns than the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. \u001d  Then there is Ethisphere, which ranked Google highly and is partly funded by ethics and compliance consultant Corpedia Inc. Ethisphere rates companies on issues such as transparency and the strength of compliance systems, then asks a company's suppliers and customers to rate its behavior. Ethisphere compares companies only with peers in the same industry, says Alex Brigham, Corpedia's CEO. Ethisphere says the 65 publicly traded companies on its top-ranked list outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 19:49 ET (23:49

\u001d  LOS ANGELES (AP)--Disney has put a rodent on top of the box office, though not the studio's venerable mascot, Mickey Mouse. \u001d  \"Ratatouille,\" an animated comedy about a gourmet rat that gets a chance to cook in a French restaurant, debuted as the No. 1 weekend movie with $47.2 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. \u001d  20th Century Fox's action thriller \"Live Free or Die Hard,\" Bruce Willis's return as unstoppable cop John McClane, opened in second-place with $33.15 million. Since opening Wednesday, the movie has grossed $48.2 million. \u001d  In narrower release, Michael Moore's health care documentary \"Sicko,\" released by the Weinstein Co. and Lionsgate, took in $4.5 million in its nationwide debut to finish at No. 9. The movie opened in one New York City theater a week earlier. \u001d  Focus Features' family drama \"Evening,\" with an all-star cast that includes Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Glenn Close and Claire Danes, opened at No. 10 with $3.5 million. \u001d  The previous weekend's No. 1 movie, Universal's \"Evan Almighty,\" fell to No. 3 with $15.1 million, raising its 10-day total to $60.6 million. The movie's sharp 52% fall from opening weekend dims the studio's prospects for recouping the enormous $175 million production budget for the film. \u001d  While \"Ratatouille\" easily dominated the weekend, it had the smallest debut among releases by Disney's Pixar Animation unit since 1998's \"A Bug's Life,\" which opened with $33.3 million. The other five Pixar films since then, among them \"Toy Story 2,\" \"Finding Nemo\" and last year's \"Cars,\" had opening weekends between $57.4 million and $70.5 million. \u001d  Chuck Viane, Disney's head of distribution, said \"Ratatouille\" was up against more competition than past Pixar flicks. With sparkling reviews for \"Ratatouille,\" Disney is counting on the staying power at theaters that other Pixar films have had. \u001d  \"Our whole idea was to set ourselves up for what we call the 10-day opening,\" Viane said of the upcoming Fourth of July week. \"We look at this as one extended playtime. We're in this for the long haul. We're glad we're No. 1, but we're not trying to make this just a weekend wonder.\" \u001d  Willis returned to the \"Die Hard\" franchise after a 12-year absence, and as Sylvester Stallone did last year with \"Rocky Balboa,\" he proved that an aging action hero still could pack theaters. \u001d  \"John McClane is everyman. He's a hero, but he's thrust into situations, and I think people love that,\" said Bert Livingston, general sales manager for Fox. \"He's clever, he's funny and he gets the job done.\" \u001d  \"Sicko,\" Moore's dissection of the ills of U.S. health care, played in 441 theaters, about half the number for his last movie, 2004's $100 million hit \"Fahrenheit 9/11.\" With a $23.9 million opening, \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" did five times as much business, though. \u001d  Still, \"Sicko\" had the second-best documentary debut ever behind \"Fahrenheit 9/11.\" By comparison, \"Ratatouille\" opened in nearly 4,000 theaters, about nine times as many as \"Sicko.\" \u001d  Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of the Weinstein Co., said he wanted to roll \"Sicko\" out slowly to give it a longer shelf life and keep Moore's stand for universal health care on the front burner. \u001d  \"The idea is to hold during the summer and just continue to build this thing,\" Weinstein said. \"I just think the debate in this country is going to catch up with the movie, so we've got to keep it slow.\" \u001d  Weinstein and Moore said they hoped \"Sicko\" would do in the range of the $21.6 million total for the filmmaker's 2002 Academy Award winner \"Bowling for Columbine.\" \u001d  If Sunday estimates hold, Hollywood's overall revenues will be up slightly, snapping a four-week downturn that has surprised analysts who had expected the industry to do record business this summer. The top-12 movies took in $146.7 million, up 2% from the same weekend last year. \u001d  \"For now, I'm glad we broke the down streak,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Media By Numbers. \"Four down weekends turns into five, which turns into eight, and then we have a slump on our hands. We didn't want to go in that direction.\" \u001d  Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Media By Numbers LLC. Final figures will be released Monday. \u001d  1. \"Ratatouille,\" $47.2 million. \u001d  2. \"Live Free or Die Hard,\" $33.15 million. \u001d  3. \"Evan Almighty,\" $15.1 million. \u001d  4. \"1408,\" $10.6 million. \u001d  5. \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,\" $9 million. \u001d  6. \"Knocked Up,\" $7.4 million. \u001d  7. \"Ocean's Thirteen,\" $6.05 million. \u001d  8. \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,\" $5 million. \u001d  9. \"Sicko,\" $4.5 million. \u001d  10. \"Evening,\" $3.5 million. \u001d  --- \u001d  Universal Pictures and Focus Features are owned

gateway said in a statement that the new prices will apply from September 1, 2007, but it now won't use asset revaluations to determine aeronautical pricing for the next 10 years. \u001d  \"We hope that this approach will remove much of the uncertainty and tension in the price setting process going forward,\" said Auckland Airport chief financial officer Robert Sinclair. \u001d  The company also said departure fees will remain at NZ$25 per departing passenger until July 1, 2008 and will be levied on the airlines, removing the need for passengers to pay the charge at the airport. \b \u001d

(Nasdaq: HSIC), the largest provider of healthcare products and services to office-based practitioners in the combined North American and European markets, today made a formal offer to acquire Software of Excellence International Ltd., (NZX: SOE), for NZ$2.70 per share. Including the payment of a NZ$.03 per share dividend by Software of Excellence to shareholders, the total consideration represents a 27% premium based on the closing price of SOE shares on April 27, 2007, the last trading day prior to when Software of Excellence made public the disclosure of a potential acquisition. Excluding transaction costs, the total purchase price of NZ$77.2 million (approximately $58.0 million), would be paid in cash. If completed, Henry Schein expects the transaction to be neutral to 2007 earnings and slightly accretive to 2008 earnings. \b \u001d  Software of Excellence is publicly listed in New Zealand and had revenue from continuing operations of approximately $19.1 million for its year ended March 31, 2007. The Company has been delivering innovative clinical and practice management solutions to Dental professionals since 1988, and now serves a customer base of more than 5,000 practices in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Software of Excellence is a leading supplier of practice management systems to both private and public health dentists in the United Kingdom, and is also the largest supplier of dental software in Australia and New Zealand. \b \u001d  \"We are very happy that the Independent Directors of Software of Excellence are recommending their security holders accept our offer,\" said Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein. \"By acquiring Software of Excellence we will be able to offer our dental customers another productivity tool, allowing them to focus more of their time delivering quality care to their patients.\" \b \u001d  Henry Schein has today delivered a formal takeover offer under New Zealand law for Software of Excellence. Investors representing approximately 23% of the outstanding shares and mandatory convertible notes of Software of Excellence, including Chief Executive Officer Brian Weatherly, and the company's largest shareholder, have entered into a lock-up agreement to accept this offer. \b \u001d  Henry Schein will be mailing formal offer documents to holders of Software of Excellence shares and mandatory convertible notes over the next 3 days. Henry Schein's offer will remain open until August 17, 2007 and is subject to the receipt of acceptances sufficient to provide Henry Schein with 90% or more of the voting rights in SOE. \b \b   About Henry Schein \b \u001d  Henry Schein, a Fortune 500(R) company, is recognized for its excellent customer service and highly competitive prices.

(T) said Sunday that the situation has improved. \u001d  \"We are working on any issues on an individual basis with customers who were impacted,\" said Michael Coe, a spokesman for AT&T, the Apple Inc. (AAPL) device's exclusive carrier. Nearly all customers have been able to activate their phones within five to eight minutes, he said. \u001d  Without activation, not even the phone's alarm clock works, leading some unhappy customers to joke that their inactive iPhones are little more than expensive paperweights. \u001d  AT&T attributed the problems to overloaded servers as large number of customers tried to activate their phones over the weekend. After being hit with the initial onslaught, AT&T made technical adjustments to its activation system so that new users wouldn't face the same delays, Coe said. \u001d  Customers with corporate accounts might also experience delays because AT&T needs authorization from the telecommunications manager at their company to switch them to an individual account, he said. \u001d  Rob Enderle, an industry analyst with The Enderle Group, said the activation problems probably won't hurt iPhone sales. \u001d  \"This kind of thing is not unusual when you have this number of people trying to buy something all at once,\" Enderle said. \u001d  Depending on how the companies handle customer's complaints, it could in fact help, he said. If customers feel the company has treated them well, they are more likely to buy and recommend its products in the future. \u001d  \"It doesn't matter whether your product breaks or not,\" Enderle said. \"It matters how well you treat your customers.\" \u001d  The iPhone, which also serves as an iPod media player and a wireless Web device, went on sale Friday evening after months of anticipation. Thousands of people lined up in front of Apple and AT&T stores across the country to be among the first to get one. \u001d  Apple has been updating its Web site nightly to report which of its stores have iPhones in stock. Nearly all AT&T stores have sold out, Coe said. \u001d  Apple would not provide details about iPhone sales figures or customer activation problems, but a spokeswoman said the company was working hard to resolve any issues. \u001d  \"There are a small percentage of iPhone customers who have had a less than perfect activation experience,\" said Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris. \u001d  Customers can activate the phones by logging on to Apple's iTunes software from their computers. Although many customers said they experienced no delays, others received a message saying activation \"will take some additional time.\" \u001d  Many buyers said their troubles began when they tried to switch from their current cell phone provider to AT&T. The activation problem has affected both existing AT&T wireless customers and those signing up from another cell phone carrier, Coe said. \u001d  As of Sunday afternoon, eBay Inc. said more than 2,700 iPhones had been sold on the online auction site at an average price of $740.18. The iPhone retails for $499 for the 4-gigabyte version and $599 for the 8-gigabyte model. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 20:23 ET (00:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f469668c75deeb03583211d855d58743","symR":["RS"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Reliance Steel & Alum","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RS"],"IndustryCodes":["STL","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Reliance Steel & Alum: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=RS or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:24 ET (09:24 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f48fdd3ad2f8118d39d02319178ef8e4","symR":["NAII"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Natural Alternatives Intl Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T08:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NAII"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Natural Alternatives Intl Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NAII or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 04:46 ET (08:46 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f4f0ec6761cc9f1b47dde635df29bacf","symR":["FKI.LN","GB0003294591"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for FKI PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T07:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FKI.LN","GB0003294591"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  FKI PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0003294591 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 03:56 ET (07:56 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f51f012eb075359450a8a42d51e017df","symR":["SHW"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Sherwin Williams Company","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-01T09:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SHW"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  Sherwin Williams Company: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=SHW or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 05:31 ET (09:31 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f541e6a0df8cbde3be15489827484d66","symR":["ASEI"],"date":"2007-07-01","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for American Science & Engr.

Her spare production and novel delivery made it a standout in a hip-hop market dominated by big beats and big boasts. The album won Britain's prestigious Mercury Music Prize, and led to a gig opening for a Gwen Stefani tour. \b \u001d  -- The Buzz: The new album, due in late August from Interscope Records, part of Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group, features collaborations with a handful of big names in hip-hop, including Timbaland. Despite the participation of mainstream stars, the first single from the album, \"Boyz,\" features M.I.A.'s trademark skittering electronic production. The 12-song album also includes percussion played by local musicians in Chennai, India -- recorded when Ms. Arulpragasam's difficulties securing a long-term U.S. work visa led her to look for other recording locations. \b \u001d  -- The Prospects: Despite its critical acclaim, \"Arular,\" M.I.A.'s previous album, sold a modest 128,000 copies in the U.S. Whether high-profile collaborations will ratchet her career to the next level, or undermine the very outsider charm that won over critics in the first place, remains to be seen. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 20:29

Prosecutors last month sought a two-year prison term for the Hanwha Group (HWG.YY) chairman in the attack on off-duty bar workers who had taken part in the altercation with his 22-year-old son. \u001d  Victims said Kim's bodyguards confronted them after the scuffle in March and forcibly took them to a construction site near the capital, where the tycoon attacked them with his feet, fists, a steel pipe and a stun gun, though none of the victims were seriously hurt. \u001d  Judge Kim Chul-hwan said Kim's responsibility for the crime was \"heavy,\" as the Hanwha chief mobilized his social clout and corporate organization to personally retaliate against the workers. \u001d  \"The violation of the law is big and is serious,\" Kim, the judge, said, adding the attacks were carried out in a \"systematic manner.\" \u001d  In his first trial session last month, the tycoon admitted to punching the bar workers during the attack in March but denied using the pipe and stun gun. The judge, however, found that the tycoon used both weapons in the attack, as alleged by the victims. \u001d  The 55-year-old tycoon, one of South Korea's richest people, also said he was the one who \"mainly beat\" the victims and that his bodyguards took over when he \"got tired.\" \u001d  Kim has been in jail since his May 11 arrest. \u001d  The dramatic details of the case, which media have likened to something out of a gangster movie, have drawn intense public interest in South Korea, where the heads of family controlled conglomerates wield great economic, political and social clout. \u001d  Hanwha was established in 1952 as the Korea Explosives Corp. It later developed interests in petrochemicals, finance, insurance, construction and retail. It also owns the Hanwha Eagles professional baseball team. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 01, 2007 22:29 ET (02:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

PCL (ATC.TH) and Rayong Refinery PCL (RRC.TH) into a new entity by early 2008, said PTT President Prasert Bunsumpun. \u001d  The move is part of PTT's realignment to strengthen the competitiveness of its refinery business. \u001d  The merger plan will be proposed to shareholders of the two units for approval. Once they give the green light, the merger process is expected be completed around late 2007 or early 2008, Prasert said late Friday. \u001d  The move will harness synergies between the two companies and help cut production costs, he added. \u001d  At present, PTT owns 49.84% of Aromatics and 48.75% of Rayong Refinery. \u001d  Prasert said PTT will further merge the new entity with its 49.50%-owned refinery flagship Thai Oil PCL (TOP.TH) next year. The merger would create a new company with a total market capitalization of over THB200 billion. \u001d  \"A larger-sized company would have a better potential to expand business and grow further,\"
