To facilitate that review, we intend to provide shortly equity and debt commitment letters for amounts necessary to effect the transaction and a proposed merger agreement that we would be prepared to enter into.  We are prepared to move very quickly to finalize the definitive transaction and related documents. \b \u001d  We believe that we offer a high degree of closing certainty and that we are well positioned to negotiate and complete the transaction in an expedited manner.

Keep in mind, when I wrote the list, I asked my readers to accept my mea culpa since my outlook would undoubtedly turn out to be off the mark, like most predictions. \b \u001d  Fortunately, they weren't way off. \b \b   Consuming Apple - On The Mark \b \u001d  In my '06 predictions, I said that Apple Computer Inc. (AAPL) would continue to shine as it grabs a larger share of new markets for entertainment gadgets and media centers that hold video, pictures and music. Apple was the fastest-growing shopping destination in '05, and holds that lead as measured by traffic since 2004, according to Nielsen//NetRatings. Apple was also the No. 7 music retailer in December 2006, according to comScore Networks. As for video, Apple also expanded its licensing deals and now sells full-length feature films from Walt Disney Co. (DIS) as well as television shows from CBS Corp. (CBS), NBC Universal, Fox and ABC. \b \u001d  Apple shares went from $32 to $71 in 2005. So making a bullish call on Apple was risky. Apple, however, managed to hit a high of $91 in November 2006, and ended the year at $85. \b \b   EBay vs. Comcast - On The Mark \b \u001d  In my predictions, I said that eBay Inc. (EBAY) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSK) would compete against each other for voice over Internet, or voIP, services. EBay did promote its Skype voIP services across its marketplace by integrating Skype-me buttons for sellers in multiple categories and in several countries. Skype has also certainly improved in the last year. There are now Skype phones, such as the one made by Netgear, that work in WiFi hotspots. The number of Skype users jumped 137% to 136 million users in the third quarter, the latest available figures. EBay also said that it expects Skype to generate $196 million in sales for 2006. I said that Skype would definitely surpass $200 million. So, I may be proven wrong. \b \u001d  As for Comcast, it now has 1.3 million subscribers and its voIP service is on an annualized run-rate of $900 million, according to Sanford Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett. \b \u001d  What I forgot to predict was the number of competing entrants into the voIP space, such as Jajah, Sightspeed and others. \b \b   The Rise Of Free Agents - On The Mark \b \u001d  In my predictions I said that amateur or user-generated video will emerge as entertaining content to be used in commercials, and amateur producers would be signed up by a major consumer brand, like Coca-Cola. It turns out that the amateur production of Diet Coke and Mentos was a hit with Coke and Google Inc. (GOOG). Coke signed up Eepybird - the producers of the video - to do more videos. And, Google began running the video/commercial in October. \b \b   Google Breaks $400, Commercializes Video \b   - On/Off The Mark \b \u001d  I predicted that Google would become the network operator for San Francisco's low-cost or free WiFi initiative, and break below $400 in 2006. Both those predictions came true. Despite the bullish momentum that drove Google shares to $466 in early January of last year, the stock crashed to $337 by March. But I was wrong in my prediction that Google would become an agent to all the amateur video producers, by charging users to watch videos and splitting the fees with the creators. I was wrong. It turns out that many other smaller video sites, such as Revver.com, Metacafe and Brightcove are trying to be the agents. I also predicted that Google's payment service would launch and that it would be offered as a way to pay for videos. Checkout did launch, but it's not being used to sell videos. \b \b   Tech Geeks Become Media Chic - On The Mark \b \u001d  I predicted that engineers would become increasingly valuable as content companies spend more resources on search and other interactive and communications tools to engage their audiences. It wasn't a tough prediction, I know. \"Between December 2005 and today, there has been a 6% increase in the number of engineering jobs available searching our extensive job database,\" said SimplyHired President and COO Dion Lim. \"Given that there are almost 240,000 job postings for engineers currently in our database, an increase of this nature means that there were about 20,000 new jobs offered for engineers in 2006.\" \b \b   Bloggers Turn Into Merchandisers - On The Mark \b \u001d  I predicted that companies would turn bloggers into salesmen. It was a prediction based on Yahoo Inc.'s (YHOO) \"Shoposphere\" service, which enables people to create personalized shopping lists around specific topics or interests. The ideas of personal selling and the power of getting the ordinary consumer to sell products aren't new, so it's not surprising to see it take off across the Web and from many companies, such as Kaboodle. \b \b   Video Sales Get Pumped Up - On The Mark \b \u001d  I predicted the video sales would jump in 2006. Now video sales aren't nearly as hot as music singles, and, many companies have opted to offer videos for free and make them ad-supported. But video sales are catching on. Apple has sold more than 35 million videos from its iTunes store. And, according to Strategy Analytics, sales of videos are estimated to be $298 million in 2006, up from $22 million in 2005. Those sales include television programs, short videos, movies and other videos through sources such as Apple's iTunes store, Amazon.com Inc.'s (AMZN) Unbox service and specialty providers such as MovieLink and CinemaNow. Video sales are estimated to grow to $1.5 billion in 2007. By comparison, advertising on video is estimated to grow to $775 million in 2007, up from $410 million in 2006, according to eMarketer. \b \b   Meat-Market Cleanup - On The Mark \b \u001d  I predicted that there would be a social-network crackdown. That was pretty accurate. In April of 2006, News Corp.'s (NWS) MySpace hired Hemanshu Nigam as security czar to oversee child safety measures and thwart sexual predators. \b \b   Social Serendipity - On The Mark \b \u001d  My favorite prediction was that Internet users would begin to socialize in ways they couldn't even imagine. This was definitely on the mark. Just take a look at the interaction of people on the virtual economy and civilization on Second Life or related social commerce sites, such as Cyworld or Wallop. Or, take a look at YouTube, where people create video soap operas, or where people connect with one another via video. Or, thanks to Wikipedia, take a look at the way people are collaborating through all sorts of wikis, from Wikia to ABC's \"Lost\" wiki-community, created by Wetpaint.com. \b \b   Amazon Galaxy - Off The Mark \b \u001d  I made a playful prediction about Google, NASA and Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos shaking hands to collaborate on space missions. That never happened. But Bezos has continued to build out his startup company, whose mission is to build inexpensive \"human access to space.\" \b \b   Microsoft/Yahoo vs. Google/AOL - Off The Mark \b \u001d  I predicted that Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Yahoo would forge a greater alliance beyond making their instant messaging clients compatible, especially since Google took a $1 billion stake in AOL. Well, I was quite off. And, Yahoo has some tough times ahead as it executes its reorganization and Panama. Forging alliances may be too distracting as it tries to focus internally. \b \u001d  That said, a closer partnership may be one of my predictions for 2007. To that end, stay tuned for my Thursday column, in which I will be laying out my 2007 predictions. \b \u001d  Happy New Year! \b \u001d  (Bambi Francisco is Internet editor for MarketWatch in San Francisco.) \u001d  -By Bambi Francisco; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 08:11 ET (13:11 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"02954bb97c14b5cda5d4cd49e55599ba","symR":["EBHI","GOLDEN.XX","SCPP.XX"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Eddie Bauer: Antitrust Waiting Period For Sale Ends >EBHI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T14:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EBHI","GOLDEN.XX","SCPP.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","RTS","SAP","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Eddie Bauer Holdings Inc.

MacPhail, President and Chief Operating Officer. \"Our net sales level has made CI the top-selling non-bank fund company and the third best-selling fund company overall.\" \b \bIn 2006, CI's assets under management grew $8.4 billion or 15.4% to $62.7 billion, and total fee-earning assets grew $9.9 billion or 13.9% to $81.6 billion. Both are record levels for CI. \b \bThe year was capped by a month of impressive retail fund sales. In December 2006, CI Investments Inc. had gross sales of $806 million and net sales of $269 million. In addition, United Financial Corporation had gross sales of $110 million and net sales of $23 million, resulting in combined net sales of $292 million for the month. \b \bFor the calendar year, CI Investments had gross sales of $9.3 billion and net sales of $2.3 billion, while United Financial had gross sales of $1.1 billion and net redemptions of $95 million. \b \b\"CI is well positioned for another successful year in 2007,\" Mr. MacPhail said. \"For example, CI Investments is planning to launch an exciting new product this spring and early indications are that it will be very well received by advisors and their clients. \b \b\"Furthermore, we continue to see good performance across our product lineup, both at CI Investments and United Financial.\" \b \bCI's lineup of Canadian equity funds is particularly outstanding, with all of CI Investments' funds in this category ranked first quartile over five years ending November 30, 2006. In the global category, CI Global High Dividend Advantage Fund, which was launched in February 2006 and invests in dividend-paying global companies, has gathered over $350 million in assets. \b \bCI Investments continued to lead the industry in 2006 with the most funds with Morningstar Canada's top five-star rating. Morningstar announced in December that CI Investments had 46 mutual and segregated funds with five stars at November 30, 2006. \b \bCI's assets under management at December 31, 2006 consisted of investment fund assets at CI Investments and United Financial of $61.8 billion and structured products/closed-end funds of $923 million. CI's administered/other assets of $18.9 billion included institutional assets at Trilogy Global Advisors, LLC, which generate fees for CI, and $17.1 billion in assets under administration at Assante Wealth Management (Canada) Ltd. and IQON Financial Management Inc. (net of assets under management at United Financial), which generate fees for those companies. \b \bReflecting CI's increased asset base and strong cash flow, CI has increased its distribution to unitholders to $0.18 monthly or $2.16 annually per trust unit of CI and exchangeable limited partnership unit of Canadian International LP beginning with this month's payment on January 15. This represents a yield of 8.08% on CI's closing unit price of $26.72 on December 29, 2006.

Toyobo plans to take a 70% stake in the joint venture. \u001d  In addition, Toyobo will spend about Y1.5 billion to boost its capacity for nonwoven fabric by 25% to 12,500 tons a year as early as 2008. The material is used for automotive seats and headliners. \u001d  Toyobo will also increase the output of engine filters at a U.S. affiliate by 2008, investing about Y1 billion. \u001d  For packaging films for cell phones, the company will spend several hundred million yen to upgrade equipment at its domestic bases. Demand for this film is quickly growing, with the firm aiming to increase sales of this product by more than 10-fold to more than Y10 billion by 2009. \u001d  Toyobo is beginning to stress these products now that it is in the final stages of restructuring its unprofitable apparel textile business. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 11:26 ET (16:26 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"041bd450fd79eb67fc64a7458949fd30","symR":["UKDAY"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"London Open Gold And Silver At 0800 GMT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T08:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":["PCS"],"Story":"\b \bGold    $639.00-$639.50  ($634.04-$634.50) \bSilver $12.99-$13.07     ($12.77-$12.87) \b \bContact: Ken Gridley, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-20-7842-9484; ken.gridley@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 03:01 ET (08:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"04eba75ec2a33a413c498db1a40a5e27","symR":["IAR"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Idearc Inc.

(AP)--A rejected suitor for the Hard Rock chain of cafes, casinos and related businesses claims in a lawsuit that the Seminole Tribe of Florida was the successful buyer because of improper collusion and bid-rigging. \u001d  The lawsuit was filed late Friday in Broward County Circuit Court. \u001d  The Baltimore, Md.-based development firm The Cordish Co. and an affiliate, Power Plant Entertainment LLC, contend that Hard Rock Cafe International Inc. management secretly negotiated with the Seminoles for seven months before plans to sell were announced in July. \u001d  The Seminoles announced the $965 million purchase of the Hard Rock empire from London-based Rank Group PLC (RNK.LN) on Dec. 7, marking the first time a Native American tribe had purchased a major international corporation. \u001d  Power Plant, a partnership between Cordish and Coastal Development LLC, was the original developer of the Seminole Hard Rock casinos and hotels in the Florida cities of Hollywood and Tampa. \u001d  The Cordish lawsuit said the company and its banker, Goldman Sachs & Co. (GS), were refused the right to bid for the business even though they could have made a larger offer. \u001d  \"We were declined the opportunity to bid, which is kind of amazing. We believe we would have prevailed,\" said Marty Steinberg, the Miami-based attorney for Cordish. \u001d  The Seminoles agreed to keep Hard Rock managers in place and provide them with \"additional financial benefits\" if the tribe was the successful bidder, according to the lawsuit. \u001d  \"Their actions were motivated by self-dealing and a desire to enrich themselves,\" the lawsuit says. \u001d  A spokesman for Hard Rock Cafe International declined comment Tuesday. The Seminoles also had no immediate comment. \u001d  The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, which could be tripled under Florida law. \u001d  The Seminole-Hard Rock deal includes 124 Hard Rock Cafes, four hotels, two casino hotels, two concert venues and stakes in three unbranded hotels.

Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who took up lobbying with Bryan Cave Strategies last year and opened his own shop after the election. \u001d  The changes under way can be felt all the way to the top of influential organizations. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers last month named former Democratic Rep. Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma as the trade group's new president. McCurdy, who left Congress in 1994 to mount an unsuccessful run for Senate, will replace Fred Webber, a former official in the Nixon and Ford administrations. \u001d  Some lobbying firms already have a head start. For example, the Federalist Group, a Republican firm, hired former Louisiana Democratic Rep. Chris John last March and is now adding more Democrats to the firm in hopes of expanding its $14.6 million a year lobbying business. \u001d  \"The firms that will be in trouble are the ones that stayed the course - you can use those three words, 'stayed the course' - and were blinded by what was happening in the Congress,\" said John, one of the leaders of the moderate to conservative Blue Dog Democrats in the House. \"Those are the ones that are going to be hurt.\" \u001d  The Federalist Group, a subsidiary of Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide, which in turn is owned by WPP Group PLC (WPPGY), will now become Ogilvy Government Relations, shedding a name that had become synonymous with Republican lobbying. John also recently hired Moses Mercado, deputy executive director of the Democratic National Committee. \u001d  Some lobbyists concede that after years of seeking to influence Republicans, those lobbying firms and trade groups predominantly made up of Republicans will have to work harder to be heard. \u001d  \"Memories in this town are very long,\" said Paul Miller, a lobbyist and the outgoing president of the American League of Lobbyists. \"Unless their relationship is very good with those Democratic members, you still may have a tough time. But you would have an easier time if you would have hired a Democrat.\" \u001d  Still, the reality in Washington is that neither side holds the upper hand. A Republican president still has the White House and the 51-49 Democratic margin in the Senate is so slim that any substantive legislation would require a bloc of GOP votes. \u001d  \"Anything you do in this town, you have to work both sides of the aisle,\" said Bruce Josten, the top lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u001d  It hasn't always been that way. For years, the Republican Party, led by House GOP leader Tom DeLay, promoted a plan to put more Republicans in key lobbying positions. Now, some trade groups are scrambling to correct the imbalance. \u001d  The lobbying industry's readjustment comes as Congress considers further restrictions on how lawmakers and lobbyists interact - a response to the influence-peddling scandals that have rocked the capital over the last two years. Pending legislation would extend to two years the current one-year ban on lobbying Congress by former senators, House members and congressional staffers. \u001d  For former lawmakers or top notch congressional staffers, the financial incentives are huge. Mid to high six-figure salaries are not unusual for the well-connected.

Canadian markets were closed Monday for New Year's Day. \u001d  The Canadian dollar's movements thus far Tuesday have largely consisted of aimless, choppy gyrations within a tight C$1.1630 to C$1.1655 range, with little deviation expected until full trading resumes on Wednesday. \u001d  There are no Canadian economic data releases scheduled until Thursday, and currency market illiquidity is being exacerbated Tuesday by only limited activity from the U.S. as that nation prepares for Ford's funeral. \u001d  Currency watchers said a slightly weaker global tone for the U.S. dollar has enabled the Canadian dollar to crawl slightly higher, though the currency remains undermined by some of the negative factors that contributed to the slide with which it ended 2006. \u001d  Among these have been downward pressure on prices of key Canadian dollar-sensitive commodities like crude oil and natural gas, as well as a sense that a recent string of poor Canadian economic indicators will lead the Bank of Canada into again downgrading its growth estimates and perhaps switching to a more dovish policy stance. \u001d  The central bank makes its next scheduled interest rate announcement on Jan. 16, followed by a monetary policy report update on Jan. 18. \u001d  For the immediate near term however, movements for the Canadian dollar are likely to be modest, and driven mainly by external factors such as commodity prices. \u001d  \"Given the lack of event risk, price moves in U.S. dollar-Canada are expected to be driven by cross flows and the performance of commodity markets,\" said chief foreign exchange technical analyst George Davis of RBC Capital Markets in Toronto in a note to clients. \"Weaker crude oil and natural gas prices continue to undermine the Canadian dollar, thereby sustaining the depreciation that was witnessed as we ended 2006.\" \u001d  Davis suggested that the U.S. dollar for the short term has support in the C$1.1611 to C$1.1630 region, and faces resistance around the C$1.1670 mark. \u001d  Canadian bonds are higher in light trading early Tuesday, with the yield on the benchmark government of Canada 10-year bond at 4.07%, from 4.08% late Friday. \u001d  These are the exchange rates at 10:17 a.m. EST (1517 GMT), 8:00 a.m. EST (1300 GMT), and late Friday. \b   USD/CAD     1.1644     1.1635     1.1667 \b   EUR/CAD     1.5455     1.5440     1.5398 \b   CAD/JPY     102.02     102.17     102.08 \u001d  -By Paul Evans; Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2022; paulr.evans@dowjones.com \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 10:25 ET (15:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0aa2fb0bd505bf473f646dca39ab74a0","symR":["HERO"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Hercules Offshore CFO Suffers Stroke>HERO","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T21:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HERO"],"IndustryCodes":["DRL","OIE","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:04 ET (21:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0ae4f8e3a68a4e1b0f2f81ece524c155","symR":["SVT.LN","GB00B1FH8J72","SVT.LN","GB00B1FH8J72"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Severn Trent Completes Sale Of STL To TestAmerica","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T09:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SVT.LN","GB00B1FH8J72"],"IndustryCodes":["WAT","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 04:58 ET (09:58 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0aee3e100ae6ce10fa33b3452c8fd260","symR":["FJCC"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Fedders Sells Land Parcel In Maryland","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T22:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FJCC"],"IndustryCodes":["HPD","HPR"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LIBERTY CORNER, N.J., Jan. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Fedders Corporation (OTC: FJCC) a leading global manufacturer of air treatment products, including air conditioners, furnaces, air cleaners, dehumidifiers and humidifiers for residential, commercial and industrial markets, today announced that on December 29, 2006 it sold 182 acres of undeveloped land in Frederick, Maryland to a Maryland-based investor group for $4.5 million.

(HDL) so badly of late, it could be a good investment. \u001d  The Troy, Mich., company, one of the world's largest music distributors which operates the music departments of big-box stores such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), stumbled from one pratfall to another in 2006, making its stock chart look like a ski slope. Problems included sliding CD sales, pains with an acquisition, missed earnings goals, accounting confusion, a president who quit after a month and even Justin Timberlake's risque reinvention. Yet some institutional investors have increased their stakes lately, attracted by a stock that's selling for half its book value, at around $7 a share, after trading for as much as $26.47 in 2004. \u001d  \"I don't think it's the end of the world for CDs,\" said John Bendall, the principal of Hermitage Capital, a Handleman shareholder. While their lead shrank dramatically, CDs still outsold digital downloads almost 15 to one in 2005 - the latest year for which data are available, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. \u001d  Bendall, who takes positions in companies he thinks will be bought out - with some recent success, thinks private-equity buyers will be interested in Handleman because it has potential to generate cash. It's especially attractive when trading at such a low multiple. \u001d  \"As we say in the South, the sherriff would pay you $10 (a share) for it in a liquidation,\" said Bendall, a New York-based Southerner. \u001d  As of the end of October, Handleman's book value was about $13.75 a share. \u001d  Handleman spokesman Greg Mize said investors are likely concerned about the music industry and about the company's dependance on a few big customers but noted that Handleman plans to diversify its product line and customer base. \u001d  But at the root of many of Handleman's troubles in 2006 was its effort to move beyond music distribution to insulate itself from the slow death of the CD. In late 2005, the company purchased video-game distributor Crave Entertainment Group, promising that profits from the unit would come rolling in within the year. \u001d  Handleman, however, didn't bargain for a delay in the launch of Sony Corp.'s (SNE) new game console or for the long time it took computer-game makers to put out \"next-generation\" games. The unit has yet to turn a profit. \u001d  Long term, Michael Cai, director of broadband and gaming at market-research company Parks Associates, said video games may face similar competition as CDs from digital sales over the Internet. \u001d  But given the hammerlock that Wal-Mart has on video-game sales and that 99% of console games are currently sold through retail outlets, the Internet pressures may be a long way off, Cai said. \b \b   Wider Losses \b \u001d  Largely due to the underperformance of the video-game unit, which represents about 12% to 15% of sales, Handleman posted wider losses and missed Wall Street targets in the first two quarters of fiscal 2007. (Handleman's fiscal year ends in April.) \u001d  \"There's some seasonality and we're currently in the busiest time of the fiscal year,\" Mize said about the video-game business' prospects this quarter. But the company will need hefty profits this quarter to make up for the last two quarters. \u001d  In its fiscal second quarter ended in October, a tax charge of $8.8 million hurt results. \u001d  \"I'd say there was a large swing (in tax estimates) between the first and second quarter,\" Mize said. \u001d  The tax charge widened Handleman's fiscal second-quarter loss to $14.2 million; Wall Street expected a profit. The explanation of the charge on the press release, which cited \"the impact on income tax results from a revision in projected full year operating results,\" confused analysts and accountants. \u001d  \"I asked two other certified public accountants (who are practicing auditors) what this meant and they had trouble understanding it,\" said David Appel, partner in charge of tax and business services at Miami accounting and advisory firm Rachlin Cohen & Holtz. \u001d   \"If the CPAs are having difficulty understanding it, how is the average person going to understand it?\" \u001d  According to Debra Jeter, a professor of accounting of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, the charge may mean the company decided that the \"whole year was looking bad\" in terms of profitability. \u001d  Jeter said current tax accounting rules \"leave the door open for some earnings management.\" \b \b   One-Month President \b \u001d  Another unsettling situation in 2006 was the brief reign of John Beeder as president and chief operating officer. He was named to the post in late July and resigned on Aug. 31, citing concerns with his former employer Hallmark Cards Inc. triggered by Handleman's small greeting-cards business. \u001d  Mize, the Handleman spokesman, said he didn't know whether the company was aware of Beeder's non-compete agreement with Hallmark when it hired him. He said Beeder knew Handleman was testing a greeting-cards distribution unit when he signed for the job. \u001d  Beeder, reached at his home in Kansas, refused to comment on the matter. \u001d  There is some light at the end of the tunnel, however: Handleman recently signed a deal with British supermarket chain Tesco PLC (TSCO.LN) to manage video-game, DVD, greeting-cards and CD supplies for the company. The deal, worth about $50 million a year in revenue, may carry better margins than current arrangements because Handleman won't bear the risk by taking ownership of the inventory. \u001d  Handleman will also hope that Justin Timberlake's next album isn't marked unsuitable for children, disqualifying it for display at Wal-Mart - another strange twist that hurt revenue in 2006. \u001d  -By Rob Curran, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5176; robert.curran@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 14:00 ET (19:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0c5fcae3d2132ef0624da917fe654b65","symR":["MAT"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": American Girl's New 'Girl of the Year' Character Inspires Girls to Help Others","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T14:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MAT"],"IndustryCodes":["ENT","TMF","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bAmerican Girl's New 'Girl of the Year' Character Inspires Girls to Help Others \b\b \b- National Mother/Daughter Contest Seeks Real Girls with Caring and Helpful Spirits - \b\b \b\b \b   MIDDLETON, Wis., Jan. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Whether it's assisting with \bdisaster-relief efforts, rescuing animals in need, or helping an elderly \bneighbor, girls today are making a significant impact on our world.

Hadeed is the Gulf Region's \blargest steel producer with an annual production output of more than \bfour million tons. MultiServ's contracts call for the operation and \bsupport of two mill-owned dockside gantry cranes to offload incoming \biron ore from ocean-going ships, and the monitoring and maintenance of \bthe mill's eight mile (approximately 13 km) conveyor belt system which \btransports the ore to the steel plant. The conveyor services contract \breflects MultiServ's expanding capabilities for providing conveyor belt \bmanagement services, an outgrowth of Harsco's acquisitions in 2005 and \b2006 of two leading providers of conveyor belt management and \bmaintenance services to the steel industry and other industrial \bclients. A typical integrated steelworks can have as many as 40 to 50 \bmiles of conveyor belts on its premises. MultiServ will also assume \bresponsibility for the regular processing and clean-out of Hadeed's \bsteelmaking ladles, tundishes and Electric Arc Furnace refractories, \btaking over work previously performed by a local contractor, and before \bthat, by the mill itself. \b \b   The new contracts add to the more than $100 million in new \bMultiServ mill service contract awards announced by Harsco within the \bpast several months, including new contracts at mills in Argentina, \bBrazil and Mexico. The awards are consistent with Harsco's stated \bstrategic objectives for expanding its overall presence in the Latin \bAmerica, Middle East and Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia-Pacific \bregions to a targeted 30 percent of total sales within the next few \byears, and measured against a steadily growing total sales base. These \bregions currently account for approximately 17 percent of Harsco's \btotal sales. \b \b   Harsco Corporation is a diversified, worldwide company with \bfour market-leading business groups that provide mill services, access \bservices, engineered products and services, and gas containment and \bcontrol technologies to customers around the globe. The Company employs \bapproximately 21,000 people in 45 countries of operation. Harsco's \bcommon stock is a component of the S&P MidCap 400 Index and the Russell \b1000 Index.

The vehicle also features Delphi's award-winning selectable color instrument cluster, and ultrasonic content theft detection and inclination sensing, both of which are available on the current production Mustang. \b \u001d  In addition, Delphi has included a keyless entry fob which includes a display for vehicle information. \b \b    Integrated Controls \b \u001d  Delphi's Integrated Center Panel delivers a host of benefits to automakers. It replaces separate HVAC, radio, entertainment and communications, accessory switches and other functional switches with a single mechatronic module. This eliminates clutter on the instrument panel and enhances interior aesthetics. \b \u001d  The innovative design also reduces wiring harness mass and cost, provides for easier vehicle assembly, and greatly reduces the difficulty of matching colors and finishes across a variety of separate components.  And, because the system offers a wide array of packaging options, it can help automakers deliver distinctive vehicles that stand out from the competition. \b \u001d  \"We continue to find ways to help our customers provide new technology while staying competitive in the market,\" said Jugal Vijayvargiya, Delphi Electronics & Safety vice president of Controls & Security product business unit. \"Our Integrated Center Panel with dual view brings both - innovation and value together.\" \b \u001d  The Integrated Center Panel is available with touch-screen and traditional switching interfaces. Delphi can integrate switch functions for a centrally mounted touch screen which allows for intuitive selection of climate, audio, video, navigation, telephone and vehicle personalization settings. \b \u001d  The touch screen system also features Delphi's patent-pending Driver/Passenger Discrimination sensing. This feature enables the driver and passenger to use the same controls to generate different responses from the vehicle - for example permitting the passenger to use vehicle navigation features that are inaccessible to the driver while the vehicle is in motion. By applying active infrared sensors on the integrated center panel and an adaptive human machine interface design, Delphi's innovative technology can discriminate between driver and passenger control inputs, offering a \"dual- zone control\" capability. \b \u001d  Another unique patent-pending feature is detection of a driver attempting to lean over to view the passenger's display. This technology disables the display when this occurs. \b \b    Displays: Color Selectable Instrument Cluster \b \u001d  The Mustang GT on display features Delphi's award-winning color-selectable instrument cluster. The cluster display has been expanded to include color- selectable cockpit switch backlighting controlled by an intuitive human machine interface (HMI). The instrument cluster and cockpit switches can be subtly or dramatically illuminated using red, green and blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Using Delphi's innovative \"light pipe\" technology, the driver can mix and blend the intensity of red, green and blue LEDs to create up to 240 different custom-colored illumination schemes. This unique feature allows the driver to modify all of the cockpit illumination from door-to-door to provide a personalized interior environment. The color selection is all controlled via a simple, intuitive control scheme within the Integrated Center Panel control and display. \b \u001d  \"Interior aesthetics and lighting provide a huge level of overall owner satisfaction, Vijayvargiya said. \"By offering customization, Delphi's instrument cluster technology provides this enjoyment for each individual driver.\" \b \b    Security Systems \b \u001d  Using a transponder and hidden antennas which communicate bi- directionally, Delphi's Keyless Entry System with Vehicle Information Display enables the vehicle to be locked from further away than before. It also enables the driver to access critical information about the vehicle at ranges greater than 500 meters. \b \u001d  Delphi's two-way communication key fob provides the vehicle owner with actual status of the car such as whether the car is locked or the alarm is activated. Other information included in the display are interior temperature, alarm condition, fuel level and vehicle location. The information is displayed in a large, easy-to-read organic LED display on the driver's personal fob while using very little current to prolong battery life. The two-way communication device also includes a communication range management feature which ensures that returned information to the car is always received by the identification device. The Delphi show car is started by pressing a start switch when the key fob is in range. \b \u001d  Delphi's ultrasonic content theft detection sensors on the vehicle provide security by detecting movement within the passenger compartment while the Delphi inclination sensors improve vehicle theft protection level with the ability to trigger the alarm in case of wheel thefts or towing thefts. This sensor can be used as a standalone feature or as an integrated component of the total alarm systems. \b \u001d  \"Delphi security products value is immeasurable as they provide drivers with peace of mind regarding their vehicles,\" said Vijayvargiya. \b \u001d  Delphi is a leader in automotive alarm systems supplying more than 2.5 million alarm systems in 2006 and has delivered over 20 million systems since the product was launched. \b \b    For more information about Delphi (OTC: DPHIQ), visit www.delphi.com. \b \b    FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT \b \u001d  This press release, as well as other statements made by Delphi may contain forward-looking statements within the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that reflect, when made, the company's current views with respect to current events and financial performance. Such forward-looking statements are and will be, as the case may be, subject to many risks, uncertainties and factors relating to the company's operations and business environment which may cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from any future results, express or implied, by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: the ability of the company to continue as a going concern; the ability of the company to operate pursuant to the terms of the debtor-in-possession (\"DIP\") financing facility; the company's ability to obtain court approval with respect to motions in the chapter 11 proceeding prosecuted by it from time to time; the ability of the company to develop, prosecute, confirm and consummate one or more plans of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 cases; risks associated with third parties seeking and obtaining court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for the company to propose and confirm one or more plans of reorganization, for the appointment of a chapter 11 trustee or to convert the cases to chapter 7 cases; the ability of the company to obtain and maintain normal terms with vendors and service providers; the company's ability to maintain contracts that are critical to its operations; the potential adverse impact of the Chapter 11 cases on the company's liquidity or results of operations; the ability of the company to execute its business plans, including the transformation plan described in the Company's March 31, 2006 press release, and to do so in a timely fashion; the ability of the company to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and associates; the ability of the company to avoid or continue to operate during a strike, or partial work stoppage or slow down by any of its unionized employees; and the ability of the company to attract and retain customers. Other risk factors are listed from time to time in the company's United States Securities and Exchange Commission reports, including, but not limited to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005. Delphi disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events and/or otherwise. Similarly, these and other factors, including the terms of any reorganization plan ultimately confirmed, can affect the value of the company's various pre- petition liabilities, common stock and/or other equity securities. Additionally, no assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies. A plan of reorganization could result in holders of Delphi's common stock receiving no distribution on account of their interest and cancellation of their interests. Under certain conditions specified in the Bankruptcy Code, a plan of reorganization may be confirmed notwithstanding its rejection by an impaired class of creditors or equity holders and notwithstanding the fact that equity holders do not receive or retain property on account of their equity interests under the plan. In light of the foregoing and as stated in its October 8, 2005, press release announcing the filing of its Chapter 11 reorganization cases, the company considers the value of the common stock to be highly speculative and cautions equity holders that the stock may ultimately be determined to have no value. Accordingly, the company urges that appropriate caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in Delphi's common stock or other equity \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 10:01 ET (15:01 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"0dd02dc96148ccd14758e3d73ceeb293","symR":["CPC.YY"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Taiwan's CPC To Cut Gasoline Prices By NT$0.4/Liter Wed","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T09:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CPC.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 04:03 ET (09:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0df7525815f71fb2b7093c22e94395de","symR":["7203.TO","7267.TO","DCX","DCX.XE","F","GM","HMC","TM","DE0007100000","JP3633400001","JP3854600008","US3704421052"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Slower Dec.

Stoll \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--As auto makers report December U.S. sales on Wednesday, a decline in fleet sales to rental agencies and significant weakness at Ford Motor Co. (F) are expected to fuel an overall market pullback for the month. The slide may be a prelude to a difficult year ahead for car sales and domestic vehicle production. \u001d  Analysts forecast that December industry sales will slide as much as 6%, aided by what could be a double-digit percentage decline at Ford, despite heavy year-end sales incentives and an expected uptick in luxury car sales. Other domestic auto makers are seen posting nearly flat sales for the month, while recent sales gains are expected to continue for Asian auto makers such as Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) and Honda Motor Co. (HMC). \u001d  Even with December's expected slide, full-year auto sales are seen reaching about 16.5 million vehicles in 2006. While the result is down more than 2% from the 16.9 million sold in 2005, the volume still represents historically strong demand, according to trade publication Ward's Automotive Reports, which tracks U.S. auto sales. \u001d  But demand for new light vehicles may hit headwinds this year amid a continued housing market slump, and as U.S. auto makers back away from unprofitable practices that helped pump up demand in prior years. Ford and General Motors Corp. (GM), for example, have both laid out plans to reduce fleet sales and lessen their reliance on incentives, such as discounts and rebates. \u001d  In a research note released to investors last week, Merrill Lynch auto analyst John Murphy forecasted that auto sales will sink to about 16 million vehicles in 2007, an outlook mirrored by many other auto analysts. Sales in the low 16 million range would represent the lowest annual sales tally of the decade. \u001d  \"The slowdown in new vehicle sales observed in the past few months appears now likely to persist well into\" 2007, Lehman Brothers Inc. auto analyst Brian Johnson said in a recent note to investors. \u001d  Comerica Bank Chief Economist Dana Johnson said that car sales in particular will be harder to produce in the first half of 2007. \"Cars are a big ticket item and sometimes people take equity out of their houses to finance a down payment and there has been less of that available,\" the economist said. \u001d  Dana Johnson predicted that auto sales will speed up in the second half of the year as overall economic growth begins to rebound. \u001d  Merrill Lynch's Murphy said that the relative profitability of vehicle sales could also fade in 2007 as consumers continue to move away from SUVs and pickups in favor of more fuel-efficient passenger cars and crossover models. Light trucks rake in a higher profit margin for auto makers. \u001d  Comerica's Johnson said Detroit's auto makers may be able to better handle lower sales volumes in 2007 thanks to the severe job cuts that were executed in 2006. Ford and GM will dismiss as many as 72,000 hourly workers in the U.S. by September via recently staged accelerated attrition programs. DaimlerChrysler AG's (DCX) Chrysler Group is expected to announce additional job cuts in February. \u001d  Johnson said fewer workers for the Big Three means it should be less costly to shut down or slow assembly lines. GM, Ford and Chrysler cut production in 2006 and the cutback is expected to continue through at least the first half of 2007. \u001d  Lehman's Johnson estimates that 2007 North American auto production will fall 100,000 vehicles, or 7%, below 2006's \"already low\" level of 15.3 million vehicles. He said Big Three production will fall 5% in 2007, following a 7% decline last year, as Detroit's market share continues to fade. \u001d  -By John D.

(CME) unit CME said in a press release Tuesday that average daily volume for its interest rate products, which make up the bulk of CME's trading volume, was nearly 2.99 million contracts in December, a 58% increase over the previous year. Overall average daily volume at CME jumped 44% last month to 5.4 million contracts. \u001d  CBOT Holdings Inc. (BOT) unit CBOT, which plans to merge with CME in the middle of this year, reported Tuesday average daily volume of 2.16 million contracts in its financial complex for December, up nearly 40% over the previous year. CBOT's overall average daily volume was 2.77 million contracts last month, a 40% increase from the year earlier period. \u001d  Credit Suisse analyst Howard Chen said CME volume was \"strong through the finish,\" and called CBOT's December growth \"impressive,\" in research notes Tuesday. Chen raised his fourth quarter earnings per share estimates for CBOT to $1.03 from a prior estimate of $1. \u001d  Banc of America analyst Christopher Allen, on the other hand, trimmed his fourth-quarter CBOT earnings per share estimate to $1.01 from $1.06. While CBOT December volume growth was \"robust\" on a year-over-year basis, volume was down sharply from record November levels, Allen said. \u001d  Traders use products like eurodollars at CME and Treasurys and federal-fund futures at CBOT to bet on the direction of interest rates. Mixed economic data reports led to volatile price conditions in the interest-rate markets last month, helping to boost volume, as traders worked to anticipate future Federal Open Market Committee interest rate moves. \u001d  The FOMC has left its benchmark rate unchanged at its last four policy-setting meetings, and current market prices reflect expectations that the Fed will lower rates in the second half of this year. \u001d  The growth of electronic trading continued to fuel volume growth at both exchanges in December. For CME, overall trading volume on its Globex electronic platform rose 51% year-over-year in December, with 3.99 million contracts traded per day. \u001d  On CBOT's e-cbot electronic platform, average daily volume of 2.24 million contracts in 2006 was up 29% over the previous year. CBOT's electronic products will migrate to Globex following the proposed merger between the exchanges. \u001d  Both exchanges have taken steps recently to promote further growth and use of electronic trading, which accounted for 71.8% of average daily volume at CME last year and nearly 70% of CBOT average daily volume last year. For example, CME has adopted measures to get more options trading handled on the screen, and CBOT launched daytime electronic trading of agricultural products in August. \u001d  The growth of electronic options trading helped to boost overall options volume at CME to average 1.2 million contracts per day in 2006, a 46% increase over the previous year. Electronic options volume - which accounted for 13% of total options volume in the fourth quarter, compared with 7% in the first quarter 2006 - posted a 167% increase in 2006, with 123,000 contracts traded per day. \b \b   Agricultural Gains At CBOT \b \u001d  The CBOT's year-over-year December volume gain was also helped by stronger volume in the exchange's agricultural complex, although analyst Allen noted that pace of growth was significantly slower than in recent months. \u001d  Average daily volume for agricultural products at CBOT was 440,200 contracts in December, up nearly 36% from the year-earlier month. \u001d  CBOT launched daytime electronic trading of agricultural contracts in mid-2006, a move that helped fuel the volume expansion, and electronic volume in the product area posted a 10-fold increase last year over the previous year. Volume was also up last year in the trading pits, where the bulk of trading still occurs, climbing 23% to 420,745 contracts compared with 2005 volume. \u001d  Bernard Dan, CBOT's chief executive, said in the exchange's release that new initiatives in CBOT's agricultural complex \"contributed to volume growth and expanded the Exchange's global reach\" last year. \u001d  For CME, the trading of New York Mercantile Exchange energy contracts on its Globex platform hit a record 384,000 per day last month. Nymex and CME reached an agreement in early 2006 under which Nymex's benchmark contracts trade on Globex. The CME saw Nymex volume on its platform grow to 360,000 contracts per day in the fourth quarter, a 105% increase over the previous quarter. \u001d  \"As we stated in our last earnings call in October, NYMEX energy and metals volumes...have outpaced our original volume and profit assumptions,\" said Jamie Parisi, CME's chief financial officer, in the company's release. \b \b   Guidance For Nymex Volume \b \u001d  Parisi also offered guidance on CME's expectations for the rate per contract the exchange will earn from the Nymex volume, a rare forecast for the exchange. If average daily volume of Nymex products on Globex is 500,000 contracts in a month, CME expects an average of 31 cents to 33 cents per contract. If the volume averages one million contracts, the CME expects 25 cents to 27 cents, and if volume is two million contracts per day, the CME would expect 22 cents to 23 cents per contract. \u001d  All CME product areas posted gains last month. Trading of foreign exchange futures, an area that CME has said represents its biggest growth opportunity, increased 45% in December to 621,000 contracts. Early this year, CME and Reuters Group PLC (RTRSY) intend to launch FXMarketSpace, the world's first centrally-cleared global foreign exchange market place. \u001d  Also, trading of e-mini equity index contracts rose 29% in December to 1.54 million contracts per day. \u001d  While metals contracts still represent a tiny portion of trade at CBOT, they have also posted major gains. Average daily volume of 52,641 contracts last month was up 332.3% from the year-earlier period. The volume increase was spurred by major gains among gold futures. \u001d  For the fourth quarter, CBOT's average daily volume was 3.27 million contracts, a 36% increase from the previous year. On the year, total average daily volume of 3.21 million contracts represented a 29% gain over 2005. \u001d  CBOT also reported that total volume of 805.9 million contracts in 2006 represented a new record for the fifth consecutive year. \u001d  At CME, average daily volume in the fourth quarter was 5.3 million contracts, up 29% in the same period over the prior year. CME reported average daily volume of 5.3 million contracts for 2006, up 28% over 2005, with more than 1.3 billion contracts traded. \u001d  Both CME and CBOT reported the average rate per contract stood at 64.5 cents in the three months ending Nov. 30, up slightly from 63.8 cents in the previous three-month period. The data is reported on a one-month lag. \u001d  Banc of America has had an investment banking relationship with CBOT Holdings in the last 12 months. Credit Suisse has had an investment banking relationship with both exchanges, and expects to receive or seek banking compensation from them in the next three months. \u001d  -By Jesse Thomas, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4117; Jesse.Thomas@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:47 ET (20:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0fe7c103664e3e5b3832580fff042124","symR":["30110.AE","ABN","CTPZY","ISA.BO","JPM","TRPL4.BR","BRTRPLACNPR1","COI15AO00020","NL0000301109","US46625H1005"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Colombian Government Authorizes ISA To Borrow $182 Mln","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T17:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30110.AE","ABN","CTPZY","ISA.BO","JPM","TRPL4.BR","BRTRPLACNPR1","COI15AO00020","NL0000301109","US46625H1005"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","ELC","XAEX","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BOGOTA (Dow Jones)--The Colombian government authorized state-owned electricity transmitter Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA.BO) to borrow $182 million to finance its expansion in Brazil. \u001d  ISA will borrow the money from Dutch bank ABN AMRO Holding NV (ABN) and U.S.-based JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(AT&T Inc. or the Company) at \"A\" for its Senior Unsecured Notes and R-1 (low) for its Commercial Paper. \u001d  DBRS also confirmed the ratings of its affiliated companies following the announcement that AT&T Inc. completed its all-stock $85.6 billion acquisition of BellSouth (roughly $107 billion in total enterprise value). \u001d  These confirmation include the following: \u001d  - AT&T Corporation's (AT&T Corp.) Guaranteed US Notes at \"A\" \u001d  - BellSouth Corporation's (BellSouth) Debentures and Senior Unsecured Notes at \"A\" and its Commercial Paper at R-1 (low) \u001d  - Cingular Wireless II, LLC's (Cingular) Senior Unsecured Notes at A (low). \u001d  DBRS has assigned ratings to Cingular's Co-obliged Notes at \"A,\" of which AT&T Inc. has agreed to become a co-obligor. DBRS has also assigned a rating of \"A\" to BellSouth's Guaranteed Notes, guaranteed by AT&T Inc. DBRS has also discontinued its rating on AT&T Corp.'s unguaranteed notes. All trends are Stable. \u001d  These rating actions follow the recent regulatory approval received by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which was preceded by the necessary state and Department of Justice approvals earlier this year. This action remains consistent with DBRS's confirmation of the aforementioned ratings when the transaction was originally announced on March 6, 2006. \u001d  DBRS notes that this acquisition has created a massive telecommunications operator with significant scale (roughly 66 million access lines, more than 11 million DSL subscribers and ownership of the largest wireless carrier in the United States, Cingular, with approximately 59 million subscribers). Additionally, this acquisition has given the Company significant last-mile access and strong market presence in the residential and enterprise communications markets in the United States. The Company will also carry the AT&T name and brand (Cingular and BellSouth will begin to be re-branded in 2007), which is one of the most respected brands in the world. While DBRS notes that AT&T did commit to a number of merger commitments to ensure the FCC's approval, none of these are significant enough to change the business risk profile of the Company. \u001d  From a financial perspective, DBRS notes that the new company has a strong balance sheet that will generate sizeable free cash flow (the Company is forecasting free cash flow after dividends in excess of $4 billion in 2007 and $6 billion in 2008), supported by strong balance sheets at AT&T Inc., BellSouth and Cingular and the all-equity nature of this transaction. As a result, the Company's consolidated credit metrics are expected to remain strong, with percentage debt in the capital structure to remain below 40%, net debt-to-EBITDA below 1.6 times, cash flow-to-debt above 0.45 times and EBITDA interest coverage above 10.0 times. However, DBRS expects the Company's free cash flow in 2006 and 2007 to be directed toward its sizeable two-year share repurchase program (between $10 billion and $11 billion expected to be repurchased in 2006 and 2007), which will effectively cash fund the equity premium involved with the acquisition of BellSouth. DBRS expects this program to be funded through free cash flow and cash on hand over this time frame, with no material increase in the Company's consolidated leverage. \u001d  DBRS expects liquidity to be significant, with AT&T Inc.'s credit facility ($10 billion now that the transaction has closed, with the ability to raise the facility upon the consent of its lenders to $12 billion) and cash on hand sufficient to back its commercial paper (CP) program ($12 billion authorized). While DBRS notes that AT&T Inc. has a sizeable amount of debt maturing over the next year (nearly $9 billion on a pro forma basis as at September 30, 2006), a sizeable portion is CP outstanding at both AT&T Inc. and BellSouth. The AT&T Inc. CP will likely be termed out and the BellSouth CP is expected to be refinanced by AT&T Inc. as it matures. DBRS expects that the remaining long-term debt will be refinanced upon maturity, with AT&T Inc. the main debt issuer in the group going forward. \u001d  The confirmation of the ratings also assumes that the business risk profile of the combined company will not significantly change as it continues to defend its core business and customer base against increasing competition (in the residential segment) and fundamental challenges remain in the enterprise segment despite its strong position in this market. This will include its bundling capabilities and its rollout of video (IPTV) services across its legacy territory (now 21 states) in order to increase the stickiness of its customers and attempt to mitigate access line erosion. Despite competition remaining ongoing, DBRS does acknowledge that as a result of this transaction, AT&T Inc.'s pro forma revenue mix for 2007 will see its revenue exposure to the increasingly competitive consumer segment reduced to 23%, while exposure to the growing wireless segment will be higher at 34%. \u001d  DBRS believes that the added execution risk placed on the Company - in addition to executing on two sizeable transitions over the past two years, including its acquisition of AT&T Corp. (closed in November 2005) and Cingular's acquisition of AT&T Wireless Services, Inc. (closed in October 2004) - appears to be manageable given that this transaction is a horizontal merger involving two companies that have past working knowledge of one another. Integration costs are expected to be most substantial in 2007 at a projected $2 billion, but these will be accompanied by significant synergies of $2 billion by 2008, which will increase to $3 billion by 2010. \u001d  DBRS has maintained a differential on the ratings of the new AT&T Inc. and its wholly owned entity, Cingular. DBRS has discontinued its rating on the non-guaranteed AT&T Corp. notes because separate disclosure is no longer available for this entity. As a result, DBRS will continue to rate AT&T Inc. and Cingular separately based on their own business and financial risk profiles. \u001d  As referenced above, AT&T Inc. has guaranteed BellSouth's $1.2 billion August 15, 2008, floating rate note. Additionally, AT&T Inc. has agreed to become a co-obligor on two Cingular notes, including (1) $750 million 7.5% notes due May 1, 2007; and (2) $2 billion 8.125% notes due May 1, 2012. As a result of the BellSouth guarantee, DBRS expects that BellSouth will no longer issue financial statements. \b \b   Issuer Debt Rated Rating Action Rating Trend \u001d  AT&T Inc.

(\"BPI\") announced today that effective January 1, 2007, the number of Boston Pizza restaurants included in the Fund's royalty pool (the \"Royalty Pool\") has been increased to include the royalties from 41 new full-service restaurants opened across Canada between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006 (the \"Period\"). One full-service restaurant was closed during the Period. With the addition of these 40 net new restaurants, royalties are now payable to the Fund from 266 Boston Pizza restaurants. \b \bThe Fund indirectly owns the Boston Pizza trade marks and trade names used by BPI in its Boston Pizza restaurants in Canada. In 2002 the Fund licensed these trade marks to BPI for 99 years and in return BPI pays the Fund a top line royalty of 4% of franchise revenues of Royalty Pool restaurants. Annually, the Royalty Pool of Boston Pizza restaurants is increased to include the new Boston Pizza restaurants that have opened in the prior year. The increase is adjusted to reflect any locations that may have permanently closed during the year. \b \b\"In 2006 our team set another Boston Pizza record for new store openings. Opening 41 new locations is a great achievement that speaks to the strength of our business model. Our employees and franchisees should be commended,\" said Mike Cordoba, Chief Executive Officer for BPI and the Fund. \b \bOn January 1 of each year (the \"Adjustment Date\"), an adjustment is made to add to the Royalty Pool new Boston Pizza restaurants that opened and to remove any Boston Pizza restaurants closed prior to that Adjustment Date. In return for adding this additional royalty revenue, BPI receives the right to indirectly acquire additional Fund units (the \"Additional Entitlements\"). The adjustment for new Franchise Sales added to the Royalty Pool is designed to be accretive for Unitholders. The Additional Entitlements are calculated at 92.5% of the estimated royalty revenue added to the Royalty Pool, divided by the yield of the Fund, divided by the Weighted Average Unit Price. BPI receives 80% of the Additional Entitlements initially, with the balance received when the actual full year performance of the new restaurants is known with certainty. BPI receives 100% of distributions from the Additional Entitlements throughout the year. Once these new restaurants have been part of the Royalty Pool for a full year, an audit of the royalty revenues of these restaurants received from BPI will be performed. At such time an adjustment will be made to reconcile distributions paid to BPI and the Additional Entitlements received by BPI. \b \bIn return for adding the royalty revenue from the 40 net new restaurants to the Royalty Pool, BPI has received 1,726,782 Additional Entitlements. The 1,726,782 represents 80% (2,158,478 represents 100%) of the Additional Entitlements with the balance received when the actual full year performance of the new restaurants is known with certainty. The 1,726,782 Additional Entitlements represents 11.2% of the Fund units on a fully diluted basis. The full 2,158,478 Additional Entitlements would represent 13.3% of the Fund on a fully diluted basis. The issuance of the Additional Entitlements to BPI is subject to approval by the Toronto Stock Exchange. \b \bThe estimated annual gross franchise revenue for the net 40 restaurants in 2007 is estimated to be $74,555,000, due to the addition of $75,777,000 in estimated annual gross franchise revenue for the 41 new restaurants less $1,222,000 in estimated annual gross franchise revenue from the one closed restaurant. The estimated 4% royalty revenue the Fund will receive in 2007 from these additional net 40 restaurants is $2,982,200. The royalty revenue for the purposes of calculating the Additional Entitlements, therefore, is $2,758,535 or 92.5%. Once the actual performance of these new restaurants for 2007 is known, after taking account of the one closure, the number of Additional Entitlements will be adjusted in 2008 to reflect the actual royalty revenue received by the Fund in 2007. As of January 1, 2007, there are 266 restaurants in the Royalty Pool. \b \bIncluding the 1,726,782 Additional Entitlements described above, BPI has the right to exchange its securities for 4,475,957 Fund Units, representing 28.9% of the Fund Units on a fully diluted basis. BPI has agreed to maintain at least a 20% ownership interest, direct or indirect, in the Fund until such time as there are 275 restaurants in the Royalty Pool.

Brascade is the continuing entity resulting from the amalgamation of Brascade and Diversified Canadian Financial II Corp. (DCF II) with Diversified Canadian Holdings Inc., which was effective January 1, 2007. The holders of the Senior Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive quarterly fixed, cumulative preferential dividends equal to $0.29375 per Senior Preferred Share, representing an annualized yield of 4.7%. The Senior Preferred Shares will be retractable at the option of the holder at any time at $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends. \u001d  Looking forward, the underlying portfolio of Brascade will comprise mainly preferred shares and dividend-paying common shares (Portfolio Shares) of a reasonably diverse mix of companies in the real estate, forest products, energy and asset management sectors. The rating is underpinned by the substantial asset coverage of 7.9 times based on current market values and solid Senior Preferred dividend coverage, which is initially expected to be 2.8 times, excluding the potential contribution of dividends from Canary Wharf Group. \u001d  The rating is also supported by the following conditions relating to the Senior Preferred Shares: \u001d  (1) The asset coverage for the Senior Preferred Shares being at least three times (asset coverage being defined as the market value of Brascade's portfolio of investments minus accrued expenses then divided by the sum of the par value of the Senior Preferred Shares and senior debt of Brascade); \u001d  (2) Brascade's senior debt not exceeding 10% of the market value of Brascade's investment portfolio; and \u001d  (3) No dividends being paid on the Brascade common shares unless, after giving effect to such dividend, the asset coverage for the Brascade Senior Preferred Shares would be at least three times. \u001d  The initial common share holdings include a 37% interest in Norbord Inc. (Norbord) common shares, 15% interest in Canary Wharf Group and 12.4 million recently acquired shares of Brookfield Properties Corporation (Brookfield Properties) for US$470 million, which together comprise approximately 80% of the current market value of Portfolio Shares. Other major investments include preferred shares in BPO Properties, comprising 7% of the total market value, and preferred shares in Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (Brookfield) and Brascan Energy, which together comprise 9%. \u001d  DBRS expects that Brascade will focus investments in stable, income-producing assets such as preferred shares or common shares in real estate, power and other income-producing assets. The main contributors to current cash flow are common dividends from Norbord (net of exchangeable debenture interest) providing 34% of total dividend income and 30% from Brookfield Properties. Despite operating in a cyclical industry, Norbord has maintained a consistent common dividend for in excess of ten years (excluding special dividends). \u001d  Excess cash flows beyond the Senior Preferred Shares will be available to Brookfield as sole holder of the Junior Preferred Shares and as sole common shareholder. Brascade may pay out excess funds in common dividends subject to the conditions listed above or reinvest in Brascade. The Junior Preferred Shares rank subordinate to the Senior Preferred Shares with respect to the payment of dividends and in the distribution of assets upon dissolution and are entitled to receive quarterly fixed, non-cumulative dividends equal to US$0.31 per Junior Preferred Share. \u001d  The challenges to the rating include the fact that currently approximately 50% of the value of the underlying shares are unlisted and may be illiquid. Upon retraction by the holder, the principal amount of Senior Preferred Shares may be repaid by liquidating the assets, which may have an impact on the realized value of portfolio assets. As well, there are no material restrictions on the contents of the underlying portfolio and volatile market conditions could cause significant reductions in the net asset value of Portfolio Shares (especially common shares). \u001d  Note: All figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. \u001d  Issuer Debt Rated Rating Action Rating Trend Notes Latest Event \u001d  Brascade Corporation Senior Preferred Shares  New Rating Pfd-2 (low) Stb  Jan 2, 2007 \u001d  DBRS will publish a full report shortly that will provide additional analytical detail on this rating action.

Wilkerson \b \u001d  Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. (SIRI) said Tuesday that it would report positive free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2006, ending the year with more than six million subscribers. \u001d  Sirius announced it added 2.7 million subscribers last year, bringing its total to 6.024 million paying customers. The figure represents an 82% improvement over the 2005 total. \u001d  The company had cut its 2006 subscriber forecast in December, saying it expected to end the year with between 5.9 million and 6.1 million subscribers by the end of the year, compared with its earlier expectation of 6.3 million subscribers. \u001d  Sirius was counting heavily on a surge in holiday sales, partially bolstered by its new Stiletto wearable radio. But Chief Executive Mel Karmazin pointed to slower retail sales than expected from the Thanksgiving weekend onward. \u001d  In addition, the company faced difficult comparisons with the fourth quarter of 2005, when the imminent Sirius debut of popular radio host Howard Stern led to 500,000 subscriber additions.

Reasonable grounds include discussions among the potential bidder and the target, or the designation of advisors. \u001d  If the company declares its intention to make a bid, it must provide details of that bid within a certain timeframe set by the AMF. \u001d  If it fails to provide enough details within the set timeframe, the company may then be considered as not intending to launch a bid. \u001d  If the company doesn't intend to launch a bid, it is then prevented from doing so for the following six months, unless there are important changes in the business environment, the situation or the shareholding of the interested parties. \u001d  At 1538 GMT, Suez shares were up 1.43% at EUR39.8, implying a market value of EUR49.9 billion for the company. \u001d  \"Pinault is indicating he doesn't rule out anything, and this boosts Suez shares,\" Fideuram Wargny analyst Julien Picard said. \"But I don't see anything happening before the French presidential election in the spring, as energy is a highly sensitive, political subject.\" \u001d  Suez shares have surged in the past several weeks after a court postponed the GdF merger until after the French presidential election, making it more unlikely as time passes and raising the chances of alternative bids for Suez. \u001d  The French socialist opposition party, which has opposed the privatization of GdF - a prerequisite for the merger with Suez - has said it would block the merger if it wins the election. \u001d  Several reports in the French press citing unnamed sources have indicated Pinault's interest in bidding for the whole of Suez, with the plan to sell the energy division back to GdF and to keep the water and waste business. \u001d  A GdF spokeswoman reminded that GdF's chairman and chief executive, Jean-Francois Cirelli, last week told French magazine Paris Match that GdF and Pinault did \"not have any project in common\" and that \"the ideal solution\" for GdF remained a merger with Suez. \u001d  At 1542 GMT, GdF shares were trading down 0.29% or EUR0.10 at EUR34.75. \b \u001d  -By Anne-Sylvaine Chassany, Dow Jones Newswires; +331 4017 1740; anne-sylvaine.chassany@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 10:59 ET (15:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"123cbbf07d949dac991acdc9f8abfe09","symR":["ANO","ARQ.V","CA03633E1088"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Anooraq Settlement With Pelawan & Finalization Of Anooraq Capital Structure>ANO","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T14:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ANO","ARQ.V","CA03633E1088"],"IndustryCodes":["PCS","PPM"],"Story":"\b   VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(CCNMatthews - Jan. 2, 2007) - Anooraq Resources Corporation (\"Anooraq\" or the \"Company\") (TSX VENTURE:ARQ)(AMEX:ANO)(JSE:ARQ) announces that it has finalized a settlement agreement with its controlling Black Economic Empowerment (\"BEE\") shareholder, Pelawan Investments (Pty) Ltd (\"Pelawan\") (\"The Settlement Agreement\"). The Settlement Agreement relates to a potential material deemed dilutive financing to have occurred in Anooraq by December 31, 2006, as a result of the Company not having (a) completed an equity financing of C$98.4 million and (b) concluded a Material Transaction by December 31, 2006, as described in the Anooraq News Release of November 15, 2005. \b \bIf the parties had failed to reach The Settlement Agreement, and based on an assumed weighted average share price for Anooraq of C$1.25 at December 31, 2006, the Company would have been obliged to issue to Pelawan an additional 74 million common shares in discharge of its obligations under the original Reverse Take Over transaction (the \"RTO\") entered into between the parties and concluded on September 30, 2004. This deemed dilutive financing, against no corresponding inflow of funds, would have resulted in a significant decrease in the net asset value per share in Anooraq. This has been avoided. \b \bThe salient terms of The Settlement Agreement are as follows: \b \b(a) Anooraq will issue to Pelawan 36 million common shares (\"Adjustment Consideration Shares\"), representing a 50% reduction in the number of Adjustment Consideration Shares due to Pelawan under the original RTO transaction terms. The Adjustment Consideration Shares will be issued by Anooraq to Pelawan by no later than 15 business days after December 31, 2006. \b \b(b) In addition, the Company will issue to Pelawan warrants for the purchase of 167 million common shares in Anooraq (\"BEE Warrants\"). The BEE Warrants are valid for a period of 2 years to December 31, 2008. The strike price of the BEE Warrants are the higher of (i) C$1.35 per BEE Warrant in respect of BEE Warrants exercised on or before December 31, 2007, or C$1.48 per BEE Warrant Share in respect of BEE Warrants exercised after December 31, 2007, or (ii) a price per BEE Warrant Share that is 50% less than the Anooraq common share price payable by arms length parties under an equity financing undertaken by the Company that either raises an amount of at least C$98,400,000 or is undertaken pursuant to a Material Transaction (a \"Concurrent Financing\"). \b \b(c) From the date of issue of the Adjustment Consideration Shares to Pelawan in (a) above or as a result of the exercise of any of the BEE Warrants up to the closing date of the Concurrent Financing, the common shares issued to Pelawan pursuant thereto will be subject to a lock up arrangement and Pelawan will not be entitled to dispose of any of these shares, save for the exemption referred to in (d) below. After the closing date of the Concurrent Financing, the disposal of such shares shall remain subject to the original lock up agreement entered into between Pelawan and Anooraq under the terms of the original RTO transaction (\"the BEE Lock Up\"). For further information on the BEE Lock Up see the Company's August 16, 2004 Management Information Circular at www.sedar.com, accessible from the Investor Centre on the Company's website. \b \b(d) Anooraq has agreed to grant Pelawan an exemption to the BEE Lock Up for the purposes of facilitating Pelawan's financing of the exercise of the BEE Warrants. In the event that Pelawan exercises any BEE Warrants Pelawan shall, in its sole discretion, be entitled to dispose that number of common shares up to 25% (or such greater amount as is required to facilitate the financing of the exercise of the BEE Warrants) of the aggregate common shares issued to Pelawan pursuant to such exercise, provided that all of the proceeds received by Pelawan from such disposal shall be applied by Pelawan to support the financing of the exercise of the BEE Warrants and reasonable expenses related to such exercise. \b \b(e) On the occurrence of a Concurrent Financing, Pelawan shall be obliged to exercise the BEE Warrants to ensure, at a minimum, that Anooraq retains its status as a 52% controlled BEE company, in compliance with undertakings given by Pelawan and the Company in favour of the South African Reserve Bank and Anglo Platinum Limited. \b \bIn commenting on The Settlement Agreement: \b \bRon Thiessen, President and CEO of Anooraq, said: \b \b\"I am pleased that we have achieved this settlement in terms of the historical obligations under the RTO; it resolves overhanging issues for the Company, provides certainty to our capital structure, creates opportunity for future equity financings and still maintains our status as a Black Economic Empowerment company under South African legislation. \b \bDevelopments have taken longer than originally anticipated in respect to our assets in South Africa, but we are gaining momentum with our partner, Anglo Platinum, and moving forward on our original goals. This settlement with Pelawan creates a strong foundation for Anooraq and I look forward to continuing and improving this momentum into the new year.\" \b \bTumelo Motsisi, deputy CEO and MD of Anooraq and Executive Chair of Pelawan, said: \b \b\"The Settlement Agreement is a balanced solution and creates a good platform for both Pelawan and Anooraq to achieve our stated objective of becoming a significant black controlled, independent and operational PGM producer in South Africa.\" \b \b \bISSUED ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ANOORAQ BY \b \bRonald W Thiessen                          Tumelo Motsisi \bPresident and CEO                          Managing Director and Deputy CEO \bAnooraq Resources Corporation              Anooraq Resources Corporation \b                                           Executive Chair \b                                           Pelawan Investments (Pty) Ltd \b \b \bFor further details on Anooraq and its properties in South Africa, please visit the Company's website at www.anooraqresources.com. \b \bCautionary and Forward-Looking Statement Information \b \bThis release includes certain statements that may be deemed \"forward-looking statements\".

They are largely exempt from tax at the corporate level, though shareholders are taxed on the dividends. \u001d  Under the new U.K. REIT regime, companies or groups of companies that choose to become REITS pay an entry charge of 2% of the market value of their investment properties upon conversion to the structure. \u001d  Companies which adopt an REIT structure are able to spread the charge over four years in installments of 0.5%, 0.53%, 0.56% and 0.6%. REITs will also be required to distribute 90% of their income to shareholders. \u001d  The new regime, which is broadly similar to REIT structures in other countries, is expected to make property investment into a liquid, easily accessible, and financially attractive way for small investors to access property as an asset class. It is also seen as a good way for them and global institutional investors to diversify their investment portfolios. \u001d  At 0830 GMT, British Land was up 28 pence, or 1.6%, at 1,742 pence. Land Securities was up 21 pence, or 0.9%, at 2,346 pence, underperforming a broadly higher U.K. shares market. \u001d  Analysts welcomed the new U.K. REIT regime, though there was little surprise in Tuesday's announcements by the two largest land developers in the U.K. \u001d  Arbuthnot Securities analyst Nan Rogers maintained a neutral rating on the sector, and said the Land Securities charge was expected to be somewhat below that of British Land because Land Securities is a more highly geared company. \u001d  As for U.K. REITS as a group, she sees them trading at only a \"comparatively small premium\" to Net Asset Value.

Best Co. has upgraded the financial strength rating (FSR) to B++ (Good) from B+ (Good) and the issuer credit rating to \"bbb\" from \"bbb-\" of Crusader Insurance Company (Crusader) (Woodland Hills, CA). The outlook for both ratings is stable. \b \u001d  The rating actions reflect Crusader's solid capitalization, improved underwriting and operating performance, as well as its strong regional market presence and explicit financial support from its publicly traded parent, Unico American Corporation (Unico) (NASD: UNAM). These positive factors are offset by sub par underwriting and operating results posted during the 2000-2003 period, driven by adverse loss reserve development and the company's limited geographical spread of risk. However, due to numerous corrective actions taken by Crusader's management team in recent years, the improved operating performance is expected to be sustainable. As a result, the rating outlook reflects A.M. Best's expectations that the recent improvement in operating performance and capitalization will be sustainable over the medium term. \b \u001d  For Best's Ratings, an overview of the rating process and rating methodologies, please visit www.ambest.com/ratings. \b \u001d  For current Best's Ratings, independent data and analysis on more than 3,000 individual property/casualty companies and A.M.

CACI asked the court to lift the automatic stay that blocks the company from appealing a U.S. District Court summary judgment in favor of Air America Radio. \u001d  Drain lifted the stay, effective Jan. 8, on the condition that any damages against Air America are limited to proceeds available under the radio network's $5 million insurance policy from Landmark American Insurance Co. \u001d  Air America and its corporate parent, Piquant LLC, filed for Chapter 11 protection on Oct. 13, listing assets of $7.8 million and debts of $19.8 million. The network is heard on 92 stations across the U.S. \u001d  The company is trying to seek a buyer that would keep it on the air. \u001d  CACI sued Air America and Rhodes on Sept. 23, 2005, seeking damages for statements Rhodes made about the firm's actions while working for the U.S. military in Iraq. The firm said Rhodes \"falsely stated\" that CACI employees committed rape, murder and torture in Iraq. \u001d  CACI said Rhodes also claimed the company's employees misrepresented themselves as members of the U.S. military, and fought on the side of the former South African government to support apartheid. \u001d  Air America, which claims Rhodes' comments were protected opinion, won a summary judgment in April. CACI on Oct. 20 filed a notice of appeal with the intent to move forward with the suit in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. \u001d  -Marie Beaudette, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1354; marie.beaudette@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 10:39 ET (15:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1b2ad4188769f2363c5c485805ef8b32","symR":["TEN.MI","TS","LU0156801721"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Tenaris Confirms Its Tax Treatment Won't Change Until 2011","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T13:59:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TEN.MI","TS","LU0156801721"],"IndustryCodes":["STL","XDJGI","XISL","XMIB","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BUENOS AIRES (Dow Jones)--Luxembourg-based tube maker Tenaris SA (TS) said that Luxembourg has terminated its so-called 1929 holding company regime on Jan. 1, but confirmed that the European Union's harmonization of its internal market's tax system won't impact the company's accounts until 2011. \u001d  The Italian-Argentine maker of seamless tubes and welded pipes said in a statement that \"under the implementing legislation, preexisting publicly listed companies - including Tenaris - will be entitled to continue benefiting from their current tax regime until December 31, 2010, irrespective of any share transfers that may occur within that period.\" \u001d  The statement follows the ruling issued in August by the European Commission, which decided that the tax treatment of companies under Luxembourg's 1929 holding company regime is \"incompatible\" with the E.U.'s common market and that they must comply with the E.U. tax treatment no later than Dec. 31. \u001d  The commission has, however, allowed a transition period for existing companies under the special 1929 regime to continue benefitting from their current tax regime until Dec. 31, 2010. \u001d  The E.U.'s ruling had created some uncertainties about its impact on the finances of Luxembourg-based public companies, such as Tenaris, given that it includes a clause saying that the benefit of the transition period would end for those 1929 holding companies whose capital would have been totally or partially transferred during the transition period. \u001d  As a public company, part of Tenaris' capital changes hands every day and as a result the taxes could have theoretically been applied immediately. \u001d  -By Serena Saitto, Dow Jones Newswires; 5411-4311-3125; serena.saitto@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 08:59 ET (13:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1b309cbd4db90cc8626da94704afc9cf","symR":["CFDAY","DPH","DPHIQ"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Highland Cap Balks At Appaloosa-Cerberus Plan For Delphi","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T21:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CFDAY","DPH","DPHIQ"],"IndustryCodes":["OTA","XFFX"],"Story":"\b \b   By Marc Hopkins \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Blasting a plan by institutional investors to fund Delphi Corp.'s (DPHIQ) reorganization as an \"inappropriate raid\" on the auto-parts company's assets, hedge fund Highland Capital Management is proposing its own $4.7 billion investment deal. \u001d  In papers filed Thursday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, Highland furthered its opposition to a $3.4 billion proposal by a group of investors led by Appaloosa Management L.P. and Cerberus Capital Management L.P. \u001d  Highland said the Appaloosa-Cerberus deal takes an estimated $1.29 billion in value from holders of common stock and constitutes \"an inappropriate raid on the corporate treasury through a one-day transfer of massive value from current stockholders to a small alliance of privileged investors and to creditors whose claims are paid in excess of 100%.\" \u001d  Highland said the \"transfer\" is based on Delphi stock being valued at $57.90 a share once the company's Chapter 11 plan is confirmed. The fund said transfer of value would be represented through $144.3 million in connection with direct subscription shares, $785.1 million in preferred shares, $232.2 million in overpayment to unsecured and bond creditors, and $129 million in overpayment to junior creditors. \u001d  Under the Appaloosa-Cerberus plan, investors would gain the exclusive right to buy convertible preferred stock valued at $1.2 billion and $200 million in common stock. The group could end up with a stake of 30% to 70% in Delphi after it emerges from bankruptcy. \u001d  The rival $4.7 billion investment scheme proposed by Highland doesn't include special allocations of direct subscription shares or preferred shares to small groups of investors, and it would allow all stockholders to participate in a rights offering to fund the company. \u001d  Highland also said its proposal would allow Delphi to be run by an independent board of directors, while the Appaloosa-Cerberus plan gives those investors veto power and the ability to name six board members. \u001d  A hearing on the Appaloosa-Cerberus proposal has been scheduled for Jan. 11 in the Manhattan bankruptcy court, but Highland wants the date pushed back to Jan. 22 to give Delphi's board enough time to discuss its proposal. \u001d  Delphi, the largest automobile-parts supplier in the U.S., is one of a handful of parts companies operating under Chapter 11 amid production cutbacks by the country's biggest makers of vehicles. \u001d  The company filed for Chapter 11 protection on Oct. 8, 2005, listing $17.1 billion in assets and $22 billion in debt. \b \u001d  -Marc Hopkins, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1362; marc.hopkins@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:00 ET (21:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1b5047c897f24af25f3fad2dc2d3a9d5","symR":["CARDG.EB","CFDAY","CH0012815459"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CFA IPO Spotlight: LifeWatch Corp Prospectus Info","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T16:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CARDG.EB","CFDAY","CH0012815459"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV"],"Story":"\b \b   DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LifeWatch Corp. on Dec. 13 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an initial public offering of up to $86.25 million in common stock.

The services allow physicians to provide patients appropriate treatment, potentially averting \"significant medical events, including death,\" according to the company's SEC-filed prospectus. In cases where it is determined that a patient requires immediate medical attention, LifeWatch notifies the patient's physician and emergency response professionals. \bOFFERING INFORMATION \u001d  LifeWatch filed an IPO to sell up to $86.25 million in common stock, but it didn't detail the terms of the offering. \u001d  The company said it intends to use the net proceeds from the IPO to repay about $27.6 million of outstanding debt, to launch and market services for its newest product, to enhance infrastructure and for other corporate purposes. \u001d  Cowen & Co., Jefferies & Co. and Piper Jaffray are listed as underwriters for the offering. \u001d  The company said it plans to list its stock on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol LIFE. \bEARNINGS \b                               Nine Months Ended \b                                    Sept. 30, \b                            2006                2005 \bRevenue                  $36,933,000         $34,011,000 \bGross profit              18,042,000          15,387,000 \bOperating income           3,412,000           2,209,000 \bNet income                 1,202,000           1,029,000 \b \b \bGROWTH STRATEGY \u001d  LifeWatch said its objective is to expand its position as the leading provider of cardiac-event monitoring services and the leading manufacturer and distributor of cardiac-event monitoring devices in the U.S. The company said it intends to accomplish this by capitalizing on its demonstrated ability of layering new technology-enabled services onto its existing delivery channels of payer contracts and physician relationships nationwide. \u001d  Key elements of LifeWatch's strategy include launching Card Guard's LifeStar ACT device; further expansion of the company's network of physicians and payers; and continuing to provide a broad range of cardiac-event monitoring services and products. \u001d  LifeWatch also said it plans to expand into new monitoring markets such as ambulatory vital-signs and clinical-research monitoring, and to pursue potential opportunistic strategic acquisitions. \b \bRISK FACTORS \u001d  LifeWatch said risk factors include its dependence on referrals from physicians, and reimbursement by third-party payers; compliance with regulations regarding reimbursements by government third-party payment programs; and any failure to enroll and service a significant number of patients with more-sophisticated monitoring devices. \u001d  LifeWatch said risk factors also include competition; any failure to expand its services beyond cardiac monitoring; medical- or product-liability claims; enforcement of federal and state laws regarding privacy and security of patient information; intellectual-property-rights claims; and dependence on the company's management team. \u001d  Other risk factors include interruptions or delays in telecommunications systems or in network or related services; any failure to protect intellectual-property rights; rapid technological change and LifeWatch's ability to cope with such change; and any failure to obtain and maintain necessary U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals. \b \bMANAGEMENT \b \bName                     Age   Position \b \bFrederick J.

The U.S. Federal Reserve, meanwhile, is expected to enter a phase of steady interest rates in 2007. \u001d  \"While the tightening cycle is likely to be gradual, the BOJ is likely to be hiking rates independently of the ECB and the Fed from the second quarter and beyond - which means the yen's negative interest rate differential should gradually close through 2007,\" said Lehman Brothers foreign exchange strategists. \u001d  However, the timing of the Bank of Japan's next rate hike is still the source of some confusion, with strategists looking to economic data as the best guide to the BOJ's rate decisions. \u001d  Japanese economic growth picked up in the third quarter of 2006 and is expected to remain robust throughout most of next year. \u001d  \"The unexpected strength of third-quarter gross domestic product figures supports an early BOJ rate hike,\" said BNP Paribas foreign exchange strategists. \u001d  \"Though the contribution from private demand was weak, the fact that the overall economy continues to expand at the potential growth rate supports an early move by the BOJ,\" BNP said. \u001d  Japanese economic data released last week was mixed, with stronger retail sales countered by weaker than expected industrial output. However, overall data have been improving, particularly the business surveys. \u001d  A weaker dollar, meanwhile, will also likely contribute to future yen strength, with the Japanese currency likely to be a beneficiary of central banks diversifying out of the dollar as a reserve currency. \u001d  \"With the relative cheapness of the yen widely recognized, some central banks have started to think about diversifying into yen,\" said Goldman Sachs strategist Thomas Stolper. \u001d  \"IMF data show that in aggregate, central banks are substantially underweight yen. This could limit the scope for further yen weakness versus the main reserve currency, the dollar,\" Stolper said. \u001d  The yen started trading the new year slightly higher, helped by continued speculation the Bank of Japan will raise rates at its next meeting Jan. 19. \u001d  At 0745 GMT Tuesday, the dollar was trading down at Y118.64 from Y119.02 late last Friday in New York, the last trading day of 2006, according to EBS. \u001d  However, wasn't able to achieve the same gains against the euro, which is also getting support from early rate hike expectations. The euro rose to Y157.37 from Y157.11 and was also up at $1.3268 from $1.3199. \u001d  SUBSCRIBERS CAN FIND FOREX FOCUS DAILY ON: \u001d  Bloomberg TNI FRX POV \b   Reuters   USD/DJ \u001d  Telerate  1066 or 1074 \b   Thomson   P/1066 or P/1074 \b \u001d  -By Ilona Billington, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0) 207 842 9452; ilona.billington@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 03:15 ET (08:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1b8a508c7e29d215893a67e043878fa8","symR":["STI"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Asset Management Advisors Taps Ken Russell To Head Greenwich Office>STI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T19:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["STI"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 14:00 ET (19:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1bb201053445ae049d682d217f010a75","symR":["CR","US2243991054"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Crane Co.

(INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) stunted growth last year, spurring the first yearly decline since the Internet bubble burst, one industry researcher is forecasting. \u001d  Technology research firm iSuppli on Tuesday estimated global microprocessor revenue in 2007 will climb to $35.4 billion, a gain of 10.8% over its current estimate for 2006. \u001d  It forecasts 2006 microprocessor sales will decline 6.6% to $31.9 billion. The last time microprocessor sales declined on a year-over-year basis was 2001, when revenue plunged 25%, according to iSuppli. Typically, microprocessor sales grow at an 8% clip on average. \u001d  \"Vendors have had enough of the blood bath,\" said iSuppli analyst Gary Grandbois. \"We think microprocessors will bounce back.\" \u001d  Intel and AMD, rivals in the production of chips used in PCs and servers, have been locked in a heated battle the past year. In 2006, Intel was forced to cut prices on its PC chips as its inventories swelled. The markdowns forced AMD to cut prices on some of its chips as well. \u001d  Some industry forecasters expect PC sales to pick up this year with release of Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) new Windows operating system called Vista. In the past, businesses and consumers have purchased new computers when Microsoft sold a new software operating system. \u001d  AMD, of Sunnyvale, Calif., has said it plans to grow at twice the industry's rate this year. \u001d  At its analyst day Dec. 14, AMD forecasted its computer-chip shipments will rise 20%, twice the rate it estimates the industry will grow. It also predicted a kinder price environment for PC chips. \u001d  Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel, the world's No. 1 chip maker, hasn't offered a shipment forecast. \u001d  Microprocessor revenue declined last year as much of the semiconductor industry grew. \u001d  In 2006, iSuppli is forecasting global semiconductor sales will come in at $258.5 billion, growth of 9%. For 2007, it estimates sales will expand to $285.8 billion, a 10.6% rise. \u001d  -Matt Andrejczak; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:27 ET (21:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1bffd637f82ec6d18ff657a3f32c80bf","symR":["CHTT"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Chattem Completes Buy Of 5 Brands From J&J For $410M Cash>CHTT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T17:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CHTT"],"IndustryCodes":["COS","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 12:00 ET (17:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1c2d3eb63a5358c46de8bf02a446cfc4","symR":["CLK","GE","HD","HPQ","MS","WMT","XOM","US30231G1022","US3696041033","US4282361033","US4370761029","US9311421039"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Exxon To Disclose Business Ties With Pay Advisor","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T12:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CLK","GE","HD","HPQ","MS","WMT","XOM","US30231G1022","US3696041033","US4282361033","US4370761029","US9311421039"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","FAD","HIM","IDD","OIL","RTB","RTS","SCR","SVC","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \b   By Kaja Whitehouse \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  (This article was originally published Friday) \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In a sign that a wide array of public companies may be amenable to disclosing any ties they may have with firms that advise on executive pay, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) also agreed to start shedding light on this next year. \u001d  More than 25 companies have been pressured by institutional shareholders in recent months to come clean about relationships with their compensation consultants. Under new Securities and Exchange Commission rules put in place this year, companies will be required to disclose in public filings the name of their compensation consultants, but not their other business relationships. \u001d  Shareholders are seeking this disclosure due to concerns that consultants that rely on management's approval to win other work at the company, such as crafting benefits plans for rank-and-file workers, may be reluctant to provide objective advice on how these same executives are paid. \u001d  General Electric Co. (GE) also agreed to comply with this disclosure in its next proxy statement, it was reported Thursday. Pfizer made this information available to shareholders in its March 2006 proxy and plans to do so again next year. More about how other companies are reacting to the request will be known Tuesday when shareholders leading a letter campaign make public the results of their effort. \u001d  Exxon told shareholders in November that it plans to add this information to its coming proxy statement, which is scheduled to be mailed to investors in April, Exxon spokesman Dave Gardner said Friday. \u001d  In October, a group of 13 institutional investors sent a joint letter to the 25 largest Standard & Poor's 500 companies, including Exxon and GE, asking for this information. In early November, union group AFL-CIO submitted proposals to GE, Home Depot Inc. (HD) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), asking that shareholders vote on whether the company should disclose this information in its proxy. Other institutional shareholders have submitted proposals at still more companies, said Daniel Pedrotty, director of the office of investments with the AFL-CIO. \u001d  Companies that say no to the letter requesting increased disclosure may also be targeted with proposals asking to give shareholders a vote, said Bernard Kavaler, spokesman for Connecticut Treasurer Denise L. Nappier, which signed the letter. So far, two-thirds of the 25 companies that received the October letter have responded, said Kavaler, who declined to specify how many agreed to make the information available to shareholders. \u001d  Pfizer responded to the shareholder letter in November, according to a copy of the letter provided by spokesman Paul G. Fitzhenry. Pfizer was \"the first company to provide this expanded executive compensation disclosure\" by making it a part of the 2006 proxy, the letter said. \u001d  Pfizer's board receives advice from New York compensation firm Frederic W. Cook & Co., the proxy statement said. The firm doesn't advise Pfizer's management and receives no other compensation from the Pfizer other than a fee of less than $5,000 to provide an executive salary survey, the proxy said. \u001d  GE, which received both the letter and a shareholder proposal from AFL-CIO, told shareholders earlier this month that it will add this information to its April proxy, said GE spokesman Peter O'Toole. GE's board of directors used Frederic W. Cook in 2006; the firm also advises the company's human resources on its broader pay programs, said O'Toole. \u001d  In 2006, Exxon's board of directors worked with New York compensation consulting firm Pearl Meyer & Partners, a unit of Clark Consulting Inc. (CLK), according to an email statement from Gardner. Pearl Meyer didn't provide \"any other services to the corporation,\" Gardner said. Officials from Pearl Meyer weren't immediately available for comment. \u001d  Other companies that received the letter include Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Morgan Stanley (MS), Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot. None of these companies was immediately available for comment. \u001d  Shareholders behind the effort have likened such ties to when auditing firms provided consulting work for the companies they were auditing - a situation that some have attributed to the accounting scandals at Enron Corp. (ENE) and WorldCom Inc. The Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002 restricted the non-audit services firms are allowed to provide audit clients. \u001d  -By Kaja Whitehouse, Dow Jones Newswire; 201-938-2243; kaja.whitehouse@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1ca71aa0b7502dbd0c13d5e7e5b81ccb","symR":["TXT"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Textron Names R.

It also requires federal clearance pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  The Lawrenceburg plant, adjacent to AEP's Tanners Creek Plant in Lawrenceburg, Ind., is a combined-cycle, natural-gas power plant with a generating capacity of 1,096 megawatts. The plant began commercial operation in June 2004. \b \u001d  \"The purchase of the Lawrenceburg plant will provide additional generating capacity to meet the growing electricity demands of our customers at an attractive price,\" said Michael G. Morris, AEP's chairman, president and chief executive officer. \"To meet an annual 2 percent growth in peak electricity demand in our eastern seven-state footprint and our reserve margin requirement in the PJM Interconnection, we must build new plants, like our Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) clean-coal generation projects in Ohio and West Virginia, and also seek opportunities to acquire recently completed gas- fired plants when the price is right. When the Lawrenceburg purchase is complete, we will have successfully added more than 2,900 megawatts of new natural gas-fired capacity to our generation fleet in two years at a significant discount to building equivalent capacity. \b \u001d  \"The IGCC plants and our existing fleet of coal-fired plants in our eastern seven states will continue to supply the bulk of our customers' demand and energy requirements on a daily basis,\" Morris said. \"The Lawrenceburg plant, along with the Darby acquisition announced in November 2006, and the Waterford and Ceredo plants purchased in 2005, will operate as mid-merit and peaking generation, designed for use when electricity demand is higher than average.\" \b \u001d  When the transaction closes, AEP Generating Co. will own the Lawrenceburg plant, and AEP will operate the plant as part of the company's generation pool that provides power to AEP's utility units serving customers in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. \b \u001d  American Electric Power is one of the largest electric utilities in the United States, delivering electricity to more than 5 million customers in 11 states. AEP ranks among the nation's largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 36,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the U.S. AEP also owns the nation's largest electricity transmission system, a nearly 39,000-mile network that includes more 765 kilovolt extra-high voltage transmission lines than all other U.S. transmission systems combined. AEP's utility units operate as AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia and West Virginia), AEP Appalachian Power (in Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas). The company is based in Columbus, Ohio. \b \u001d  This report made by AEP and certain of its subsidiaries contains forward- looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: electric load and customer growth; weather conditions, including storms; available sources and costs of, and transportation for, fuels and the creditworthiness of fuel suppliers and transporters; availability of generating capacity and the performance of AEP's generating plants; the ability to recover regulatory assets and stranded costs in connection with deregulation; the ability to build or require generating capacity when needed at acceptable prices and terms and to recover those costs through applicable rate cases or competitive rates; the ability to recover increases in fuel and other energy costs through regulated or competitive electric rates; new legislation, litigation and government regulation including requirements for reduced emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, carbon and other substances; timing and resolution of pending and future rate cases, negotiations and other regulatory decisions (including rate or other recovery for new investments, transmission service and environmental compliance); resolution of litigation (including pending Clean Air Act enforcement actions and disputes arising from the bankruptcy of Enron Corp. and related matters); AEP's ability to constrain its operation and maintenance costs; AEP's ability to sell assets at acceptable prices and on other acceptable terms; the economic climate and growth in AEP's service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns; inflationary and interest rate trends; AEP's ability to develop and execute a strategy based on a view regarding prices of electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related commodities; changes in the creditworthiness of the counterparties with whom AEP has contractual arrangements, including participants in the energy trading market; changes in the financial markets, particularly those affecting the availability of capital and AEP's ability to refinance existing debt at attractive rates; actions of rating agencies, including changes in the ratings of debt; volatility and changes in markets for electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related commodities; changes in utility regulation, including implementation of EPACT and membership in and integration into regional transmission structures; accounting pronouncements periodically issued by accounting standard-setting bodies; the performance of AEP's pension and other postretirement benefit plans; prices for power that AEP generates and sells at wholesale; changes in technology, particularly with respect to new, developing or alternative sources of generation, and other risks and unforeseen events, including wars, the effects of terrorism (including increased security costs), embargoes and other catastrophic events. \b \bSOURCE  American Electric Power \b \u001d    /CONTACT: Media: Melissa McHenry, Manager, Corporate Media Relations, +1-614-716-1120, Analysts: Julie Sloat, Vice President, Investor Relations, +1-614-716-2885, both of American Electric Power \b    /Web site: http://www.aep.com/ \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:24 ET (20:24 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1da7e227e7cf68fd7120e5fd1d136d74","symR":["CSE"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": CapitalSource Insiders to Sell Shares under 10b5-1","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T15:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CSE"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  CHEVY CHASE, Md., Jan. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- CapitalSource (NYSE: CSE) announced today that John K.

The Company's offer contained only one condition - that they agree not to solicit any proxies for additional board seats or other matters not recommended by the Board. The Board's offer was intended to respond favorably to a significant shareholder's request for a voice on the Board, while avoiding the unnecessary expense and distraction of a proxy contest. \b \u001d  In rejecting the Company's offer, Mr. Biglari increased his demands to include the submission of a proposal to Friendly's shareholders to remove the Company's three classes of directors. Donald N. Smith, Chairman of the Board, said \"(W)e gave Mr. Biglari what he asked for. Now he wants more. What does he really want? His demands, together with his actions at the publicly traded Western Sizzlin Corporation (\"WSC\"), raise concerns regarding his true intentions. It appears that he isn't interested in just a voice on the Board - he wants to control the Board.\" \b \u001d  In a letter to shareholders dated January 2, 2007, Smith stated, \"(t)he results of WSC suggest that it would not be in the best interests of our shareholders to allow Mr. Biglari to control the Friendly's Board. After Mr. Biglari took control of WSC, rather than reinvesting in the restaurant business of WSC, Mr. Biglari used WSC's surplus cash, its bank credit facilities and a brokerage margin account to purchase Friendly's stock. It appears that Mr. Biglari is leveraging the credit of WSC and his hedge fund to purchase our stock.\" \b \u001d  Smith added, \"Under Mr. Biglari's leadership, WSC's operating cash has dwindled, year to year earnings from operations have declined, franchised restaurants continue to be closed, and its stock price has declined significantly. While he continues to offer criticisms of our company, he hasn't offered any plan, vision or strategy for increasing Friendly's shareholder value. If Mr. Biglari gains control of your Board, he could change the Company's financial agreements to allow him to invest Friendly's cash in other companies, like he has done at WSC. We believe that Mr. Biglari wants to gain control of the Board in order to redirect corporate assets for purposes other than the continued growth of Friendly's. The Friendly's Board will take all actions necessary to prevent this from happening. Friendly's is a restaurant company not a hedge fund or investment company.\" \b \u001d  As previously announced, the Company decided to increase the size of its Board and expects to appoint individuals who will bring independence, experience, success and value to enhance the business of the Company. The Company is considering a number of candidates who will bring these values and expects to make an announcement shortly. \b \b   About Friendly Ice Cream Corporation \b \u001d  Friendly Ice Cream Corporation is a vertically integrated restaurant company serving signature sandwiches, entrees and ice cream desserts in a friendly, family environment in over 520 company and franchised restaurants throughout the Northeast. The Company also manufactures ice cream, which is distributed through more than 4,500 supermarkets and other retail locations. With a 71-year operating history, Friendly's enjoys strong brand recognition and is currently remodeling its restaurants and introducing new products to grow its customer base. \b \b   Forward Looking Statements \b \u001d  Statements contained in this release that are not historical facts constitute \"forward looking statements\" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include statements relating to the appointment and anticipated contributions of any new members of the Board of Directors. All forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated. These factors include risks and uncertainties arising from accounting adjustments, the Company's highly competitive business environment, exposure to fluctuating commodity prices, risks associated with the foodservice industry, the ability to retain and attract new employees and directors, including a replacement chief executive officer, new or changing government regulations, the Company's high geographic concentration in the Northeast and its attendant weather patterns, conditions needed to meet restaurant re-imaging and new opening targets, the Company's ability to continue to develop and implement its franchising program, the Company's ability to service its debt and other obligations, the Company's ability to meet ongoing financial covenants contained in the Company's debt instruments, loan agreements, leases and other long-term commitments, unforeseen costs and expenses associated with litigation, and costs associated with improved service and other similar initiatives. Other factors that may cause actual results to differ from the forward looking statements contained herein and that may affect the Company's prospects in general are included in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result the Company can provide no assurance that its future results will not be materially different from those projected. The Company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any such forward looking statement to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. \b \b    CONTACT: Friendly Ice Cream Corporation \b             Deborah Burns, 413-731-4124 \b             Senior Director Investor Relations \b \b    SOURCE: Friendly Ice Cream Corporation \bCopyright Business Wire 2007 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:09 ET (21:09 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1e682272f03aab175da254f8df6a2bed","symR":["GM","US3704421052"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Mortgage Lenders Network Not Accepting Loan Applications","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T14:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GM","US3704421052"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 09:26 ET (14:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1e93479e0f32b119cc7fd541f11e43bc","symR":["MGM"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Reservations Now Being Taken for Luxury Residences at MGM MIRAGE's $7B CityCenter","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T17:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MGM"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"CityCenter's Stunning Residential Sales Pavilion Opens on the Las Vegas Strip \b \b \u001d  LAS VEGAS, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- CityCenter's spectacular Residential Sales Pavilion opened today, designed to showcase the development's offerings and take reservations for approximately 2,700 luxury residences.

The free Telelogic Modeler substantially increases the opportunity for organizations to start to increase productivity and shorten design cycles with Model-Driven Development. Telelogic Modeler is available for download at http://www.telelogic.com/modeling/modeler. \b \u001d  Based on technologies found in the market-leading Telelogic Rhapsody(R) and Telelogic Tau(R) environments, Telelogic Modeler features a comprehensive implementation of the Object Management Group's (OMG(TM)) UML 2.1 standard. Telelogic Modeler enables users to specify, visualize, and document system and software designs, including the system's structure and intended behavior, greatly improving team workflow and collaboration. At the push of a button, users can create a document comprising the entirety of their design's model elements, eliminating the time-consuming and error-prone task of documenting designs. \b \u001d  \"Telelogic Modeler will benefit the software marketplace, making robust UML-based modeling available to every developer, and providing a logical path to full Model-Driven Development,\" said Chris Lanfear, Director, Venture Development Corporation (VDC). \"This move from Telelogic comes at a very opportune time, as developers and management search for tools that can help them manage growing complexity and meet their customer's software needs. Telelogic's decision to offer Modeler for free should accelerate the adoption of UML-based modeling, benefiting both users as well as software development solutions suppliers like Telelogic.\" \b \u001d  Users can easily customize Telelogic Modeler to accommodate their domain-specific terminology.

These leading products support the use of advanced MDD functions such as simulation, automatic code generation of the complete application, requirements traceability, and model-based testing. For a nominal fee, development teams that use Modeler across multiple design configurations can upgrade to Telelogic Modeler Corporate Edition, which includes interfaces to popular configuration management products, such as Telelogic Synergy(TM), and full customer support. \b \u001d  \"As a co-founder of UML and an co-author of UML 2.0, Telelogic is proud to play a key role in the industry's acceptance of Model-Driven Development as a best practice for software design,\" said Ingemar Ljungdahl, Chief Technology Officer, Telelogic. \"With Telelogic Modeler, development teams can use an advanced design tool and benefit from the improved collaboration and communication it provides for free.

The committee consists of King Street Capital Management LLC, QVT Financial L.P., JMB Capital Partners L.P., Mason Capital Management, Smith Management LLC and Triage Management LLC, which collectively owned about 30% of the company's stock. \u001d  The reimbursement includes $1.15 million in professional fees, $132,032 in expert-witness expenses and assorted other fees accrued during a protracted court battle during which the hedge funds won the right to 3% to 15% of two trusts in the case. Most of the hedge funds bought shares after Refco, a former commodity brokerage, tumbled into bankruptcy in October 2005. \u001d  The reimbursement comes as Refco's bankruptcy is winding down. Creditors recently won court approval to receive a fraction of the $16.8 billion they were owed under a Chapter 11 plan approved in late December. According to court documents, the company has $3.65 billion in cash that could be available for distribution to creditors. \u001d  Refco initially entered bankruptcy amid allegations that its chief executive Phillip Bennett, who has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges, had hidden $430 million in bad debt. The company exited bankruptcy proceedings late last month under a plan that calls for it to wind down its operations. \u001d  The equity group said it deserved to collect fees and expenses for its role in the case because it helped secure for most Refco stockholders the right to receive proceeds of two trusts - the Litigation Trust and the Private Action Trust. \u001d  Specifically, any equity holder would get a pro rata share of 3% of the first $500 million, 7.5% of recoveries between $500 million and $1 billion, and 15% of recoveries over $1 billion. A previous plan, which the committee fought to amend, would have allowed them only 10% of a subset of Refco Inc.'s claims. \u001d  Paul Silverstein, a partner at Andrews Kurth LLP who represented the ad hoc equity committee, said it was far too soon to estimate how much those trusts would be worth, and he couldn't give a timeline for any resolution. \u001d  The committee said it considered the effort successful. \"With more than $2 billion in claims filed against the parent estates that, if allowed, would be payable before equity receives a distribution, and given the almost $2 billion aggregate creditor shortfall, this was a truly remarkable achievement,\" the group said in court filings. \u001d  Stockholders typically see their investments wiped out in bankruptcy cases. But the ad hoc group, which previously included Lonestar Capital Management LLC, had argued that Refco was unique because of its more than 75 subsidiaries not in bankruptcy proceedings that were able to sell or liquidate. In addition, the group argued, Refco and its investors had grounds to sue former executives and financial advisers. \u001d  \"Our clients' position throughout was that the Refco parent entity, which had virtually no liquidated debt, had valuable causes of action in its own right that could be prosecuted for the benefit of parent equity, since the parent had no obligation to downstream the money to any insolvent subsidiaries. That is the heart and soul of the position we advocated during the entire course of the case,\" said John A. Lee, a partner at Andrews Kurth. \u001d  Lee called the ad hoc equity committee's contributions to the Refco case fairly \"unique,\" in terms of both its constructive contributions to the process and the committee's victory in securing distributions to equity that aren't dependent on creditors first being paid in full. \u001d  The equity committee also cited in court documents its contribution via objections to many motions from creditors in the case. One such objection led to a proposed $300 million allocation of proceeds from Austrian bank Bawag PSK Group to Refco Group Ltd. LLC being reduced to $100 million, thus leaving a greater amount to be apportioned to the overall estate. \b \u001d  -Tiffany Kary, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4292; tiffany.kary@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:12 ET (21:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2788cf60d2d806834e61138742caeee9","symR":["AMTD"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": TD AMERITRADE to Host Earnings Conference Call","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T13:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMTD"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b                Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2007 at 8:30 a.m. ET \u001d                           (7:30 a.m. CT) \bOMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 02, 2007-- \u001d  TD AMERITRADE Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:AMTD) will hold its quarterly conference call to discuss fiscal first quarter results and related matters on Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2007, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (7:30 a.m. Central Time). \b \u001d  Participants may listen to the conference call by dialing 1-800-819-9193.

(NASDAQ:DHOM) today announced that effective December 29, 2006 it completed a four-year renewal of its credit facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2007. The newly amended and restated agreement, which matures December 29, 2010, provides additional borrowing capacity and is structured to move the Company's business plan forward. \b \u001d  The amended agreement includes a $35 million revolving line of credit, a $110 million senior note, and a secondary or mezzanine note of $90 million. The Company believes that this new agreement will provide adequate liquidity to weather an anticipated loss in 2007 as a result of the depressed housing market, and to respond aggressively when the market rebounds. \b \u001d  For the renewal period, the interest rates on the senior note are comparable to the rates on the previous facility (9.60% compared to 9.25%). The new secondary note bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 15% and includes stock purchase warrants which, if exercised, would represent approximately 15% of the Company's fully-diluted common shares. \b \u001d  The Company's new line of credit results in immediate availability of approximately $18.2 million in additional borrowings that can be used to fund day-to-day working capital needs. Private investment funds Silver Oak Capital, LLC and certain private investment funds affiliated with Silver Point Finance, LLC are the lenders for the credit facilities. \b \u001d  In October 2006, a number of the Company's lenders exercised their right to assign their interest to third party lenders including some of the investment companies named above. The last two months have provided for a smooth transition to this new group of lenders. Huntington National Bank will continue to serve as an Administrative Agent. \b \u001d  \"We are very pleased with the successful renewal of our credit facility,\" said Douglas G. Borror, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our communities are the foundation on which we have built our reputation. We now have the long-term financing in place to prepare for growth when the market rebounds and to continue implementing our strategic plans. Today, the housing market remains a challenge, but our credit facility enables us to assure our customers, vendors and shareholders that we have a sound capital structure that we believe will enable us to withstand the market and plan for the future,\" said Borror. \"We expect to continue to command a significant share of our markets.\" \b \u001d  The real estate market has been especially hard hit in the Midwest. Dominion Homes has responded by reducing its land acquisition, development activities and expenses. The Company believes that the renewal and restructuring of its credit facility represents a significant piece in its strategic financial plan. \b \u001d  Dominion Homes offers a variety of homes, which are differentiated by size, price, standard features and available options. The Company's \"The Best of Everything\" philosophy focuses on providing its customers with unsurpassed products, quality, and customer service. Additional information about the Company and its homes is located on its website www.dominionhomes.com. \b \u001d  Certain statements in this news release are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

And to assure their incoming majority doesn't go the way of Napoleon's 100 days back in charge, a judicious mix of partisan and bipartisan actions of somewhat limited ambition seems to be in the works. \u001d  Pelosi is scheduled to take up her gavel Thursday. And while Democrats promised after their Nov. 7 victory to allow Republicans full participation in deliberations, Pelosi and incoming Majority Leader Steny Hoyer have decided to sideline the opposition from what the Washington Post calls the first burst of lawmaking. In a strategy finalized over the holidays, the Democratic leadership plans to use House rules to keep the opposition from blocking speedy passage of their bills by offering alternative measures. \"The episode illustrates the dilemma facing the new party in power. The Democrats must demonstrate that they can break legislative gridlock and govern after 12 years in the minority, while honoring their pledge to make the 110th Congress a civil era in which Democrats and Republicans work together to solve the nation's problems,\" the Post says. \"Yet in attempting to pass laws key to their prospects for winning re-election and expanding their majority, the Democrats may have to resort to some of the same tough tactics Republicans used the past several years.\" \u001d  That said, the Democrats make no claim to starting a revolution, a la Newt Gingrich and his band of newly installed Republicans following the 1994 midterm election. They don't intend to amend the Constitution or eradicate federal agencies, as the Los Angeles Times notes. But then the Democrats offer a vision that adheres rather than radically opposes historical views of what governments should do. They intend to break the \"link between lobbyists and legislation\" by addressing lobbyist gifts and legislative earmarks, an aim likely to find some opposition from fellow Democrats; re-establish the \"pay-as-you-go\" rules long championed by Alan Greenspan in a bid to have \"no new deficit spending,\" though these rules were often circumvented even when they were in effect; implement recommendations from the 9/11 commission, including the screening of all imported cargo; raise the minimum wage; and lower Medicare prescription-drug rates by repealing a ban on government price negotiations with drug companies. Even some Republicans are expected to give this program a warm reception, the Times reports. \u001d  But the agenda also includes proposals like an overturning of President Bush's limits for research on the medical use of embryonic stem cells, what the New York Times describes as a return to some of the biggest Washington battles of the last decade. But, as the L.A. Times notes, the country's deeper problems, like the looming fiscal problems of Social Security and the war in Iraq - a conflict Americans want Congress to take the lead on, according to polls - don't figure prominently among the new initiatives. \b \b   Iraqi Refugees, Gen. Casey, Hussein And Maliki \b \u001d  That doesn't mean Iraq won't headline half a dozen high-profile hearings in the House and Senate. Beyond the obvious question of how to refashion U.S. strategy for the war, at least one panel - the Senate subcommittee on immigration, border security and refugees - plans to look at how the U.S. is treating Iraqis who were persecuted for helping Americans. Sen. Edward Kennedy, the incoming chairman of that committee, plans such a hearing at a time when advocates for refugees and even some U.S. officials say there's an urgent need to let more Iraqis into the U.S., the New York Times reports. \"Until recently the Bush administration had planned to resettle just 500 Iraqis this year, a mere fraction of the tens of thousands of Iraqis who are now believed to be fleeing their country each month,\" the Times says. \u001d  On a related front, the Times reports that Gen. George Casey, the top American commander in Iraq, now appears likely to leave that post in February or March rather than next summer as previously scheduled. Casey had long opposed the deployment of more U.S. troops to Iraq, arguing that would just delay the needed shift of responsibility to Iraqi forces. But last month he stopped opposing such a troop increase, apparently in line with White House plans to augment the American contingent as part of President Bush's latest revision of strategy. The administration's failure to foresee the spread of sectarian violence in Iraq is at least partly responsible for the collapse of previous strategies, senior officials in Washington and Baghdad tell the Times. The expedited execution of Saddam Hussein over the weekend only seems to have fanned the flames of Sunni-Shiite hatred. And the Iraqi government has ordered an inquiry into why guards were allowed to taunt and film the late dictator's final moments before the hanging, the Times of London reports. \u001d  One big issue the hanging didn't resolve, Newsweek says, is the U.S.'s inability to find a way of replacing Hussein's \"ruthless efficacy\" with a different means of keeping Iraq unified. The Wall Street Journal suggests the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki hasn't provided such an alternative. It was hoped that as the head of Iraq's first elected parliamentary government, Maliki would rise above his Shiite roots and close the \"sectarian chasm\" with Sunnis, as the Journal notes. \"But as Iraq moves closer to full-scale civil war, a look at Maliki's history of Shiite activism suggests he is ill-prepared to be a true unifying figure,\" the paper says. \"On his watch, Iraq has become further polarized along sectarian lines, significantly complicating the U.S. efforts to reduce the violence.\" \b \b   An Ambitious Agenda For The New AT&T \b \u001d  AT&T Inc. (T) plans to market new wireless services to business customers and consumers - including remote access to files and desktop computers over the Internet and wirelessly - and is looking to turn advertising into an important source of revenue, Chairman and Chief Executive Edward E. Whitacre Jr. tells The Wall Street Journal. AT&T, in closing the $86 billion acquisition of BellSouth Corp. (BLS), became the No. 1 telecom company. And by gaining full control of Cingular Wireless - which had been a joint venture with BellSouth - AT&T hopes to sell AT&T-branded wireless services across its customer base of corporate and Internet clients, the Journal says. \u001d  At the same time, a key concession on the BellSouth deal made to the Federal Communications Commission may rein in some of AT&T's other ambitions, and those of its rivals. AT&T essentially capitulated on the issue of \"net neutrality\" - rules that require telecom companies to give equal treatment to all Internet traffic from the Web's backbone to consumers' computers. Supporters of those rules say the AT&T accord sets out what the Journal calls \"a template for future legislation and may at least temporarily hinder hopes of other telecom and cable companies from monetizing their Internet lines by charging companies such as Google Inc. or Amazon.com Inc. to give their traffic priority and faster service.\" \b \b   Also Of Note... \b \u001d  Associated Press: Violence erupted in the Gaza Strip, with warring Palestinian factions firing at each other and kidnapping rivals, and gunmen abducting a foreign news photographer - clashes that broke a weeklong pause in the violent confrontation between the radical Islamic group Hamas, which controls the government ministries, and the Fatah movement of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. \u001d  Financial Times: Gazprom (GSPBEX.RS), the Russian gas company, struck a five-year deal to supply gas to Belarus just minutes before a New Year deadline, narrowly avoiding a gas price war that threatened to disrupt supplies to Europe. The agreement, averting a shutdown of gas supplies to Belarus, doubles the price of gas for Belarus this year and gives Gazprom a 50% stake in the country's pipeline network. \u001d  Wall Street Journal: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is likely to abandon a $300 million loan to Sakhalin II, the huge energy project in the far east of Russia, after Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) and its two partners were forced to sell a 50% stake in the venture to Gazprom, a move that many observers saw as tantamount to nationalization. \u001d  New York Times: Regulators are more concerned about the relationship between big banks and guests of their \"hedge fund hotels\" - space leased to ambitious hedge fund traders as temporary homes, with receptionists, espresso machines and IT consultants - looking at whether the banks might be using the real-estate relationship as a way to entice the funds to do business with them, possibly at the expense of their investors. \u001d  Ad Age: General Mills Inc.

Using the new Interactive Application is as simple as word processing, with no training necessary. The key advantages for using the PrivateRisk Protector Interactive Application are: \b \b --  Lowers transaction costs and saves time. Brokers can use one \b     paperless transaction to secure multiple coverages. The \b     application can be submitted to an underwriter with one click. \b --  Less administrative work because the application has been pared \b     down.

This has been fueled by demand from investors flush with cash to invest, encouraged by unusually low default rates and willing to accept historically low premiums over risk-free returns as a result. \u001d  Rating agency Moody's Investor Services said it believes rising rates, a decline to inflated asset valuations, and a European or U.S. economic slowdown could derail the bull market. But investors remain stoic in the face of such warnings. \u001d  \"While the credit cycle is likely to turn negative sometime in the intermediate term, underlying economic and company fundamentals remain strong,\" said Joe Biernat, director of research at European Credit Management in London, which has EUR17.9 billion of assets under management. \"Unless there is a geopolitical or natural disaster event on a large scale, the credit clock is likely to turn towards the selling hour at a very slow pace.\" \u001d  However, Biernat said that takeovers, and the extra debt that acquirers often put on companies, will remain a risk for bonds this year. \u001d  Already, the increased risk of leveraged buyouts has led investors to push for greater restrictions against new owners piling on debt and pushing down the company's investment-grade credit rating. But investors have also sought out riskier financing tools such as quasi-equity hybrid bonds. These bonds have qualities of both equity and debt, and German industrial conglomerate Siemens AG (SI) used them to raise around EUR2 billion to fund its acquisition of Bayer AG's (BAY) diagnostics division in 2006. \u001d  More could come this year. The chief financial officer of European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. (5730.FR), otherwise known as EADS, has said he's interested, and analysts think France's Schneider Electric (12197.FR) is another likely candidate. \u001d  Last year, investors who took on the added risk of sub-investment-grade debt did particularly well. Lehman Brothers' European high-yield index for euro-denominated bonds returned 11.15% through Dec. 27, well above the 5.8% of full-year 2005. Those who bought U.S.-dollar-denominated high yields earned 11.78%, according to the bank's index, well above the 2.74% of 2005. \u001d  Returns for European investment-grade bonds varied much more widely, depending on the currency. Those for euro-denominated European bonds, however, plummeted to just 0.5% as of Dec. 27, down from 4.08% in 2005, but returns for dollar-denominated European investment-grade bonds rose to 4.46% from 1.96%. \u001d  At the same time, European companies issued the most Eurobonds since 2001: EUR200.3 billion, just shy of the EUR213.4 billion in 2001, according to data provider Dealogic. \u001d  New issues from investment-grade companies hit EUR159 billion, up 64% on 2005 and making 2006 the best year since 2001. Reflecting the boom in takeovers, acquisition financing accounted for a quarter of investment-grade bond issues in the Euro-denominated corporate bond market, up from 8% in 2005, according to Societe Generale. \u001d  Europe's high-yield market had its biggest year ever, with European companies issuing EUR41.3 billion of high-yield debt in the Eurobond market, according to Dealogic. That is nearly double the EUR21.3 billion of bond sales in 2005 and has been driven by the ever-growing size and frequency of leveraged buyouts. \u001d  With bankers expecting the acquisition and buyout markets to be even bigger than 2006's EUR1.08 billion, analysts predict bond-market issuance could climb jump again. One high-yield banker estimated that European high-yield issuance could exceed 2006 levels by 10%-20%. Moreover, the bulk of financings for takeovers done in 2006 still need to be completed. \u001d  \"We expect a lot of M&A activity next year and expect this to be predominantly financed in the debt markets. This is because debt financing is readily available, it's cheap and from a corporate-finance point of view, it makes more sense than doing a share swap,\" said Eirik Winter, co-head of  fixed-income capital markets at Citigroup. \u001d  -By Kate Haywood, Anousha Sakoui and Carol Dean Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0) 7842 9315; kate.haywood@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 00:54 ET (05:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2d0027df5a9177f6aa643e1912e33a4b","symR":["SIRI"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Sirius Reports 2006 Subscriber Base Of 6.024M, Up 82%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SIRI"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XNQ1","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Sirius Satellite Radio Inc.

The company agreed to pay restitution and penalties and adopt reforms. \u001d  In November, the attorneys general for the three states told St. Paul Travelers and three other major insurance companies that they must end special commissions to agents and brokers by Jan. 1 as agreed to in the earlier settlement. \u001d  ACE Group Holdings Inc. of Bermuda, American International Group Inc. (AIG) of New York, Zurich American Insurance Co. Inc. and St. Paul Travelers had agreed to end contingent commissions when 65% of an insurance line is sold by companies that don't pay the commissions. \u001d  In November, the companies were told that the 65% \"tipping point\" was reached in automobile, homeowners and several other insurance products. \u001d  A lawyer for St. Paul Travelers said in a Dec. 30 letter to Blumenthal that as of Monday it would stop paying contingent commissions in several insurance business lines. It will stop paying contingent fees in all insurance lines by Jan. 1, 2008, and will instead use a \"purely fixed commission program.\" \u001d  A spokesman for Travelers did not immediately return a call Tuesday. \u001d  Blumenthal said he believes the contingent fees will eventually disappear as Travelers and other insurers abandon the practice. \u001d  \"I expect contingent compensation bans will be contagious in the industry eventually ending a pay-to-play culture altogether, and restoring consumer trust,\" he said in a statement. \u001d  State attorneys general have argued that \"contingent commissions\" paid to brokers and agents to steer business to insurance companies are tantamount to kickbacks that unfairly increase the prices paid by insurance clients. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:52 ET (21:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2f678fba21ef1ed9ad7769b913627cdc","symR":["CIT"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"CIT Completes Acquisition Of Barclays UK And German Vendor Finance Businesses>CIT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T14:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CIT"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 09:25 ET (14:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2f910903bb1554c817b5f28c5d0740fb","symR":["SAND.SK","SE0000667891"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Sandvik Completes Acquisition Of Metso Powdermet AB","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T08:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SAND.SK","SE0000667891"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XDJGI","XISL","XSXA"],"Story":"\bSTOCKHOLM, Sweden--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 02, 2007-- \u001d  Sandvik (STO:SAND) announced on 23 November, 2006, that it had reached an agreement with the Finnish Metso Corporation covering the acquisition of Metso Powdermet AB.

(SCRA, SCRB) is asking the bankruptcy court overseeing its Chapter 11 case to extend the company's exclusive reorganization rights by 120 days. \u001d  The company has been operating under Chapter 11 protection through the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., since Oct. 15. A similar proceeding is also taking place in the Supreme Court of Bermuda. \u001d  Sea Containers said in papers filed last Thursday with the Wilmington court that it wants until June 12 to propose a plan to pay creditors and up to Aug. 11 to lobby creditors to support the plan. \u001d  U.S. bankruptcy law requires companies operating under Chapter 11 to submit a plan outlining how creditors will be paid. Exclusive periods that prevent other parties from submitting such plans to the court allow the company to retain control of the restructuring process without outside interference. \u001d  Sea Containers said it needs the additional time to create a Chapter 11 plan because its case is large and complex. In June 2006, the company and its units had combined assets of $1.67 billion. The figure includes its Baltic Sea ferry property, Silja Oy Ab, which was sold last year. \u001d  The company said additional time is also needed to negotiate dual creditor protection proceedings that are governed by laws of Bermuda and the United Kingdom as well as the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. \u001d  Sea Containers said it isn't using the extension request as a tactic to pressure creditors, and that the request only reflects that the case isn't \"ripe for the formation of a viable plan of reorganization.\" \u001d  Judge Kevin J. Carey will consider the extension request during a Jan. 17 hearing in the Wilmington bankruptcy court. Objections are due Jan. 10. \u001d  Sea Containers is based in Hamilton, Bermuda, and is engaged in marine container leasing and passenger rail transportation. The company also has other businesses involved in container manufacturing and repair. \b \u001d  -Marc Hopkins, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1362; marc.hopkins@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 13:52 ET (18:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"31037433f31258ef9d3ffd3afc3b17ec","symR":["CADAY"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Toronto Stocks Close Mixed As New Year Kicks Off -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T21:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CADAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  U.S. markets were closed for the funeral of former U.S. President Gerald Ford. \u001d  Seven of the TSX's 10 sectoral indexes rose in the session, led by the materials group with a 0.62% increase. \u001d  With gold futures moving higher in New York on a weaker U.S. dollar, the gold sub-index rose 0.77%.

She said, \"ViewPoint allows our staff to respond more professionally to ensure the desired customer service experience for our members.\" As a non-profit looking to reduce costs, the Society also employs TeleVantage's Direct Inward Dialing (DID) feature, which allows members to dial a staff number directly thereby bypassing an auto-attendant. DID also eliminates the number of phone lines the Society leases resulting in additional savings. \b \u001d  \"TeleVantage's functionality is the engine behind increased productivity and improved customer service for many businesses,\" said Dick Anderson, executive vice president and general manager of Vertical Communications. \"TeleVantage provides companies of all sizes with a competitive edge by converting their telephone system into a powerful business tool.\" \b \b   About Aerospace Products International \b \u001d  Aerospace Products International, Inc., headquartered in Memphis, Tenn., is the leading provider of innovative distribution and supply chain services for the aviation industry.

(together, \"Harbinger\") today announced it is seeking the election of seven independent directors to replace the majority of the existing Board of Directors of Ryerson Inc. (NYSE: RYI) at the Company's 2007 Annual Meeting of shareholders. Harbinger, which owns a 9.7 percent stake in Ryerson, detailed its intention in a written notice to Ryerson's Board of Directors, which will be made publicly available in a Schedule 13-D amendment to be filed with the SEC. \b \u001d  Harbinger said it has become increasingly concerned that Ryerson's Board of Directors and senior management have demonstrated a lack of focus on profitability and management of inventory, and that it believes the Company's current Board has not fulfilled its responsibility to enhance value for shareholders. In particular, Harbinger believes that the current Board and senior management team have failed to adequately execute on the Company's strategy and that Ryerson's current Board lacks the necessary experience in the metals service center industry and has provided insufficient oversight of the Company's management team. Harbinger notes, based on publicly available information, that Ryerson has consistently underperformed its industry peers by a variety of key performance metrics, including gross, operating and net margins, and that peer companies have consistently turned inventory more rapidly than Ryerson. \b \u001d  Larry Clark, Managing Director of Harbinger Capital Partners, said: \"This Company has consistently underperformed and there is a need for a significant change at the Board level. Our seven nominees are experienced and independent and, once elected, will work to deliver value to all shareholders. Ryerson's long-term strategy to simultaneously improve cost structure and productivity and expand its customer base while remaining a leader in a consolidating industry is the right one. However, we believe the Company's performance over time demonstrates that the current management team has failed to execute on this strategy and requires better counsel - and we are taking this important step to provide it.\" \b \u001d  Specifically, since 1996, Ryerson's operating margins, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) divided by sales, have averaged 3.4 percent, less than half of the metals service center and processor composite average of 8.0 percent.(1) Harbinger believes that poor inventory management has resulted in inventory turns of 3.8x up to the third quarter of 2006 and has historically averaged 3.9x over ten years, while the metals service center and processor composite has averaged closer to 5.1x during the same period.(2) In addition, over the past ten years, Ryerson has delivered an average return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") of approximately 4.5 percent while the metals service center and processor index has achieved an average ROIC of ten percent.(3) \b \u001d  Harbinger believes that these results reflect a failure by management to execute the Company's business strategy and that, as a result, Ryerson's share price has dramatically underperformed its peers. On a total return basis (which assumes dividend reinvestment) Ryerson has returned only 44 percent since 1996, compared to 94 percent and 165 percent for the S&P 500 and the metals service center and processor composite index, respectively. Over the same ten years, Ryerson's closest peer, Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co., has grown its equity market capitalization over 700 percent.(4) Each of these share price and market capitalization numbers is as of December 12, 2006, the last trading date prior to the date that Harbinger filed its Schedule 13D describing its share ownership in Ryerson and its intentions for the company. \b \u001d  Harbinger believes that Ryerson's current Board lacks the specific qualifications necessary for leveraging the value drivers within the metals service center industry that would create acceptable shareholder returns. Harbinger has assembled a slate of nominees, none of whom come from Harbinger, that possesses broad industry and distribution experience and that Harbinger believes can effectively focus Ryerson's management team on the execution of its business plan with the goal of materially improving the Company's financial performance and future prospects for value creation. \b \u001d  Harbinger's seven independent director nominees together form an experienced and entrepreneurial team that intends to focus on guiding senior management toward delivering cost and operating efficiency and profitability at Ryerson. They are: \b \b   Keith E. Butler \b \u001d  Mr. Butler is the sole owner of BCS Placements, LLC.

(MKTS) will go before a bankruptcy judge Wednesday morning to request permission to start borrowing against a $75 million bankruptcy finance package. \u001d  The San Diego, Calif. company filed for Chapter 11 protection Friday, after lenders refused to give the company more time to refinance $41.5 million in senior debt. \u001d  Terms of the debtor-in-possession loan Advanced Marketing will present in bankruptcy court call for a fast-paced effort to sell the company, or find a debt or equity deal that will pay off the senior lenders. \u001d  The company must within 10 days of the Chapter 11 petition file a motion describing a transaction that may include a sale of some or all its assets. \u001d  Within 60 days of the bankruptcy filing, lenders will expect some kind of court-approved deal to be in place that will pay them off, according to loan documents. \u001d  Advanced Marketing paid senior lenders nearly $3.9 million between July and December 2006 in forbearance fees in a bid to buy the company some time to refinance its debt; the effort failed. \u001d  For 18 months before it resorted to filing for bankruptcy, Advanced Marketing searched for a buyer or investor. In a court filing, Chief Financial Officer Curtis R. Smith said more than one entity is interested in the company, but there is no firm deal yet. \u001d  Wells Fargo Foothill Inc., agent on the senior bank debt, is also the agent on the planned Chapter 11 finance package, which carries interest at the rate of prime plus 3.5%. \u001d  According to Advanced Marketing, the borrowing base formula in its existing senior loan would have allowed it to draw as much as $65 million. \u001d  The company says senior lenders are over-secured, with collateral that includes about $147.5 million in accounts receivable and $72.5 million in inventory, as well as equity in foreign subsidiaries. \u001d  Besides its U.S. operations, Advanced Marketing has units in Mexico, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, which are not included in the Chapter 11 case. \u001d  Advanced Marketing's failure to timely complete a promised restatement of financial statements for five years ending in 2003 triggered the debt default and its eventual bankruptcy filing. \u001d  The financial restatements were linked to probes by the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission into Advanced Marketing's advertising practices. \u001d  Costs of dealing with the investigations and fending off the shareholder lawsuits that followed ran high. \u001d  Legal and accounting expenses were almost $14.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005. The following fiscal year, legal and accounting expenses were $6.2 million, the company said in court documents. \u001d  The company's Chapter 11 proceedings will be represented by by O'Melveny & Myers. Wednesday's hearing begins at 10 a.m. EST before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher S. Sontchi in Wilmington, Del. \u001d  Advanced Marketing supplies books to membership warehouse clubs including Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST), the Sam's Club unit of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

If not, 5523, half a point below last Tuesday's high, would be targeted instead. A fall through it would cause 5512 minor support to be eyed.

Another upside target comes in at 4189 and then further resistance at 4198 in the case of an advance through the first level. Minor support comes in at 4145, the Dec. 29 low. A decline through it would invalidate this forecast and instead lead to a fall toward 4112 minor support.

(HTZ) has been on quite a ride since its buyout more than a year ago: It went full circle from being a division of publicly traded Ford Motor Co. (F) to being private to being public again as a stand-alone company. \u001d  Hertz's equity sponsors' speed in taking the company public again has critics accusing them of pulling off a \"quick flip\" of the company - criticism the investors say is unwarranted. \u001d  Executives at Clayton Dubilier & Rice Inc., which led the $15 billion deal for Park Ridge, N.J.-based Hertz in December 2005, said in an interview the speedy transition doesn't mean there was no time for operational improvements. Instead, the firm said its three-year courtship of Hertz prior to the buyout meant it could move quickly afterwards. \u001d  Indeed, CD&R and co-investor Carlyle Group LP cited in interviews a litany of specific changes, such as bringing in new management, introducing new offerings such as environmentally friendly \"green\" cars, reducing the number of sport-utility vehicles in Hertz's fleet, and adding vehicles with better fuel economy. Merrill Lynch & Co.'s (MER) private-equity arm was also an investor in the Hertz deal. \u001d  (The Big Deals, a series of occasional articles, takes a look at how some of the largest companies that have been bought out are performing under their new owners. The series is also being published in LBO Wire, a newsletter published by Dow Jones & Co. that covers buyouts.) \u001d  In addition, Hertz now buys cars from a wider range of automobile manufacturers. Vehicles made by Ford account for about one-third of Hertz's fleet, down from some 50% in the past. Diversification of suppliers gives Hertz more negotiating power and offers its customers more choices, the private-equity investors said. \u001d  That is important, as Hertz faces a new challenge of having to dispose of more cars on its own, as it has purchased fewer \"program\" cars since the buyout. Program cars can be sold back to auto manufacturers after a certain amount of time, but as Ford and General Motors Corp. (GM) slip deeper into financial trouble, they have increased prices on these cars. They now make up about 50% of Hertz's fleet, down from 75% at the time of the buyout. \u001d  Owning fewer program cars means higher exposure for Hertz to the volatility of the used-car market, noted Standard & Poor's analyst Betsy Snyder. \"If the company needs to downsize quickly,\" she said, \"there could be a potential problem.\" \u001d  Richard Broome, a spokesman for Hertz, acknowledges the higher risk, but said the company is able to manage it. Owning fewer program cars also enables Hertz to distance itself further from the troubled auto makers, and gives Hertz more flexibility in matching its fleet to customer demand, he said. \u001d  It isn't just the car-rental division that has changed, the sponsors said. Hertz's equipment-rental division has also benefited from growth in the nonresidential construction sector and the fact that contractors are renting more equipment instead of owning it. \u001d  \"The growth and efficiency opportunities we identified in our investment case have proven to be true; some have exceeded our expectations,\" said CD&R Financial Partner David Wasserman. \u001d  For the first nine months of 2006, Hertz posted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $2.32 billion, up from $2.13 billion during the year-ago period. Revenue rose to $6.07 billion from $5.63 billion, with increases in both the car-rental and equipment-rental businesses. Those are numbers that analysts generally agree are solid. \u001d  \"Hertz's overall operational performance is moderately better than our expectations,\" said Bruce Clark, senior vice president of Moody's Investors Service Inc. \u001d  But critics have been vocal about Hertz's aggressive dividend policy. Less than six months after the leveraged buyout, Hertz cut a check in the amount of $1 billion to CD&R, Carlyle and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity through a dividend, and it distributed another $300 million to the sponsors after its initial public offering in mid-November. The dividends, plus unrealized gains, mean the private-equity firms' $2.3 billion equity investment has doubled in value within a year. \u001d  The dividends also mean that Hertz's interest expenses have nearly doubled since the buyout, said S&P's Snyder, to $672.6 million for the first nine months of 2006 from $353.2 million in the same period in 2005. Snyder said that should Hertz fail to de-lever or add additional leverage, its credit ratings could be further downgraded, which would mean even higher borrowing costs. \u001d  But the company's buyout backers point to Hertz's increased cash flow as justification for taking the dividends. They add that Hertz's net debt has declined since the buyout, to 3.9 times Ebitda as of September 2006 from 4.4 times as of December 2005. \u001d  \"We were prudent and disciplined,\" said Carlyle Managing Director Gregory Ledford. \u001d  Nevertheless, the dividend gave public investors somewhat cold feet during Hertz's IPO. The company's stock priced at $15 a share, below price talk of between $16 and $18, and struggled to stay above the offering price for some time. It recently has been trading at above $17, but how the private-equity investors eventually fare on the deal as they sell down shares will depend on the job they do of convincing investors that they did have Hertz's long-term interests at heart when they purchased it, and not merely their own. \u001d  The investors said they don't have immediate plans to sell down shares as they believe in Hertz's long-term growth. But they are nonetheless \"looking at all options,\" including secondary offerings and block trades, said Carlyle's Ledford. \u001d  -By Shasha Dai, Dow Jones Newsletters; 201-938-4298; shasha.dai@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:37 ET (20:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"34f36115641ced0c54083e61de8619cd","symR":["PVH"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Phillips-Van Heusen Acquires Assets Of Superba >PVH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T17:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PVH"],"IndustryCodes":["CLO","TEX","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 12:54 ET (17:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"353fe9fd6add68ca0f52370b8e9a3009","symR":["CFC","CS","CSGN.VX","HRB","LEND","MS","NEW","WFC","CH0012138530","US9497461015"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Investors Eying Mortgage Servicers Amid Rising Defaults","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T17:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CFC","CS","CSGN.VX","HRB","LEND","MS","NEW","WFC","CH0012138530","US9497461015"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","CSV","MFN","REA","REI","SCR","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSMI","XSP5","XST5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \b   By Lingling Wei \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--More than ever, for mortgage-bond investors, it's not just who makes the loan, but who services it. \u001d  With a growing number of financially stretched homeowners falling behind on their mortgage payments, investors in securities backed by subprime loans are paying more attention to the ability of so-called mortgage servicers to manage delinquencies and defaults - just as they are more closely scrutinizing the quality of loans lenders originate. \u001d  \"From an investor's perspective, you are looking for servicers that are aggressive in flushing out delinquencies early,\" says Andy Chow, who manages a $6 billion portfolio of mortgage bonds and other fixed-income assets for Seneca Capital Management in San Francisco. \u001d  Mortgage credit strategist Peter DiMartino at RBS Greenwich Capital says he can't overstate the importance of servicers in mitigating loan losses. \"There is an adage out there,\" he notes, \"that says 'once you buy a bond, you are buying the servicer.'\" \u001d  Loan servicers collect fees for performing such tasks as collecting monthly payments and contacting borrowers who fall behind on their loans. Lenders retain some mortgage loans on their books, but most are sold to investors in the form of mortgage-backed securities. Big lenders often service their own loans, including those that have been sold to investors, but in many cases Wall Street firms that create mortgage-backed securities select a servicer. \u001d  Mundane as those servicing tasks sound, a recent Fitch Ratings analysis found that loans handled by servicers rated RPS1, the highest ranking by the rating agency, experienced fewer losses and lower loss severity than those managed by servicers rated PRS3, defined as \"fully acceptable.\" The highest-rated subprime servicers, according to Fitch, include both big lenders such as Countrywide Financial Corp. (CFC), Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), and H&R Block Inc.'s (HRB) Option One and servicing specialists like Litton Loan Servicing LP, a unit of credit-sensitive asset purchaser C-BASS LLC. \u001d  In early December, Fitch placed the servicer rating of AMC Mortgage Services Inc. on \"rating watch evolving,\" meaning that its rating could remain \"fully acceptable with noted strength,\" be upgraded or downgraded, depending on its financial situation. But analysts Thomas Crowe and Kathy Tillwitz also noted that the servicing portfolio of AMC, part of ACC Capital Holdings in Orange, Calif., is experiencing increasing delinquencies and its cost of servicing is significantly higher than the industry average. \u001d  \"Our servicing operations are performing better than or equal to others in the industry,\" AMC spokesman Chris Orlando says. \u001d  Credit-rating agencies generally rank servicers based on their financial stability and the quality of their loan-administration and default-management processes. A servicer's rating can impact the amount of money issuers of mortgage-backed notes need to set aside to cover losses in order to achieve a given rating - ranging from triple-A to triple-B - for each of the various classes of their bonds. \u001d  However, some analysts and traders say, rating agencies' servicer ranking hasn't yet had a measurable impact on the pricing of mortgage-backed securities as it is rather static. At the same time, they note, a servicer's ability to recover losses on defaulted loans likely will have more sway over pricing if, as expected by some economists, the worst housing slump in six years continues and past-due mortgages keep rising. \u001d  \"Investors are increasingly interested in servicer quality,\" says Rod Dubitsky, head of Credit Suisse Group's (CS) asset-backed securities research group, \"but they still tend to tier (meaning price bonds) more based on a servicer's financial strength than its servicing quality because financial strength is easier for investors to get their arms around while loss-mitigation skills are difficult to measure.\" \u001d  Those skills, he adds, \"will have a greater impact on spreads (on mortgage bonds) going forward as we approach the twin buzzsaws of increasing payment shock and slowing home-price appreciation.\" Dubitsky says his team is accelerating its efforts to evaluate servicers' loss-mitigation skills. \u001d  In another sign of the growing importance of servicing quality, Wall Street firms are looking to acquire mortgage servicers in addition to lenders as part of their strategy to boost their mortgage-bond business. As recently as December, Morgan Stanley (MS) closed its acquisition of Saxon Capital Inc., a Glen Allen, Va., company that specializes in servicing subprime loans as well as wholesale lending. \u001d  Borrowers with poor or limited credit histories, or with high debt relative to income, promise greater profit opportunities for lenders and investors as they pay higher rates than more creditworthy borrowers. Subprime mortgages now make up 19% of total mortgage loans outstanding, and the pool of subprime mortgage-backed securities has widened more than five-fold in four years between 2001 and 2005. \u001d  On the other hand, subprime loans also boast higher default risk. The majority of those loans now carries fixed rates for the first two or three years and then resets to market rates. Mortgage Bankers Association estimates that about $1.1 trillion to $1.5 trillion of adjustable-rate mortgages are due to adjusting to higher payments this year. \u001d  About half of that amount is expected to get refinanced into fixed-rate mortgages or other types of loans ahead of the reset. But at a time when home prices are declining in many parts of the country, highly-leveraged subprime borrowers have fewer choices to tap into their homes to pay down debt. \u001d  The seasonally-adjusted delinquency rate for subprime mortgages jumped to 12.59% in the third quarter of last year, according to the industry's trade group, the highest since 2003. Recent studies by UBS and by RBS Greenwich Capital also show that subprime loans made and securitized in 2006 are going into foreclosure faster than loans made in previous years. \u001d  Because of the way mortgage-backed bonds are structured, investors in those securities especially care if a servicer is able to liquidate in a timely fashion nonperforming loans and properties taken back due to foreclosure, known as real-estate owned assets, or REOs for short. The longer the property is on a servicer's book, the bigger the losses. \u001d  The rationale, explains Chow of Seneca, lies with the \"excess interest,\" or the difference between the interest payments from the borrowers and the coupon paid to investors in the mortgage-backed bonds. Such excess cash flows can be used to make payments to the investors if a loan defaults. \u001d  \"Thus a diligent servicer could trap excess cash flows for the benefit of the strength of (the asset-backed deal) structure,\" Chow says. \"If on the other hand, the servicer delays in liquidating REOs,\" he adds, \"the excess interest escapes\" and the credit risk increases for investors. \u001d  Some investors are also questioning who shoulders more blame for the soaring delinquencies: lender, or servicer? Joseph Lydon, President and Chief Operating Officer of Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. (LEND), a major subprime lender and servicer, says \"the best servicing in the world isn't going to cure bad loans.\" The company's servicing operation is rated \"above average\" by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, and viewed as \"fully acceptable\" by Fitch. \u001d  What sets Accredited apart from others, Lydon says, is \"a feedback loop\" linking servicing to production, which allows the company to make adjustments to its underwriting guidelines based on how loans perform over time. The Los Angeles-based lender is cutting back on piggyback loans, which allows consumers to borrow as much as 100% of a home's purchase price, and stated-income loans - or loans that disclose income but don't require verification. \u001d  Many servicers have also strengthened their borrower outreach-and-education programs to prevent foreclosure. Borrowers never contact their servicers in more than half of all foreclosure cases, industry surveys show, and delinquent borrowers often don't know that there are alternatives to foreclosure. Among the common options a servicer can offer are forbearance, which temporarily delays or reduces payments, and loan modifications, which changes the payment terms for a fixed period. \u001d  \"We try to have very, very early intervention,\" says Richard Cimino, president of loan servicing at New Century Financial Corp. (NEW), a subprime lender and servicer in Irvine, Calif. \u001d  -By Lingling Wei, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2089; lingling.wei@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 12:24 ET (17:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3557f586442045973cea77955b97328e","symR":["CIX.UN.T","CA1254961099"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CI Financial December Net Sales C$224M >CIX.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T21:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CIX.UN.T","CA1254961099"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:15 ET (21:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"358d106c4ee60301a1fb7e3e2bdc5125","symR":["HSIC"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Henry Schein to Begin Taking 2007 Influenza Vaccine Orders Tomorrow, January 3, 2007","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HSIC"],"IndustryCodes":["MDS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XRUS"],"Story":"\b  Company Has Commitments to Receive Injectable Flu Vaccine From All  Three Manufacturers, and Expects to Sell More Doses in 2007 Than Any \u001d                          Other Distributor \bMELVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 02, 2007-- \u001d  Henry Schein, Inc.

The AMPS are used with the intent of enhancing returns by borrowing at U.S. interest rates and investing the proceeds in relatively higher yielding Asian and Australian fixed-income securities.  In order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in U.S. interest rates on the costs associated with the AMPS, the Fund has entered into an interest rate swap agreement, enabling the Fund to lock in fixed interest rates for 80% of the outstanding AMPS.  Details regarding this interest rate swap agreement are contained in the Fund's annual report to shareholders. \b \u001d  There can be no assurance that the Fund will have an interest rate swap in place at any given time nor can there be any assurance that, if an interest rate swap is in place, it will be successful in hedging the Fund's interest rate risk with respect to the AMPS. The implementation of this strategy is at the discretion of the AMPS Hedging Committee of the Fund's Board of Directors. \b \b    Important Information \b \u001d  Aberdeen Asset Management Inc., the Fund's Administrator, has prepared this report based on information sources believed to be accurate and reliable.

The amount would represent half of Bolivia's overall exports. \u001d  The manufacturing sector is expected to end the year with 27% of exports, followed by mining with 19% of exports. \u001d  In 2005, the hydrocarbons sector accounted for 47% of exports, up from less than 30% of exports in 2003. \u001d  The rise in hydrocarbons exports came despite the nationalization of Bolivia's oil and gas sector in May 2006, which at least temporarily has stalled new investments by foreign oil firms in the sector. Nationalization may lead to a slowdown in exports, as foreign companies are hesitant to develop crucial new gas deposits. \u001d  The rise in the value of gas and oil products exports in 2006 came due to increasing export volumes to Brazil, and due to rising gas prices, the Hydrocarbons Chamber said. \u001d  Gas exports rose from 15.4 million cubic meters a day in 2003 to 31 mcm/d in 2006, the chamber said. Of that, about 26 mcm/d currently are exported to Brazil, according to recent data from Brazil's state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR), or Petrobras. Bolivia exports the remainder to Argentina. \u001d  The price of natural gas from Bolivia to Brazil rose from $1 per million British Thermal Units, or BTU's, in 1999 to $1.9 per million BTU's in 2003, and to $4.03 per million BTU in October 2006, the Hydrocarbons Chamber said. \u001d  Argentina pays $5 per million BTU's since July 2006. \u001d  Bolivia currently is in talks with Brazil, trying to increase the price of gas sold to that country, a demand so far rejected by Petrobras. \b \u001d  -By Bernd Radowitz, Dow Jones Newswires; +5521-3288-5004; bernd.radowitz@dowjones.com; \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 07:06 ET (12:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"380b1d7274e9813f3fe62034b81db7ed","symR":["DCX","DCX.XE","DE0007100000"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Chrysler Group Conference Call to Announce December 2006 Sales","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T18:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DCX","DCX.XE","DE0007100000"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\bChrysler Group Conference Call to Announce December 2006 Sales \b \b\b \b\b \b\b    What:    Telephone conference call to discuss Chrysler Group's December \b\b             sales \b\b \b\b    Who:     Steven Landry, Vice President - Sales and Field Operations, \b\b             Chrysler Group \b\b             Michael Manley, Vice President - Sales Strategy and Dealer \b\b             Operations, Chrysler Group \b\b \b\b    When:    Wednesday, Jan. 3, 2007 - 3:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. EST \b\b \b\b    Details: Teleconference: Domestic telephone number: 800-857-0714 \b\b             International telephone number: 210-795-9123 \b\b             Call Leader: Kevin McCormick \b\b             Passcode: Sales \b\b \b\b    Other:   Following the conference call, starting at 5 p.m., there will be \b\b             a telephone replay available until Jan. 11, 2007, at 5 p.m. EST \b\b \b\b             Domestic telephone playback number: 800-509-8621 \b\b             International telephone playback number: 203-369-3807 \b\b \b\b    Contact: Kevin McCormick \b\b             (248) 512-6218 \b\b             klm15@dcx.com \b\b \b\b             Markus Mainka \b\b             (248) 512-2729 \b\b             mm1021@dcx.com \b\b \b\b \b\bSOURCE  Chrysler Group \b\b \b \b\b    /Web site: http://www.media.daimlerchrysler.com \b\b    /Web site: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com/ \b\b \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 13:21 ET (18:21 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"38a8460e729270af636d54d969f7a732","symR":["MMM","US88579Y1010"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"3M Completes Sale Of Its European Pharmaceuticals Business","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T18:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MMM","US88579Y1010"],"IndustryCodes":["IDD","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  3M Co.

The company has four regional wholesale lending offices. \u001d  MLN's outside public relations representatives referred inquiries to company executives. MLN officials, including the chief executive and general counsel, didn't respond to phone calls or emails. On Dec. 8, the company posted a note on its Web site saying it continued to operate normally. \u001d  MLN also has a big mortgage servicing arm, with a portfolio of more than $14 billion and over 100,000 accounts, according to the company's Web site. The status of the servicing business wasn't clear. \u001d  The decision by MLN to stop funding new loans, and to consider alternatives for its wholesale business, is the latest sign of an ongoing shakeout in in the subprime mortgage industry. Late last year, for example, two subprime lenders, including Ownit Mortgage Solutions shut down citing \"the current unfavorable conditions of the mortgage industry.\" \u001d  Some subprime issuers are facing liquidity problems as their so-called warehouse lenders withdraw credit lines.

Semashko had said he hoped a resolution of the gas price dispute would help the sides address the oil customs duty. \u001d  Belarus is offering to share the income from oil sales if Russia scraps the customs duty, and Semashko said that Minsk was willing to discuss a 50-50 split. Earlier, the government had offered Russia only a 15% share. \u001d  Oil resale profits and the gas Belarus bought from Russia at bargain prices until Monday helped authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko keep the country's Soviet-style, largely centrally planned economy running and, as a result, maintain his popularity and grip on power. \u001d  Belarus is a key Russian military ally and buffer against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the nations agreed a decade ago to form a close union. But the recent energy pressure suggests President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin is growing tired of supporting Lukashenko, who has resisted efforts to grant Moscow more control over his country's economy. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 13:31 ET (18:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"39c886e69a1c0397cd87ad28eebc4e34","symR":["ACW"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Accuride Corp Announces Chmn Of The Bd And Executive Management Appointments>ACW","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACW"],"IndustryCodes":["TRQ","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"39cf13ea915cf7d72ef45a36d8be134f","symR":["DX.B.T","SE","US8475601097"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Spectra Energy: New Natural Gas Midstream Company Launched in Houston","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T17:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DX.B.T","SE","US8475601097"],"IndustryCodes":["GAS"],"Story":"- Approximately $21 Billion in Assets - $3 Billion in Capital Expenditures for Growth Opportunities Projected Over Next Three Years - Initial Annual Dividend of 88 Cents Per Share \b \b \u001d  HOUSTON, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Spectra Energy Corp, the former natural gas businesses of Duke Energy, became a stand-alone, publicly traded company today, emerging as one of the leading pure play natural gas midstream companies in North America.

We have a strong balance sheet, the know-how and financial flexibility to grow our Spectra Energy Transmission business.\" \b \u001d  Wyrsch said Spectra Energy Transmission expects a Compounded Annual Growth Rate of 7 to 9 percent in ongoing segment Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) over the next three years. To accomplish this, the company plans to invest approximately $1 billion annually in expansion projects. \b \u001d  With approximately $21 billion of assets, Spectra Energy enjoys a strong balance sheet with a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 55 percent. The company expects to provide approximately 60 percent of its net income to shareholders in the form of annual dividends, with an initial annual dividend of 88 cents per share. \b \u001d  As previously announced, in conjunction with the spin-off, Duke Capital has been renamed Spectra Energy Capital and the Duke Energy Income Fund is now the Spectra Energy Income Fund. \b \u001d  At 10:30 a.m. CST today, employees and their families will watch as the new Spectra Energy sign is unveiled at the former Duke Energy building at 5400 Westheimer Court, Houston.

(NYSE:WTR) announced today that its subsidiary, Aqua New York, Inc., has acquired New York Water Service Corporation from Utilities & Industries Corp., LLC in a transaction valued at approximately $51 million. The transaction included a cash payment of $27.4 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and the assumption of $23.5 million of debt. The newly acquired water system serves approximately 135,000 residents in Nassau County, Long Island. \b \u001d  Including the closing of New York Water Service, Aqua America recorded a total of 28 acquisitions of water and wastewater systems and septage hauling/wastewater services companies in 2006. The transactions expanded the company's existing operations in North Carolina, Virginia, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Indiana and Illinois. Since 1995, the company has completed approximately 200 acquisitions. The U.S. water industry is very fragmented, with more than 50,000 water systems operating in the country. \b \u001d  With the New York Water Service acquisition, Aqua America's overall customer base expanded by more than 7 percent in 2006 through acquisitions and organic growth. This increase exceeds the company's goal of 4 percent growth, which is double the utility industry's growth average. In addition, the company continues to engage in various growth ventures to expand its service territory - usually at the request of real estate developers - to provide water and/or wastewater utility services to brand new developments. In 2006, the company closed nearly 80 new developer systems, which are projected to eventually serve more than 10,000 residents. \b \u001d  \"The closing of New York Water Service puts an exclamation point on another solid year for our company's growth-through-acquisition strategy,\" said Aqua America Chairman Nicholas DeBenedictis. \"Along with our many tuck-in acquisitions and the continued expansion of our non-regulated wastewater services business, we are pleased to cap off 2006 with an immediately accretive, platform-building acquisition that establishes an important beachhead in the country's third most-populous state. From this base, we look forward to pursuing additional growth opportunities across New York in the years to come.\" \b \u001d  The New York Public Service Commission unanimously approved the New York Water Service acquisition last month. The system provides public water in the well-established southeastern Nassau County communities of Merrick, North Merrick, Bellmore, North Bellmore, Wantagh, Seaford, and portions of Levittown and Massapequa. As a result of the acquisition, New York becomes Aqua America's seventh-largest state operation. \b \u001d  \"With its long history in the water business, New York Water Service will remain the same fine company it has always been - only now under the ownership and management of a larger, more experienced company with additional environmental and technical expertise,\" DeBenedictis said. \"What's more, we are pleased that the New York Water Service managers and staff will remain with the Aqua team and will continue to serve customers as they have in the past.\" New York Water Service will adopt the Aqua New York name in the near future. \b \u001d  DeBenedictis added, \"This acquisition makes us a major investor in Long Island, as we plan to spend approximately $14.4 million in infrastructure and water quality system improvements through 2010. We will invest $3.6 million to complete the current installation of radio frequency meter reading technology, which will allow us to read the customers' water meters remotely without having to access their property.\" The company also plans to rehabilitate two major water supply wells to improve water quality and will construct a third well for needed water supply. \b \u001d  Aqua America, Inc. is the largest U.S.-based publicly traded water and wastewater utility holding company, serving approximately 2.8 million residents in Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Indiana, Virginia, Maine, Missouri, and South Carolina. Aqua America is listed on both the New York and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges under the ticker symbol WTR. \b \u001d  This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that address, among other things, potential additional growth opportunities, the projected investment in and improvements to the acquired system, the expected timing and extent of improvements to systems, the effect of the acquisition of the described business, and possible benefits from the acquired operations. There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements including: the risk that the proposed improvements will not be made as projected or have the indicated benefits; the costs related to the transaction; the risk that anticipated benefits will not be obtained or will not be obtained within the time anticipated; and other key factors that we have indicated could adversely affect our business and financial performance contained in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

He said it's possible Railpower could achieve net income of C$9.5 million by 2008, assuming the road switcher can be sold for more than C$1 million a unit. \u001d  Whale further noted he had assumed Railpower would need to raise C$25 million in equity at 49 Canadian cents a share, leading to a significant increase in the number of shares outstanding by 2008.

(OTC:PGDP) (Frankfurt:P6G) (WKN:A0HGKQ) is pleased to release the results of a trenching program in the central part of its San Miguel concession block near Temoris, Chihuahua, Mexico. The five trenches reported are located in the San Antonio - Carmen zone which is adjoining and to the north of the San Luis zone where Paramount reported drill results that included 35.5 g/t gold across 4.0 meters (see news release dated August 1 2006). \b \u001d  Trenches nine through thirteen span approximately 175 meters along strike on the San Antonio - Carmen zone. Trench ZSA-09 starts approximately 50 meters north from trench ZSA-08 (88.4 meters averaging 50.2 g/t silver, including 1.0 meters of 1,300 g/t silver). Trench ZSA-10 is approximately 90 meters north of ZSA-09. Trenches ZSA-11 and ZSA-13 continue across strike to the west of ZSA-10 with approximately 50 meters between them. Trench ZSA-12 is approximately 70 meters north of ZSA-10. \b \u001d  Paramount's Manager of Exploration in Mexico, Bill Reed, commented: \"The trenching results at San Antonio compare very well with earlier trenches in the San Luis, San Jose and La Union zones. These recently completed trenches in the San Antonio - Carmen zone have exposed a series of sub-parallel en echelon veins that extend 175 meters to the north of those previously reported trenching results with a width of more than 200 meters. This confirms our prior observation that this mineralized system is strengthening to the north. We will continue drilling this zone immediately after the start of the New Year.\" \b \b   The highlights of the trenching include: \b \u001d  ZSA-09 - 61.9 meters averaging 79.0 g/t Ag, including 2.1 meters of 625 g/t Ag with 1.24% lead, and 1.0 meters of 887 g/t Ag with 5.59% lead. \b \u001d  ZSA-10 - 36.5 meters averaging 56.3 g/t Ag, including 17.5 meters of 87 g/t Ag. \b \u001d  ZSA-12 - 30.0 meters averaging 87.7 g/t Ag, including 3.0 meters of 422 g/t Ag, and 7.0 meters of 195 g/t Ag with 1.6% zinc. \b \b   ZSA-13 - 1.0 meters 62.0 g/t Ag and 0.79% lead. \b \u001d  The trenches are excavated to a depth of 2-3 meters and extend from west to east across the quartz veins and stockwork quartz veins that host silver and gold mineralization in the Guazapares mining district. The trenches were cut through thin overburden to better define drill targets and spaced approximately 50 to 75 meters apart. The geology of the trenches is mapped in detail and continuous rock chip samples of no more than one meter in length are collected from the trench walls. \b \u001d  Drill holes have been completed on

(Nasdaq: EVOL), a leading provider of software solutions and services to the wireless, wireline and IP carrier market, today announced plans to realign and strengthen its executive management team to better support the Company's 2007 growth initiatives.  The management changes will occur in stages during the first quarter of this year. \b \u001d  Effective January 1, 2007, Thad Dupper, executive vice president, worldwide sales and marketing, assumed the position of president, a title previously held by Stephen Gartside, chief executive officer.  During the first quarter of 2007 the Company expects to hire a new vice president, worldwide sales to be based in Europe.  Once the new vice president, worldwide sales is in place the plan calls for Dupper to take over the role of CEO from Gartside, who will remain active with the Company as chairman of the board. George Hallenbeck, the current chairman, will continue as a board member. The Company expects the changes to be completed by April 1, 2007. \b \u001d  The promotion of Dupper is part of a planned progression and allows Gartside to focus on strategy and select corporate affairs in his new role as chairman of the board. \b \u001d  \"Over the last three years, Thad and I, along with the management team and employees throughout the organization, have transformed Evolving Systems from a U.S.-centric company into a global company and a leader in the wireless activation and number management space,\" Gartside said.  \"In mid-2006 I approached the board with my recommendation to elevate Thad to president and CEO as we implement our growth strategy that he has helped formulate.  The board enthusiastically supported this recommendation as well as my own move to chairman.  Building on the Company's solid second half 2006 performance, the first quarter of 2007 is the right time to move forward with these changes. Thad is a highly qualified executive manager and the right choice to guide Evolving Systems as president and CEO. \b \u001d  \"Evolving Systems' growth strategy requires us to expand our team and realign some key management positions,\" Gartside added.  \"Our plans provide for focused investments in existing core products that we expect will result in an expanded footprint with carriers in select areas that hold promise for long-term growth.  We are also evaluating complementary partnerships and other strategic activities. Geographically, we have an increasing focus on markets outside of the United States, so we believe it is appropriate that our new senior sales executive be located in Europe in closer proximity to key growth markets.\" \b \u001d  \"We have worked hard over the past three years to position Evolving Systems as a global company with a reputation for leading service activation and numbering solution products,\" Dupper said.  \"Our goal is to continue to build on that success by bringing innovative new products to market.  We have the right team in place to make this happen and I'm privileged to take on this new assignment.\" \b \u001d  Dupper joined Evolving Systems in 2004 to oversee sales, business development and marketing.  During his career he has served as senior executive vice president for Dun & Bradstreet, where he was responsible for their highest growth business unit and helped transform D&B to have a significant presence on the World Wide Web.

PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 02, 2007-- \b   3M today announced the launch of a new format of the 3M Confirm \bauthentication products with floating image technology that helps to \bprotect against counterfeiting and tampering. This new format offers \bmulti-layered overt and covert security features, and allows for the \bincorporation of additional security and tracking features into the \bsame label. \b \u001d  First introduced last April as the latest in a line of innovative security solutions, the Confirm authentication products with floating image technology from 3M feature an optically variable device (OVD) - a unique, overt security feature. The OVD image appears to \"float\" above or \"sink\" below the surface of the label and then disappear as the viewing angle changes, which enhances the brand with a visually attractive \"wow\" factor. Dramatic movement of the image is easy to detect and recognize using only the human eye, enabling quick and easy authentication that helps to prove the label and product are genuine. \b \u001d  \"This fully customizable strip is ideal for any market segments that are known victims of counterfeiting or fraud, such as major branded electronics, automotive parts, apparel or pharmaceuticals,\" said Bill Markovitz, marketing development manager, 3M Security Systems Division. \"The additional functionality of the new format allows manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to use just one label for easy authentication, bar codes, tracking and other additional security features, which cuts costs and increases efficiency and security.\" \b \u001d  The new format builds on 3M's proven retroreflective security technology - 3M Confirm security labels - which have been very well accepted in the security marketplace for more than 25 years. The floating image security feature enhances the inherent security of Confirm authentication labels and is based on 3M proprietary technology. Verification is easier than ever and can be accomplished by a diverse population. \b \u001d  For more than 30 years, 3M has provided premier security solutions and services that identify, authenticate, secure and track materials and information by combining security and productivity. Drawing on its broad technology base and expertise, 3M creates solutions for a wide array of security needs. Examples include issuance and authentication of travel documents and personal identification cards, brand and asset protection solutions to fight counterfeiting and tampering, file tracking solutions, and library security and workflow management solutions. \b \b   About 3M - A Global, Diversified Technology Company \b \u001d  Every day, 3M people find new ways to make amazing things happen.

Debt tied to expansion scuttled the IPO plan and sent Radnor on a hunt for new backers. \u001d  Tennenbaum invested $120 million in the company less than a year before its Aug. 21, 2006, bankruptcy filing.

And that worries a lot of businesses. \u001d  Concerns about the safety of sensitive data stored on these devices is also spawning a new security market. Smartphones - high-end phones that combine the functions of a PDA and computer - can now store copious amounts of data. Several high-profile laptop computer losses this year fanned fears about the risk posed by smartphones and other small devices with lots of memory. Boeing Co. (BA) reported in November that it lost a laptop crammed with the personal data of hundreds of thousands of employees. This was the company's third such breach in 13 months. \u001d  It's easy to imagine the problem getting more serious as smartphones get more popular. \u001d  \"As devices get smaller and have more storage, the likelihood that information can leak out has gone through the roof,\" said Bob Egner, vice president of product management and global marketing at encryption technology firm Pointsec. \u001d  Companies are recognizing the threat. Security consultants say companies are still trying to figure out how to secure content on mobile devices. Some of the steps seem like common sense: limiting remote access to internal files, adding password protection, limiting online access. Companies are also adding encryption to secure their data and installing technology that can track or prevent documents from getting sent by email or instant messenger. \u001d  Vendors like Credant, Symantec Corp. (SYMC) or Finnish-based F-Secure OYJ (FSC1V.HE) are eager to cater to the growing need to protect mobile devices, especially as prices in the PC security market have come down. The total mobile phone security market is expected to grow to $5 billion in 2011, up from the current $750 million, according to Juniper Research, a U.K. market research firm. \u001d  The interest in security is coming from the growing number of smartphones. Smartphone use in the U.S. is lagging Europe and Asia, but the number of such devices is clearly growing. According to Telephia, a San Francisco market research firm, there were just under 6 million smartphones in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter, up from a little over 4 million six months earlier. Of those, a little more than half are being purchased by businesses, the firm estimates. Other calculations on the smartphone market have yielded far larger numbers, but Telephia has a narrower definition for smartphones. \u001d  Many corporate employees are now accessing the same files on handhelds they use on PCs. Unlike in Europe and Asia where mobile security concerns generally come from consumers, who are accustomed to using their phones for more than talking, interest in the U.S. is mainly from companies. \b \b   Forgetful Employees \b \u001d  Despite the publicity around viruses, hacker programs and phishing scams on mobile phones, the biggest security threat to companies is not from external breaches but from forgetful employees. \u001d  \"The phone left in a taxi is the most common security issue these days,\" said Scott Horn, general manager at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). \u001d  Interest in encryption has jumped as companies figure out what to do when forgetful employees leave devices behind. Encryption firms Credant and Pointsec have seen demand pick up dramatically this year. \u001d  Credant, Addison, Texas, encrypts data that is sitting on laptops, smartphones and other mobile devices and helps companies set up rules about how users can transfer files. Users also might be directed to enter a password or show a fingerprint. \u001d  In the coming year, the firms expect that protecting data stored on SD cards, USB sticks and memory cards will become more of a priority. To this end, Credant is developing products that will allow users to move encrypted data between devices more easily. \u001d  Pointsec, Lisle, Ill., similarly helped companies protect sensitive data with encryption. But while the threat has often been seen from the outside, the company is starting to guard against unscrupulous insiders as well. Egner says the company is preparing to launch a product later in the month that will help curb unauthorized file-sharing. \u001d  Attacking security with a different approach, Discretix, a San Mateo, Calif. technology firm, developed hardwarethat goes onto chip sets and encrypts data. Because it's not software, it's faster and harder to hack into, says Jacob Greenblatt, Discretix's director of strategy. The technology helps prevent data from falling into the wrong hands. While it doesn't combat viruses or Trojan horses, it can prevent an infection from spreading to sensitive parts of a smartphone. Discretix's Cryptocell technology will be included on three different Sony-Ericsson phones. Most Samsung GSM phones will also include the technology, Greenblatt said. \u001d  Microsoft has come out with a security package for Windows Mobile 5.0 that will allow users to manage security on their mobile devices in a similar fashion as on PCs. For example, the security pack will allow companies to set up passwords, limiting network access. Also, like with Credant or Pointsec, administrators will be able to wipe out data remotely or block access if a mobile device is lost or stolen. The software giant also announced that a new version of Exchange will include some new rights management functions for email, which can help prevent data from falling into the wrong hands. \u001d  For existing security giants, such as Symantec and McAfee Inc. (MFE), the focus on corporate security on mobile devices has been a boon. \u001d  In addition to threats of corporate espionage, companies are looking to ward off emerging viruses, just as on computers. Some emerging threats are snoopware, which is similar to spyware but can compromise some features on a cellphone such as the microphone or camera - enabling hackers to spy on their victims, said Khoi Nguyen, group product manager of mobile security at Symantec. \u001d  The emergence of smaller, portable devices has brought both benefits and headaches. And though the security industry is coming up with solutions, some of the best prescriptives are still common sense, according to industry-watchers: don't lose a smartphone or leave it out for someone to steal, don't open attachments from strangers and don't download a lot of applications. \u001d  -By Ellen Sheng, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5863; ellen.sheng@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 11:00 ET (16:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"449b2fd5c95aaa0c905e348511b3606a","symR":["CVG.T","CA17965L1004","CVG.T","CA17965L1004"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Clairvest Names Cameron Williamson As Fincl Chief >CVG.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T16:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CVG.T","CA17965L1004"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 11:25 ET (16:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"44d590333a5f608db034a05ac04216f0","symR":["HRH"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Hilb Rogal & Hobbs Says Glencairn's Hearn Named CEO Of Current Staff, Staff HRH London Ops>HRH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T22:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HRH"],"IndustryCodes":["INP","INS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 17:05 ET (22:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"44eaa4f0c9829214fdbc02f1d2c7eeee","symR":["BIOM","BRA.T","MRK.XE","CA09161R1064","DE0006599905"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Biomira: Merck KGaA To Enroll Patients For Stimuvax Trial","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T17:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BIOM","BRA.T","MRK.XE","CA09161R1064","DE0006599905"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","XDJGI","XMDAX"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Biomira Inc.

However, the fund is broadly focused, allowing the managers to rotate in and out of different groups, recognizing that the relevant price performances of different commodities will fluctuate despite the general overall uptrend in resource prices. \u001d  For instance, the fund managers have been largely out of oil and gas stocks for the last year, preferring producers of other commodities such as uranium and zinc, Brockelsby said. The fund owns only one oil and gas stock, Pacific Stratus Energy Ltd. (PSE.V), an oil and gas company operating in Colombia. \u001d  For the one-year period ending Nov. 30, the fund is up 61%, sharply outpacing the average gain of 21% for the comparable group and a 20% rise in the relevant index, according to Globefund. On a three-year basis, the fund is up 22% versus 28% for the group average and a similar rise for the comparable index. \u001d  \"There is still an economic cycle within this longer-term (rising) trend (in commodity prices), and within that cycle there is more demand for different commodities at certain points in the cycle,\" Cook said. \u001d  Take oil, for example. Since the price of oil \"ran farthest first\" reaching a price in the high US$70 a barrel range, consumers started to reduce their demand for crude, resulting in the subsequent slide in the price. That said, demand for crude remains relatively strong, given that the price remains around US$60 a barrel, Cook noted. \b \b   Bullish On Uranium \b \u001d  Indeed, Cook cites these still relatively higher prices for crude as a reason for the mangers' bullish view of uranium - an alternative source of energy. \u001d  The fund's uranium holdings include Paladin Resources Ltd. (PDN.AU) and SXR Uranium One Inc. (SXR.T). Both companies also highlight the managers' focus on mid-sized companies and some small-capitalized firms with either growing production bases or those just about to go into production. Often, these types of companies offer better value and have the potential for an upward valuation re-rating, the managers said. \u001d  For example, early next year Paladin is expected to start production at its mine in Namibia. In addition, Paladin and SXR could be takeover targets either for a bigger company or private-equity firms, the managers suggested. \u001d  In the base-metal group, the fund managers are particularly bullish on zinc and nickel producers. The supply-demand situation is tighter for these metals than for copper at the moment, as the price of the latter typically does better earlier in the cycle, the fund managers. \u001d  The fund's zinc-based holdings include Breakwater Resources Ltd. (BWLRF) and Hudbay Minerals Inc. (HBM.T). The fund also holds Rio Narcea Gold Mines Ltd. (RNO), a gold and nickel producer, and Skye Resources Inc. (SKR.T), a nickel producer. \u001d  Copper producer First Quantum Minerals Ltd (FM.T) is a stock the managers recently sold, reflecting a build-up in copper inventories and concerns over the margins of miners of this metal, the manager said. \u001d  -Ben Dummett, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2024; ben.dummett@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 12:00 ET (17:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4582d760ae5df8cf885cf88fb44fd608","symR":["CANI","CKFR"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CheckFree Announces Pact To Buy Carreker>CKFR","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CANI","CKFR"],"IndustryCodes":["FAD","SOF","SVC","XDJGI","XNQ1","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"468faaaf81ac7d6343be5fd4ab59cc47","symR":["RVX.T","CA76128M1086"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Resverlogix To Raise $15M In Conv Debt Financing","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T14:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RVX.T","CA76128M1086"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 09:30 ET (14:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4691c5b945d5356233f65c63febae189","symR":["1020848.FR","12052.FR","SZE","FR0000120529","FR0010208488"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Artemis Weighs Options On Possible Suez Bid","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T10:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1020848.FR","12052.FR","SZE","FR0000120529","FR0010208488"],"IndustryCodes":["GAS","MUT","XB20","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\u001d  (This updates an item that ran at 0835 GMT with comments from an analyst, Suez, GdF and the French market regulator.) \b \b   By Anne-Sylvaine Chassany \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--French investment holding company Artemis SA, controlled by billionaire businessman Francois Pinault, said Tuesday that it is keeping all its options open over a possible bid for French-Belgian energy and water group Suez (SZE), sending Suez shares to new highs. \u001d  \"After the request of (French market regulator) AMF, Artemis confirms that at this stage, no decision has been made regarding a possible bid for Suez shares and that all options remain open,\" Artemis said. \u001d  The statement comes after several weeks of speculation over an imminent Artemis bid for Suez, which is struggling to make its own planned merger with French state-owned gas company Gaz de France SA (1020848.FR) materialize. \u001d  In his statement Tuesday, \"Pinault is indicating he doesn't rule out anything,\" Fideuram Wargny analyst Julien Picard said. \"But I don't see anything happening before the French presidential election in the spring, as energy is a highly sensitive, political subject.\" \u001d  According to French market regulation, any entity that declares it doesn't intend to launch a bid for a listed company is then prevented from actually launching a bid for the following six months, \"unless there are important changes\" in the environment, the situation or the shareholding of the interested parties. \u001d  \"We're currently studying the terms of the (Artemis) statement in light of our regulation,\" a spokeswoman for AMF said. \u001d  At 1005 GMT, Suez shares were up 1.5% at EUR39.8, implying a market value of EUR49.9 billion for the company. \u001d  Suez shares have surged in the past several weeks after a court postponed the GdF merger until after the French presidential election, making it more  unlikely as time passes and raising the chances of alternative bids for Suez. \u001d  The French socialist opposition party, which has opposed the privatization of GdF - a prerequisite for the merger with Suez - has said it would block the merger if it wins the election. \u001d  Several reports in the French press citing unnamed sources have indicated Pinault's interest in bidding for the whole of Suez, with the plan to sell the energy division back to GdF and to keep the water and waste business. \u001d  \"Suez is an integrated industrial group. There are no assets for sale,\" a spokesman for Suez said Tuesday. \u001d  A GdF spokeswoman reminded that GdF's chairman and chief executive, Jean-Francois Cirelli, last week told French magazine Paris Match that GdF and Pinault did \"not have any project in common\" and that \"the ideal solution\" for GdF remained a merger with Suez. \u001d  At 1005 GMT.

All companies are domiciled in New York, NY. The outlook for all ratings is stable. \b \u001d  The ratings recognize Navigators' leading position as a global provider of insurance to the marine energy sector, its solid level of capitalization, management's conservative approach to underwriting and claims management and its improving level of profitability. \b \u001d  These positive rating factors are somewhat offset by the group's rapid growth in relatively new lines of business in recent years and its somewhat elevated dependence on reinsurance. Nevertheless, the financial flexibility and explicit support of the holding company is sufficient to offset these concerns. The financial leverage of the parent organization is a conservative 19% of debt-to-total tangible capital, with coverage ratios far exceeding A.M. Best's requirements for the current rating levels.

Forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control. Although the company believes that the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by such forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons. Risk factors and uncertainties that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, the following: the company's commission revenues are based on premiums set by insurers and any decreases in these premium rates could result in revenue decreases for the company; the level of contingent commissions is difficult to predict and any material decrease in the company's collection of them is likely to have an adverse impact on operating results; the company has eliminated National Override Agreements commissions effective for business written on or after January 1, 2005, and it is uncertain whether additional contingent commissions payable to the company will offset the loss of such revenues; the company's growth has been enhanced through acquisitions, but the company may not be able to successfully identify and attract suitable acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions; the company's failure to integrate an acquired insurance agency efficiently may have an adverse effect on the company; the general level of economic activity can have a substantial impact on revenues that is difficult to predict; a strong economic period may not necessarily result in higher revenues; the company's success in the future depends, in part, on the company's ability to attract and retain quality producers; the company may be subject to increasing costs arising from errors and omissions claims against the company; the company is subject to governmental regulation which may impact operating results and/or growth; the business practices and broker compensation arrangements of the company are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by governmental authorities and related private litigation; the company is subject to a number of investigations and legal proceedings, which if determined unfavorably for the company, may adversely affect the company's results of operations; a decline in the company's ability to obtain new financing and/or refinance current borrowings may adversely affect the company; if the company is unable to respond in a timely and cost-effective manner to rapid technological change in the insurance intermediary industry, there may be a resulting adverse effect on business and operating results; and quarterly and annual variations in the company's commissions and fees that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected impacts on the company's results of operations. \b \u001d  The company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements to reflect occurrences or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.

(LEN) Chief Executive Stuart Miller is seeing no signs that the deteriorating home-building market has bottomed, and Lennar expects to take land-related writedowns of between $400 million and $500 million in its fiscal fourth quarter to reflect the weak conditions. \u001d  \"Market conditions continued to weaken throughout  the fourth quarter, and we have not yet seen tangible evidence of a market recovery,\" said Miller, in a statement. \u001d  At the same time, the company slashed its exposure to the troubled California market, where market conditions have been deteriorating at a fast clip. Lennar, along with its partner LNR Property Corp, agreed to sell a 62% stake in their LandSource joint venture, whose primary investment, Newhall Land and Farming, owns 15,000 acres of land in the Santa Clarita Valley of California. Lennar and LNR will each receive $660 million for the stake from the new partner, MW Housing. Lennar will continue to get management fees and retain a 19% stake in the partnership. \u001d  \"I think it sends a signal that they don't want to have their capital at risk in Southern California for the next few years,\" said Raymond James analyst Rick Murray. He sees the sale as a sign that the company doesn't believe that a rebound in California will happen in the near future. \u001d  Murray adds that it is a win-win situation for Lennar. \u001d  \"It looks, on the surface, to be a fantastic deal for Lennar,\" said Murray. \"The company is effectively selling a 62% interest and recovering basically all of the capital that it originally put into the deal when it acquired Newhall.\" As a result, Lennar will continue to hold a 19% interest and collect management fees on the venture \"and have no capital at risk,\" he said. Murray doesn't hold shares in Lennar, and his firm hasn't had an investment-banking relationship with the company in the past year. \u001d  Lennar, based in Miami, also offered its preliminary results for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Nov. 30. \u001d  The builder's orders fell 6% in the latest quarter, which is better than many of its rivals, who have been experiencing declines of 20% to 40%. However, the small order decline reflects aggressive price slashing and incentives, not improved demand. \u001d  Lennar has acknowledged from the start of the housing slowdown that it has resorted to price slashing and other incentives to move sales. It adopted this strategy early on based on its belief that selling homes and maintaining good liquidity was more important than keeping house prices up during the slowdown. \u001d  \"While we are hopeful that low interest rates, strong employment and a healthy economy will help stimulate a recovery in 2007, we have continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet by delivering our backlog, selling inventory aggressively and renegotiating our land positions,\" said Miller. \"We ended the 2006 fiscal year with zero outstanding on our $2.7 billion revolving credit facility and over $600 million of cash on the balance sheet.\" \u001d  The price discounting and incentives took a toll on the company's gross profit margins, which were \"materially lower\" in the quarter, he said. \u001d  Lennar expects to report earnings in the range of 70 cents to 75 cents a share.  However, the company will take a charge in the range of $400 million to $500 million, in land-related writedowns. When this is factored in, the company will post a loss of between 88 cents and $1.28 a share.

But they have failed to make headway in one key area: music programming. \u001d  For a variety of reasons -- including fear of piracy and the need to be paid -- the major record labels and music publishers that control the rights to about 75% of the commercially released music in the U.S. have refused to make deals that would allow songs to be used in podcasts. Consequently, podcasts have been blocked from using this music, at least legitimately. That has stopped music-oriented radio programming from being available as podcasts. \u001d  That is starting to change. San Francisco-based Rock River Communications Inc. has struck some of the first deals to license major-label content for podcasts. Rock River, which specializes in making the mix CDs sold at the check-out counters of retailers like Gap Inc. and Williams-Sonoma Inc.'s Pottery Barn, is creating a series of promotional podcasts on behalf of corporate clients including DaimlerChrysler AG and Ford Motor Co. \u001d  Chrysler and Ford pay Sony BMG Music Entertainment -- the joint venture of Sony Corp. and Germany's Bertelsmann AG -- a flat fee, which the companies decline to disclose, for the right to distribute the podcasts for a year, regardless of how many or how few copies are downloaded. Users can keep the programs on their personal computers or MP3 players indefinitely. \u001d  \"What we're doing with podcasts is taking the King Biscuit Flower Hour notion of sponsored content,\" says Rock River President and Chief Executive Jeff Daniel. He is referring to a popular radio program in the 1970s and '80s that was sponsored by a regional baking-products company called King Biscuit Flour. \"It's a patronage model.\" \u001d  Thanks to a tangle of legal and financial problems, record labels have been slow to license their music for podcasts. For starters, podcasts are almost all delivered in the MP3 format, which includes none of the special software that other digital-music formats use to prevent wholesale copying. That has contributed to podcasts' popularity by making it simple to disseminate them and load them onto any digital music player, not just iPods. But it has also made music companies uneasy, since they have in nearly all cases insisted that online music sellers wrap their files in copy-protection software. \u001d  The other major hurdle facing podcasts has been the difficulty of figuring out how labels and artists should be paid. Many podcasts are free, like broadcast or Internet radio; but because of key differences between those media and podcasting, the performance rights royalties that are collected from broadcasters don't apply to podcasts. Plus, given that many podcasters are do-it-yourselfers who give their content away, it isn't even clear where those royalties might come from. \u001d  For now, Rock River has struck licensing deals only with Sony BMG, to include four to eight songs in podcasts created on behalf of its clients. The \"Chrysler Music Legends\" series focuses on a specific artist in each program, and includes 30-second ads from the car maker at a few points in the program. Subjects of the biographical programs have included Miles Davis, Johnny Cash and Journey. \u001d  The programs are available from Chrysler's home page and from the podcasting section of Apple Computer Inc.'s iTunes Music Store. The Ford series isn't due to launch until later this month, but Rock River executives say they are in discussions to license content from multiple major labels. \u001d  Licensing music for podcasting has long been a source of internal debate at music labels. Many executives argue that it is worth handing over some content to spur consumer interest, while others maintain that the companies erode the value of their product by knowingly allowing it to be freely downloaded and copied. \u001d  Ted Cohen, a digital-media strategist who for many years was an executive at EMI Group PLC, says that keeping up-and-coming artists \"protected\" from use in podcasts has often backfired. \"We've protected them so well nobody knows they exist,\" he quips. \u001d  Adam Block, senior vice president and general manager of Sony BMG's Legacy Recordings, says the podcasts are \"essentially a movie trailer for our projects.\" He says the possibility of the shows' being copied wasn't much of a concern because the songs are embedded within a long program that would be difficult to redistribute. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 00:00 ET (05:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"53d57c3b2b12a79637b5fd2d9f482586","symR":["CADAY"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Canada Bonds End Higher In Reflection Of Gains Elsewhere","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CADAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b \u001d  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canadian bonds ended higher in very light dealings Tuesday, following the early direction set in the U.S. Treasurys market and then coasting the rest of the way after the U.S. bond market's early close in honor of late former President Gerald Ford. \b   4.25s 2008   100.46   up 0.06   4.00% vs 4.01% \b   3.75s 2011    99.09   up 0.10   3.97% vs 3.98% \b   4.00s 2016    99.54   up 0.20   4.06% vs 4.08% \b   5.75s 2033   126.02   up 0.32   4.12% vs 4.14% \b   10-Yr Spread to U.S. 10-Yr:  -63 vs -63 \u001d  There are no Canadian economic data releases scheduled until Thursday, and direction for the local bond market continued to be largely set elsewhere, bond watchers said. \u001d  The early close of U.S. Treasurys trading and the full close of some other U.S. markets for Ford's memorial observances meant that thinly traded holiday conditions persisted in both bond markets Tuesday. \u001d  The modest gains for both Canadian and U.S. bonds were mostly a reflection of some softer-than-expected manufacturing data out of Europe that also boosted European government bonds, and also marked a needed rebound from the exaggerated selling that closed 2006 last week. \u001d  \"It just took a little bit of buying in very thin markets to give prices a push upwards,\" said fixed-income strategist Mark Chandler of RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. \"Over the holiday period yields had crept up a few basis points - again in very illiquid trade - so some of the gains we saw today were just some payback for what happened over the holidays.\" \u001d  Chandler said that the main risks for the remainder of the week likely are that prices will continue to rise and correct from the recent selling, particularly if this week's key U.S. and Canadian data releases underperform forecasts. \u001d  The U.S. will see the Institute for Supply Management's December index of manufacturing activity Wednesday, as well as December non-farm payrolls figures on Friday, when Canada also releases its December employment report. \u001d  \"I think there's more of a chance that the data comes in a bit on the soft side,\" Chandler said, adding that interest rate futures markets may be underestimating the odds of U.S. rate cuts over the next few months, and that weaker data beginning this week may lead to some re-evaluation of the policy outlook. \u001d  Canadian economic data have been markedly weaker recently, and the Canadian bond market has some underpinning from notions that the Bank of Canada may again downgrade its growth estimates and perhaps switch to a more dovish policy stance at its coming series of public statements later in January. \u001d  The Canadian central bank makes its next scheduled interest rate announcement on Jan. 16, followed by a monetary policy report update on Jan. 18. \u001d  -By Paul Evans; Dow Jones Newswires; (416) 306-2022; paulr.evans@dowjones.com \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:13 ET (20:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"54523eaf09abe2b1c7d63554505a4378","symR":["TIE","US8883392073"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Titanium Metals Sells Stake In Venture; Sees $39M 4Q Gain","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T12:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TIE","US8883392073"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Titanium Metals Corp.

I was off all last week, which was as much of me as Ruthie could take. \u001d  I pleaded but then Ruthie remembered that I'd voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976. I was lucky she didn't toss me out of the house on New Year's Day. \u001d  Ruthie and I enjoyed our usual hellzapoppin' New Year's Eve. I awoke from my extended nap at 11:40 p.m., which woke her up. I said, \"Oh good, we can ring in the new year together.\" By 11:55 p.m., she had fallen asleep again. \u001d  That left just me and CNN's Anderson Cooper to ring in the New Year. \b \u001d  Half A Roll Of Quarters \b \u001d  We are, after all, two days into the second quarter of 2007 so we can assert with a great degree of literalism that the fourth-quarter 2006 Earnings Season has begun. \u001d  There are about 20 listings on the Dow Jones Newswires calendar of companies slated to report quarterly results this week. The figurative Earnings Season does not begin until next week when Alcoa becomes the first of the Dow Jones Industrial Average 30 to report results. \u001d  There are three events on the U.S. financial calendar this week that are worth noting: The minutes of the Dec. 12 Federal Open Market Committee meeting and the Institute for Supply Management's report on December manufacturing activity, both of which will arrive on Wednesday, and Friday's jobs report for December. \u001d  In November, the manufacturing activity index from the Institute for Supply Management signaled contraction by dropping below 50 to a reading of 49.5. The Dow Jones call for December is 50, which is not \"Whoop-de-doo, whoop-de-doo/I hear a polka/And my troubles are through.\" \u001d  Our call for December nonfarm jobs is that a total of 115,000 were created, down from 132,000 in November. This would be called \"trend-like,\" which is what you say when you have nothing else to say. Several chief economists see job growth last month of a mere 100,000 or so. \b \u001d  Third Wake Up Call \b \u001d  You know how certain things drive you wild even as you are berating yourself for responding so mightily to something so trivial. \u001d  For all of 2006, my daily e-mail of the top stories from the BBC Online said \"Copyright BBC 2005\" at the bottom. I ground my teeth and resisted the urge to say anything until some time in the third quarter when I e-mailed the Beeb Online to suggest, with overweening civility, that they might seriously consider updating their sign-off to \"Copyright BBC 2006.\" \u001d  Sometime during the fourth quarter, I e-mailed the folks at the BBC asking them to please change the copyright date, a request which was again ignored. \u001d  This morning, I walked into my cubicle where I sat down to find at the end of the Top Stories daily e-mail for Jan. 2, 2007, \"Copyright BBC 2005.\" \u001d  Perhaps, not following U.K. affairs as closely as those who live there, I made a mistake in the second e-mail by referring to myself as \"a close personal friend of the Prime Minister, Tony Blair.\" \b \u001d  Nic-O-Tweens \b \u001d  Here's something I did not know: In the U.K., you can buy cigarettes once you've turned 16. \u001d  In an example of what might be called \"bracket creep,\" the U.K. Health Ministry estimates that 9% of the country's lads and lassies ages 11 to 15 smoke. \u001d  But hold on. Later this year, the legal smoking age in England and Wales will be raised to 18. \u001d  I'm of two minds: Of course, we don't want 11-year-olds, or anyone else for that matter, lighting up. On the other hand, I did not wait until I was 18 to begin stealing my father's Pall Malls. \u001d  The world over is crammed with legislation that cannot possibly be enforced. \u001d  Speaking of legislation that can be enforced, a handful of states have just raised the minimum wage. Soon, the Democratic Congress will pass an increase in the federal minimum wage and President George W. Bush has promised to sign it into law. \u001d  I read a lot, and so do you, about the pros and cons of raising the minimum wage. One thing I never read - the issue should have been discussed, even if the sum defies calculation - is how many untold millions in raises will be withheld by employers in anticipation of the time, nearly upon us, when raises will be forced upon them. \u001d  Yeah, lucky you. You got 40 more cents an hour but the boss was going to give you 60. \u001d  Then too, if my minimum wage goes to $7.40 an hour from $7.00, speak to me not of hefty percentages. I will still be making a bit less than $300 a week, which will buy me room and board at Mummy and Daddy's, which will leave enough left over for gasoline and a car payment, assuming the Mater and the Pater are not gougers. \u001d  For the purposes of supporting oneself, a minimum wage of less than, say, $20 a hour, is a joke. \b \u001d  What Me Worry? \b \u001d  You will pardon my thickness but what if my biweekly paycheck were to triple between pay periods and I were to be asked about the miraculous increase, and I were to respond that the increase was agreed to at a special meeting of the Dow Jones board of directors. \u001d  Later, it was discovered by an \"independent committee\" that there was no special meeting and that DJ's CEO, Rich Zannino, when asked about my heady increase, replied, \"Jim who?\" \u001d  You can see the trouble I'm having with Steve Jobs's 7.5 million misdated stock options, a matter that the market believes was disposed of when Al Gore - yes, that Al Gore - signed off last week on a report that everything at AAPL was jake, except for maybe two guys we are not naming who might have done something but, hey, they left the company. \u001d  Looking at George Stahl's story on Dow Jones Newswires, I am gobsmacked by two paragraphs: \b \u001d  1) \"The findings (of the Gore Committee) conform to earlier statements from the company that Jobs was aware of the favorable grant dates and that there was no misconduct by Apple's current management. The review added, however, that Jobs recommended some of the favorable grant dates.\" \b \u001d  2) \"The board committee found that a grant to Jobs of options to buy 7.5 million shares was improperly recorded as having been approved at a special meeting of the board on Oct. 19, 2001. No special meeting occurred on that date, the board found.\" \b \u001d  Whatever league these people are playing in, I'm way too thick to play along with them. \b \u001d  (Jim Murphy, resident iconoclast at Dow Jones Newswires and veteran observer of global business trends, can be reached at (201) 938-2145 or by e-mail at Jim.Murphy@DowJones.Com) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"56f44538f414a51937fad25aa4e03874","symR":["ALXN"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Alexion to Present at the 25th Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T15:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ALXN"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\bAlexion to Present at the 25th Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference \b \b\b \b   CHESHIRE, Conn., Jan. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, \bInc.

But a healthy economy meant a slow year for corporate restructurings, as Chapter 11 filings by businesses dropped to their lowest level in more than 10 years. \u001d  As 2007 begins, turnaround professionals are crossing their fingers in hope that the next wave of restructurings is around the corner. Experts say the low-cost financing deals that have saved companies from filing for Chapter 11 protection could fall apart as market conditions change. \u001d  \"It doesn't take a lot of courage to predict that there will be some level of increase in activity in light of the low level of activity currently,\" said Tom Sperry, senior managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers' corporate-restructuring arm. \u001d  Although the markets are still flush with cash from the hundreds of funds that specialize in distressed securities, the \"fundamental laws of financial physics have not changed,\" he said. \"If you borrow too much, the music stops. And if you can't pay it back you're going to have to restructure.\" \u001d  Companies in the real estate industry, including home builders, building-materials manufacturers and sub-prime lenders --those that deal with borrowers with bad credit--could hit the skids this year if home sales remain low and borrowers default on adjustable-rate mortgages. \u001d  \"Home builders are sitting on undeveloped land they once considered assets,\" aid Tom Henderson, a Houston attorney and a member of the Turnaround Management Association's international board of directors. \"Now the land's become just another form of liability as sales of new homes in most markets have slowed.\" \u001d   The health care industry is also under the microscope for potential trouble in 2007, and turnaround professionals are continuing to keep a close eye on the troubled auto industry as General Motors Corp. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F) continue to downsize and squeeze suppliers. \u001d  Experts See A Slowing Economy Fueling Bankruptcies \u001d  Some experts say 2007 can't be much slower than last year. In 2006, the top five bankruptcies totaled only about $13 billion in assets, compared with $101.3 billion in 2005. In the 12-month period that ended in September, business Chapter 11 filings dropped to 6,003 -- the lowest level since the mid-1990s. \u001d  John Lonski, an economist with Moody's Investors Service, said the default rate for U.S. speculative-grade corporate bonds is likely to inch up in 2007 -- but remain well below the annual average of the past 20 years. Moody's predicts a default rate between 2.5% and 3%, up from 2% in November. \u001d  Diane Vazza, a Standard & Poor's managing director who specializes in distressed debt, said S&P has a nearly identical forecast -- 2.5% to 3% by the end of 2007. \"These companies are still propped up by an enormous amount of liquidity,\" Vazza said. \u001d  \"Up until this point, companies have been able to shrug off any speed bump,\" she said. \"But as the economy slows, these companies are more exposed because they don't have a cushion.\" Top economic forecasters expect the growth of U.S. gross domestic product to slow to a rate of 2.4% this year, down from an estimated 3.3% in 2006. \u001d  The surge in leveraged buyouts, or LBOs, engineered by private-equity firms over the past few years may play a role in the next round of corporate restructurings. As financially troubled companies continue to attract buyout deals that pile on debt, some are warning of a potential bust in LBOs. \u001d  \"With all the highly leveraged acquisitions that have occurred over the years, will there be a hiccup that would cause restructurings?\" asked Dominick DeChiara, a partner at Nixon Peabody LLP. \"The level of liquidity in the market keeps pushing them off.\" \u001d  According to S&P's Leveraged Commentary & Data Group, companies bought in LBO deals in the fourth quarter of 2006 had a ratio of debt to cash flow of 5.7 times on average. Some recent deals, including the $17.1 billion buyout of Harrah's Entertainment Inc. (HET), have pushed the ratio of debt to cash flow above 7 or 8. \u001d  Hedge Funds May Play Bigger Role In 2007 Bankruptcies \u001d  With more private-equity-owned companies expected to seek bankruptcy protection in coming years, restructuring professionals also warn of a potential clash with aggressive hedge-fund creditors, who have become a major presence in Chapter 11 cases over the past several years. \u001d  Bankruptcy experts are predicting hedge funds and other distressed investors will play an even larger role in 2007. Nearly half of the respondents to the TMA's annual Trend Watch poll said they believe the influence of hedge and private-equity funds in corporate restructurings will continue to grow. \u001d  Hedge funds \"provide liquidity to companies that might otherwise be candidates for failure,\" said Marcia Goldstein, who co-heads the bankruptcy practice at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Hedge funds also buy claims from traditional financial institutions and other creditors, which gives private investment firms a bigger footprint in Chapter 11 cases. \u001d  Control battles spurred by hedge funds may take a new turn as creditor-friendly changes to the Bankruptcy Code implemented in late 2005 continue to play out. \u001d  By the middle of 2007, companies that sought Chapter 11 protection after the changes took effect on Oct. 17, 2005, will begin to lose absolute control over their bankruptcy cases as they hit the law's 18-month reorganization plan filing deadline. \u001d  In 2007, the starring role of hedge funds in Chapter 11 cases will be most prominently on display in the bankruptcy of Delphi Corp. (DPHIQ), which is in the middle of a battle among major hedge funds for post-bankruptcy control of the automotive-parts supplier. \u001d  Delphi last month reached a $3.4 billion restructuring deal with a group of funds, including David Tepper's Appaloosa Management, Harbinger Capital Partners and Cerberus Capital Management, but the financing pact is being challenged by a rival $4.7 million offer from Dallas-based hedge fund Highland Capital Management. \u001d  As 2006 came to a close, hedge funds scored victories in other closely watched Chapter 11 cases. Twinkie maker Interstate Bakeries Corp. (IBCIQ) succumbed to pressure from hedge fund Brencourt Advisors LLC to replace its board of directors, while chemical company Solutia Inc. (SOLUQ) reached a reorganization deal that gives its hedge-fund dominated bondholders the right to nearly half of its equity after bankruptcy. \u001d  Hedge fund pressure could also influence the outcome of what could be one of this year's biggest turnaround stories: consolidation of the airline industry. US Airways' $8 billion-plus hostile bid for Delta Air Lines Inc. (DALRQ) kicked off the frenzy, but Northwest Airlines Corp. (NWACQ) added fuel after it hired a financial adviser to evaluate a potential merger. \u001d  Northwest's move has spurred on New York hedge fund Owl Creek Asset Management, which is seeking a shareholder panel in the carrier's Chapter 11 case, claiming the merger buzz throughout the industry indicates Northwest has equity value. \u001d  Benefits Seen Mixed In Airline Industry Mergers \u001d  Bankruptcy experts say consolidation in the industry -- which has seen Delta, Northwest, United Airlines, US Airways, Independence Air and both Hawaiian Airlines and Aloha Airlines seek Chapter 11 protection in recent years -- is inevitable. \u001d  \"Do I see more mergers taking place? Absolutely,\" said Cyrus Pardiwala, senior managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers' Corporate Advisory & Restructuring LLC. \"I think we have an overcapacity in the market. One way to deal with that is in some sort of consolidation.\" \u001d  But Stephanie Wickouski, a bankruptcy partner at Drinker Biddle and Gardner Carton, said consolidation could hurt some of the companies that supply goods and services to carriers and rely on a fragmented airline industry. \u001d  \"There are going to be fallouts in industries that were the beneficiaries of the excess capacity,\" she said. \u001d  -Marie Beaudette, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1354; marie.beaudette@dowjones.com \u001d  (Kristina Doss, Marc Hopkins, Laura McGann and Joseph Rebello contributed to this report) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 10:35 ET (15:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"59785ab87d374a7d3f1f6b93c2dfd4ae","symR":["BHI"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Baker Hughes to Present at the Goldman Sachs Global Energy Conference 2007","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T16:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BHI"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bBaker Hughes to Present at the Goldman Sachs Global Energy Conference 2007 \b \b\b \b   HOUSTON, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Baker Hughes Incorporated \b(NYSE: BHI) announced today that Matt Pye, vice president - business \bdevelopment, North America, will be a panelist at the Goldman Sachs Global \bEnergy Conference 2007 in New York, NY, on Wednesday, January 17, 2007 at \b11:00 a.m. eastern time.

(A/Negative/A-1), BellSouth Corp. (A/Negative/A-1), and the combined company's wholly owned wireless communications company, Cingular Wireless LLC (A/Negative/--), including the 'A' corporate credit ratings on the companies. At the same time, we removed all the ratings for the three companies from CreditWatch. These actions followed the Dec. 29, 2006, closing of AT&T's acquisition of BellSouth. \u001d  The outlooks are negative. On a pro forma basis, the new AT&T, including Cingular Wireless, had about $63 billion of debt reported as of Sept. 30, 2006. \u001d  Standard & Poor's had earlier indicated its intention to affirm all ratings if the acquisition was consummated under the proposed terms. \u001d  \"Although AT&T made a number of concessions to break the deadlock needed to get FCC approval, the magnitude of these concessions are not material enough to affect the ratings,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Catherine Cosentino. \u001d  Commitments by AT&T include network neutrality, technology upgrades, and jobs. Ratings reflect our view that the merged entity's wireless business is sufficiently strong to counter the somewhat higher business risk of its wireline operations. This, coupled with a modest capital structure, supports the overall 'A' corporate credit rating. \u001d  However, the negative outlook reflects ongoing concern that the local telephone business will continue to face the challenges of wireless substitution and increased competition from cable TV operators providing both cable modem and IP telephony services. \u001d  The ratings for the enlarged AT&T and its related entities reflect the company's continuing dominant position as the largest local telephone company in the U.S., with about 66 million access lines. \u001d  Complete ratings information is available to subscribers of RatingsDirect, the real-time Web-based source for Standard & Poor's credit ratings, research, and risk analysis, at www.ratingsdirect.com.

INTRINSIC \bRV met its primary endpoint, showing that dual-chamber pacing in combination \bwith Boston Scientific's AV Search Hysteresis (AVSH) programming -- a \bproprietary feature that proactively reduces right ventricular (RV) pacing \bwhen the heart's natural rhythm is present -- performs as well as single- \bchamber pacing in reducing heart failure hospitalization and all cause \bmortality (p<0.001, non inferiority). \b\b \b   \"The results of this landmark study are important because dual-chamber ICD \bprogramming can provide benefits to patients that single-chamber programming \bmay not, such as improved heart function and enhanced arrhythmia detection,\" \bsaid Brian Olshansky, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Director of Cardiac \bElectrophysiology, University of Iowa Hospitals and a lead investigator of the \btrial.  \"Prior studies have suggested that dual-chamber devices may lead to \bunnecessary RV pacing, which in some patients may pose safety concerns.  This \bstudy showed that these perceived safety concerns were not present in the \bpatient arm where dual-chamber pacing with AV Search Hysteresis was used.\" \b\b \b   INTRINSIC RV (Inhibition of Unnecessary RV Pacing with AV Search \bHysteresis in ICDs) is a multi-center, randomized, prospective, non- \binferiority trial that enrolled 1,530 patients with a current indication for \ban ICD at 108 centers in the United States, Germany, Italy and Australia.  The \bprimary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart-failure \bhospitalization.  Patients in the dual-chamber pacing with AVSH group \bexperienced 33 percent fewer deaths and heart-failure hospitalizations \bcompared to single chamber pacing (p=0.072, superiority). \b\b \b   \"INTRINSIC RV represents Boston Scientific's ongoing commitment to \bclinical science, and is part of our larger program to demonstrate the \bdistinctive value of these sophisticated, life-saving devices to patients and \bphysicians,\" said Steven Zelenkofske, D.O., F.A.C.C., Vice President, Clinical \bSciences and Chief Patient Safety Officer, Boston Scientific CRM. \b\b \b   Approximately 330,000 American adults experience sudden cardiac death \b(SCD) annually, and only 1 in 20 survives.  SCD claims more lives each year \bthan AIDS, breast cancer and lung cancer combined.  SCD occurs six to nine \btimes more often among heart-failure patients than in the general population. \bICD's have been shown to prevent SCD and this technology continues to provide \bnew opportunities for improved patient care. \b\b \b   Boston Scientific is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of \bmedical devices whose products are used in a broad range of interventional \bmedical specialties.

(\"AT&T\") and BellSouth Corporation (\"BellSouth\"), the Baa1 senior unsecured rating for Cingular Wireless LLC \"(Cingular\"), the A2 senior unsecured rating of two debt issues of Pacific Bell Telephone Co. (\"PacBell\"), one debt issue of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. (\"SW Bell\"), two debt issues of AT&T Corp. (\"Corp\"), the debt of Southern New England Telephone Co. (\"SNET\"), and upgraded the senior unsecured rating on two debt issues of New Cingular Wireless Services Inc., now assumed by AT&T, to A2 from Baa1, and withdrew the senior unsecured ratings for all other debt issues of PacBell. The outlook for the AT&T and BellSouth ratings remains stable while the outlook for the Cingular rating remains positive. \u001d  These actions reflect AT&T's acquisition of BellSouth on December 29, 2006, in which AT&T assumed the two New Cingular debt issues and unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed one BellSouth debt issue. The acquisition is subject to a number of consents by AT&T to the Federal Communications Commission which Moody's believes will not materially impact AT&T's financial performance. As well, AT&T has stated that it has no current plans to materially change the corporate structures of BellSouth and Cingular, and Moody's therefore assumes BellSouth will continue to own 40% of Cingular as well as its other existing assets. \u001d  The ratings on certain PacBell debt issues have been withdrawn pursuant to Moody's guidelines for the withdrawal of ratings, as insufficient information is available to Moody's to assess their standalone creditworthiness, and they are not unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by AT&T. Two PacBell notes (7-1/8% issue due 2026 and the 6-5/8% issue due 2034) and the SW Bell debt (7% issue due 2015) and four specific bonds of Corp are all fully guaranteed by AT&T and are therefore rated the same as the parent. SNET continues to file financials with the state regulator, thereby enabling Moody's to form a standalone credit opinion on that subsidiary in the absence of a full guarantee from AT&T. \u001d  The outlook for AT&T's rating is stable as Moody's continues to expect the company to manage its capital structure towards a debt/EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5X (after Moody's standard adjustments), and also improve related metrics, by the end of 2008. Moody's expects the company to be able to generate sufficient cash flow that would provide it the ability and the flexibility to manage to, and achieve, its target capital structure. The outlook for Cingular's rating is positive because Moody's expects the company's operating results to continue to improve over the next two years, achieving industry-average margins by 2008, although execution risk remains.

Hanford \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  EGL Inc. (EAGL) received an offer of $36 a share from Chairman and Chief Executive James R. Crane and private equity firm General Atlantic LLC on Tuesday. \u001d  The estimated $1.46 billion offer represents a 21% premium to the logistics company's closing stock price on Friday of $29.78. The stock reached a low of $28.57 on Dec. 21 and a 52-week high of $53.80 on May 8. \u001d  Crane is EGL's largest shareholder with a stake of 18%. He founded the company in 1984. \u001d  EGL, based in Houston, provides air and ocean freight forwarding, customs brokerage, local pickup and delivery service, supply chain management and other logistics services. \u001d  EGL's board has formed a special committee of independent directors to review and evaluate the proposal, but the company said in a press release that no decision has been made regarding the offer. \u001d  EGL and Crane couldn't be reached for comment. General Atlantic declined to comment. \u001d  In a letter Tuesday to EGL's board, Crane said that the transaction would be financed through equity from investment funds affiliated with General Atlantic, equity investments by Crane and others and about $1.13 billion of debt. \u001d  EGL has struggled to balance its top-line growth with its focus on profitability, Robert W. Baird analyst Jon Langenfeld said. That constant balancing act, combined with investor concern about a slowing economy, has weighed on EGL's share price, he said. \u001d  \"This has been a company that has shown it will step up and buy the stock when it's undervalued,\" Langenfeld said. \"It's been through a prolonged period of being undervalued, and management could be thinking that if investors don't give the company the credit it deserves, then they'll take it private.\" \u001d  Langenfeld has an outperform rating on the stock and a 52-week price target of $42. \u001d  The offer for EGL comes on the heels of a spate of private equity buyouts in 2006. Private equity firms will often take a public company private, only to take it public again later. \u001d  It's possible that scenario will play out for EGL if Crane's offer is accepted, but EGL could also be sold to another strategic partner by Crane, Langenfeld said. \u001d  Langenfeld doesn't own shares of EGL. Robert W. Baird expects to receive or intends to seek investment banking-related work from the company within the next three months. \u001d  -By Desiree J.

Stoll \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--Chrysler Group Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said Tuesday that a small-car joint venture between the U.S. unit of DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) and China's Chery Automobile Co. could fuel growth in the U.S. and insisted the company's efforts in China help preserve jobs outside that country. \u001d  LaSorda, whose comments were published on Chrysler's media Web site Tuesday as part of an online internal interview, said the company's deal with Chery to start building small \"B-Segment\" subcompact cars in China is necessary in order to be profitable while meeting growing global demand for small cars. \"This is important for our growth here, but not only here (in the U.S. Canada and Mexico), but the European markets and other growth areas,\" LaSorda said. \u001d  Chrysler on Friday confirmed it will form a partnership with Chery on a production joint venture that will begin producing cars for export from China as early as 2008. The decision ended months of speculation concerning Chrysler's plan for competing in the global B-segment, where it has been notably absent. \u001d  Chrysler will sell the Chery-built car in a variety of markets and it likely will be the U.S. first auto maker to attempt selling mainstream Chinese-built cars in the U.S. \u001d  \"Consumers are, quite frankly, just looking for choice, and the fact that the Chrysler Group doesn't even play in this segment, it's very important that we do,\" the executive said of Chrysler's decision to sell small Chinese cars in the U.S. He insisted the new car will help the company diversify its product portfolio, which has been criticized for being too heavily weighted toward trucks and SUVs. \u001d  LaSorda is under pressure to turn around Chrysler's ailing U.S. operations while keeping momentum growing in Europe and Asia. Ballooning inventories, high sales incentives and a consumer shift away from SUVs and pickup trucks has hindered Chrysler, just as it has hurt the company's Detroit-based competitors. Chrysler has lost market share in 2006 as leaner Asian auto makers continue to generate momentum in the U.S. \u001d  Chrysler for at least a year has been searching for a partner with which to build small cars. LaSorda said \"the major reason\" Chrysler picked a Chinese partner \"is their cost structure and their ability to engineer and design in those segments.\" \u001d  LaSorda said Chrysler already has a presence in China and the company's decision to continue its effort there is an extension of its business plan, which includes exporting parts to China from other regions in order to help build the models Chrysler produces in China. \"I tell you, there are a lot of jobs being preserved by our growth in China and our exports there,\" LaSorda said. \"And this (the Chery deal) will have no impact because we're not even involved in the B-segment today.\" \u001d  -By John D.

(DUK) is completed, Duke's top executive said Tuesday. \u001d  Spectra Energy will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday under the listing symbol SE. With the separation from Duke Energy, Anderson will leave Duke Energy to become the chairman of Spectra Energy, he told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. \u001d  The company may pursue corporate-level acquisitions or individual asset purchases in the transmission and natural gas storage businesses, Anderson said. \u001d  \"Our natural gas infrastructure is very attractive,\" he said. \"We need to optimize our large asset position to make sure that we protect it.\" \u001d  Spectra Energy plans to broaden its transmission portfolio with acquisitions in the eastern and northwestern United States, Anderson said. In the West, the company hopes to build on its recently integrated Canadian operations, which include more than 1,800 miles of natural gas pipelines. \u001d  Duke missed out on opportunities to expand its interstate pipeline system in the Rocky Mountains when the company was shoring up its balance sheet after the 2001 Enron Corp. accounting fraud scandal, Anderson said. Duke and other companies with unregulated power generation businesses struggled during that period amid turmoil in the electricity markets. \u001d  Spectra Energy will also look to bolster its gas storage portfolio with acquisitions near existing projects. The company's natural gas storage facilities include salt caverns in Virginia, Texas and Louisiana and depleted reservoirs in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Ontario. Spectra also has liquefied natural gas facilities in Ontario and Tennessee. \u001d  \"Gas storage is a highly prized service in the industry today,\" Anderson said. \"We'll be making acquisitions on an opportunistic basis if the assets fit our position.\" \b \b   Easier For Investors \b \u001d  Duke Energy announced in September that it had filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to separate its natural gas and electric businesses in an effort to create two streamlined businesses that would be more easily understood by investors. When the separation is completed, Duke shareholders will own stock in both companies. \u001d  After its separation from Duke Energy, Spectra Energy will be among the largest midstream natural gas companies in North America. The company's interstate pipeline system will deliver over 2.9 trillion cubic feet of gas to customers annually, representing more than 12% of the natural gas consumed in North America.

McGann \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  The New York Racing Association's biggest creditor, New York State, has asked a judge to dismiss the bankruptcy case of the horse-track operator, arguing that it's ineligible under the legal definition of who can file for Chapter 11 protection. \u001d  Under U.S. bankruptcy law, courts do not have jurisdiction over \"governmental units\" - a category in which the racing association, or NYRA, would fall, the state argued in papers filed Friday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. \u001d  NYRA acts as an instrument of New York State by running four public thoroughbred racing tracks and raising money for the state, according to the court filing. \u001d  \"In addition, every meaningful aspect of NYRA's existence is under the control of the state,\" lawyers for New York wrote. \"NYRA is effectively controlled by direct and indirect appointees of the state.\" \u001d  A hearing on the state's request is scheduled for Jan. 19. Objections are due by Jan. 12. \u001d  NYRA filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 2 when New York State withheld $30 million in operating funds in an attempt to block the nonprofit association from installing video-lottery machines at its tracks. The next day, the state decided to pony up $8 million to cover NYRA's costs through the end of 2006. \u001d  The machines, NYRA said, are needed to cover costs, particularly with its contract to continue running horse racing in New York up for a 20-year renewal at the end of 2007. \u001d  NYRA has been in charge of thoroughbred racing in New York since 1955. It operates the three largest thoroughbred tracks in New York, at Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga. \u001d  The association employs about 1,400 people and nearly 3,000 during the summer racing season. In addition, more than 1,000 \"backstretch workers\" - grooms, stablehands and exercise riders who are employed by trainers - live free of charge at Aqueduct, in the New York City suburb of Queens, and at the Belmont Park track on Long Island. \u001d  NYRA listed assets of $153.3 million and debts of $309.9 million in its Chapter 11 filing two months ago. \b \u001d  -Laura K.

John McCain's bid. \u001d  The document also predicts some $100 million could be spent against Giuliani to highlight political vulnerabilities like his three marriages and moderate stances on social issues including gun control and gay rights. \u001d  Giuliani is a hugely popular fundraiser for his party, due largely to his response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:08 ET (20:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"67b2314967233d5f1092d260a41a9352","symR":["00953.AE","PHG","NL0000009538"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Philips and Bioscan to market NanoSPECT and NanoSPECT/CT systems in Europe, the Middle-East, Africa, and Latin America","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T08:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["00953.AE","PHG","NL0000009538"],"IndustryCodes":["CSE","ENT","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\bANDOVER, Mass. & WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 02, 2007-- \u001d  Royal Philips Electronics (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHI) and Bioscan, Inc. announced today that they have signed an agreement giving Philips Medical Systems co-marketing and co-distribution rights for Bioscan's In-Vivo molecular imaging products, NanoSPECT and NanoSPECT/CT. The agreement covers countries in Europe, the Middle-East, Africa, Asia and Latin America. \b \u001d  NanoSPECT, Bioscan's preclinical imager uses breakthrough multiplexed multi-pinhole (MMP) SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) technology increasing the system sensitivity ten-fold and improves spatial resolution to the sub-millimeter range. NanoSPECT is capable of imaging study subjects at lower injected dose levels and images are obtained in minutes rather than hours, enabling dynamic SPECT. Using NanoSPECT, it is possible to look inside the organs of studied subjects with high-clarity functional images. \b \u001d  NanoSPECT/CT is a unique system that integrates up to four SPECT detectors equipped with powerful multi-pinhole collimators and the precision and accuracy of helical CT scanning. This combination offers image resolution at the nanoliter level as well as improved image contrast for small lesion detection, precise lesion localization, and accurate quantification. The simultaneous dual-isotope imaging capability, the relatively lower operational cost of NanoSPECT/CT compared to preclinical PET and its flexible and upgradeable platform makes it an attractive and a secure investment. \b \u001d  \"Philips is committed to offering leading-edge preclinical imaging solutions that fulfill the needs of our customers. We are looking forward to collaborating with leading institutions around the globe in preclinical and molecular imaging,\" said Jay Mazelsky, senior vice president and general manager, nuclear medicine, for Philips Medical Systems. \"Preclinical imaging is increasingly used to accelerate drug discovery and to identify and validate more specific drug targets that could be used for personalized treatment of disease. The addition of Bioscan's NanoSPECT/CT to our preclinical imaging product portfolio offers our customers immediate access to this exciting research tool and the security of knowing it is backed by Philips' industry-leading customer support.\" \b \u001d  Bioscan will continue to market and sell the NanoSPECT product line in the US and will continue to focus on the biotech and pharmaceutical market segment in Europe and other parts of the world. \b \u001d  \"We are extremely excited about the opportunity of working with Philips in co-marketing and supporting the NanoSPECT product line,\" said Ted Kleinman, Bioscan's president and chief executive officer. \"We truly believe that Philips' significant worldwide customer base, distribution network and commitment to quality products and customer support will boost the market demand for this outstanding product and will certainly benefit our customers.\" \b \b   About Royal Philips Electronics \b \u001d  Royal Philips Electronics of the Netherlands (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHI) is a global leader in healthcare, lifestyle and technology, delivering products, services and solutions through the brand promise of \"sense and simplicity\".

(LEN) Chief Executive Stuart Miller is seeing no signs that the deteriorating home-building market has bottomed, and Lennar expects to take land-related writedowns of between $400 million and $500 million in its fiscal fourth quarter to reflect the weak conditions. \u001d  \"Market conditions continued to weaken throughout the fourth quarter, and we have not yet seen tangible evidence of a market recovery,\" said Miller, in a statement. \u001d  At the same time, the company slashed its exposure to the troubled California market, where market conditions have been deteriorating at a fast clip. Lennar, along with its partner LNR Property Corp, agreed to sell a 62% stake in their LandSource joint venture, whose primary investment, Newhall Land and Farming, owns 15,000 acres of land in the Santa Clarita Valley of California. Lennar and LNR will each receive $660 million for the stake from the new partner, MW Housing. Lennar will continue to get management fees and retain a 19% stake in the partnership. \u001d  \"I think it sends a signal that they don't want to have their capital at risk in Southern California for the next few years,\" said Raymond James analyst Rick Murray. He sees the sale as a sign that the company doesn't believe that a rebound in California will happen in the near future. \u001d  Murray adds that it is a win-win situation for Lennar. \u001d  \"It looks, on the surface, to be a fantastic deal for Lennar,\" said Murray. \"The company is effectively selling a 62% interest and recovering basically all of the capital that it originally put into the deal when it acquired Newhall.\" As a result, Lennar will continue to hold a 19% interest and collect management fees on the venture \"and have no capital at risk,\" he said. Murray doesn't hold shares in Lennar, and his firm hasn't had an investment-banking relationship with the company in the past year. \u001d  Lennar, based in Miami, also offered its preliminary results for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Nov. 30. \u001d  The builder's orders fell 6% in the latest quarter, which is better than many of its rivals, who have been experiencing declines of 20% to 40%. However, the small order decline reflects aggressive price slashing and incentives, not improved demand. \u001d  Lennar has acknowledged from the start of the housing slowdown that it has resorted to price slashing and other incentives to move sales. It adopted this strategy early on based on its belief that selling homes and maintaining good liquidity was more important than keeping house prices up during the slowdown. \u001d  \"While we are hopeful that low interest rates, strong employment and a healthy economy will help stimulate a recovery in 2007, we have continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet by delivering our backlog, selling inventory aggressively and renegotiating our land positions,\" said Miller. \"We ended the 2006 fiscal year with zero outstanding on our $2.7 billion revolving credit facility and over $600 million of cash on the balance sheet.\" \u001d  The price discounting and incentives took a toll on the company's gross profit margins, which were \"materially lower\" in the quarter, he said. \u001d  Lennar expects to report earnings in the range of 70 cents to 75 cents a share.  However, the company will take a charge in the range of $400 million to $500 million, in land-related writedowns. When this is factored in, the company will post a loss of between 88 cents and $1.28 a share. Thomson First Call currently lists the company's operating earnings, before charges, of $1.07, down 70% from a year earlier. \u001d  -By Janet Morrissey, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2118 \b \u001d  Corrected Jan. 2, 2007 12:17 ET (17:17 GMT)\u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 12:03 ET (17:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6886bfde27ee9e8adb08f60ee1ce6421","symR":["ACW"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Accuride Names Keating Chmn>ACW","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACW"],"IndustryCodes":["TRQ","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"68d0b358083e7aa9bf7b482eca77942c","symR":["BUENAVC1.VL","BVN","PEP612001003"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Cerro Verde's $850 Million Sulfide Expansion Officially Commences Copper Production","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T21:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BUENAVC1.VL","BVN","PEP612001003"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LIMA, Peru, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Compania de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A.

The volume weighted average will then be calculated based on transactions done during each of these sessions. \u001d  Judge said the longer session in the afternoon is intended to generate the largest possible sample of trades on which to base the volume weighted average. \u001d  \"We think the volume weighted average will give a more representative value for the whole day, rather than a figure which represents prices at one given time\" Judge said. \u001d  The Argus move follows troubles in the market in late November when Platts was forced to suspend prompt loading dates for the fuel oil barge market following barge congestion at the Vopak terminal, Rotterdam. Platts is a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos.

The report comprehensively covers over 25 territories and 17 classes of business. \b \b   The key findings of the report are: \b \b   --  Rates for both property and casualty exposures are generally \b        flat or falling modestly. In Europe (with the exception of \b        wind exposed Northern European multi- territory covers where \b        rates are firm), Asia, Australia, Latin America and those \b        areas and classes of business of the United States not prone \b        to natural catastrophes, rates are flat or have fallen by 5% \b        to 10%. \b \b   --  The major exception to this trend is United States property \b        business, where an insurer has significant East Coast or Gulf \b        Coast wind-exposed business. This business is experiencing \b        rate increases due to five macro factors: \b \b        1. Reinsurers have sought to bring January renewals of \b           Nationwide and/or Critical Cat accounts in-line with the \b           mid-year 2006 pricing levels with cedants experiencing rate \b           increases of around 40%. \b \b        2. Reinsurance pricing is reflecting the perception of \b           increased volatility that is embedded in the latest \b           property catastrophe models. \b \b        3. Reinsurers are trying to recoup losses from the \b           catastrophes of 2005. \b \b        4. Reinsurers and their investors have a new appreciation for \b           the insured values and the resulting catastrophe exposures \b           in the Northeast of the United States - the third \"peak \b           zone\". \b \b        5. There is simply not enough retrocession capacity for \b           reinsurers to spread their catastrophe risks. Reinsurers, \b           as a consequence, require greater returns to compensate for \b           this increased retained exposure. \b \u001d  Looking forward to 2007, the atmosphere of relief is almost tangible as the market takes advantage of the current respite and works to apply the hard learned risk management lessons of the 2004 and 2005 underwriting years. Reinsurers are rebuilding both their balance sheets and their commercial confidence while in parallel insurers are creating and implementing sophisticated enterprise risk management programs. \b \u001d  Willis Group Holdings Limited is a leading global insurance broker, developing and delivering professional insurance, reinsurance, risk management, financial and human resource consulting and actuarial services to corporations, public entities and institutions around the world.

Rogers. \"Our merger with Cinergy last year gave our power business the increased scope and scale it needed to have an industry-leading position. In the United States, we are the third largest in coal generation; we're fourth in nuclear generation and second in hydroelectric capacity among investor-owned utilities.\" \b \u001d  Rogers added, \"We believe we can create greater long-term value for our shareholders as a stand-alone power company than if we had remained combined with the gas transportation, storage and processing operations. Our employee incentive target of $1.15 per share, based on ongoing diluted EPS for 2007, serves as the base for our 4 to 6 percent annual growth through the end of 2009. Also, we anticipate a target dividend payout ratio in the range of 70 to 75 percent.\" \b \b \b    Duke Energy has four business segments: \b     -- With nearly 28,000 megawatts of regulated generation capacity, \b        Franchised Electric & Gas is the largest segment and is the primary \b        source of earnings growth. It serves 3.9 million electric customers in \b        North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana - a 47,000 \b        square-mile service territory. It also serves 500,000 retail gas \b        customers in Ohio and Kentucky. \b \b     -- The Commercial Power segment has approximately 8,700 megawatts of \b        unregulated generation, primarily in the Midwest. Substantially all of \b        the results for this segment are driven by sales to retail customers \b        in Ohio. \b \b     -- Duke Energy International has approximately 4,200 megawatts of \b        generation, primarily in Latin America. About 75 percent of this \b        capacity is hydroelectric, and approximately 80 percent is under \b        contract. \b \b     -- Crescent Resources is a 50-50 joint venture with Morgan Stanley Real \b        Estate Fund.

In addition to Rogers, the directors are: William (Bill) Barnet III, G. Alex Bernhardt Sr., Michael G. Browning, Phillip R. Cox, Ann M. Gray, James H. Hance Jr., James T. Rhodes, Mary L.

The EPS measure used for employee incentive bonuses is based on ongoing diluted EPS. Ongoing diluted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure as it represents diluted EPS from continuing operations adjusted for the per-share impact of special items. Special items represent certain charges and credits which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for ongoing diluted EPS is reported diluted EPS from continuing operations, which includes the impact of special items. Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-GAAP financial measure, information to reconcile it to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to forecast all special items for future periods. \b \u001d  This document references Duke Energy's anticipated annual growth in ongoing earnings of 4 to 6 percent through 2009. Ongoing earnings is a non- GAAP financial measure as it represents income from continuing operations adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items represent certain charges and credits which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for ongoing earnings is reported earnings from continuing operations, which includes the impact of special items. Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-GAAP financial measure, information to reconcile it to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to forecast all special items for future periods. \b \u001d  This document references the anticipated combined contribution to total ongoing segment EBIT for 2007 from the Franchised Electric and Gas and Commercial Power segments. Ongoing segment EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure, as it reflects segment EBIT adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items represent certain charges and credits which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for forecasted ongoing segment EBIT is reported segment EBIT, which is from continuing operations and includes the impact of special items. Due to the forward-looking nature of this non-GAAP financial measure for future periods, information to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is not available at this time, as management is unable to forecast any special items for any future periods. \b \b    Forward-looking statements \b \u001d  This release includes statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. Such statements are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

This sale, expected to close in the first quarter of 2007, was contemplated in Tripos' recently announced agreement to sell its Discovery Informatics business to San Francisco-based Vector Capital. \b \u001d  The Discovery Informatics and Discovery Research businesses will operate, following their respective sales, as independent, private companies committed to providing superior services to their current and prospective customers. \b \u001d  Provid Pharmaceuticals is a drug discovery service company engaged in the design, identification and optimization of novel lead compounds for pharmaceutical development. The company provides expert medicinal chemistry research services to the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. \b \u001d  \"Tripos' board and management are pleased to announce the proposed sale of our Discovery Research division to an organization that shares a commitment to high quality, innovation and customer priorities. Provid is committed to the customer relationships that we have established and to the combination of design and chemistry that has enabled Tripos Discovery Research to build its business over the past nine years,\" said Dr. John P. McAlister, president and chief executive officer of Tripos. \"The business will remain in Bude, England, and the new owners will retain the current management and staff of Tripos Discovery Research.\" \b \u001d  \"With the agreement on this transaction, Tripos has now made provision for the sale of each of its principal business units to other strategic owners with resources committed to continuing and enhancing those businesses as private companies to maximize their potential for future success. Furthermore, we are providing our stockholders with a proposal that our board believes provides them with a greater certainty of value than the continued uncertainty of operating Tripos in its current form.\" \b \b   The Stock Sale \b \u001d  Tripos will sell the stock of its discovery research subsidiary for approximately $2.0 million, subject to adjustment based on net working capital, capital leasing debt, and property, plant and equipment formulas at closing. Tripos' board of directors has approved the transaction. This transaction is subject to numerous customary terms and conditions, including Provid's ability to obtain acquisition financing, receipt of certain customer consents, resolution of repayment obligations under certain British government economic development grants, and limited post-closing indemnification. Tripos will apply the proceeds of this sale to retire corporate-level obligations related to this business. \b \u001d  Tripos plans to file a proxy statement with the SEC containing more detailed information about the proposed asset sale to Vector, including additional information about estimated proceeds to stockholders. Following SEC review of the proxy statement, Tripos will schedule a special meeting of stockholders and distribute the proxy statement. It is currently anticipated that the special meeting will be held early in 2007. \b \b   General \b \u001d  This press release contains forward-looking statements concerning, among other things, Tripos' future prospects, including: (1) Tripos' ability to consummate the sale of its Discovery Informatics business to Vector; (2) Tripos' ability to consummate the sale of its Discovery Research business to Provid; (3) Tripos' ability to sell certain other assets, including its corporate headquarters building; (4) Tripos' ability to satisfy its creditors out of the proceeds of the foregoing transactions and other available resources; (5) Tripos' ability to offset corporate tax liabilities on the sale of assets through the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards; (6) Tripos' ability to distribute any remaining cash to its stockholders; (7) Tripos' ability to access the capital necessary to fund its business, including the availability of capital to replace its existing bank facility upon maturity and the potential need to issue common stock or warrants that could be dilutive to current stockholders; (8) Tripos' ability to assess, pursue and effect strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value; (9) Tripos' ability to obtain an extension of its bank line of credit if the Vector and Provid transactions do not close before March 1, 2007; or (10) in the event that Tripos is unable to effect strategic transactions, additional steps that might need to be taken.

And he's known to buy at prices that don't entice value investors. \u001d  \"They're almost all caught in the middle,\" Heppelmann says of his picks. That's especially true in technology stocks, where he's found favorites in recent years. \u001d  Yet the Liberty Ridge Capital Inc. manager's performance is the envy of many. The Old Mutual Focused Fund, with a 2006 gain of 22.9%, was ranked in the top 1% of large-cap blend funds for the period, according to research firm Morningstar Inc. That was 7.1 percentage points better than the Standard & Poor's 500 index and 8.8 points better than Morningstar's large-blend category index. The fund has annualized returns of 12.6% over three years, which is 2.2 points better than the S&P 500 and 1.65 points better than its category index, according to Morningstar. \u001d  Heppelmann runs a tight portfolio of stocks in just 27 companies. His picks are characterized by entrenched positions in \"oligopoly\" industries, where a few companies dominate the market. He also looks for steady financial profiles featuring strong cash flow, above-average long-term revenue and earnings growth, and stock prices that he believes are not just likely to go up but unlikely to fall. The commitment to quality and mindfulness of downside, he says, reduces the volatility risk inherent in a portfolio that is heavily weighted in a small number of stocks. \u001d  \"The way I think of risk is permanent loss of capital, not daily or weekly volatility,\" Heppelmann says. \"I think my risk is somewhat mitigated by having such quality companies,\" while his returns are maximized by investing in only his best ideas. \u001d  Of course, the contrarian bent and trim holdings list can still cause trouble. In 2005, the fund returned just 1.9%, well below its benchmarks, largely due to Heppelmann's heavy bet on out-of-favor Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which ended the year down slightly. But he didn't give up in 2006, weighting Microsoft at 15% of the fund's net assets even as the stock bottomed this summer. \u001d  \"The risk-reward ratio was absolutely absurd,\" Heppelmann says in explaining his massive wager. Microsoft's stock was \"severely mispriced\" considering its market dominance and an outlook that featured several key product releases and double-digit revenue growth for the next five years. \"The valuation didn't make sense to me at all. Even here it doesn't.\" \u001d  In 2006, the bet paid off as Microsoft was up about 14% for the year. And though Heppelmann has let go of some of his stock, as he tends to do when his picks rise, it was still the fund's top holding at 11.1% of net assets as of Sept. 30. \u001d  General Electric Co. (GE), the fund's second-largest holding at 8.15% of net assets, has also been caught in the \"no man's land\" between growth and value investors. But Heppelmann thinks both camps are warming to the stock at the same time. \u001d  GE's growth profile is starting to look better, as its exposure to international markets provides hope for investors who see a slowing in U.S. economic growth. Meanwhile, GE's dividends and share buybacks will lead value investors to take notice, he says. The stock has been rising since summer and was up about 6% for the year. \u001d  A more recent Heppelmann bet - and one that's paid off more quickly - is Dell Inc. (DELL), which he bought when sentiment bottomed after news in August that batteries were causing its laptops to catch fire. \u001d  Long an admirer of Dell, Heppelmann had always taken a pass on the stock because of its high price, which he felt carried too much downside risk. But this summer, \"it was priced like a company that couldn't be saved,\" he says. \"You listen to the press, and it sounds like Dell is an also-ran in the computer business,\" even though it continued to enjoy strong market share and be a \"cash-flow machine.\" \u001d  Dell's stock has since rebounded, trading at about $25, up 32% from its July 21 low of $18.95. \u001d  An older favorite of Heppelmann's, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA, CMCSK), has paid off handsomely this year with a 63% gain to about $42. While he reduced the size of his stake as Comcast and other cable stocks rallied, the manager is still a big fan. \u001d  \"It's everything I look for,\" he says. \u001d  Comcast is dominant as the country's largest cable provider. Its financial visibility is strong, thanks to customers unlikely to go elsewhere. The company, and the cable industry in general, has successfully wooed consumers with its triple-play bundle of television, Internet and phone service. And consumers are increasingly held captive to digital cable by a budding love for flat-screen high-definition TVs. \u001d  Meanwhile, telecom companies, whose plans for fiber-optic lines into the home struck fear in the hearts of many, have proven to be paper tigers, he argues. \u001d  \"I've always liked cable because they own you,\" he says. \"A lot of this 60% move is just correcting an abnormality that I think was created by a lot of (bad) press.\" \u001d  (Riva Richmond covers Internet companies and computer-security software makers for Dow Jones Newswires.) \u001d  -By Riva Richmond, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5670; riva.richmond@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6eae03deabb220d6f2661a425365f5e0","symR":["AL","AL.T","CA0137161059"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Alcan 'Disappointed' With B.C.

(2412.TW) said Tuesday two repair ships will soon start fixing undersea cables damaged last week by an earthquake off the island's coast that resulted in a major disruption to telephone and Internet links across Asia. \u001d  The two ships will take two to three weeks to complete their task, said Wu Chih-ming, a senior official at Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan's largest telecommunications company. \u001d  \"The ships are expected to arrive in Taiwan today and tomorrow and will work at sea over the next two weeks,\" Wu said Tuesday. Two more ships will join later, he said, without elaborating. \u001d  Wu said one of the ships is Japanese registered and sailed to Taiwan from Japan. The other, British registered, sailed to Taiwan from the Philippines, he said. Both are specially equipped to repair undersea cables and had to complete other repair work before setting out for Taiwan. \u001d  The Dec. 26 quake - measured at magnitude 6.7 by Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau and 7.1 by the U.S. Geological Survey - snapped undersea cables off Taiwan, cutting telecommunications across the region and leaving companies scrambling to reroute traffic through satellites and cables that were not damaged. \u001d  Services were gradually restored in the days following the quake, but have not fully recovered. \u001d  In Hong Kong, Internet connection on the first working day of the year was about 70% to 80% back to normal Tuesday, an official said. \u001d  \"There was no major congestion this morning. The situation is better than we thought,\" said Ha Yung-kuen of the Telecommunications Authority. \u001d  Residential Internet users will still experience some delays because service providers will give business users priority, he added. Internet connection in Hong Kong should be fully restored by mid-January, when repair works for the first of six damaged undersea cables serving the territory is expected to be complete. \u001d  By the end of January or early February, all major cables serving Hong Kong and other countries in the region should be fully repaired, said another official, Chan Tze-yee. \u001d  Asian data transmission lines, made of clusters of glass fibers wrapped in protective material, carry Internet data and voice calls as pulses of light. \u001d  Chunghwa Telecom estimates the repairs will cost about NT$50 million (US$1.5 million). \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 03:01 ET (08:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"70e38c275cc8fa28f4c2d31a2e0956d6","symR":["TOASO.IS","TRATOASO91H3"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"HSBC Downgrades Tofas To Neutral From Overweight","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T06:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TOASO.IS","TRATOASO91H3"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 01:38 ET (06:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"70f426bdd2f2205603bce06196456f07","symR":["1020848.FR","12052.FR","ART.YY","SZE","FR0000120529","FR0010208488"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"AMF:Still Studying Artemis Release On Possible Suez Bid","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T13:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1020848.FR","12052.FR","ART.YY","SZE","FR0000120529","FR0010208488"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","GAS","MUT","XB20","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 08:24 ET (13:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"711becc6cd8d40f7e75d4203c5b3623d","symR":["UNCA"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Growth Fuels Expansion of Unica Team in Europe","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T14:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UNCA"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b     Former Omniture Director Joins Unica to Drive Web Analytics; \u001d   Sales Leader from Cognos and Business Objects to Lead Sales in \u001d                               France \bWALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 02, 2007-- \u001d  Unica(R) Corporation (Nasdaq: UNCA), a global provider of Enterprise Marketing Management (EMM) solutions, today announced the appointment of two new executives to drive sales growth in Europe.

(NASDAQ: CRAY) today announced that General Atomics researchers using a Cray X1E(TM) supercomputer have made a significant breakthrough in their ability to predict what happens inside an experimental fusion reactor, a milestone on the way to developing a stable and efficient new power source. Fusion is the nuclear reaction that fuels stars like the sun and has the potential to produce clean, almost limitless power here on Earth. \b \u001d  The General Atomics scientists are employing a computer code they wrote called GYRO, scaled to the massive compute capabilities of a Cray X1E system located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), to simulate the complex behavior of the super-heated gaseous fuel called plasma as it roils within a reactor. Working under a grant of computer time from the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program, the researchers have for the first time been able to simulate both electron and ion plasma turbulence, a crucial step for eventually designing and building a full-scale, energy-producing fusion reactor. \b \u001d  \"Approximation is the name of the game in physics,\" said Jeff Candy, principal scientist in the Energy Group at General Atomics. \"GYRO performs a faithful gyrokinetic approximation of the fundamental physics that occurs when the nuclei of deuterium and tritium atoms fuse within a reactor's magnetic containment field. Normally researchers do smaller electron-scale simulations of the plasma. But the Cray X1E supercomputer at ORNL has allowed us to combine electron-scale and ion-scale simulations to produce a much closer approximation of turbulence fluxes for various temperatures and densities. Modeling these instabilities on the actual reactor would be very time-consuming and expensive.\" \b \u001d  \"ORNL is the nation's largest computing resource for big, open science,\" said Doug Kothe, director of science for ORNL's National Center for Computational Sciences. \"As part of DOE's recently expanded INCITE program, time on our Cray X1E 'Phoenix' and Cray XT3 'Jaguar' supercomputers is being allotted to scientists from General Atomics and other organizations doing challenging, high-impact research that requires leadership-class computing resources. Breakthrough science becomes possible because of the systems expertise provided by the collaboration between Cray and ORNL staff and researchers.\" \b \u001d  The National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory is funded by the Department of Energy's Office of Science. The center was designated in 2004 by the Secretary of Energy as the Leadership Computing Facility for the nation. \b \b    Complex Calculations \b \u001d  A fusion reactor spins plasma at a high rate of speed, building up pressureand immense heat that can reach 200 million degrees Fahrenheit. Gyrokineticphysics is employed to study how these conditions cause instabilities that make the plasma slow down and cool. The equations involved in gyrokinetic calculations such as those performed by the General Atomics GYRO code were originally developed by researchers over 25 years ago. However, it has onlybeen in the last few years that computers have become powerful enough to produce useful gyrokinetic simulations for fusion research. \b \u001d  To completely model the plasma in one of the donut-shaped reactors known astokamaks where fusion research is conducted, the GYRO simulations will needto be included in still more complex models that take into account the engineering aspects of the reactors. General Atomics is also conducting fundamental research on the alpha particles produced by reactors that tend to slow down the plasma reaction. The ultimate goal is to design a much larger reactor that can confine the plasma in near-perfect thermal equilibrium and sustain the intense heat required for commercial power generation. \b \u001d  \"Gryokinetic simulations place a tremendous amount of stress on a supercomputer's architecture,\" said Cray Chief Technology Officer Steve Scott. \"The Cray X1E system at ORNL is built with powerful vector processors sharing a common global memory and fed by massive memory and interconnect bandwidth. We are delighted that the General Atomics team and other INCITE participants have been able to take advantage of this advanced architecture to do the sort of large-scale, computationally demanding scientific work that was not previously possible.\" \b \b    About General Atomics \b \u001d  Headquartered in San Diego, California, General Atomics was conceived in 1955 for the purpose of harnessing the power of nuclear technologies for the benefit of mankind. General Atomics' basic research into fission and fusion has matured into competence in many technologies, making the company and its affiliates one of the world's leading resources for high-technology systems development ranging from the nuclear fuel cycle to remotely operated surveillance aircraft, airborne sensors, and advanced electric, electronic, wireless and laser technologies.

The shareholders pushing this effort worry consultants may be reluctant to provide objective advice on executive pay if they rely on management's approval to win other business at a company. \u001d  \"We are convinced it is in the best interest of shareholders and corporations for compensation consultants to provide independent, unbiased advice regarding executive compensation,\" said Connecticut state treasurer Denise L. Nappier, who heads the state's $23 billion retirement fund. \"The responses confirm that a solid number of leading companies agree,\" she said in a press release issued Tuesday. \u001d  Most respondents, including ConocoPhillips (COP) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), revealed the name of their compensation consultants and disclosed any outside business relationships they may have with them. For example, ConocoPhillips said its board uses Towers Perrin, and that the board's compensation committee has twice approved, since September 2005, Towers Perrin performing other work for the company. \u001d  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and General Electric Co. (GE) made public the contents of their letters late last week, and said they will disclose this information to investors in their proxy statements this year. \u001d  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), Home Depot Inc. (HD) and Procter & Gamble Co. (GE) said they generally prohibit their executives from hiring the same consultants that advise their boards on how to pay top officers. The state of Connecticut called these and seven other policies \"best practices.\" \u001d  A Dec. 1 letter from Proctor & Gamble, for example, says its compensation consultant \"will do no work for management and will have no other connection to the company.\" \u001d  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) said it \"does not believe such a policy would necessarily serve the best interests\" of the compensation committee, which evaluates such concerns on a \"case by case basis.\" \u001d  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) said it tries to keep ties to a minimum, but \"given the size, complexity and global scope\" of the company, it cannot guarantee \"absolutely no unrelated work for Dow someplace in the world.\" \u001d  A few respondents, including Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS), said they are considering the request. \u001d  Morgan Stanley's compensation committee \"plans to discuss the questions raised\" by the letter at its next scheduled meeting, said a Nov. 16 letter by the money manager. \u001d  Companies that have yet to respond to the letter are Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK), Citigroup Inc. (C), J.P.Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) and Verizon Communications (VZ). \u001d  Companies with policies that fall short of shareholders' expectations could be targeted with proposals asking that investors be given the chance to vote on the matter, Connecticut state's press release said. \u001d  Nappier's office has been leading the effort, which started with a letter to the 25 largest Standard & Poor's 500 companies in October, asking them to come clean about any relationships they may have with their compensation consultants and urging them to adopt policies that would eliminate any ties. The letter was signed by 13 institutional investors representing $850 billion in assets, including London money manager F&C Asset Management (FCAM.LN) and the AFL-CIO union. \u001d  By Kaja Whitehouse, Dow Jones Newswire; 201-938-2243; kaja.whitehouse@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:20 ET (21:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"71f31f0ebe5e65dbb557800b50df17fa","symR":["PSD.AU","PSDV","AU000000PSD7"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": pSivida Released from Loan Covenant","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T14:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PSD.AU","PSDV","AU000000PSD7"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\b   pSivida's lender agrees to release the Company from loan covenant   necessary to complete specified financing transactions with Nordic \u001d               Biotech Advisors and gives other relief \bBOSTON & PERTH, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 02, 2007-- \u001d  Global bio-nanotech company pSivida Limited (NASDAQ:PSDV)(ASX:PSD)(Xetra:PSI) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with its principal institutional lender whereby the lender has agreed to a general forbearance with respect to any defaults through to and including the earlier of the closing of the Nordic Biotech Advisors (Nordic) transaction or March 31, 2007, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions: \b \b   --  The lender has agreed to allow the Company to transfer or \b        grant security interests in the Company's Medidur(TM) and \b        Mifepristone assets which would be necessary to complete \b        specified financing transactions with Nordic; \b \b   --  The lender agreed to forego the interest payment due on \b        January 2, 2007 in favor of adding approximately US$309k \b        (AU$391k) to the principal amount of the loan (representing \b        the value of the American Depository Receipts (ADSs) with \b        which the Company would have issued to satisfy the payment had \b        it met certain conditions allowing it to pay with ADSs); \b \b   --  The lender agreed to defer the Company's scheduled payment of \b        US$800k (AU$1m) for prior registration delay penalties until \b        the earlier of the closing of the Nordic transaction or March \b        31, 2007; \b \b   --  The lender agreed to forgive US$770k (AU$973k) of additional \b        registration delay penalties accruing through the earlier of \b        the closing of the Nordic transaction or March 31, 2007; \b \b   --  The lender agreed to amend the Company's loan covenants to \b        release it from the obligation to satisfy a minimum cash \b        balance test of 30% of the outstanding principal until March \b        31, 2007; and \b \b   --  The lender agreed that the Company would have until ten days \b        after the earlier of the closing of the Nordic transaction or \b        March 31, 2007 to file a registration statement with respect \b        to securities issuable on exercise of the lender's warrants. \b \u001d  In return for the foregoing, the Company has issued to the lender warrants to purchase 1.5 million ADSs over 5 years with an exercise price of US$2.00 per ADS and has agreed, upon receipt of required approvals, including shareholder approval, and satisfaction of other standard conditions, to issue additional warrants to purchase 4.0 million ADSs over 5 years with an exercise of US$2.00, subject to adjustment based on the final terms of the Company's transaction with Nordic. \b \u001d  The Company expects to close definitive documents with Nordic Biotech Advisors for a US$4.0m (AU$5.1m) corporate investment in the Company and a US$22.0m (AU$27.8m) investment over time in a 'Special Purpose Vehicle' that is expected to fully fund the Company's portion of costs to develop Medidur(TM) for the treatment of the chronic eye disease diabetic macular edema. \b \u001d  THIS RELEASE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER TO SELL OR A SOLICITATION TO BUY ANY SECURITIES. \b \b   NOTES TO EDITORS: \b \u001d  pSivida is a global bio-nanotech company committed to the biomedical sector and the development of drug delivery products.

Analysts expect sales to exceed 70 million units this year. The product presents the dream combination of high volumes and profit margins with a still-high price tag: an average 26-inch model costs about $750 in the U.S., three times the price of a tube set of the same size. \u001d  But the popularity has triggered a price war as manufacturers and retailers scramble for market share. Prices of flat-panel TV sets fell almost 40% in 2006, far more than manufacturers expected. Electronics makers now face a tricky task balancing investment costs, production increases and cost reductions to sustain revenue and profit growth. \u001d  Over the past 18 months, manufacturers have been scrambling to meet demand by building more assembly plants or changing production lines in old ones. Flat-panel models became the majority of sets sold in the U.S., the world's largest TV-set market, during the third quarter of 2006. Europe reached that milestone in the second quarter and Japan in mid-2005. \u001d  Flat-panel sets have also become the dominant force shaping the fortunes of the world's top electronics makers. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Samsung Electronics Co. and Sharp Corp., which pushed early and hard into flat-panel sets, have seen sales and profits rise. Those that didn't -- such as Sanyo Electric Co. and TCL Corp. -- have ceded market share and profitability. Sony Corp.'s earnings recovered over the past year or so after it revamped its TV business around flat-panel models. \u001d  Samsung now leads the world in own-brand TV-set production, with its volume jumping 33% to 20 million units in 2006. It likely displaced Sony as the world leader in revenue from TV sets last year, though final figures won't be available for several weeks. Samsung expects revenue from TV sets in 2006 to be around $11 billion, up from $6.5 billion a year earlier. \u001d  \"In some quarters in the past, we were No. 1 in production volumes, but we couldn't claim ourselves as the real No. 1 because we didn't lead in revenue,\" said Choi Gee Sung, president of Samsung's consumer-electronics division. \"Now, we think we can claim that.\" \u001d  There already are signs that manufacturers are seeking to prevent the product from undergoing the rapid commoditization that affected DVD players and other gadgets. One is the end last year of pell-mell factory construction for flat-panel TV components -- which turned several sleepy cities in Japan, Korea and Taiwan into boomtowns. Only two leading-edge factories are under construction for liquid-crystal-display panels, for instance, down from 12 in 2004. \u001d  The scaling back in production-line building comes as myriad forces pare prices of flat-panel TV sets. \u001d  One factor is the constant decline in component prices. Another is the fight between backers of the two types of flat-panel technology: plasma, with pictures that look better in dark rooms but which is inefficient to produce in small sizes and thus accounts for only 15% of the market, and LCDs, which look better in bright rooms but are more expensive per screen inch to build than plasma. Both types of technology can be used to make TV screens in the 40-inch to 46-inch range, leading to greater price competition for a size that is expected to become a standard in affluent markets over the next few years. \u001d  In addition, U.S. electronics retailers -- whose margins of 30% to 40% represent the biggest element of the final price -- are now using flat-panel TV sets for their own strategic discounting. The leader in revenue, Best Buy Co., offered a Panasonic 42-inch plasma HDTV at $999 for one day during the holiday sales season. The set is regularly priced around $1,500, still well below the $4,000 it cost two years ago. \u001d  In the coming year, more price barriers are likely to be cracked -- such as 27-inch models falling below $500 and some 42-inch models dropping below $1,000. A 42-inch LCD TV will carry an average selling price of $1,283 in the fourth quarter of 2007, down 37% from $2,036 in the fourth quarter of 2006, according to a forecast by iSuppli, a market research firm in El Segundo, California. \u001d  In smaller screen sizes, prices of flat-panel sets are already only about twice the level of tube TVs. A 20-inch LCD set now sells for less than $400 in most of the world. LCD-set prices will fall at an average annual rate of 13% from 2007 to 2010, according to an iSuppli forecast. \u001d  Within a few years, says Lee Hee Gook, president and chief technology officer of LG Electronics Co., flat-panel sets could reach commodity status, where they sell for about the same as tube TVs. \"How can we do that and make profit?\" he asks. \"That will be tough.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"73e26d467455635c1dcde8df52ce4894","symR":["ORA"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Ormat Technologies Gets Order From Ngawha Generation>ORA","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T13:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ORA"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 08:34 ET (13:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"73f73d3bfeb724ae9375a7bba6b95bb4","symR":["DUK","US2643991068"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CORRECT:Spectra Eyes Post-IPO Acquisitions, CEO Fowler Says","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T19:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DUK","US2643991068"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","MUT","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  Spectra Energy Corp. aims to expand its natural gas transmission and storage businesses through acquisitions after its spinoff from Duke Energy Corp.

The outlook is stable. \u001d  Pro forma for $1 billion of new debt sold in the fourth quarter--partly to refinance $515 million of debt coming due in the next six months, some of which was repaid in December--Goodyear has total debt (including the present value of operating leases and underfunded employee benefit liabilities) of about $12 billion. \u001d  The new contract should enable Goodyear to achieve substantial cost savings over the three-year contract term. The company estimates that compared with 2006 prestrike levels, savings are expected to total $70 million in 2007, $240 million in 2008, and $300 million in 2009. These savings are comprised of capacity-related savings, reduced legacy costs, and savings from increased productivity. \u001d  Significant terms of the new three-year contract include: \u001d  -- The elimination (subject to court and regulatory approval) of Goodyear's responsibility for all current and future retiree health care liabilities for the company's USW workforce in return for the creation of a VEBA trust with $1 billion in initial funding, a portion of which could be funded with Goodyear's common equity. Resulting OPEB expense savings are estimated at $110 million and cash savings at $145 million annually compared with 2006. Goodyear's total unfunded OPEB liability was $2.6 billion at the end of 2005, of which about half was the USW OPEB liability. \u001d  -- The closure of the Tyler, Texas-based plant after the end of 2007. This closure will eliminate 9 million units of higher-cost capacity and save an estimated $50 million annually. \u001d  -- Lower-cost wages and benefits for new hires during the first three years of employment.

(NYSE:PRU) introduced today a new term life insurance policy that includes a money back guarantee. PruLife Return of Premium (ROP) Term, issued by Pruco Life Insurance Company (Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey in NY and NJ) in 29 states**, offers consumers the powerful combination of valuable death benefit protection and the guaranteed return of all premiums paid if the insured lives past the end of the level premium paying period selected (15, 20 or 30 years). \b \u001d  \"People seeking life insurance are often conflicted between the affordability of term coverage and the desire for the cash value permanent policies can offer,\" said Jim Avery, president of Prudential's Individual Life Insurance business. \"The advantage of this new product is that it provides both a death benefit that's payable while the coverage is inforce and a \"living benefit\" in the form of a full premium refund if the insured outlives the protection period.\" \b \u001d  Unlike traditional term insurance policies, ROP term builds cash value. The cash value is guaranteed to grow and become equal to the premiums paid by the end of the initial level premium paying period (15, 20 or 30 years). *Returned premiums do not include premiums paid by the optional disability waiver of premium rider, or any amount of outstanding loans with interest. Policies lapsed or cancelled before the end of the initial level premium paying period will result in only a partial return of premium or no refund at all. \b \u001d  PruLife Return of Premium Term (contract number PLTIR 2006) can be converted, during the policies conversion period, to a permanent Prudential or Pruco Life individual life insurance policy offered under the contract, should the individual want a life insurance policy that continues to build cash value beyond the period selected. If the individual wishes to retain the policy after the end of the level premium paying period, premiums are generally payable to age 95 and increase every year. \b \u001d  Prudential Financial companies, with approximately $586 billion in total assets under management as of September 30, 2006, serve individual and institutional customers worldwide and include The Prudential Insurance Company of America, one of the largest life insurance companies in the United States. These companies offer a variety of products and services, including life insurance, mutual funds, annuities, pension and retirement-related services and administration, asset management, banking and trust services, real estate brokerage franchises, relocation services and, through a joint venture, retail securities brokerage services.

Despite a slowdown in the number of VC-backed merger and acquisition deals, their total value remained on par with last year, thanks in large part to Google Inc.'s (GOOG) acquisition of YouTube Inc. \u001d  There were 56 completed IPOs of VC-backed companies in 2006, which raised a total of $3.7 billion, according to data released by VentureOne, a research unit of Dow Jones & Co. (DJ), the publisher of this newswire. That far outstrips 2005's total of 42 IPOs and $2.3 billion raised, though it falls short of the 67 IPOs and $5 billion raised in 2004. \u001d  In the fourth quarter, 18 venture-backed companies completed IPOs during the fourth quarter of 2006, a healthy jump from the 12 IPOs during the year-earlier period and the highest total since the fourth quarter of 2004, according to VentureOne. In the latest quarter, these companies raised $1.2 billion in the offerings, up from $697 million in the year-ago quarter. \u001d  (This story also appeared in VentureWire, a newsletter published by Dow Jones covering venture capital and start-up companies.) \u001d  The IPO pipeline also saw a boost at the tail end of 2006. Clearwire Corp., BigBand Networks Inc., Orexigen Therapeutics Inc., Glu Mobile Inc. and Aruba Networks Inc. all registered for IPOs between Dec. 15 and Dec. 26. \u001d  Information technology companies saw the greatest gain in terms of the number of IPOs during 2006, with 20 - the highest IT company IPO total since 2000 and nearly twice the 11 completed in 2005. Notable IT company IPOs during 2006 included data storage company Isilon Systems Inc.'s (ISLN) December offering, and health-care Web site eHealth Inc.'s (EHTH) October offering. \u001d  There were 28 completed health-care company IPOs in 2006, up slightly from last year's total of 21 but down from 39 in 2004. Health-care company IPOs during 2006 included obesity treatment company Orexigen's and biopharmaceutical company Affymax Inc.'s (AFFY) offerings in December. \u001d  While IPO activity was respectable in 2006, venture-backed M&A deal activity lagged. That, however, was offset by a surging individual M&A deal size - notably the $1.65 billion acquisition of YouTube by Google in October - keeping dollar volume relatively even. \u001d  The past year as a whole saw 404 venture-backed M&A deals compared with 407 in 2005, the lowest yearly total since 2003. The fourth quarter of 2006 saw the sharpest decline, with 75 M&A deals - the fewest in any quarter since the first quarter of 1999, when there were 53, according to VentureOne. \u001d  But those 75 M&A deals in the fourth quarter were worth some $7.3 billion, outpacing the $5.5 billion value of the 102 deals done in the fourth quarter of 2005. A large portion of the fourth quarter 2006 total, of course, was thanks solely to YouTube. \u001d  Followed by YouTube, the next-largest acquisitions of VC-backed companies during the fourth quarter were the $580 million sale of communications provider Xspedius Communications LLC to Time Warner Telecom Inc. (TWTC), and the $417 million sale of mobile messaging company Mobile 365 Inc. to Sybase Inc. (SY). \u001d  By market sector, there were 273 M&A deals in IT markets in 2006, and 74 in health care - a proportion roughly equivalent with past years. \u001d  By John Letzing, Dow Jones Newsletters/VentureWire; 415-439-6678; john.letzing@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:37 ET (20:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"781b4062f549b1c91b7f165b34cad55f","symR":["AFR"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"American Financial Realty Trust Completes Sale Of State Street Fincl Center For $889 M>AFR","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AFR"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"78268c00bee2e130b054d83ce4a2542e","symR":["5213.TO","8604.TO","CAY.XX","NMR","JP3593400009","JP3762600009"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Buyout Funds Set Aside Y4T To Invest In Japan Cos -Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T17:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5213.TO","8604.TO","CAY.XX","NMR","JP3593400009","JP3762600009"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","SCR","SEM","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA","XSTF"],"Story":"\u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Corporate buyout funds and others are earmarking nearly Y4.07 trillion in capital this year for investment in Japanese firms, up 240% from two years earlier, according to a survey by The Nikkei, the newspaper reported in its Wednesday morning edition. \u001d  Anticipating a further round of industrial reorganizations here, a number of large European and U.S. funds have also made their way to Japan's shores. A surplus of capital among both domestic and overseas investment funds is also spurring a steady inflow of funds into companies. \u001d  To finance a buyout, acquisition funds usually collect money from investors and borrow about three to five times that amount from financial institutions. Consequently, investment funds could spend more than Y20 trillion. \u001d  This means that investment funds potentially have more buying purchasing power than Japanese companies themselves, which spent about Y15 trillion in 2006 on corporate mergers and acquisitions. \u001d  Each investment fund plans to spend an average of Y94.8 billion or so, the survey found. Overseas investment funds are expected to spend an average of Y240 billion apiece on buyout deals. \u001d  The Japanese market is one of the most attractive in the world as an investment destination, says Michael Smith, chairman of the U.K.-based investment fund CVC Capital Partners Ltd., which invested in Skylark Co.'s management buyout (MBO) last year. \u001d  CVC Capital is believed to be setting aside up to Y500 billion for Japan. \u001d  Although the overseas funds accounted for less than 30% of the funds in the survey, they have about Y2.26 trillion, or about 60% of the total amount earmarked by survey respondents, set aside for investment in Japan. \u001d  Meanwhile, 90% said they are not planning hostile takeover attempts. Of the foreign funds responding to the survey, all said they are not eyeing such plans.

According to Lima, the bank's credit portfolio had reached an estimated BRL128.5 billion by Nov. 30. \u001d  \"We want to increase our presence when it comes to consumer credit linked directly to payroll deductions,\" said Lima. He added, \"The bank could do this through partnerships or even the purchase of some specific portfolios.\" \u001d  However, Lima noted that the increase in Banco do Brasil's credit portfolio in 2006 came with some problematic side-effects. The bank posted third-quarter provisions against bad loans of BRL1.63 billion, up 40% from BRL1.17 billion a year previously. \u001d  As with other Brazilian banks, concern about arrears in consumer loans has risen with the expansion of loan portfolios to lower income customers. \u001d  The bank \"will be on constant alert for any change in the level of arrears,\" Lima said. \u001d  The bank has tended to accumulate higher provisions compared with its peers in the industry because the biggest portion of its portfolio is farm loans, which suffered a crisis during 2006. Earlier in the year, the government permitted holders of farm loans to stretch out existing credits, easing some of the financial pressure on agricultural borrowers but reducing inflows for Banco do Brasil. \u001d  \"I am expecting an improvement in our farm portfolio in 2007, due to an increase in prices for some farm commodities,\" said Lima. \u001d  The CEO of Brazil's biggest bank declined to provide any forecasts for the bank's 2007 earnings or revenue performance. However, he offered that the bank's strategy would emphasize \"growth, profitability and a high degree of excellence in corporative governance.\" \u001d  Lima said, \"Before I assumed the post (in December), I met with Finance Minister Guido Mantega and he sent me a clear message - growth, profitability and corporate governance are the pillars.\" \u001d  Lima, a career employee at Banco Brazil, took over the firm's helm in December, after the exit of Rossano Maranhao. President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, who took office for a second term on Jan. 1, has yet to confirm any of his major cabinet or government entity appointments for the new administration. \u001d  Lima, meanwhile, also reinforced the bank's commitment to sell more shares to the market as a way of increasing its free float. \u001d  In June, the Banco do Brasil sold 52.26 million shares, raising BRL2.27 billion, while also migrating its shares to the investor-friendly Novo Mercado mechanism on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchanges, or Bovespa. \u001d  The Novo Mercado has the most rigorous rules for listing on the Bovespa. Participants' free float must reach 25% of shares and 100% of shares must be common, or voting, shares, rather than preferred shares. \u001d  After the 2006 operation, the free float of the bank rose to 12.5% from 7%. Banco do Brasil is controlled by the Brazilian Treasury, which holds a 72.1% stake, while the bank's own pension fund Previ holds 12% and the equity arm of the Brazilian Development Bank, BNDESPar, holds a 3.4% stake. \u001d  \"I can't guarantee that we will sell sufficient shares in 2007 up to the point where we reach a 25% free float,\" said Lima. \"However, selling more shares is certainly at the top of my agenda for the year.\" \u001d  A company joining the Novo Mercado has 36 months to increase its free float to 25% - setting a June 2009 deadline. \u001d  Banco do Brasil reported a third-quarter net profit of BRL907 million, down from BRL1.44 billion in the same quarter a year ago, attributed to an extraordinary tax gain in the year-ago quarter, which created an unusually high basis for comparison. \u001d  Banco do Brasil is Brazil's largest retail bank, managing total assets of BRL281.6 billion as of the end of the third quarter. The bank ended the quarter with a total of 24.1 million account holders. \u001d  As of 1445 GMT, the bank's shares were up 1.55% at BRL64.99, while the main stock index was up 1.27%. \b \u001d  -By Rogerio Jelmayer, Dow Jones Newswires; 5511-3145-1480; rogerio.jelmayer@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 12:10 ET (17:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7c46ca29c93e62691f19396038ae1bd2","symR":["PVH"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation Announces Strategic Licensing Arrangement with Harbor Footwear Group, Ltd. for Bass Footwear","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PVH"],"IndustryCodes":["CLO","TEX","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\bNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 02, 2007-- \u001d  Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation (NYSE: PVH) today announced it has entered into a licensing agreement with Harbor Footwear Group, Ltd. to market men's, women's and children's footwear for the Bass brand, including the iconic Weejun and Sunjun, throughout the world. \b \u001d  Under the agreement, the 130-year old Bass brand will continue to be sold in better department stores and independent retailers throughout the U.S., as well as through distributors in over 30 countries around the world.

The company, for regulatory reasons, has to buy the stake through a public tender offer. \u001d  According to a previous filing to the regulator sent by investment bank Santander Investment Valores Colombia in November, Cencosud will carry out the tender offer after Jan. 28. \u001d  In the filing to the securities regulator, Santander had said the Chilean retailer would offer COP12,500 a share, minus possible dividends distributed by Exito between October 2006 and 10 days after the public tender offer. \u001d  The peso strengthened 3.2% between the two announcements. \u001d  The price offered by Cencosud is 21% lower than the last closing price of the share. Exito closed at COP15,600 on Thursday, the last trading day in 2006. \u001d  Eduardo Reyes, who manages a fund of shares and bonds with local brokerage Asesores en Valores, said no one besides Grupo Toro will have any interest in selling their shares. Reyes holds Exito shares. \u001d  After the regulator's statement, the stock exchange suspended trading in Exito shares until a day after the publication of the details of the tender offer. \u001d  According to press reports, French retailer Casino Guichard-Perrachon (12558.FR), which owns a 38.6% stake in Exito, may block Cencosud's bid, but the French company declined to comment on its intentions. Existing shareholders have until Jan. 17 to decide if they will exercise the preferential right to buy shares. \u001d  Exito has a market share of almost 40% in Colombia, with outlets in 32 cities there and more than 345,000 square meters of retail space. It also has assets in Venezuela. \u001d  According to the securities regulator, other Exito minority shareholders include the country's largest holding, Suramericana de Inversiones (SURAMINV.BO), which through its various divisions holds a 8.17% stake. \u001d  Banco Santander Central Hispano SA (STD) owns a 2.86% stake in Exito. \u001d  Exito last August launched a bid to take over rival Carulla Vivero SA (CARULLA.BO).

Ag Growth's sales, marketing, and distribution system includes approximately 1,400 dealers and distributors in 48 states and nine provinces. \u001d  Non-GAAP measures \u001d  References to \"EBITDA\" are to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Management believes that, in addition to net income or loss, EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating its performance. Specifically, management believes that EBITDA is the appropriate measure from which to make adjustments to determine the Fund's distributable cash. EBITDA is not a financial measure recognized by Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Management cautions investors that EBITDA should not replace net income or loss as an indicator of performance, or cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of the Fund's liquidity and cash flows. The Fund's method of calculating EBITDA may differ from the methods used by other issuers. \u001d  Distributable cash is a non-GAAP measure generally used by Canadian income funds as an indicator of financial performance. The Fund defines distributable cash as EBITDA less interest expense, maintenance capital expenditures, and current taxes. Distributable cash is not a financial measure recognized by Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. The method of calculating the Fund's distributable cash may differ from similar computations as reported by similar entities and, accordingly, may not be comparable to distributable cash as reported by such entities. \u001d  Forward-Looking Statements \u001d  The statements contained in this news release may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our expectations regarding the future growth, results of operations, performance and business prospects, and opportunities of the Fund. Forward-looking statements contain such words as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"continue\", \"could\", \"expects\", \"intend\", \"plans\" or similar expressions suggesting future conditions or events. Such forward-looking statements reflect our current beliefs and are based on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from results discussed in the forward-looking statements, including changes in national and local business conditions, decreased crop yields, industry cyclicality, and competition.

Local network enhancements included adding and upgrading cell sites and a new switching facility to improve call handling capacity and quality, increasing coverage and expanding wireless broadband services for business and consumer use. \b \u001d  The company also continued to invest in redundancy capabilities designed to keep the network operating during power outages and in its rigorous quality assurance program - daily testing designed to analyze network reliability and assist the company in targeting improvements. \b \u001d  \"Investment in our network is an investment in customer satisfaction,\" said Christine Baron, president of the company's Philadelphia Tri-State Region.  \"An outstanding customer experience begins with connecting and holding calls, and customers continue to choose Verizon Wireless because we have the nation's most reliable wireless voice and data network.\" \b \u001d  Strong demand for Verizon Wireless services continued during 2006 as the company set new records for net new customers - more than 5.4 million during the first three quarters of the year - and improved upon its customer retention rates, the best in the industry. \b \u001d  During 2006, the expansion of the company's Evolution-Data Optimized (EV- DO) third generation (3G) wide-area network fueled an explosion of new high- speed broadband services for consumers and businesses. Mobile professionals throughout much of the region can now enjoy an \"untethered\" mobile office experience, enabling them to wirelessly access their calendars, E-mail and critical business information residing behind corporate firewalls. In addition, VCAST entertainment services have transformed Verizon Wireless phones allowing local consumers to carry a single multifunctional device providing access to downloadable music, high-quality videos, cool 3D games and even turn-by-turn navigation services. \b \b    Other local network upgrades in 2006 included: \b \b     -- Continued expansion of company's wireless broadband network \b        throughout the region, including Philadelphia and suburbs, the Lehigh \b        Valley, the state capitals of Trenton, N.J. and Dover, Del.; along \b        the Jersey shoreline and at the major airports across the Tri-State \b        Region. The wireless broadband service is available to about 90% of \b        the region's population with expansion to continue in 2007. \b     -- Significant expansion of the company's mobile switching facility in \b        Wilmington, Del. to handle the growing demand for wireless voice and \b        data services in the state. \b \b \u001d  The company's investment in its Philadelphia region reflects its commitment to offer customers the most reliable wireless service available. The company's 'most reliable network' reputation is based on network studies performed by real-life test men and test women.  Test men and test women are Verizon Wireless engineers who drive specially equipped vehicles some 220,000 miles quarterly on Interstate, U.S. and state highways as well as major and secondary roads. Test vehicles are equipped with computers that automatically make more than 750,000 voice call attempts and more than one million data tests quarterly on the Verizon Wireless network and the networks of other carriers.  The engineers are the inspiration for the company's memorable national advertising campaign. \b \u001d  \"As the fastest-growing wireless company with the highest loyalty rate, it is important we continue to make significant investments in our network to stay ahead of the growing demands of our customers,\" Baron said. \"In 2007, we will continue to invest in our network and deliver the reliable and innovative services customers want.\" \b \b    About Verizon Wireless \b \u001d  Verizon Wireless operates the nation's most reliable wireless voice and data network, serving 57 million customers.

The network was built and operated by Airspan and its partner, Consolidated Gulf Co. W.L.L. (\"CGC\"), for Qatar Telecom (\"QTel\"). \u001d  Qatar Telecom (QTEL), which is an existing Airspan AS4020 customer, selected Airspan's WiMAX/Wi-Fi solution from a joint proposal submitted in a competitive tender process by Airspan and CGC.  Airspan supplied its MacroMAX and MicroMAX -- System-on-a-Chip (\"SOC\") base stations, which connected to 300 ProST / Wi-Fi customer access points to create HotZones across the sites where the Games took place.  The MicroMAX-SOC, Airspan's latest WiMAX base station, is the first low-cost WiMAX solution to be sold to the carrier, enterprise, and defense markets. \u001d  The network was used to provide international news media with high-speed Internet access for data, VoIP and multimedia (picture/video clips) transmissions. Users obtained Internet access primarily through the Wi-Fi HotZones, which were backhauled by WiMAX to the Internet.  Direct WiMAX access was also available for high-bandwidth applications. The network provided viewers with real-time, live news updates, and instant event coverage through the uploading to media websites of pictures and recorded video clips for special events. \u001d  Commenting on this highly successful, high-profile deployment, Eric Stonestrom, CEO of Airspan Networks, said that, \"Airspan was delighted to have been chosen by QTel for the very important task of providing broadbandwireless connectivity to the world's leading media during the fifteen days of games in Doha. With CGC as our partner, we worked tirelessly to ensure that the solution set the standard by which internet connectivity and communications at other events will be measured.\" \u001d  Mr. Anil Mahajan, Head of Business Development of CGC, said: \"Airspan's world-class WiMAX/Wi-Fi solution was the ideal platform to provide a broadband wireless solution on the mass scale required for the Games. CGC successfully integrated WiMAX into QTel's core IP network, and the solution enabled thousands of stories, pictures and videos to be sent out by world's media, communicating in real time the dramatic events and spectacle that the games created.\" \u001d  \"We are pleased to have been part of QTEL's WiMAX broadband wireless accessnetwork during the 15th Asian Games 2006. We provided a total turnkey solution and ensured high speed NLOS broad band wireless access and high capacity backhaul to numerous WiFi Access Points. Our fully integrated WiMAX Forum Certified ProST WiMAX/WiFi integrated outdoor CPE solution was deployed at all games venues spread throughout Doha. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight that we are impressed by QTel's progressive initiative and vision of providing ubiquitous broadband wireless access services in Qatar.  While others are planning or trialing WiMAX in the region, QTEL did it. And being the leading telecom operator is undoubtedly the first telecom operator in the region to successfully deploy WiMAX on such a large scale.

The facility serves as an integral component of the comprehensive solid waste management plan of Hillsborough Country. As outlined in the terms of the extension agreement, Covanta will operate and maintain the expanded facility though 2027 to deliver County residents with environmentally-sound waste disposal and clean, renewable energy. \b \u001d  \"We look forward to continuing our long-standing partnership with Hillsborough County as we work to complete the expansion of this facility. The County's decision to expand reinforces the strategic role waste-to-energy plays in recovering energy and materials from the waste stream to further reduce reliance on landfilling.

Of that, 9.034 billion BOE were from oil. Petrobras overseas reserves fell to 1.681 billion BOE in 2005 from 1.872 billion BOE in 2004. \u001d  According to the less strict criteria of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, or SPE, Petrobras' 2005 Brazilian reserves rose to 13.232 billion BOE from 13.023 billion BOE in 2004. Of that, 11.364 billion barrels were oil reserves. \u001d  The SPE also accepts as reserves areas in earlier stages of development. \u001d  Petrobras' overseas oil and gas reserves, according to SPE criteria, fell to 1.681 billion BOE in 2005, down from 1.872 billion BOE in 2004. \u001d  A company press official Tuesday said Petrobras hopes to include at least a great part of the areas now declared commercially viable as reserves under SPE criteria. \u001d  Petrobras on Friday had said 16 of the new areas were located offshore and three areas were located onshore. \u001d  The 16 offshore areas are located at three Atlantic Ocean sites off the coasts of southeastern Brazil. \u001d  The greatest amount of new reserves will be added to the Campos Basin off the Rio de Janeiro coast, where Petrobras estimates eight new areas to add reserves of 1.37 billion BOE. In one of the areas, the Maromba field in the BC-20 block, U.S. oil firm Chevron Corp. (CVX) has a participation, Petrobras said. \u001d  Another 560 million BOE in estimated new reserves will come from the Santos Basin off the Sao Paulo coast, most near the Mexilhao gas field where Petrobras plans to start output in early 2009. \u001d  Petrobras also has a 40% stake in the BS-4 block in the Santos Basin, which Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSB.LN) Thursday declared to be commercially viable. Shell is lead operator in that block with a 40% stake, while Chevron also holds 20%. The BS-4 is estimated to contain reserves of about 300 million barrels of very heavy crude. \u001d  The remainder of Petrobras' new areas will come from its most recent oil province off the coast of Espirito Santo state, where the company estimates new reserves to amount to 168 million BOE. \b \u001d  -By Bernd Radowitz, Dow Jones Newswires; +5521-3288-5004; bernd.radowitz@dowjones.com; \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 09:16 ET (14:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"88690ecee090f54310003df33d47754d","symR":["COB.A.T","CA21639P2089"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Coolbrands International Inc.

(GOOG) and partner EarthLink Inc. (ELNK), the Internet service provider, are \"very close\" to finalizing terms of a deal to build a San Francisco-wide wireless Internet network, sources said Tuesday. \u001d  San Francisco is trying to join the growing numbers of major U.S. cities that make available free, and relatively low cost, Internet access using Wi-Fi, a popular wireless technology. An agreement on contract terms means both sides have overcome a major hurdle after more than nine months of sometime acrimonious negotiations. \u001d  But the process is by no means over. Before construction on the network could begin, the contract terms must be approved by the city's board of supervisors. Also, according to the sources, while an official announcement could happen as early as this week, they cautioned the negotiations could fall apart on any number of issues. \u001d  \"We're close, very close,\" said one of two sources speaking about the pending deal. Another source, familiar with EarthLink's stance, said \"this could happen this week.\" Both were granted anonymity because they weren't supposed to be talking publicly about the deal. \u001d  Representatives from Mayor Gavin Newsom's office didn't reply to requests Tuesday seeking comment. An EarthLink (ELNK) spokesman had no comment and a Google representative referred comment to EarthLink. \u001d  The proposed network in San Francisco would have two components; one would make available, for free, a high-speed Internet network supported by advertisements appearing on computer or laptop screens logged onto the network. \u001d  The Google and EarthLink proposal also calls for selling a faster, commercial-free wireless Internet service in San Francisco for $20 a month. \u001d  San Francisco's leadership is trying to create opportunity for more of its citizens to derive the economic benefits from using the Internet. San Francisco's leadership also wants to the city's reputation as a technology-friendly city. \u001d  EarthLink hopes to profit from this venture, and other municipal-wide wireless networks it is now building, by extending its Internet services to a bigger, more captive audiences. \u001d  Google's motivations aren't as crystal clear, although the company would clearly benefit from serving up ads to free Internet users. Google also operates a city-wide wireless network, on its own, in its hometown of Mountain View. \u001d  In April, San Francisco formally began negotiations with the Google/EarthLink partnership, after choosing their joint proposal from a list of five others that were submitted. \u001d  Almost immediately, privacy advocates including those from the American Civil Liberties Union raised concerns about Google's involvement, questioning whether that meant the network would be tracking users' whereabouts. \u001d  Google acknowledge it was possible to track users and, if done so, it would ostensibly be done as a way to tailor the ads that would appear to mirror a business someone's close to. \u001d  While Google and EarthLink say privacy concerns are baseless, a San Francisco-based privacy group earlier this year submitted to the city guidelines and minimum standards it considers necessary for protecting people's privacy. \u001d  In September, frustrations over the slow pace of the negotiations apparently boiled over. \u001d  Chris Sacca, head of Google's special projects, said in an interview published in the San Francisco Chronicle that talks hadn't advanced for months, and city officials have made unreasonable demands such as free computers and a revenue share. \u001d  -Ben Charny; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 14:51 ET (19:51 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"88ac112b51aae799d97ceb89f787503a","symR":["GM","US3704421052"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MLN Considering Strategic Alternatives For Wholesale Ops","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T14:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GM","US3704421052"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 09:26 ET (14:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"88ad9391f4002a96a00b0fd16e861ecc","symR":["MTD"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

The idea is that they can devise winning strategies no matter the state of companies' finances because of the many different ways they can buy or sell credit risk. \u001d  Hedge funds specializing in distressed debt could do particularly well, after slim pickings in troubled companies bonds and loans over the past few years, analysts say. \u001d  The expectation that a turn in credit quality will create more investment opportunities for hedge-fund managers is one reason why Commerzbank AG in December launched a fixed-income fund of hedge funds investing with at least 15 managers in fixed-income and credit strategies. \u001d  \"Credit markets have had such a good run, clearly, but no one expects that to last. As and when we start seeing the credit market become choppy and the element of uncertainty kicks in, hedge funds will come into their own,\" said Mehraj Mattoo, global head of alternative investment strategies at Commerzbank. \u001d  Regulators and ratings agencies aren't so sure. They have cautioned that hedge funds could exacerbate the effects of more companies struggling to make debt repayments, shaking the \"wall of money\" that has helped bring risk premiums on corporate bonds near all-time lows. \u001d  One worry is that price moves in corporate bonds or derivatives could be amplified by hedge funds needing to meet margin calls on positions they finance with borrowed money. \u001d  \"That is the big unwind scenario. To meet margin calls on illiquid instruments, hedge funds will have to sell their liquid assets,\" said Ed Eyerman, a managing director at Fitch Ratings in London. \u001d  Credit markets have looked like a one-way bet for both hedge funds and traditional buy-and-hold investors since the last major wave of defaults around 2002. \u001d  Then, the collapses of Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc. helped push the average yield premium on U.S. high-yield bonds to 9.47 percentage points over risk-free rates. The gap is now around 3.5 percentage points, as the high-yield default rate has fallen from more than 8% in 2002 to around 2% now. \u001d  Over that period, hedge funds helped lead a charge into credit markets by investors looking to make money from taking on credit risk. Investment banks responded by introducing products that compartmentalize lending risks, reaping them billions of dollars in fees. \u001d  In one measure of the markets' rapid growth, about $400 billion in collateralized debt obligations were issued in the U.S. and Europe in 2006, more than double the amount in 2004. \u001d  These pools of debt contracts referencing everything from risky corporate loans to people's credit card payments are crucial to the markets because they fuel the sale of credit default swaps - contracts that pay sellers a premium to insure against a borrower defaulting. \u001d  The notional value of those swap contracts was $26 trillion at June 30, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, more than 15-fold the $1.6 trillion in June 2002. \u001d  Although CDOs and credit derivatives spread lending risks to a wider number of investors from companies' original lenders, they have also created turmoil in their relatively-short existence. \u001d  Credit hedge funds in particular suffered significant losses when spreads on some derivatives products unexpectedly became correlated after the May 2005 junk downgrades of U.S. automakers General Motors Corp. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. (F). \u001d  \"An economic downturn will test the new synthetic players and products in the corporate bond market. These products and markets are relatively new and, more importantly, have yet to be tested in a bear market,\" Mark Kiesel, a portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. wrote in a recent note. \u001d  Kiesel said Newport Beach, Calif.-based Pimco, which controls $641 billion in assets, is collecting the difference in prices between companies' bonds and their credit default swaps, because it expects the swaps market to react more sharply if there is a correction in the pricing of default risk. \u001d  Ratings agencies also have warned that hedge funds and other investors may be mispricing the risk of some new types of corporate loans. Highly leveraged companies owned by private-equity funds have been heavy issuers of second-lien loans that give holders a secondary claim on a company's collateral. Owned almost exclusively by hedge funds, the loans' performance hasn't been tested through a default cycle. \u001d  Patrick Brennan, a London-based portfolio manager on NewFinance Capital's Opus Credit fund of hedge funds, said skilled hedge-fund managers should be able to adapt quickly if there is a significant increase in corporate defaults. Like most credit-market investors, he isn't anticipating that will happen for at least a year or two. \u001d  He said his $100 million fund - which returned more than 12% in 2006 after fees - is profiting from managers with stakes in corporate restructurings at U.S. airlines and auto-parts suppliers. Other gains are coming from hedge funds that provide specialty finance such as bridge financing for real-estate development, and from managers who are short-selling against the repayment of mortgages granted to U.S. home buyers with spotty credit. \u001d  \"We are avoiding derivatives-based strategies and highly levered products because we view those as vulnerable to any significant liquidity squeeze in the market,\" Brennan said. \u001d  -By Margot Patrick, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9451; margot.patrick@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 00:45 ET (05:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"88e297da656ac28c7a37303d5a4b87b4","symR":["HSG.T","IPS","IPS.T","NUE","STLD","CA4145743015","CA4626221010"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"2nd UPDATE:Nucor Makes $1.07B Tender For Harris Steel","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T14:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HSG.T","IPS","IPS.T","NUE","STLD","CA4145743015","CA4626221010"],"IndustryCodes":["STL","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Adds background, analyst's comments on pricing.) \b \b   By Christopher Scinta \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Nucor Corp. (NUE) said it plans to acquire Canadian steel processor Harris Steel Group (HSG.T) for C$1.25 billion (US$1.07 billion), adding to its operations downstream from its steel mills and adding exposure to what has been a strong non-residential construction market. \u001d  The Charlotte steel company's C$46.25-a-share tender offer will remain open for at least 35 days and represents a 6.3% premium to Harris' Friday's close. Harris shares ran up from around C$36 earlier this month after the company announced it was in talks that may lead to a sale. \u001d  Harris Steel Chairman and Chief Executive John Harris and other members of the Harris family, along with Chief Operating Officer Paul Kelly, have agreed to tender 13.7 million shares, representing more than 50% of Harris Steel stock. \u001d  Nucor said Harris had net debt of C$123 million at Sept. 30. \u001d  Nucor shares closed on Friday at $54.66, down 1.1%. \u001d  Toronto-based Harris supplies steel reinforcing bar for construction projects as well as wire and metal grates. \u001d  \"The acquisition of Harris Steel Group significantly advances Nucor's downstream growth initiatives,\" said Nucor Chief Executive Dan DiMicco in a statement. \"...Harris Steel provides Nucor with immediate and broad geographical reach and with considerable scale and growth opportunities.\" \u001d  In December, Nucor said its fourth-quarter earnings would be below analyst expectations and cited heavy imports and high inventories that were driving down prices. Other steelmakers including Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) and Ipsco Inc. (IPS) have joined Nucor in saying their fourth-quarter results would be hurt as wholesalers worked through their excess inventory. \u001d  Steel imports, though they declined in November according to preliminary figures from the Census Bureau, are still expected to reach a record 46 million tons in 2006. \u001d  UBS analyst Timna Tanners said in a recent note that steel sheet prices likely reached a bottom at $530 a ton in December, down $100 from the peak over the summer. Prices for long products, such as steel beams and merchant bar, were holding up better than sheet due to \"continued relatively robust construction demand,\" she said. \u001d  -By Christopher Scinta,Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5218; chris.scinta@dowjones.com \u001d  (Jonathan Vuocolo contributed to this report.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 09:50 ET (14:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"88f46b5f6932149ed8ece4e6fb0e19ea","symR":["BLND.LN","BTLCY","LAND.LN","GB0001367019","GB0031809436","BLND.LN","BTLCY","LAND.LN","GB0001367019","GB0031809436"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"British Land Opens Up 1.5% After REIT Conversion","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T08:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BLND.LN","BTLCY","LAND.LN","GB0001367019","GB0031809436"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XFT1","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 03:01 ET (08:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"891c43d4539f542ef3e4ddf1444e79cd","symR":["EGP"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Eastgroup Ppties Sells Auburn Hills Ppty For $17.9M >EGP","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T21:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EGP"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:42 ET (21:42 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8989e1c6934d24980390b5723ed138c5","symR":["CFDAY","GBTVQ"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Harbinger Seeks Shareholder Panel In Granite Ch 11 Case","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CFDAY","GBTVQ"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \b   By Marie Beaudette \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Harbinger Capital Partners is urging the Manhattan bankruptcy court to form a committee to represent shareholders in the Chapter 11 case of Granite Broadcasting Corp. (GBTVQ), saying the company's plan to transfer control to Silver Point Capital would give the hedge fund a windfall at shareholders' expense. \u001d  Harbinger, along with fellow preferred shareholders GoldenTree High Yield Master Fund II Ltd. and MFC Global Investment Management (U.S.) LLC, said the case represents \"a classic example\" of secured creditors attempting to \"grab upside equity value rather than simply seeking to be paid in full.\" \u001d  Granite Broadcasting, which sought Chapter 11 protection last month after reaching a deal with Silver Point and other secured bondholders, \"cannot be counted on to protect the interests of the preferred equity holders,\" the shareholder group said in papers filed Friday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. \u001d  The shareholders, who hold more than 50% of Granite Broadcasting's 12.75% cumulative exchangeable preferred stock, are pegging the post-bankruptcy enterprise value of the company at a \"dramatically\" higher level than the $493 million estimate put forth by Granite's own financial adviser. \u001d  A representative of Granite Broadcasting declined to comment. \u001d  The shareholders, who also want the court to deny Granite's request to borrow an additional $20 million from Silver Point, said the appointment of a committee is necessary to preserve the \"substantial value available for holders of the preferred equity.\" \u001d  According to court papers, an analysis conducted by investment bank Chanin Capital Partners L.P. puts Granite's enterprise value at between $630.9 million and $698 million, which would provide value to the preferred shareholders of between $19.4 million and $101.5 million. \u001d  The shareholder group called Chanin's estimate \"conservative\" and said Granite's Chapter 11 reorganization plan is based on a flawed valuation from financial adviser Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin. \u001d  \"The proposed plan assumes an artificially depressed enterprise value of $493 million, when, in reality, the enterprise value is dramatically higher,\" the shareholder group said. \u001d  The shareholders said Silver Point is attempting to \"present an artificially low valuation\" to get control of the company's equity after bankruptcy. \u001d  Silver Point is asking the court to deny the Harbinger group's request for an expedited hearing on its request to form a committee, saying all parties in the case need time to review the Chanin valuation. \u001d  \"It is premature for the Harbinger group to move this court to appoint a preferred equity committee,\" Luc Despins, an attorney for Silver Point, wrote in a letter filed with the bankruptcy court Friday. \u001d  Silver Point wants a Wednesday hearing on Granite's request to borrow an additional $20 million in bankruptcy financing - part of a $25 million debtor-in-possession loan approved on an interim basis last month - to go ahead as scheduled. \u001d  Silver Point is poised to take control of Granite when the broadcaster exits bankruptcy. The hedge fund, along with Granite's other bondholders, reached a deal before Granite sought Chapter 11 protection to trade the $295 million Granite owes them for the reorganized company's equity. \u001d  Under its proposed Chapter 11 plan, Granite's existing shares will be canceled and the reorganized company will issue 10 million new common shares, most of which are earmarked for secured creditors, namely Silver Point and the other bondholders. Silver Point is taking Granite private and the shares won't be publicly traded. \u001d  Preferred shareholders, who were owed about $300 million according to Granite's most recent quarterly financial statement, will receive a 2% stake in the new company. Based on Granite's own estimates, that stake will be worth about $5 million. \u001d  The Harbinger group claims Granite Chief Executive W. Don Cornwell is prepared to facilitate the \"windfall\" to Silver Point at the expense of shareholders in return for a \"payoff in the form of all types of undue and improper consideration.\" \u001d  As reported, Cornwell stands to gain at least $2.6 million under the reorganization deal with Silver Point and the bondholders. \u001d  Under the proposed Chapter 11 plan, Granite will pay up to $2.5 million in income taxes owed on a forgiven loan the company made to Cornwell, who is a co-founder of Granite and sole holder of its voting shares. \u001d  Cornwell will also receive an equity stake worth an estimated $132,000 in the reorganized company and keep his job as CEO at a yearly salary of $629,200, which will double if the company meets its broadcast cash-flow target of $34.3 million. Cornwell will retain his seat on Granite's board and is eligible for stock options under a management incentive plan. \u001d  Conflicts also dog Granite's directors and senior management, who have agreed to be contractually bound to support the company's Chapter 11 reorganization plan, Harbinger said. \u001d  Harbinger said there's no group in the case watching out for the interests of the preferred shareholders or even for unsecured creditors. According to court papers, the U.S. Trustee's Office declined to appoint an official committee of unsecured creditors due to \"insufficient creditor interest.\" \u001d  A committee to represent the holders of Granite's preferred stock is \"necessary immediately to engage litigation before this court regarding the adequacy of the proposed disclosure statement and confirmability of the proposed plan,\" Harbinger said. \u001d  New York-based Granite Broadcasting filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 11, listing assets of $443.5 million and debts of $644.1 million. The company operates 23 television stations in seven states and employs 786 people. \b \u001d  -Marie Beaudette, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1354; marie.beaudette@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:15 ET (20:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"89a10aab11307a6e2f7650ac679bf0df","symR":["CPE.XX","LEN","LENB","MACF.LN","GB0005518872","LEN","LENB"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Lennar, LNR Admit MW Housing Partners Into Joint Venture","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T11:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CPE.XX","LEN","LENB","MACF.LN","GB0005518872"],"IndustryCodes":["HOM","HPR","ICS","INL","INS","SVC","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Corrected Jan. 2, 2007 6:07 ET (11:07 GMT)\u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 06:04 ET (11:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8a444d7b55cb9b77becfb9dae56dc289","symR":["PVH"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Phillips-Van Heusen In Licensing Pact With Harbor Footwear","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PVH"],"IndustryCodes":["CLO","TEX","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Phillips-Van Heusen Corp.

(Amex: PRZ), one of the nation's leading providers of pain-focused medical and surgical solutions and services, today issued a formal update regarding the prevailing status of the sale(s) of its ambulatory surgery centers and other corporate matters. \b \u001d  After careful consideration of the offers and indications of interest received from several third parties expressing proposed terms to acquire PainCare's three ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) currently being marketed for sale, the Company has determined that maximum value will be realized by syndicating the ASCs and selling them as stand-alone properties to multiple buyers.  In this regard, PainCare expects to finalize terms and conditions of the individual sales during the first quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  As a consequence of the timing of the anticipated ASC sale closings, PainCare has entered into a Supplemental Agreement with the original shareholders of The Center for Pain Management ASC, LLC formally extending the date for payment of approximately $7.76 million, originally due and payable on January 3, 2007, to April 3, 2007. \b \u001d  In addition, PainCare has received forbearance from its senior lenders under the senior credit facility agented by HBK Investments LP until March 31, 2007. \b \u001d  PainCare previously announced its intent to divest its three ambulatory surgery centers located in Florida and Maryland.  The Company intends to utilize the proceeds of both the syndication and the sale to retire or substantially reduce current debt obligations and fund planned growth initiatives, including Integrated Pain Solutions (IPS), PainCare's new pain- focused Managed Services Organization currently in development and scheduled for launch in the first quarter. \b \u001d  In light of PainCare's objective to concentrate on key growth objectives within its owned and/or managed pain practices and on its development of IPS, the Company also elected to rescind its acquisition of a 60% ownership stake in Amphora, LLC, a Colorado-based Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) company. In accordance with the Settlement and Rescission Agreement, the original selling parties will return to PainCare $1.4 million in cash and 1,035,032 shares of PainCare's common stock that was issued to the sellers at the closing of the original transaction. \b \u001d  Regarding the status of the shareholder class action lawsuit, the Company reported that the Court has set a date of January 17, 2007 to rule on PainCare's 'Motion to Dismiss'. \b \u001d  \"These are all very positive developments for PainCare and represent key steps forward in our efforts to finalize our balance sheet restructuring and ultimately put to rest the legal issues that have stemmed from the financial reporting challenges we have worked hard to overcome,\" stated Randy Lubinsky, Chief Executive Officer of PainCare. \b \b    About PainCare Holdings, Inc. \b \u001d  Headquartered in Orlando, Florida, PainCare Holdings, Inc. is one of the nation's leading providers of pain-focused medical and surgical solutions and services.

The most advanced ZFP Therapeutic(TM) development program is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for evaluation of safety in patients with diabetic neuropathy.  Phase 1 clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate a ZFP Therapeutic for peripheral artery disease.  Other therapeutic development programs are focused on ischemic heart disease, neuropathic pain, cancer and infectious and monogenic diseases.  Sangamo's core competencies enable the engineering of a class of DNA-binding proteins known as zinc finger DNA-binding proteins (ZFPs).  By engineering ZFPs that recognize a specific DNA sequence Sangamo has created ZFP transcription factors (ZFP TF(TM)) that can control gene expression and, consequently, cell function.  Sangamo is also developing sequence-specific ZFP Nucleases (ZFN(TM)) for therapeutic gene modification as a treatment for a variety of monogenic diseases, such as X-linked SCID and hemophilia, and for infectious diseases, such as HIV.  Sangamo has established several Enabling Technology Agreements with companies to apply its ZFP Technology to enhance the production of protein pharmaceuticals.

That's a change. Despite an improved performance since its relisting on the Milan exchange in 2005, Parmalat hasn't been in this position. \u001d  CEO Enrico Bondi has not allowed himself to get distracted from his main task: achieve incremental growth from milk. He is confident of Parmalat achieving 11.6% operating margins on revenues of EUR3.9 billion by 2007. \u001d  At its current price, Parmalat is trading at roughly 12.5X EV/EBITDA multiple, a shade below sector peers. \u001d  BNL and Ifatalia, part of the French banking group BNP, have agreed to pay Parmalat EUR112 million in various damages. That's roughly 35% of Parmalat's original claim and at least 5% to 10% higher than some observers expected. \u001d  The company had also settled with BPI, another case of a 35% recovery. \u001d  Parmalat is claiming more than EUR7.5 billion in these clawback damages from various financial institutions, through the new Italian bankruptcy regulations. But one can't take the recovery rates to date as an indication of future settlements. \u001d  The settlements so far, including with Morgan Stanley and Nextra, resulted from new management at the financial institutions. Nothing resolves pending litigation like a new management trying to bring the curtain down on the previous management act. \u001d  As part of its settlements, Parmalat is promising it will no longer pursue criminal charges against the financial institutions. That's likely to add pressure on other institutions to settle. \u001d  But investors must note that a New York judge, presiding over Parmalat's case against Bank of America and auditors,  is eager for a global settlement. Progress in that case would pressure Citibank to consider settling. The same applies on the remaining 70 cases being fought in Italy. \u001d  If the Italian cases bring a 30% recovery rate, that's an implied amount of EUR2.25 billion. Some of that money, however, may have to go to aggrieved investors hurt by the 2003 accounting scandal that pushed it into bankruptcy. \u001d  Two things are key: Parmalat's litigation has a good chance of a speedy settlement and it will soon be in a position to pay dividends. \u001d  (Arindam Nag has covered business and finance for 15 years in Asia, Europe and the United States.

Announces Filing of Supplemental New Drug Application for WelChol in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \b \b\b \b   PARSIPPANY, N.J., Jan. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. announced \btoday that it has filed a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) with the \bU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for WelChol(R) (colesevelam HCl) to \bimprove glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  If \bapproved, WelChol will be the first LDL cholesterol lowering medication also \bindicated for improving glycemic control. \b\b \b   Clinical studies have shown that WelChol lowers A1C in patients with type \b2 diabetes mellitus.  One study, presented at the American Heart Association's \b(AHA) Scientific Sessions 2006 in Chicago, showed that WelChol, when added to \binsulin, demonstrated a mean A1C reduction of 0.5% compared to placebo (-0.41% \bvs. +0.09%, p < 0.007).  A similar effect was demonstrated in an additional \bWelChol study presented at the American Diabetes Association's (ADA) 66th \bAnnual Scientific Sessions.  In this study, the Glucose Lowering Effect Of \bWelChol Study (GLOWS), WelChol added to an oral antidiabetic therapy resulted \bin mean A1C reductions of 0.5% compared to placebo (p = 0.0007) and 1.0% in \bpatients with A1C = 8.0% compared to placebo (p = 0.002). \b\b \b   \"Every physician who treats diabetes is looking to lower A1C as \beffectively as possible, resulting in a constant lookout for improved \bcombinations of therapy,\" said Ronald B. Goldberg, MD, Professor of Medicine, \bthe Division of Diabetes and Metabolism and Associate Director, Diabetes \bResearch Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.  \"The \bsame can be said for LDL-cholesterol as well.  As a result, a compound that \bcan help lower both of these important cardiovascular risk factors, A1C and \bLDL-cholesterol, can be of great benefit for many patients.\" \b\b \b   The ADA estimates that 20.8 million people in the United States have \bdiabetes and over 90% of these have type 2 diabetes.  The ADA recommends that \bpatients with type 2 diabetes target an A1C level of < 7%.(1)  Additionally, \bthe National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommends that patients \bwith type 2 diabetes keep their cholesterol levels in check and target an \bLDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dL.(2) \b\b \b   \"Given the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol and the \bnumber of patients who are not reaching goal, adding WelChol expands patients' \btreatment options,\" said Joseph P. Pieroni, President and CEO of Daiichi \bSankyo, Inc.  \"Daiichi Sankyo strives to contribute to the health and \bwell-being of people worldwide, particularly in cardiovascular care, and we \bwill continue to investigate new applications of our therapies for patients' \bbenefit.\" \b\b \b   A recent survey of physicians attending this year's annual AHA meeting \bfurther illuminates the prevalence of patients with high cholesterol and type \b2 diabetes.  HRA Research, a leading healthcare market research company \bspecializing in the pharmaceutical industry, surveyed 100 physicians for their \bexperience with addressing cholesterol and glycemic control.  Half the \bphysicians surveyed reported that over 60% of their type 2 diabetes patients \balso have high cholesterol, and over 80% of the physicians were extremely \binterested in a drug that could treat both conditions.(3)  Two-thirds of the \bphysicians polled indicated that over the next year they expect to increase \btheir prescribing of combination therapy to lower both A1C and LDL-C.(4) \bTwo-thirds report that the recent update of ADA guidelines changed their \btreatment regimen.  They now feel strongly that each possible drop in A1C \blevels is critical to the health of their type 2 diabetes patient.(5) \b\b \b\b    About WelChol \b\b \b   WelChol is indicated for LDL-C lowering and was approved by the U.S. Food \band Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing in May 2000.  WelChol is the \btop-selling branded drug in the bile acid sequestrants (BAS) class.  WelChol \bis different from most other cholesterol-lowering drugs on the market because \bit is non-systemic, meaning that the body does not absorb it and it is \beliminated without traveling to the liver or kidneys.  Therefore, WelChol is \bnot expected to have drug-drug interactions via the cytochrome P-450 pathway. \bSystemic medications, which include statins, fibrates, and cholesterol \babsorption inhibitors, are those that are absorbed from the intestine into the \bbloodstream and travel throughout the body, specifically to the liver and/or \bkidneys. \b\b \b   WelChol is a prescription drug indicated alone or in combination with a \bstatin, as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the reduction of elevated LDL \bcholesterol in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (Fredrickson Type \bIIa) when the response to diet and exercise has been inadequate.  Liver- \bfunction monitoring is not required with WelChol when used as monotherapy, and \bin combination with a statin, no additional liver-function monitoring is \brequired beyond that for the prescribed statin alone. \b\b \b   In clinical trials with patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, when \bWelChol was given alone in addition to a low-fat diet and exercise, it was \bshown to reduce LDL cholesterol by an average of 15% to 18%. \b\b \b   When WelChol is given in combination with a statin, the combination can \blower cholesterol levels more effectively than using either therapy alone.  In \bpivotal studies where WelChol was taken with a statin, WelChol 3.8g provided \bup to an additional mean 16% (32 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol.  WelChol \bis the only non-systemic cholesterol-lowering agent approved by the FDA for \bcombination with a statin.  WelChol can be used in combination with any dose \bof any statin. \b\b \b   WelChol is engineered for affinity, specificity and high capacity bile \bacid binding.  It has been studied with four commonly prescribed statins -- \bLipitor(R) (atorvastatin calcium), Zocor(R) (simvastatin), Pravachol(R) \b(pravastatin sodium) and Mevacor(R) (lovastatin).  Additionally, WelChol has \bbeen studied with fenofibrate and had no significant effect on the \bbioavailability of fenofibrate.  Like most prescription drugs, WelChol has not \bbeen studied in combination with all medications or supplements.  Patients \bshould always tell their doctor about all medications and supplements they are \btaking before starting any new therapy, including WelChol. \b\b \b   WelChol is not for everyone, especially those with bowel blockage. \bCaution should be exercised when treating patients who have trouble swallowing \bor severe stomach or intestinal problems.  Side effects may include \bconstipation, indigestion and gas.  WelChol, either alone or in combination \bwith a statin or fenofibrate, has not been shown to prevent heart disease or \bheart attacks. \b\b \b   WelChol is only indicated for the reduction of LDL-C either alone or in \bcombination with a statin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. \bAdditionally, WelChol has demonstrated beneficial effects on other lipid \bparameters such as HDL-C and APO-B.  WelChol has also been studied in \bcombination with fenofibrate in patients with mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson \bType II B), and provided additional LDL-C reductions in these patients when \badded to a stable fenofibrate regimen.  WelChol is not indicated for use in \bthe treatment of mixed dyslipidemia or lipid parameters other than LDL-C. \b\b \b   For more information on WelChol, call 877-4-DSPROD (877-431-7763), or go \bto the WelChol web site at http://www.WelChol.com. \b\b \b\b    About Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. \b\b \b   Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. is the U.S. subsidiary of Japanese pharmaceutical \bcompany Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.

This simple and effective program is designed to help business professionals strengthen their organizational skills - and the overall health of their businesses - by reclaiming time lost to disorder. In fact, according to the Office Depot survey, about 34 percent of professionals surveyed stated that they lose almost two hours every week - or a full workday every month - to lost productivity caused by everyday disarray. \b \u001d  Anyone can get their professional life organized and into tip-top shape this new year by following the new version of the Office Depot Five-Day Office Makeover Plan. Featuring advice from organizing expert Stephanie Winston, who has aided thousands of executives in her 20-year career, this plan will help business people transform their office environment in 30 minutes a day by trimming overflowing in-boxes, strengthening file-finding capabilities, and toning-up overall organizational skills. Plus, the new Office Depot Five-Day Office Makeover Plan features valuable advice to help simplify tax return preparation. \b \u001d  \"Many people resolve to get better organized in the new year. Yet, more than two thirds of business professionals cannot bring order to their work lives because they don't know where to start, how to maintain new systems or they simply get frustrated,\" said Stephanie Winston, Office Depot's organizing advisor and The New York Times bestselling author of Getting Organized. \b \u001d  \"This plan gives professionals what they need - a more organized work environment for greater productivity every day,\" added Winston. \b \u001d  The Five-Day Office Makeover Plan makes it simple to take control of workplace disorganization by using a few basic products and tips. With the help of Winston's coaching, you will be able to find any piece of paper in less than 60 seconds, combat tiresome business travel and even make tax preparation less \"taxing.\" To get started, Winston advises business professionals spend a few minutes getting organized each day using the following approach: \b \b   --  Slim Down the Piles: A slimmed down waist line is wonderful, \b        but what can you do about that huge stack of papers on the \b        desk that has grown into multiple piles? Winston suggests the \b        TRAF system. Toss things of no interest, but use a shredder, \b        like the Ativa shredders ($24.99 - $149.99) from Office Depot, \b        to avoid identity theft. Refer paperwork to a colleague who \b        might need it. Act on the task and make sure to finalize the \b        activity. File the paper if it could be used in the future. \b \b   --  Tone-Up To-Do Lists: Create a master list categorized by \b        priority and divide and conquer by breaking down large \b        projects into manageable portions. The best way to organize is \b        to use a planner, not your memory. However, the Office Depot \b        study found that while 57 percent of men surveyed prefer to \b        use electronic tools, such as PCs and PDAs, to stay organized, \b        34 percent of women stated that they prefer to use paper \b        materials such as Day Planners. Winston recommends finding the \b        product that works best for you, such as a Palm(R) LifeDrive \b        PDA ($449.99), FranklinCovey(R) planner ($69.99) or a product \b        that combines the best of both worlds like the At-A-Glance(R) \b        Outlink Planner ($58.99) that holds Outlook(R) calendar \b        printouts. \b \b   --  Increase File-Finding Flexibility: Staying on top of filing \b        paperwork can prevent clutter and help you find needed files \b        quickly. Beyond revamping your filing system, make it easy to \b        find what you need by using the Smead(R) SuperTab File Folders \b        ($15.99) that have a 90 percent larger label area than \b        traditional file folders. \b \b   --  Train for a Less \"Taxing\" Tax Season: Instead of stuffing \b        receipts into shoeboxes, prepare an expanding file at the \b        beginning of the year with tabs for all of your receipts. Then \b        look for tax software like TurboTax(R) ($19.99 - 99.99) with \b        its new \"Deduction Maximizer Center,\" which helps anyone find \b        and track more than 350 deductions and credits. \b \u001d  Additional tips and solutions to get organized in less than 30 minutes a day can be found in the Office Depot Five-Day Office Makeover, which is available for free download at www.officedepot.com/getorganized. \b \b   About the Survey \b \u001d  The Office Depot Organization Study, conducted by TNS NFO, was designed to gain insights into consumers' organizational behaviors and challenges.

And the telephones are beginning to ring,\" said Mikels, who heads the bankruptcy practice at Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky & Pompeo. \u001d  Economic signs point to a relatively healthy 2007, with the rate of bankruptcy filings remaining low. But Mikels and others closer to the ground - like investors in distressed investors and restructuring lawyers - aren't so sure. \u001d  The naysayers predict that 2007 will be the first year in which the market will feel the adverse effects of the enormous level of liquidity available to U.S. companies. Even those significantly overleveraged and on the verge of Chapter 11 have managed to avoid in-court restructurings through multiple refinancings. \u001d  But as liquidity tightens and retreats from its unprecedented level, an uptick in Chapter 11 filings could begin. Hedge funds and private equity firms, which have been propping up some unwise projects, may finally see some of their deals go sour. \u001d             \"Liquidity Bubble\" Can't Last, Goldman VP Says \u001d  \"There is a liquidity bubble. It will burst,\" Roopesh Shah, a Goldman Sachs vice president, said at a recent industry conference. \"(Leveraged buyouts) are getting done at higher levels. Covenants are light. But look at the macro factors - a weakening dollar has to be held up by higher interest rates.\" \u001d  Economists predict that growth will lose steam in 2007, with the growth of U.S. gross domestic product slowing to a rate of 2.4% in 2007 from 3.3% in 2006. But the Federal Reserve is expected to engineer a soft landing to any downturn by carefully tweaking its interest-rate target, now at 5.25%. \u001d  Currently, the Treasury yield curve is slightly inverted, meaning short-term rates are higher than 10-year or 30-year yields. That suggests that the market expects slower growth, but not a sharp enough downturn for the Fed to slash its rates, though a slight trim is predicted. \u001d  John Lonski, an economist with Moody's Investors Service, said Moody's expects the default rate for U.S. speculative-grade corporate bonds to be between 2.5% to 3% in 2007, up from 2% in November 2006. S&P's forecast is nearly identical. \u001d  Experts say companies with wobbly finances enjoyed good fortune in 2006. U.S. economic growth remained strong, exceeding 3% even as the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate to the highest level in five years. Overall corporate profits from current production surged, climbing about 20% in year-on-year terms. The cost of borrowing for companies in financial trouble actually dropped, according to Lonski. \u001d           S&P Distress Ratio Hit 26-Year Low In December \u001d  S&P said its distress ratio, which measures the level of distress in the U.S. junk bond market, fell to a 26-year low in December. \u001d  In 2006, corporate Chapter 11 filings were held down by free-flowing liquidity and creditor-friendly changes in the Bankruptcy Code enacted in 2005. But credit quality is beginning to show signs of deterioration. Lonski said the volume of corporate bonds Moody's has rated Caa or lower - bonds at great risk of default - climbed to $129.7 billion by September, up 12% over a year ago. \u001d  Presentations at a recent distressed investing conference in New York showed a confluence of trends that point to a more dire scenario than traditional economic signs. \u001d  More high-yield bonds and second-lien loans, or financing extended to companies whose assets already secure other debts, were issued in 2006. Debt issued by banks, insurance companies and more traditional lenders fell, but financing from hedge funds and high-yield funds, who behave more aggressively when companies default, rose. \u001d  In spite of the growing number of risky financings, bankruptcy experts say capital will continue to flow in 2007. \"There is still an enormous amount of liquidity available through hedge funds and alternative sources,\" said Richard Smolev, a bankruptcy partner at Kaye Scholer. \u001d  Smolev said the risk appetite illustrates the belief that \"people can hedge their risk in much more creative ways\" than in the past, using total return swaps and other financial instruments. \u001d  Risky strategies may be compounded by what many say has been a lack of attention being paid to corporate fundamentals. The result could be more vehement battles among creditors when companies do seek bankruptcy protection. \u001d  Stuart Gilson, a professor of finance at Harvard Business School, says the next wave of bankruptcies will be bigger and more complicated. \u001d  \"There's been more money than good deals, and the money has been papering over real business problems,\" Gilson said. \"When the money runs out and the situation turns to crisis, the types of defaults we're going to see could be much more serious than in the past.\" \u001d  -Tiffany Kary, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4292; tiffany.kary@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:29 ET (20:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"95ee23f732260b262498acdec2d8f7ba","symR":["BT","BT.A.LN","PNT.LN","GB0030913577","GB00B01RM369"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"BT Group Claims 96% Of PlusNet, Offer Extended >PNT.LN BT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T07:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BT","BT.A.LN","PNT.LN","GB0030913577","GB00B01RM369"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","ISV","TLS","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--BT Group said Tuesday that as at 1300 GMT on Dec. 29, it owned or had received valid acceptances of the offer in respect of a total of 28,647,534 PlusNet shares (96.3%). \u001d  Accordingly, the acceptance condition has been satisfied and the offer is therefore unconditional as to acceptances. \u001d  In addition, the Irish Competition Authority has cleared the proposed acquisition of PlusNet by BT.

Some airlines have found themselves with schedules too tight to load and unload planes without delays, andwith no cushion to catch up. Since mainline airlines typically control the scheduling of their regional partners, the small-jet airlines have been whacked with flight cancellations at hub airports to make room for the mainline airlines' bigger planes when bad weather or construction slow traffic. \u001d  Over the past 10 years, as financially strapped big airlines have turned over more flying to cheaper partners and small jets have become a mainstay for travelers, regional airlines have doubled in size, making them an increasingly important part of travel in the U.S. Many don't just fly to small towns; they fill in airline schedules on routes as big as New York-Chicago and Boston-Washington. But they are increasingly dragging down the nation's air travel. \u001d  \"It never goes good. They are useless,\" said traveler Willy Schmieder, who arrived at the Atlanta airport for a 9 a.m. Atlantic Southeast flight to Wisconsin to visit his parents at the holidays. His flight was delayed multiple times by morning fog, then canceled by a mechanical breakdown. At 5 p.m., he was told to come back the next day. He did, and his flight was only an hour late. \u001d  In the third quarter last year, four of the six airlines with the worst on-time records were regionals. In October, the most recent month reported by the Department of Transportation, the six worst carriers in baggage were all regionals, and six of the seven airlines that canceled flights most frequently were regionals. Comair, owned by Delta Air Lines Inc., dropped to 64.9% on-time from 84.9% a year earlier. American Eagle, owned by AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, canceled flights three times as frequently as its parent airline in October. \u001d  SkyWest Inc.'s Atlantic Southeast Airlines, another Delta feeder, was the worst airline in on-time performance in the third quarter, with only 57% of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule, compared with 66.8% a year earlier. \u001d  Some problems have resulted from unexpected changes -- a faster passenger train at the Dallas airport means passengers can now make connections faster than their bags, resulting in more mishandled baggage for American Eagle, a spokesman said. Also, higher passenger loads and longer flights in small jets mean baggage is more frequently left behind, so the planes, loaded with fuel, aren't overweight. \u001d  Regional airlines say they are scrambling to fix the problems by spreading out schedules and increasing the weight small jets can carry. \u001d  Though operations last year were worse than historical averages, regional carriers say structural differences mean they are unlikely to perform as well as bigger airlines. While bigger airlines fly across the country, regionals are usually confined geographically, operating out of one or two hubs. When bad weather strikes, the carrier's entire operations can be affected. \u001d  In addition, being subservient to a larger airline can hurt. The major carrier can force cancellations at the regional to open takeoff and landing slots for bigger airplanes, so the most passengers get moved. The main airline can also force regional flights to wait for passengers. \u001d  In Atlanta in October, 63.2% of Delta flights arrived on time, but only 52.7% of Atlantic Southeast flights did. In Washington, 83.9% of UAL Corp.'s United Airlines flights arrived on time, but only 71.6% of the flights of its partner, Mesa Airlines Inc., did. Same for American in Chicago, where 62.2% of mainline American flights arrived on time in October, compared with only 57% of Eagle flights. \u001d  Comair, which historically has ranked well in DOT standings, says its problems began last summer with Delta's major expansion at New York's Kennedy Airport. Dropping lots of new Comair flights into JFK, an airport already jammed with JetBlue Airways Corp., a major American operation and the afternoon and evening rush of European flights, meant the time airplanes spent taxiing in a conga line to takeoff increased 50%, said Don Stephens, Comair's vice president of system planning. \u001d  For now, Comair has convinced Delta to space out regional flights more at JFK and add minutes to schedules to more accurately reflect trip times. Comair has also bulked up its crew base at JFK to have more pilots and flight attendants available. \u001d  Atlantic Southeast, at the bottom of on-time performance, says it, too, is increasing staffing to try to improve. It also says it's making cockpit modifications that allow for landing in lower visibility, expanding gate areas, and investing in better hand-held radios and clocks that make it clear how close a flight is to departure for ramp workers. \"We are starting to turn the corner,\" said Anthony DiNota, vice president of Atlantic Southeast's Atlanta operation. \u001d  American Eagle says it tried to cram more flights into its schedule in 2006 so it could grow without buying new aircraft. That meant flying planes more each day and turning them around more quickly between flights. \"In some cases, we stretched too far,\" said spokesman Dave Jackson. \u001d  The airline also ran into a problem with its Embraer 145 jets, which carry 50 passengers.

The following is a summary of the IPO prospectus provided to the SEC: \b \bTHE COMPANY \u001d  NorthStar Natural Gas, based in Houston and founded in May 2005, develops and operates terminals for receiving liquefied natural gas on the U.S. West Coast. \u001d  The company consolidated its liquefied-natural-gas terminal projects in March 2006 to take advantage of project portfolio diversification, economies of scale and greater access to capital. \b \bOFFERING INFORMATION \u001d  NorthStar Natural Gas filed an IPO to sell up to $125 million in common stock, but it didn't detail the terms of the offering. \u001d  The company plans to use the proceeds from the IPO to finance construction of a terminal project and to fund the continued development of its three active proposed liquefied-natural-gas terminals. \u001d  It will also use the money to fund additional projects and for general corporate purposes. \u001d  Citigroup Inc. (C) was listed as the sole underwriter of the IPO. \u001d  NorthStar Natural Gas said it plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol NSNG. \b \bEARNINGS \b \b                    Nine Months Ended Sept. 30 \b \b                             2006 \bLoss from operations      $40,603,069 \bNet income                ($42,834,774) \u001d  Figures in parentheses are losses. \b \bGROWTH STRATEGY \u001d  The company said its strategy is to focus on markets that offer attractive margins to potential suppliers of liquefied natural gas, fewer liquefied-natural-gas terminals and high barriers to entry. \u001d  NorthStar Natural Gas said it is developing terminals on the West Coast to help satisfy substantial demand for natural gas with supplies from the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. Its growth strategy also includes a process for developing cost-effective liquefied-natural-gas terminals in locations that allow for attractive margins. \b \bRISK FACTORS \u001d  The company said it has no operating revenues and negative cash flow. As of Sept. 30, 2006, it had net losses of $42.8 million; it doesn't expect to generate revenue until at least 2010. \u001d  NorthStar Natural Gas is a recently formed development-stage company and hasn't received any permits or approvals necessary to start the construction of any of its planned liquefied-natural-gas terminals. \u001d  The company also said that the proceeds from the IPO aren't sufficient to construct any of its proposed terminals. It needs to obtain additional financing to finish the projects but can't be certain it will be able to. To complete its Bradwood and Clearwater terminals, for instance, it expects costs will reach $1.4 billion, excluding interest and financing fees. \b \bMANAGEMENT \b \bName                             Age     Position \bGerald K.

Soanes                   39      president \b \u001d  Lindner has been a director of the company since its inception and was elected chairman last February. He was chief executive of MP Northwest LLC and is the CEO of KGen Power LLC, an independent power company. \u001d  Garrett was elected CEO last February and was the founder of ESI Holdings L.P., a consulting firm that provides services to companies that develop energy infrastructure, natural gas and liquefied natural gas. He is a co-founder of Organic Fuels LLC, which builds and owns biodiesel production facilities. \u001d  Soanes was elected president last February. He was also a founder of ESI Holdings and Organic Fuels. From 2000 to 2002, Soanes served as the director of business development for CMS Energy, where he was responsible for the business development activities of its natural-gas pipeline. \b \bShareholder                Cmn Shares    Before Offer % \bWilliam S.

Lindner          1,059,837      3.82 \b \bLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \u001d  As stated above, NorthStar Natural Gas has no operating revenues and negative cash flow, had net losses of $42.8 million as of Sept. 30, and doesn't expect to generate revenue 2010. It develops liquified-natural-gas terminals, which require significant amounts of capital and are subject to risks and delays in completion. \u001d  Since Sept. 30, the company has incurred about $20.8 million in development costs for its three terminals.

The FP-1 provides a full color on-screen user interface for managing and controlling an iPod in the home. Unlike typical home iPod docks, which offer very limited benefits when the iPod is removed, the FP-1 provides access to a user's PC- or Mac-based music collection and free Internet radio streams even when the iPod is not docked. Because the FP-1 is truly an Escient FireBall Music Manager (which uses the iPod for local music storage) it integrates seamlessly with other FireBall products in the home, enabling other connected FireBalls to access and play all of the iPod's music, including Apple's FairPlay DRM protected audio files. The FP-1 will be demonstrated next week in Las Vegas at the Aladdin Hotel. \b \u001d  Bill Carson, General Manager of Escient noted: \"The FireBall FP-1 is a ground breaking value-added home entertainment solution that unlocks the power of the Apple iPod experience in the home. We leveraged all of Escient's expertise in media management to create a product that uses the iPod's built-in hard drive as the storage platform and the foundation for a full-fledged networked home entertainment system.\" \b \u001d  What sets the Escient FireBall FP-1 apart from other iPod docking solutions is its ability to integrate music from various physical locations around the home into one unified on-screen user interface. Music from a user's iPod, PC/Mac, and even other networked Escient FireBall products can be integrated into a single music guide. \b \u001d  In addition to these cutting edge features, the FP-1 provides a USB pass-through mode for iPod to PC/Mac syncing and an integrated iPod charging station. It is compatible with iPod Nano, iPod Mini, iPods with color displays, iPods with video, and all current Apple iPod models. \b \u001d  The FireBall FP-1 maintains all of the Escient FireBall features that custom installers and consumers count on for total system control and flexibility, including: two-way RS-232 and Ethernet control, IR inputs, discrete IR remote codes, multiple IR code banks, and built-in software updating over the Internet. \b \b   About Escient \b \u001d  Escient is a division of D&M Holdings U.S., Inc., and is the pioneering leader in the design, development, manufacture, marketing, sales, distribution and support of a groundbreaking category of audio/video products that meld the power of the Internet seamlessly with intuitive home-entertainment devices.

(BOT) said Tuesday in a press release that average daily volume was 2.77 million contracts in December, up 40% over the year earlier period. CBOT also reported that total volume of 805.9 million contracts in 2006 represented a new record for the fifth consecutive year. \u001d  The gains on the year were helped by an increase in the use of e-cbot, the exchange's electronic platform, where average daily volume in 2006 was up 29% over the previous year at 2.24 million contracts. CBOT plans to merge with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the middle of this year, after which point CBOT's electronic products will migrate to Globex, CME's electronic platform. \u001d  CME, a unit of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME) and the largest U.S. futures exchange, will report its December volume later Tuesday. \u001d  The growth of electronic trading was a key driver of trading volume and revenue growth for both exchanges last year and has helped CBOT expand its largest product areas. \u001d  The trend continued in December, when CBOT's financial complex - which includes Treasury futures and options and federal funds futures - posted average daily volume of 2.16 million contracts, up nearly 40% over the previous year. Financial products accounted for nearly 78% of the exchange's average daily volume in December. \u001d  Credit Suisse analyst Howard Chen called CBOT's December volume growth \"impressive\" in a research note and raised his fourth-quarter earnings-per-share estimates for CBOT to $1.03 from a prior estimate of $1. \u001d  Products tied to interest rates also account for the lion's share of volume at CME. Investors use the interest rate contracts to place bets on where interest rates are headed. The Federal Open Market Committee has left the benchmark rate unchanged at its last four policy-setting meetings, but prices in the markets reflect expectations that the Fed will lower rates in the second half of this year. \u001d  Meantime, average daily volume in CBOT's agricultural complex was about 440,200 contracts in December, up nearly 36% from the year-earlier month. \u001d  CBOT launched daytime electronic trading of agricultural contracts in mid-2006, a move that helped fuel the volume expansion, and electronic volume in the product area posted a 10-fold increase in 2006 over the previous year. Volume was also up last year in the trading pits, where the bulk of trading still occurs, climbing 23% to 420,745 contracts from 2005 volume. \u001d  Citing a \"truly historic\" year for CBOT, Chief Executive Bernard Dan said the exchange's new initiatives in its agricultural complex \"contributed to volume growth and expanded the Exchange's global reach.\" \u001d  While metals contracts still represent a tiny portion of trade at CBOT, they also posted major gains. Average daily volume of 52,641 contracts last month was up 332.3% from the year-earlier period. The volume increase was spurred by major gains among gold futures. \u001d  For the fourth quarter, CBOT's average daily volume was 3.27 million contracts, a 36% increase from the previous year. On the year, total average daily volume of 3.21 million contracts represented a 29% gain over 2005. \u001d  At CBOT, the average rate per contract stood at 64.5 cents in the three months ended Nov. 30, up slightly from 63.8 cents in the previous three-month period. The data are reported on a one-month lag. \u001d  -By Jesse Thomas, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4117; Jesse.Thomas@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 11:06 ET (16:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9af5ee45bffa11032f55ff128047cf20","symR":["TMO"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Thermo Fisher Scientific to Present at the 25th Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T15:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TMO"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bThermo Fisher Scientific to Present at the 25th Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference \b \b\b \b   WALTHAM, Mass., Jan. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Thermo Fisher Scientific \bInc.

The company listed assets between $1 million to $100 million and more than $100 million in debt, court papers show. \u001d  The company named Merrill Lynch LP Holdings Inc., owed an estimated $93 million, as its largest unsecured creditor. Merrill Lynch also owns a 20% stake in Ownit Mortgage. \u001d  Other unsecured creditors include Terwin Advisors LLC, which is owed $19 million, and Credit Suisse First Boston, which is owed $12.7 million. \u001d  Ownit Mortgage's Chapter 11 petition didn't include an explanation on why it decided to file for bankruptcy protection and company representatives wasn't available for comment as of Tuesday morning. \u001d  The law firm of Pachulski Stang Ziehl Young Jones & Wein will be representing Ownit Mortgage in the bankruptcy case, which has been assigned to Judge Kathleen Thompson. The case number is 06-12579. \u001d  Ownit Mortgage grew rapidly over the last few years and was the 11th biggest wholesale subprime mortgage lender by new loan volume in the first half of 2006, according to industry newsletter Origination News. \u001d  The Los Angeles Times reported that the company's bankruptcy petition was a response to lawsuits filed by two creditors. \u001d  The filing also serves as a sign of the difficult times facing the the subprime mortgage lending industry, which took a beating when interest rates and home prices rose, the customer base shrunk and competition intensified. \u001d  A rise in defaults didn't help the company either. The percent of subprime mortgages in default rose to 7.74% in August, up from 5.53% in the same period the previous year, according to Reuters. \u001d  -By Kristina Doss, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1344; kristina.doss@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 11:24 ET (16:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9ba15a7f8d22b631db6b4b0b46df71ab","symR":["UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CORRECT: UBS Cooperating With Massachusetts Probe","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XGTI","XNYA","XSMI","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Secretary of State William Galvin said in an interview Tuesday that Switzerland-based UBS AG (UBS) was cooperating with his request for documents that he hopes will show whether hedge funds are paying higher than normal brokerage fees to compensate the investment bank for office space. \u001d  (A story at 11:56 a.m. EST incorrectly reported that Galvin subpoenaed documents from UBS.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:16 ET (20:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9cb36736736ea469229750be712cd53d","symR":["RYI"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Ryerson 9.7% Hldr Harbinger Nominates 7 Directors >RYI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T16:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RYI"],"IndustryCodes":["STL","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 11:58 ET (16:58 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9cc6ab07c29d294052f02df709bc7e3b","symR":["IKNX"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"IKONICS Corp Acquires Image Mate For $380,000 Cash >IKNX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T15:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IKNX"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 10:16 ET (15:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9d303d2c689098a0e07eeef901a31dcd","symR":["RYI"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Harbinger Capital Partners -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T16:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RYI"],"IndustryCodes":["STL","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  The Harbinger Capital Partners investment team located in New York City manages in excess of $5 billion in capital through two complementary strategies.

Under the terms of the agreement, CheckFree will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Carreker common stock at a price of $8.05 per share, for a total purchase price of approximately $206 million on a fully diluted basis. \b \u001d  Through this acquisition, CheckFree will expand its presence in payments processing to play a leading role in providing processing and risk management capabilities for ACH, check and cash. It will also become a leading provider of solutions and expert consultancy for the convergence of check and electronic payments. \b \u001d  Carreker, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a leading provider of payments technology and consulting services for the financial services industry. The company has more than 250 clients in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Continental Europe, South America, and Australia. It reported revenues of $116.6 million in fiscal 2005, which ended January 31, 2006. \b \u001d  CheckFree and Carreker will help drive innovation in the industry using a number of solutions synergies. Carreker complements CheckFree's solutions in delivering fraud management, risk mitigation and operational excellence with a substantial potential return on investment in new technology. In addition to each company's recognized expertise in large-scale system projects and payments application development, the combined company will also be able to leverage Carreker's world-class payments consulting services and revenue enhancement advisory services. \b \u001d  \"This combination will enable financial institutions and corporations to address a range of challenges, from payments convergence and more complex client requirements, to the need for operational efficiency gains and regulatory compliance,\" said Pete Kight, CheckFree Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"In addition, the newly expanded Software unit will have the necessary economies of scale to innovate and support the dramatic transformations underway in financial services.\" \b \u001d  \"This proposed acquisition is the positive outcome of the strategic alternatives review process that has been underway at Carreker for the past year,\" said John D. (Denny) Carreker, Carreker Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Combining our businesses will maximize value for Carreker shareholders while creating a leader in payments processing and risk management capabilities in ACH, check and cash.\" \b \u001d  The proposed acquisition combines CheckFree's leadership in payments processing with Carreker's expertise in check conversion -- the ability to capture and process a digital image of a paper check. As a result, the combined organization will be able to convert paper checks into electronic items at the earliest possible points in the payments process -- whether at the bank branch, corporate back office or lockbox. Having one provider for these and other capabilities will provide strong value to financial institutions and corporate customers. \b \u001d  The transaction also reaffirms CheckFree's commitment to global growth as it significantly deepens CheckFree's relationships with the world's largest financial institutions and further expands CheckFree's global presence into new geographic regions. Together, the combined organization will also serve substantially all of the top 100 U.S. banks, creating additional opportunity for CheckFree's existing solutions. \b \u001d  The proposed acquisition is subject to regulatory review, Carreker shareholder approval, and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close by March 31, 2007. CheckFree will finance the transaction with a combination of existing cash balances and revolving debt, although there are no financing contingencies in the merger agreement. The transaction is expected to be modestly dilutive to CheckFree's underlying earnings per share in the current fiscal year (ending June 30, 2007) and in fiscal 2008, and dilutive to GAAP earnings per share in each of 2007 and 2008. The company plans to share specific financial details when the transaction closes. \b \b    About Carreker  (www.carreker.com) \b \u001d  Carreker Corporation improves earnings for financial institutions around the world. The Company's integrated consulting and software solutions are designed to increase clients' revenues and reduce their expenses, while improving security and increasing the value of their customer relationships. Carreker provides products and services to more than 250 clients in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Clients include the full range of community, regional and large banks, among them more than 75 of the largest 100 banks in the United States. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas since 1978, Carreker Corporation has offices in London and Sydney. \b \b    About CheckFree (www.checkfreecorp.com) \b \u001d  Founded in 1981, CheckFree Corporation (Nasdaq: CKFR) provides financial electronic commerce services and products to organizations around the world. CheckFree Electronic Commerce solutions enable thousands of financial services providers and billers to offer the convenience of receiving and paying their household bills online, via phone in person through retail outlets. CheckFree Investment Services provides a broad range of investment management solutions and outsourced services to thousands of financial services organizations, which manage about $1.5 trillion in assets. CheckFree Software develops, markets and supports payment processing solutions that are used by financial institutions to process more than two-thirds of the 14 billion Automated Clearing House transactions in the United States, and supports reconciliation, exception management, risk management, transaction process management, corporate actions processing and compliance within thousands of organizations worldwide. \b \b    Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information \b \u001d  CheckFree supplements its reporting of total revenues, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share information determined in accordance with GAAP by using \"underlying revenue,\" \"underlying income (loss) from operations,\" \"underlying net income (loss)\" and \"underlying earnings (loss) per share.\" Management believes that certain non-cash adjustments to revenues or expenses enhance its evaluation of CheckFree's performance, and are not pertinent to day-to-day operational decision making in the business. Therefore, CheckFree excludes these items from GAAP revenue, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share in calculating underlying revenue, underlying income (loss) from operations, underlying net income (loss) and underlying earnings (loss) per share. \b \u001d  Examples of such non-cash charges may include, but not be limited to, intangible asset amortization expense and in-process research and development costs associated with acquisitions, charges associated with the impairment of intangible assets, the impact of discontinued operations, charges resulting from warrants issued to third parties, and charges associated with reorganization activities, all offset by the cumulative tax impact of these charges. CheckFree excludes these items in order to more clearly focus on the factors it believes are pertinent to the daily management of its operations, and its management uses underlying results to evaluate the impact of operational business decisions. CheckFree regularly reports underlying results to its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, CheckFree's chief operating decision makers, who use this information in allocating resources to the various business units. Additionally, as CheckFree rewards its management for their decisions that increase revenues and decrease controllable costs, CheckFree uses underlying revenues and underlying income (loss) from operations as factors in determining short-term incentive compensation for management, and uses underlying revenues, underlying net income (loss) and underlying earnings (loss) per share as factors in determining long-term incentive compensation for management. \b \u001d  Because CheckFree utilizes underlying financial results in the management of its business and to determine incentive compensation for management, CheckFree believes this supplemental information is useful to investors for their independent evaluation and understanding of the performance of CheckFree's management and its core business performance. CheckFree's underlying revenues, underlying income (loss) from operations, underlying net income (loss) and underlying earnings (loss) per share should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenues, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss) or earnings (loss) per share or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP. CheckFree's measures of underlying revenues, underlying income (loss) from operations, underlying net income (loss) and underlying earnings (loss) per share reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. \b \b    Additional Information and Where to Find It \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a243dba126aedf21368fd8b33d1e90d0","symR":["PKI"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"PerkinElmer Buys Triton Tech Thermal Analysis Pdt Line","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T14:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PKI"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  PerkinElmer Inc.

The decision by Medicare to change the designation of the code that includes ON-Q (A4306) signifies that Medicare has recognized this therapy to be a payable covered benefit and therefore medically necessary. \b \u001d  \"Medicare's recognition that ON-Q is medically necessary is yet another step towards our goal of establishing ON-Q as the standard of care for post-surgical pain relief,\" commented Donald M. Earhart, I-Flow's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We believe and are excited that the benefits of ON-Q, which include providing significantly better pain relief than narcotics after surgery and significantly reducing the need for narcotics, have been recognized by Medicare. We expect that Medicare's recognition will positively influence private insurance companies to follow suit and, thus, get more patients back to normal faster following their surgery,\" he added. \b \u001d  I-Flow believes there are over 15 million surgeries performed annually in the U.S. where ON-Q can be used to deliver superior outcomes and I-Flow estimates that half are performed on an outpatient basis. To date, ON-Q's market leadership has been propelled by hospital inpatient procedures and I-Flow believes that this decision by Medicare represents a growth opportunity. As a result of Medicare's decision, hospitals will need to list the ON-Q device code and its cost on outpatient claims so that ambulatory payment classification rates can be adjusted accordingly. \b \b   About ON-Q \b \u001d  ON-Q is now labeled to significantly reduce pain better than narcotics and to significantly reduce narcotics intake after surgery. ON-Q is a simple yet elegant device that consists of a small balloon pump that holds a local anesthetic (a pain-numbing medicine) and delivers it automatically through a specially designed catheter to provide even distribution of local anesthetic over a wider area, as compared to other catheters, because of its patented wicking capabilities. \b \u001d  Currently, more than 55 studies on the use of ON-Q have been completed and published or presented and more are underway to demonstrate the benefits of ON-Q in additional areas such as reduced infection risk, combination therapies (e.g., local anesthetic and antibiotic mixtures, a combination of a local anesthetic and an anti-inflammatory), pediatrics and chronic pain. To learn more about the benefits of ON-Q visit www.AskYourSurgeon.com. \b \b   About I-Flow \b \u001d  I-Flow Corporation (www.IFLO.com) designs, develops and markets technically advanced, low cost drug delivery systems and services that are redefining the standard of care by providing life enhancing, cost effective solutions for pain relief. \b \b   \"Safe Harbor\" Statement \b \u001d  Certain disclosures made by the Company in this press release and in other reports and statements released by the Company are and will be forward looking in nature, such as comments that express the Company's opinions about trends and factors that may impact future operating results.

The trial is being conducted by Merck KGaA of Darmstadt, Germany, (\"Merck\") and its U.S. affiliate EMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. under the provision of a collaboration agreement between Biomira and Merck. Biomira is entitled to a milestone payment upon enrollment of the first patient in the Phase III trial, which is anticipated to occur in January 2007. \b \u001d  Enrollment in the trial, which is expected to include more than 1,300 patients in approximately 30 countries, is now open to patients in 12 countries, including the U.S., and will subsequently expand to additional countries. Currently, there are no approved maintenance therapies for patients responding to first-line treatment for unresectable stage III NSCLC. \b \b    About the START Trial \b \u001d  The START trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will evaluate patients with documented unresectable stage III NSCLC who have had a response or stable disease after at least two cycles of platinum based radio-chemotherapy. The study has been designed considering scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency (EMEA/CHMP) and has been agreed upon with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). Data from a randomized phase IIb trial described below encouraged the initiation of the Phase III program. \b \u001d  For more information on the START trial, or to find a participating center and eligibility criteria, log on to www.StimuvaxSTART.com or www.clinicaltrials.gov. \b \b    About Stimuvax \b \u001d  Stimuvax is an innovative cancer vaccine designed to induce an immune response to cancer cells that express MUC1, a protein antigen widely expressed on common cancers. MUC1 is over expressed on many cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Stimuvax is thought to work by stimulating the body's immune system to identify and destroy cancer cells expressing MUC1. \b \u001d  A randomized Phase IIb trial was conducted in 171 patients with stage IIIb and IV NSCLC with response or stable disease after first line therapy. While the overall study results were not statistically significant, in the randomization stratum of patients with stage IIIb locoregional disease, Stimuvax showed a median survival of 30.6 months versus 13.3 months in the control group - an improvement of 17.3 months. In the Phase IIb trial, side effects were primarily limited to mild-to-moderate flu-like symptoms, GI disturbances, and mild injection site reactions. \b \b    About Biomira \b \u001d  Biomira is a biotechnology company specializing in the development of innovative therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer. Biomira's goal is to develop and commercialize novel synthetic vaccines and targeted small molecules that have the potential to improve the lives and outcomes of cancer patients. \b \u001d  This press release contains forward looking statements, including, without limitation, statements related to payments Biomira expects to receive; the therapeutic and commercial potential of Stimuvax and other drug candidates in Biomira's pipeline; future clinical development plans; the details of the clinical trials; and the anticipated future size of the market for Stimuvax.

(GOOG) and Ohio State University. \bOFFERING INFORMATION \u001d  Aruba Networks filed an IPO to sell up to $100 million in common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ARUN. \u001d  Goldman Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and RBC Capital Markets Corp. were listed as underwriters. \u001d  The company plans to use proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes, including expanding its sales and support functions. \u001d  The company also wants to continue to invest in research and development and may use part of the proceeds for acquisitions, although none are planned at this time. \bEARNINGS \b  For the three months ended Oct. 31 \b                            2006                2005 \bRevenue                  $24,505,000        $6,775,000 \bOperating Profit         ($3,668,000)      ($8,557,000) \bNet Profit               ($4,510,000)      ($8,533,000) \bFigures in parentheses are losses. \bBUSINESS STRATEGY \u001d  Aruba Networks wants to increase adoption of its enterprise mobility product, maintain and extend its software offerings, and increase its market penetration and geographic reach though its network of channel partners. \u001d  The company also wants to boost efficiency by growing offshore manufacturing, research and development, and customer support operations and expanding its technology partner base. \bRISK FACTORS \u001d  Aruba Networks works in a rapidly evolving and competitive industry and has limited operating history. The company said this makes it difficult to predict future operating results. \u001d  The company has a history of losses and may not become profitable. It reported net losses of $32.6 million and $12 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2005, and 2006, respectively. \u001d  Aruba Networks has long and unpredictable sales cycles. This could make it difficult to predict sales, the company said. Sales may also vary substantially from quarter to quarter. \u001d  The company outsources product manufacturing to Flextronics International Ltd. (FLEX) plants in China and Singapore. As a result, it can't ensure manufacturing quality control. \u001d  The company's supply to customers could also be disrupted if there are significant changes in Flextronic's financial or business condition. \u001d  Aruba Networks also noted in its prospectus that third parties have asserted and may in future assert claims of intellectual property rights infringement against them or against their customers or channel partners. \u001d  There could be more such infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the market increases and overlaps occur, the company said in its prospectus. \bMANAGEMENT \bName              Age  Position \bDominic Orr       55   President, chief executive and chairman \bSteffan Tomlinson 35   Chief financial officer \u001d  Orr has been Aruba Networks' president and CEO since April 2006 and a director since October 2002. The company paid Orr a $97,885 salary in 2006. \u001d  Orr was president of the content networking business unit at Nortel Networks, a communications equipment company, from October 2000 to October 2001. Orr continued as a Nortel Networks consultant until October 2002. \u001d  Tomlinson has been the company's chief financial officer since September 2005.

Based in Middletown, Conn., the company says its goal last year was to produce more than $12.1 billion in loans, 80% of which would be in the subprime space. MLN, a privately-held company that does business nationwide, says that both its prime and subprime units have stopped funding loans and accepting applications. \u001d  MLN's outside public relations representatives referred inquiries to company executives. MLN officials, including the chief executive and general counsel, didn't respond to phone calls or emails. On Dec. 8, the company posted a note on its Web site saying it continued to operate normally. \u001d  In addition to its mortgage-originating business, MLN also has a big servicing arm with a portfolio topping $14 billion and more than 100,000 accounts, according to the company's Web site. In an email sent late last week to employees and reviewed by Dow Jones Newswires, top MLN executives said the company will continue to collect and service its loan portfolio and also will keep selling loans that have been originated \"over the last few months.\" \u001d  The decision by MLN to stop funding new loans, and to consider alternatives for its wholesale business is the latest sign of an ongoing shakeout in in the subprime mortgage industry, which is getting squeezed by a cooling housing market and rising delinquencies. Late last year, for example, Sebring Capital and Ownit Mortgage Solutions shut down citing unfavorable conditions in the mortgage industry. \u001d  Some subprime issuers recently have faced liquidity crunches as their so-called warehouse lenders withdraw credit lines. MLN's message to employees last week said the company stopped funding loans and accepting new applications \"as a result of unresolved issues with our warehouse banks.\" A recording on an MLN phone system also cited \"warehouse loan issues.\" \u001d  Among MLN's warehouse lenders is GMAC's residential-mortgage arm, ResCap. In mid-December, a ResCap spokesman said that \"We have a relationship with MLN which includes purchases of loans and warehousing. We continue to support MLN through these programs.\" The ResCap spokesman declined to comment on the latest developments at MLN. \u001d  The lack of funding is an ominous sign for MLN. \"Once you say you're not funding any loans any more, the game is over,\" said Brenda B. White, a managing director at Deloitte & Touche Corporate Finance. She noted that employees may quickly start to jump ship. MLN, however, characterized its halt to funding as a suspension, and industry experts said MLN might be able to arrange a new source of short-term capital, allowing it to resume funding loans. \u001d  MLN's exploration of strategic alternatives may indicate that the company is seeking a buyer. Over the past year, several Wall Street firms have snapped up subprime mortgage lenders. By bringing lending capabilities in-house, the investment banks are hoping to lock up a supply of mortgages to better meet investors' growing demand for asset-backed securities. \u001d  -By David Enrich, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2123; david.enrich@dowjones.com \u001d  -By Lingling Wei, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2089; lingling.wei@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:03 ET (20:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a5c3f61c22072cbf6e29043349a1676e","symR":["TRX","TRXB"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Tronox Names David Klvac Controller>TRX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T19:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TRX","TRXB"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 14:30 ET (19:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a5ce3331bb251f4348e33187758ace69","symR":["ACE"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"ACE Unit Names New ACE USA Executive Positions >ACE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T21:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACE"],"IndustryCodes":["INP","INS","XDJGI","XNYA","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  ACE Ltd.'s (ACE) ACE Group of Cos. named Christopher A.

The following is a summary of the IPO prospectus provided to the SEC: \b \bTHE COMPANY \u001d  Pinnacle Gas Resources, based in Sheridan, Wyo., is an independent energy company engaged in acquiring, exploring and developing domestic onshore reserves of natural gas. \u001d  The company is currently developing coalbed methane, or CBM, properties in the Rocky Mountain region. It's a substantial holder of CBM acreage in the Powder River Basin in northeastern Wyoming and southern Montana. On April 20, 2006, the company acquired about 30,000 gross undeveloped acres in the Green River Basin of southern Wyoming. \u001d  As of Sept. 30, the company owned natural-gas and oil leasehold interests in about 452,000 gross acres. \b \bOFFERING INFORMATION \u001d  The company is offering 2.5 million shares of common stock, and the selling stockholders are offering 1.07 million shares. \u001d  Pinnacle Gas Resources didn't provide an estimated price range for the IPO, but it estimates that net proceeds from the sale of the shares offered, after deducting estimated expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions, will be about $31.8 million, assuming an IPO price of $14 a share. \u001d  According to its SEC filing, the company plans to use the net proceeds for accelerated capital expenditures, infrastructure development and general corporate purposes. \u001d  The company said it plans to list its stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol PINN. \u001d  Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., RBC Capital Markets Corp. and Johnson Rice & Co. are listed as underwriters for the offering. \u001d  The selling stockholders have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to buy up to an additional 535,715 shares to cover overallotments. \b \bEARNINGS \b                      Nine Months Ended Sept. 30, \b                         2006             2005 \bRevenue                $15,753,000     $4,433,000 \bOperating income         2,370,000     (4,400,000) \bNet income               3,041,000     (4,358,000) \u001d  Figures in parentheses are losses. \b \bGROWTH STRATEGY \u001d  The company said it intends to accelerate the development of its acreage position by increasing the level of drilling activity. \u001d  The company also intends to maintain operational control over assets and maintain a low-cost, efficient operating environment. \u001d  The company said it also intends to pursue selective acquisitions and explore the potential of its existing reserves. \b \bRISK FACTORS \u001d  About 80% of the company's total proved reserves as of Dec. 31, 2005, consist of undeveloped and developed non-producing reserves, and those reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced. \u001d  The majority of the company's properties are located in a five-county region in the northern end of the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana, making the company vulnerable to risks associated with having its production concentrated in one area. \u001d  The company sells its natural gas to two purchasers - Enserco Energy Inc. and Western Gas Resources Inc. (WGR). The loss of either customer would adversely affect the company's business. \u001d  Pinnacle Gas Resources expects to make substantial capital expenditures in development of natural-gas reserves. Its 2007 total capital expenditure budget for drilling and completion and the construction of related gas and water infrastructure is about $58.2 million. It intends to finance its capital expenditures in the future through cash flow from operations and debt. \b \bMANAGEMENT \b \bName                  Age   Position \bSteven A.

This is over 416,000 more than in 2005. Some 3,957 million customers opted for the SN Brussels Airlines full service offering while Virgin Express low fare flights attracted 1,985 million passengers. \u001d  SN Brussels Airlines saw the number of customers on board its own flights and on flights operated by partner airlines rise from 3,697 to 3,957 million in 2006. Virgin Express low fare tickets were bought by 1,830 million customers in 2005 and by 1,985 million in 2006. \u001d  The growth in passenger numbers was achieved through the introduction of very competitive low fare price actions, optimization of the range of flights and improved use of the two airlines' fleet of aircraft. The efforts not only led to an increase in the number of passengers; the aircraft seat occupancy rate also rose. \u001d  Expansion in 2007 \u001d  On 25 March 2007 SN Brussels Airlines and Virgin Express make way for Brussels Airlines which will launch two new product formulas, the b.flex 'all in' travel solution for time-sensitive business travellers and b.light for people who want to travel on a low fare. \u001d  The low fare offer from EUR49 one way will be offered by Brussels Airlines on 50 European destinations. The first booking results for the new travel formulas are very positive. Brussels Airlines also expects passenger numbers to grow further in 2007. \u001d  Eastern Europe \u001d  The range of flights will be developed further in 2007. Growth plans exist for both the European and intercontinental networks. \u001d  Because Germany has takern over the presidency of the European Union, four daily flights between Brussels and Berlin city airport Tempelhof will be in place from next week. Moreover, the number of flights to Eastern Europe is being increased significantly. Extra daily frequencies will be offered and large aircrafts used on the Brussels-Budapest route from February. The flight frequencies will also be increased on the popular Brussels-Prague connection.

(LEN) Chief Executive Stuart Miller is seeing no signs that the deteriorating home-building market has bottomed, and Lennar expects to take land-related writedowns of between $400 million and $500 million in its fiscal fourth quarter to reflect the weak conditions. \u001d  \"Market conditions continued to weaken throughout  the fourth quarter, and we have not yet seen tangible evidence of a market recovery,\" said Miller, in a statement. \u001d  At the same time, the company slashed its exposure to the troubled California market, where market conditions have been deteriorating at a fast clip. Lennar, along with its partner LNR Property Corp, agreed to sell a 62% stake in their LandSource joint venture, whose primary investment, Newhall Land and Farming, owns 15,000 acres of land in the Santa Clarita Valley of California. Lennar and LNR will each receive $660 million for the stake from the new partner, MW Housing. Lennar will continue to get management fees and retain a 19% stake in the partnership. \u001d  \"I think it sends a signal that they don't want to have their capital at risk in Southern California for the next few years,\" said Raymond James analyst Rick Murray. He sees the sale as a sign that the company doesn't believe that a rebound in California will happen in the near future. \u001d  Murray adds that it is a win-win situation for Lennar. \u001d  \"It looks, on the surface, to be a fantastic deal for Lennar,\" said Murray. \"The company is effectively selling a 62% interest and recovering basically all of the capital that it originally put into the deal when it acquired Newhall.\" As a result, Lennar will continue to hold a 19% interest and collect management fees on the venture \"and have no capital at risk,\" he said. Murray doesn't hold shares in Lennar, and his firm hasn't had an investment-banking relationship with the company in the past year. \u001d  Lennar, based in Miami, also offered its preliminary results for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Nov. 30. \u001d  The builder's orders fell 6% in the latest quarter, which is better than many of its rivals, who have been experiencing declines of 20% to 40%. However, the small order decline reflects aggressive price slashing and incentives, not improved demand. \u001d  Lennar has acknowledged from the start of the housing slowdown that it has resorted to price slashing and other incentives to move sales. It adopted this strategy early on based on its belief that selling homes and maintaining good liquidity was more important than keeping house prices up during the slowdown. \u001d  \"While we are hopeful that low interest rates, strong employment and a healthy economy will help stimulate a recovery in 2007, we have continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet by delivering our backlog, selling inventory aggressively and renegotiating our land positions,\" said Miller. \"We ended the 2006 fiscal year with zero outstanding on our $2.7 billion revolving credit facility and over $600 million of cash on the balance sheet.\" \u001d  The price discounting and incentives took a toll on the company's gross profit margins, which were \"materially lower\" in the quarter, he said. \u001d  Lennar expects to report earnings in the range of 70 cents to 75 cents a share.  However, the company will take a charge in the range of $400 million to $500 million, in land-related writedowns. When this is factored in, the company will post a loss of between 88 cents and $1.28 a share. Thomson First Call currently lists the company's operating earnings, before charges, of $1.07, down 70% from a year earlier. \u001d  -By Janet Morrissey, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2118 \b \u001d  Corrected Jan. 2, 2007 12:35 ET (17:35 GMT)\u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 12:18 ET (17:18 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"acc522ffb4ef4a9296d2d8b5810a7925","symR":["TECD"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Tech Data Corp Completes Sale Of Additional $25 M In 2.75% Convertible Senior Debentures>TECD","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TECD"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","XDJGI","XFFX","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:30 ET (20:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ad345ac5887a7d4e1b0e1ba6ad5f5b2c","symR":["AFL","US0010551028"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Aflac Promotes Paul S.

In the S&P 500/Barra Growth Index, for example, tech stocks reflected almost 26% of its allocation heading into the fourth quarter. \b \u001d  As a result, tech will have to lead the charge for large-cap growth funds in the new year, says Bob Turner, chief investment officer at Turner Investment Partners. \b \u001d  \"The sector really made a comeback in the last three months,\" he said. \"From its lows in mid-July, tech rallied over 30% heading into the end of the year.\" \b \u001d  That came after a broad spring selloff sank shares of many major tech players by 15% or more, Turner adds. \b \u001d  So which path will large-cap growth funds and their tech leaders follow in 2007? \b \u001d  \"We're firm believers that tech and large-cap growth funds are finally positioned for a prolonged rally after six years of underperformance,\" Turner said. \b \u001d  The average technology-sector mutual-fund rose 7.4% in 2006, according to data as of Thursday from fund tracker Lipper Inc. That result kept tech funds in positive territory over the past five years and came on the back of a 6.3% fourth-quarter advance. \b \u001d  More broadly, growth-focused money managers say they see better prospects in 2007 coming from tech as a whole. \b \u001d  Turner enters a new year favoring communications equipment service-providers and equipment makers. \"The consumer is still driving tech,\" he said. \"We've seen a dramatic rise in people being able to download video on all types of devices.\" \b \u001d  One of his firm's largest positions in its growth portfolios for retail and institutional investors is Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO). The shares gained 60% in 2006, in large part from supplying chips that power many consumer electronic devices, Turner points out. \b \u001d  \"Cisco can have four or five more strong quarters going forward,\" Turner said. \"In fact, we see fairly clear sailing through 2007 for Cisco as demand for more bandwidth continues to be a major story.\" \b \b   You And The Tube \b \u001d  New technologies with televisions and computer screens also are expected to spur more consumer activity in 2007. \b \u001d  A flat-screen television, for example, can require anywhere from four to 10 times as many chips to run than a traditional cathode ray tube set. \b \u001d  \"People used to hold onto their TVs for eight to 10 years on average. But now consumers are moving into digital sets and new technologies that require a faster repurchasing cycle,\" said Edmund Harriss, co-manager of the Guinness Atkinson Global Innovators Fund. \b \u001d  It's estimated that in 2006, about 140 million cathode ray tube sets will be sold worldwide, while flat-panel versions will reach 50 million new homes. In 2005, some 150 million cathode ray tube sets and 27 million flat-panel TVs were sold. \b \u001d  \"The balance will continue to shift in 2007,\" Harriss said. \"Many retailers around the world aren't even bothering to market the traditional sets anymore. There's much more revenue potential in the sets made with newer technologies.\" \b \u001d  Another driving force for tech in 2007 figures to be consumers in emerging markets. Harriss notes that in 2006, about 45% of all personal-computer sales came from emerging markets. And 61% of all handset revenue was projected as coming from developing nations. \b \u001d  \"Tech is turning more global, which certainly makes its earnings potential more attractive going forward,\" Harris said. \"In 2007, we're expecting tech companies to be the third-fastest growing sector in Europe. In Asia, tech looks positioned to wind up as the second-fastest growing segment.\" \u001d  -Murray Coleman; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 08:49 ET (13:49 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ae11ca37810fc0c383e4dca77145b559","symR":["LFG"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": LandAmerica Names Andrew S.

But underneath it all, Tom's life was combusting. \b \u001d  The documentary series \"Shooting Sizemore,\" premiering January 7 at 10:30pm, chronicles the harrowing, intimate journey of a talented actor as he attempts to redeem himself and get both his life and career back on track while fighting the demons of his past. \b \u001d  Once at the top of his game, Sizemore's career came to a screeching halt when in a matter of months his methamphetamine and heroin addiction led to his downward spiral.  As a result he lost jobs, went into bankruptcy and lost his home.  Filming from the moment he walks out of rehab and with unlimited access, VH1 follows Tom and his small remaining entourage, including Luree, his jaded but fiercely loyal personal assistant as he tries to put his life back together. \b \u001d  Interspersed in the documentary are pointed flashbacks of Tom's own never- before-seen personal footage spanning the last few years -- filming himself on drugs, succumbing to bouts of terrifying paranoia and rage.  This black-and- white, grainy handheld footage is a searing and honest look into Tom Sizemore's innermost thoughts and fears. \b \u001d  As each setback and challenge unfolds onscreen, viewers will come to know a man who has a forceful determination to live again.  He is a man on a mission to be accepted by his peers while he attempts to climb back to the upper echelon of his craft and most importantly to remain a committed father to his twin children. \b \u001d  \"Shooting Sizemore\" is a production of VH1 in conjunction with Tijuana Entertainment.  Troy Searer and John Foy serve as Executive Producers for Tijuana.  Jeff Olde, Jill Holmes, Damla Dogan, Stella Stolper and Alex Demyanenko are Executive Producers for VH1 with Michael Hirschorn also serving as Executive Producer. \b \u001d  VH1 connects viewers to the music, artists and pop culture that matter to them most with series, specials, live events, exclusive online content and public affairs initiatives. VH1 is available in 90 million households in the U.S.  VH1 also has an array of digital services including VH1 Classic, VH1 Soul and VSPOT, VH1's broadband channel.

(5401.TO) will aim to become bigger, and taking over other steelmakers in order to achieve that goal is an option, President Akio Mimura told The Nikkei in an interview published in Wednesday's edition. \u001d  The global steelmaking industry is now seeing violent change. The world's largest steelmaker, Arcelor Mittal (MT), continues its offensive, having moved to acquire a major Mexican firm. \u001d  In May, a new tax code will permit triangle mergers, making it easier for foreign companies to acquire Japanese firms. The Nikkei asked Mimura, who has been scrambling to bolster alliances with domestic and foreign steelmakers, about how Nippon Steel will respond. \u001d  Mimura said \"the birth of Arcelor Mittal was a major factor\" in Nippon Steel's calling for output of more than 40 million tons a year of mainly high-grade steel. \u001d  \"Mittal produces 110 million tons of crude steel per year, which is about triple our output. It has cash flow of more than Y1 trillion, and it has made clear its strategy to take over other steelmakers. \u001d  \"In addition, the Chinese government is trying to create a steelmaker with annual crude steel output of 30 million-50 million tons. Because our clients, Japanese automakers, are boosting output across the world, we will also shift to a growth strategy. \u001d  \"We seek not only to become the No. 1 maker of high-grade steel, but to become bigger as well. \u001d  \"One part of this strategy is our expanded investment in Usiminas (Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA, USIM5.BR), Brazil's largest steelmaker. We will provide the latest automotive steel sheet technologies, as well as cooperate in Usiminas' feasibility study for constructing an integrated steelworks locally,\" he said. \u001d  When asked to comment on Nippon Steel accelerating the formation of loose partnerships by increasing its stakes in Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405.TO), Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406.TO) and South Korea's Posco (PKX), Mimura said: \"Bolstering partnerships can also be said to be part of measures to expand scale. If Nippon Steel and Posco can supply semi-finished products to each other, then that will result in higher output capacity because we can avoid downtime when facilities are shut down for maintenance. \u001d  \"Last November, we raised Y300 billion by issuing convertible bonds, and about 80% of that amount will be used to strengthen alliances and for capital investment,\" he said. \u001d  When asked to comment about mergers and acquisitions being an effective method for expanding scale, Mimura said: \"an increasing number of business managers see M&As as an option in Japan as well. Since becoming president about three-and-a-half years ago, on average about four firms have been removed from or added to our consolidated earnings every month. I believe that it is natural for M&As to be used as a means for achieving growth. \u001d  \"While we don't have any specific plans, I believe that friendly takeovers are an option. However, because stock prices of steelmakers are high across the world, three conditions need to be met before a takeover is attempted: cost, technology and the direction of management,\" he said. \u001d  When asked about where the realignment in the steelmaking industry going, Mimura said: \"Interest rates are low globally. Some have estimated that hedge funds have Y200 trillion in funds, and it was proved in 2006 that M&As are profit opportunities for them. There is growing enthusiasm to invest in globally competitive firms, not just steelmakers. So M&As can be expected to continue. \u001d  \"When triangle mergers are allowed, foreign firms will have more freedom in M&As. In the U.S., the shares of firms that are not listed there effectively cannot be used as payment for mergers. And in Europe, there are many restrictions, such as a ban on two-tier takeover bids. \u001d  \"In Japan, there are many loopholes, so some rules should be introduced. We are at a point in time where we must think from the viewpoint of international competition, such as antitrust law recognizing East Asia as a single market,\" he said. \u001d  Mimura also told The Nikkei that Nippon Steel still needs to do a lot more preparation in terms of warding off any hostile takeover attempts. \u001d  \"When a firm is caught in a hostile takeover attempt, the management team has no choice but to spend most of its time on countermeasures,\" he said. \u001d  \"However, we will not take exclusively defensive steps, but we will seek scale and profit as well. We will run after two hares or even three,\" he said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:39 ET (21:39 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b4eba6970257b9616bf87be6ccc3817b","symR":["HSIC"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Henry Schein Expects To Distribute 20M Doses Of Flu Vaccine In '07","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T12:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HSIC"],"IndustryCodes":["MDS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 07:02 ET (12:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b5b11cdc861a751f3b216a9d0e014859","symR":["0386.HK","600028.SH","SNP","CN0005789556","CN0007637712"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"China Sinopec Group: Record High Revenue In 06; Eyes M&As","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T10:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0386.HK","600028.SH","SNP","CN0005789556","CN0007637712"],"IndustryCodes":["GAS","OIL","OIS","XATI","XDJGI","XHSG","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  HONG KONG (Dow Jones)--China Petrochemical Corp., also known as Sinopec Group, said its revenue hit a record high in 2006, as it produced more crude oil, gas and petrochemical products to meet strong demand resulting from the country's booming economy. \u001d  While President Chen Tonghai didn't give a figure for the company's 2006 revenue, he said it will step up efforts to acquire more oil and gas fields in China and overseas, according to a posting on the group's Web site. \u001d  \"We will focus on acquiring quality oil and gas fields or companies, and will also aggressively bid for exploration projects in oil-rich regions,\" Chen was quoted as saying at a company meeting on Thursday. \u001d  \"Searching for new strategic resources will still be our top priority,\" Chen said. \u001d  The company, China's second-largest oil company by assets after China National Petroleum Corp., said earlier it intends to boost upstream output by 30% by 2010 as part of its five-year plan. \u001d  Chen said because Sinopec expects oil prices to remain high this year, the company has been expanding its upstream segment at a faster rate than its downstream operations. This can help contain costs, as the company can supply feedstock to its own refineries at a cheaper rate than if it buys crude oil on the international market. \u001d  According to Chen, Sinopec Group produced more than 40 million metric tons of crude and more than 7 billion cubic meters of gas last year, based on unaudited numbers. He didn't give comparison figures. \u001d  He also said the group added 45 million tons of new proven crude oil reserves and 73.9 billion cubic meters of gas. The group's oil and gas reserves totaled 7.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2005. \u001d  Chen said the current geographical spread of Sinopec Group's overseas upstream assets \"is becoming more rational.\" For 2006, he expects 4.5 million tons, or 11% of total crude output came from abroad, about 1.2 times the level for the previous year. \u001d  Some high-profile acquisitions last year include its teaming up with Russian state oil company Rosneft in June to buy Udmurtneft A.O. from Anglo-Russian oil producer TNK-BP Holdings. The deal came shortly after the company paid US$692.2 million for stakes in three deepwater oil blocks in Angola. \u001d  Earlier this year, Sinopec discovered the Puguang gas field in China's Sichuan province, China's largest gas field to date with proven recoverable reserves of more than 250 billion cubic meters. \u001d  In 2005, Sinopec Group's pretax profit was CNY55.2 billion, up from CNY43.2 billion.  The company says it expects by 2010, its \"realized profit\" will top CNY100 billion. \b \u001d  Downstream Loss; Demand Growth Slows \b \u001d  Apart from high crude costs and low product prices, Sinopec Group's downstream operations will also face other challenges next year, Chen said. \u001d  \"Growth in domestic consumption of crude-based petrochemical products is slowing down, while new supply from the Middle East, particularly of ethylene and related products, is speeding up,\" he said. \u001d  \"Domestic coal-to-chemicals and other alternative energy projects are developing at quite a fast pace. These factors will all put pressure on domestic petrochemical producers.\" \u001d  For 2006, the group's refineries in the Pearl River Delta region should post the highest growth in new capacity, compared with its other refineries in the Yangtze River Delta region and northeastern Bohai Bay area, Chen said. \u001d  Annual production capacity of ethylene in the Pearl River Delta region grew by 64 tons in 2006, Chen said, without giving comparison figures. \u001d  The increase came from an upgrade of an ethylene plant in Maoming city and the opening of a refinery in Hainan, which has an annual processing capacity of 8 million tons. \u001d  Chen added that by 2009, one of its units, Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Co., will have an annual processing capacity of 20 million tons of crude and an annual ethylene production capacity of 1 million tons. Zhenhai is now the largest ethylene producer in China by capacity. \u001d  The company said earlier it plans to invest CNY53.7 billion to build ethylene plants in Tianjin, Zhenhai, and Guangzhou, and a xylene plant in Nanjing. \u001d  Sinopec Group said earlier it expects its crude oil processing capacity to reach 200 million tons by the end of the decade, up about 16% from 172 million tons in 2005. \u001d  Due to high international crude prices and low domestic oil product prices, its listed arm China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, recorded a refining loss of CNY29.19 billion for the first nine months of 2006. \u001d  Sinopec said its refineries will still post a refining loss for 2006, though part of the loss was mitigated by a subsidy of CNY5 billion given by the government late last year. \b \u001d  -By Aries Poon, Dow Jones Newswires; 852-2832-2332; aries.poon@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 05:45 ET (10:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b5bcf22260e48596f3f1352ea0ea994e","symR":["PVH"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Phillips-Van Heusen Closes $110M Deal For Superba Assets","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T18:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PVH"],"IndustryCodes":["CLO","TEX","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Phillips-Van Heusen Corp.

(MIR), USG Corp. (USG) and Riverstone Technologies Inc. (RSTNE) when those companies completed their Chapter 11 reorganizations. \u001d  This year, the will be even more to be made. By some estimates, the group of hedge-fund and private-equity investors that have offered to put up to $3.4 billion into Delphi Corp. (DPHIQ) could make a fat profit instantly if the deal wins court approval. \u001d  Those investors include three of Delphi's biggest shareholders -- Appaloosa Management, Harbinger Capital Partners and Cerberus Capital Management. Their immediate payoff, according to a rival bidder for the company, could amount to $1 billion. \u001d  That rival bidder, Highland Capital Management, is itself looking at a nice profit. The Texas hedge fund, which owns about 8% of Delphi's stock, has already seen the value of its shares in the company increase by at least 50%, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Delphi's stock was trading at $3.78 a share late last week. \u001d          Interest in Bankrupt Companies Is A \"Gigantic Change\" \u001d  The idea that big institutions are actually buying the stock of bankrupt companies, let alone stepping up with more cash, is astounding to veteran bankruptcy practitioners. Chapter 11 usually ends with shareholders out in the cold and companies in the hands of creditors. \u001d  \"It's a gigantic change. People are a lot more interested. Ten years ago no one was touching the equity,\" said Lawrence Gottlieb, a New York bankruptcy lawyer who represented shareholders in the bankruptcies of Seitel Inc. (SELA) and Peregrine Systems Inc. (PRGN) \u001d  Perry Mandarino, a financial adviser to troubled companies, said the stock-buying is driven in part by the increasing efficiency in the debt market. Debt is traded mostly by sophisticated players skilled at handicapping the outcome of Chapter 11 cases. \u001d  Stock analysts, by contrast, give up once a company plunges into bankruptcy. That leaves the field open mainly to big investors, who have their own capacity to assess the true value of Chapter 11 companies. Mandarino said the possibility of \"phenomenal returns\" on stock relative to returns on debt may be driving the surge in stock-buying by big investors. \u001d  For all the success big investors are having, Chapter 11 is still not safe territory for mom-and-pop shareholders, bankruptcy professionals say. High risk is built into the business plan for the big investors -- including hedge funds and private-equity firms -- that are snapping up bankrupt companies' stock. \u001d  \"If you look at the people who are going in at an equity level, by and large they are the experienced funds,\" Gottlieb said. \"Why are they doing that? Number one, they can buy the equity really cheap. It's a game of 'What the hell, maybe we can get something out of it.'\" Mandarino said the big investors in stocks also tend to be experienced risk-takers. \"Some of these funds manage billions of dollars,\" he said. \"They don't have the success they've had because they're meek or risk-averse.\" \u001d  Buying stock can also be a cheap way for big debt holders to make sure that small shareholders don't get out of line and start banging the table for more in a bankruptcy, Gottlieb said. \u001d  As long as they're not members of an official committee, big shareholders who are also big debt holders are free to take care of their own interests, without worrying about rank-and-file shareholders. Last year, Foamex International Inc.'s (FMXIQ) stock rose sharply -- to the benefit of four big shareholders who gained a majority stake in the company during its bankruptcy reorganization. Some of the four -- D.E. Shaw Laminar Portfolios LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co., Sigma Capital Associates LLC and Par IV Master Fund -- bought the stock when it was trading for less than a dime. Foamex stock now sells for nearly $6 a share. \u001d      Rights Offering Should Boost Stake Of Foamex's 'Big Four' \u001d  While the stock boomed, DE Shaw, Goldman Sachs, Sigma and Par IV parlayed their cheap shares into a seat at the Chapter 11 bargaining table. There Foamex reworked a reorganization plan that had called for creditors to end up in control of the company. The reworked plan put the big shareholders in charge. \u001d  That's thanks in part to a $150 million equity rights offering that is expected to boost the majority stake held by Foamex's big four considerably. Two of Foamex's biggest shareholders, DE Shaw and Goldman Sachs, are also big creditors. Some of the $150 million equity rights offering, for which they get a share of a $12 million fee, is headed right back into their pockets as payment for the debt they own. \u001d  \"If you're a fund and what you're really in it for is to loan-to-own, having some equity so that you can control the equity and it doesn't become an issue for you to contend with, there's value in that,\" Gottlieb said. \u001d  Small shareholders, however, aren't entirely powerless in the presence of big players. In the Chapter 11 case of Mirant, the company's creditors almost got away with $600 million in value in excess of what the company owed them, according to the calculations of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge D. Michael Lynn, who presided over the case. \u001d  They didn't, thanks largely to an official committee of shareholders holders -- mostly individual shareholders with a fervent belief that Mirant was worth more than creditors said it was. The shareholders conferred in Web chat rooms and mounted an effort to rein in the creditors. \u001d  \"They did a hell of a job for a group of people who weren't funded to take that kind of job on, and not schooled in the ways of Chapter 11,\" said Edward Weisfelner, the attorney who represented Mirant's official committee of shareholders. \u001d  Mirant's shareholders went toe-to-toe with big bondholders in a prolonged court fight that ran up hundreds of millions in professional fees and ended in a negotiated settlement that left shareholders with stock worth an estimated $1.45 a share. That was up from pennies at the time of Mirant's bankruptcy filing in 2003. \u001d  Still, no such fight is taking place in the Chapter 11 cases of Delphi and Foamex, where big investors ready to throw more money on the table have set creditors' minds at ease. \u001d  \"People step up to do a rights offering when they believe in the future of the company, and when they have the cash available,\" Weisfelner said. \"That sort of distinguishes the institutional investor cases from the mom-and-pop shareholders, who don't have millions to participate in the rights offering.\" \u001d  -Peg Brickley, Dow Jones Newswires; 302-656-8830; peg.brickley@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 11:26 ET (16:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b8aa8e2db1ee008aadf994278f831b04","symR":["TSK.T","CA9008911021"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": TUSK Energy Corporation: Zenas Plan Of Arrangement Effective>TSK.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T18:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TSK.T","CA9008911021"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS"],"Story":"\b   CALGARY, ALBERTA--(CCNMatthews - Jan. 2, 2007) - \bTUSK Energy Corporation (TSX:TSK) (\"TUSK\") is pleased to announce that the previously announced (November 13th and December 22nd) plan of arrangement with Zenas Energy Corp.

The AMPS are used with the intent of enhancing returns by borrowing at U.S. interest rates and investing the proceeds in relatively higher yielding global fixed-income securities.  In order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in U.S. interest rates on the costs associated with the AMPS, the Fund has entered into an interest rate swap agreement, enabling the Fund to lock in fixed interest rates for 80% of the outstanding AMPS.  Details regarding this interest rate swap agreement are contained in the Fund's annual report to shareholders. \b \u001d  There can be no assurance that the Fund will have an interest rate swap in place at any given time nor can there be any assurance that, if an interest rate swap is in place, it will be successful in hedging the Fund's interest rate risk with respect to the AMPS. The implementation of this strategy is at the discretion of the AMPS Hedging Committee of the Fund's Board of Directors. \b \b    Important Information \b \u001d  Aberdeen Asset Management Inc., the Fund's Administrator, has prepared this report based on information sources believed to be accurate and reliable.

Further, business surveys are pointing to more robust trading conditions in the euro zone than in North America. International equity flows are probably favouring the euro over the US dollar. \u001d  At the same time, central banks around the world say they intend to diversify their foreign exchange reserves. Since central banks are currently holding more than twice as many dollars as euros, reserve diversification seems a major plus point for the euro. As banks and other currency market participants seek to position themselves for 2007, it is not surprising the euro should seem to them the safest bet. \u001d  Even so, euro strength is unlikely to extend far into 2007. \u001d  The IMF published fresh data on 29 December relating to the currency composition of central banks' reserves.  These showed that, at the end of 2006Q3, 65% of the reserves which the IMF could allocate to a specific currency were held in US dollars, with only 25% held in euros.  For central banks in industrial countries, the imbalance was even more extreme; 73% was in US dollars and 20% in euros. \u001d  Despite talk over the past two years of central banks switching reserves from dollars to euros, the US dollar's preponderance in 2006Q3 was, apparently, hardly less than at the end of 2004.  At that earlier date, the US dollar had accounted for 66% of total identified reserves while the euro proportion was 25%. \u001d  There is a puzzle here.  If central banks are diversifying their reserves, why are these proportions so stable? \u001d  Perhaps the answer lies in the data for developing countries' central banks, which include the figures for major reserve holders such as China, Russia and the oil-producing states. The reserves of these developing countries' central banks made up, in 2006Q3, 72% of aggregate global reserves.  Regarding these reserves, however, the IMF has been able to allocate to specific currencies only 53% of the total. From the end of 2004 to 2006Q3, the unallocated reserves of developing countries' central banks grew by 44%, equivalent to $484bn worth. Some of this increase may, in fact, have been in euro holdings. \u001d  Though the IMF data may, thus, be of limited value as a guide to reserve changes, the latest numbers do pick out some notable trends. The proportion of identified global reserves held in sterling continued to rise, reaching 4.3% as compared with 3.4% at end-2004. The Japanese yen, by contrast, was out of favour, with its share dropping from 3.9% at end-2004 to 3.2% by 2006Q3. \u001d  It appears central banks are not diversifying in mechanical fashion. They are looking at currencies other than the euro when seeking an alternative to the US dollar but are steering clear of those, like the yen, which seem to have negative fundamentals. The conclusion seems to be that central banks will build up euro holdings as long as they see independent factors to support the euro but will halt or reverse this process if the euro begins to look less well underpinned. \u001d  Economic fundamentals currently favour the euro but threats to the euro zone's economic stability are already on the horizon.  Chief among these is the divergence in economic performance between Germany and some other member-states and, in particular, France. \u001d  We identified this flaw in the euro's structure in our Economic Insights No 2649. Since then, the release of December purchasing managers surveys for manufacturing has underlined the point. The German composite index rose to a six-month 'high', whereas the French composite measure sank to a level not seen since last February. \u001d  The French business slowdown is occurring at an awkward time, only months ahead of a presidential election. French politicians have been railing against the euro's appreciation and the ECB's interest rate stance, while demanding more political input into euro zone financial policies. Though their complaints have met a sharp rebuff from German policymakers, they seem to have played well with the French electorate. \u001d  There will be no quick fixes for the French economy; it took several years of painful restructuring to lay the groundwork for corporate Germany's latest successes. Consequently, as the French economy continues to languish relative to the neighbouring German powerhouse, France's leaders are likely to become ever louder in their calls for reforms aimed at weakening the euro. Economic and political tensions within the euro zone are set to rise as the French election approaches. Even if the ECB stands firm and delivers the interest rate increases that the foreign exchanges are currently discounting, the howls of protest from Paris will draw attention to weaknesses in the euro zone economy, with potentially negative implications for the euro currency. \u001d  In any event, the US current account deficit is expected to turn the corner in 2007. The primary influence on the US trade balance is the USA's growth in domestic demand relative to the rest of the world. This has slowed dramatically since the end of 2006Q1. US final sales to domestic purchasers, the appropriate measure, grew in real terms by 4.0% in 2004 and by 3.6% in 2005 but by only 1.8% on average in 2006Q2-Q3.  The US domestic growth rate is now far below the IMF's projection of 4%-plus growth in global demand.  Weak US housing and slowing business investment are likely to keep overall domestic demand subdued in 2007. Against this background, the US current account should begin to improve. This is likely to bring a turn for the better in sentiment towards the US dollar. \b \u001d  -By Stephen Lewis: (+44) 20 7190 7193; sjlewis@insinger.com \u001d  (Stephen Lewis is chief economist at Insinger de Beaufort Ltd., London, independent brokers specializing in institutional business.) \u001d  Opinions expressed are those of the author, and not of Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  This column is published for information only, and it neither constitutes, nor is to be construed as, an offer to buy or sell investments.

(Dow Jones)--Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) has been on a tear in recent months as network operators have increased their spending on new equipment, but topping these better results may not be easy as 2007 unfolds. \u001d  Telecos, cable companies and corporations that put off network upgrades since the lean years of the downturn have begun buying gear at a faster pace in recent quarters, adding capacity and preparing their networks for new demands, such as the expected crush of video on the Internet. Cisco, which supplies switches and routers that manage online traffic, saw its revenue rise 25% in its fiscal first quarter ended in October, or 16% excluding the $6.9 billion purchase last February of Scientific-Atlanta. It was the fastest growth in several years. \u001d  Cisco's stock has taken off as well, rising nearly 60% to $27.42 from $17.29 since late summer. \u001d  Expectations for the company, however, have grown, and there are signs key markets will show steady but not accelerating growth in the coming year. Investors who considered the San Jose-based vendor a 10% grower this summer now expect 15% or so. Keeping up the sales pace will be a big job for a company with $28.5 billion in annual sales despite the strong demand many see for networking equipment. \u001d  Cisco is a name synonymous with the high-tech bubble of 1999 and 2000. When traffic on the Internet jumped, network-service providers raced to build their online on ramps and the high-capacity network arteries that carry email and Web pages. When the equipment buying came to a  halt in 2001, so did Cisco's status as a growth company. The better results of the past couple quarters have brought the growth stock label back into vogue. \u001d  Cisco has become bullish on its prospects. \"You're now going to see us get more aggressive and more bold,\" Chief Executive John Chambers told analysts earlier this month at the company's C-Scape 2006 conference. \"We think the opportunity to be the major company in communications and IT is in front of us. We are very optimistic about the future.\" \u001d  During his address, Chambers said the markets Cisco serves are changing and accelerating faster than many people realize. To take advantage, Cisco has made product bets in key categories such as edge routing and Internet telephony. \b \b   Betting On Flagship Router \b \u001d  One bet is its latest flagship router - the CRS-1 - which recently emerged from a lengthy shakedown period during which service providers tested it and software bugs were repaired. Many of these customers have begun ordering the boxes, which can cost $1 million or more, leading order growth to surge over 500% in the first quarter. \u001d  Among the important trends Cisco sees taking place is the so-called \"quadruple play,\" preparing networks to carry voice, video, data and link to mobile users with all sorts of devices. Service providers are moving in this direction as they anticipate the traffic onslaught of video and consolidate voice communications, video, data and in some cases high-definition television onto IP, or Internet protocol, networks. \u001d  At AT&T Inc. (T), for instance, \"we're seeing a growing amount of traffic (and) we're operating on the assumption this is going to continue,\" says Jason Hillery, a spokesman. \"There's been a good amount of (network expansion) activity this year.\" \u001d  To handle the demands of television and other services, \"we're seeing a consolidation where all services are moving to IP\" for efficiency, says Hillery. AT&T plans to shortly kick off a substantial upgrade to its network \"core\" with a new, faster 40 gigabits-per-second technology to quadruple capacity - an opportunity for the CRS-1. Product vendors have not been announced. \u001d  Corporations likewise are beginning to spend more freely on network equipment, creating a \"$20 billion refresh cycle that we are just starting,\" says Nick Lippis, publisher of the Lippis Report, an industry newsletter. Along with looking at steering phone service over IP networks, companies are implementing a technology called power over ethernet, where networking devices transport not only data feeds but electrical power to simplify a building's wiring and to bring power to IP phones. Businesses are similarly consolidating data centers for efficiency and connecting them to higher speed networks. \u001d  The new demands play to Cisco's strengths in switches for corporations and routers for service providers. \u001d  \"There are more opportunities for the company than a year ago,\" says Mark Sue, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \"We consider Cisco a large-cap stock in a growth cycle.\" \u001d  Sue, who doesn't own stock in the company and whose firm doesn't conducting banking for Cisco, says he believes the company can grow at 15%, and he has a 12-month price target of $28, not far from where the stock trades now. \b \b   Higher Price Targets \b \u001d  Some investors suggest price targets will rise in coming quarters as Cisco increases its earnings. \u001d  \"You can make an argument they are not that expensive based on their growth rate,\" says Douglas Whitman, president of Whitman Capital LLC of Menlo Park, Calif. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.8, the shares are relatively less expensive than those of Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR) with a P/E of 32.4 and Extreme Networks Inc. (EXTR) with a P/E of 47.9. \u001d  Growth in some important Cisco markets, however, could moderate in 2007, making it difficult for the company to accelerate sales. In switching, Cisco's largest business, 2006 has been a solid year with world-wide sales growth of an estimated 10%, a slight boost from the 8% last year, according to Dell'Oro Group Inc. of Redwood City, Calif. Growth should temper slightly in 2007, to a 7% to 8% pace. \u001d  Cisco has benefited in the market by taking share from competitors such as 3Com Corp. (COMS) and Nortel Networks Corp. (NT), ending September with 72.8% of the market, up from just over 70% at the start of the year, says research firm Dell'Oro. The market-share gains should continue, says Cisco senior vice president Ian Pennell. \u001d  But a similar challenge could face the company in routing. The core router market should see global growth of 17% this year. Next year's expansion should be between 10% to 15%, says Dell'Oro. The market for edge routers - products from companies such as Juniper, Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) and Redback Networks Inc. (RBAK) that sit at the periphery of a network and regulate traffic to homes and businesses - should grow 32% this year and anywhere from 25% to 35% next year. Redback last week agreed to be sold to LM Ericsson Telephone Co. (ERIC). \u001d  Cisco has gained share in both markets, grabbing 58.6% of the core routing market as of September, up from 54.1% in March, while Juniper's share slipped to 31.9% from 36.9%, says Shin Umeda, vice president at Dell'Oro. \u001d  But rivals predict the gains won't continue. \"Right now Cisco has a newer product in the (core) market place,\" says Shailesh Shukla, a vice president at Juniper. \"Every new product gets some noise. This is not a sustainable thing.\" \u001d  (Mark Boslet is a special writer covering technology for Dow Jones Newswires.) \u001d  -By Mark Boslet, Dow Jones Newswires; 650-496-1366; mark.boslet@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf6797a3f4ec936f5edbbcb2b802f0f0","symR":["NBL"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Webcast Alert: Noble Energy, Inc.

Attorneys are seeking a class action certification for the case. \u001d  \"We're alleging that both ABB and Fidelity are fiduciary and that excessive fees were charged to the plan and participants,\" said Jerome J. Schlichter, an attorney at Schlichter Bogard & Denton in St. Louis. \u001d  The firm has filed about a dozen similar suits since last fall against several major U.S. companies, including Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT), General Dynamics Corp. (GD) and International Paper Co. (IP). \u001d  The suits contend that the 401(k) fees and expenses paid by the plans - and borne by employees - are too high and that the companies didn't disclose them properly. \u001d  At issue are rules under the Employee Retirement Income Act of 1974, a federal law that sets standards for private pension plans. ERISA requires that pension fees be reasonable and fully disclosed, and that they be charged solely for the benefit of the people in them. \u001d  \"We disagree with many of the factual and legal assertions in the complaint, and we intend to defend the suit vigorously,\" said Vin Loporchio, a spokesman for Fidelity Investments. \u001d  He said the company does not comment on litigation or specific fee arrangements with clients, but \"we believe that we provide valuable services to 401(k) clients for whom Fidelity serves as a record keeper and a trustee.\" \u001d  \"ABB is aware of this complaint,\" said Ron Kurtz, a spokesman for ABB Inc., which has about 107,000 employees worldwide, including 8,500 in the U.S. \"As this matter is now in litigation, I prefer not to comment at this time.\" \u001d  ABB manufactures equipment needed for the transmission and distribution of electric power; it also designs and develops automation technologies for industry. ABB Inc. is the U.S. unit of ABB Ltd. (ABB). \u001d  Many in the pension industry expect additional lawsuits against employers and 401(k) providers as the importance and availability of the retirement plans grows. \u001d  A recent Government Accountability Office report recommended that Congress amend rules governing 401(k) plans because the \"piecemeal\" disclosure of fees is hurting investors. \u001d  -By Jilian Mincer, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4042; jilian.mincer@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 14:06 ET (19:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bfd0cfcff8b65627df081b80e1bcae01","symR":["UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Mass.

The space comes with receptionists, espresso machines and consultants to manage information systems, the Times said. \u001d  The Times said UBS leases 400,000 square feet of space to hedge funds in a number of cities - a potential enticement to win more trading business from the hedge funds. \u001d  McNiff said Galvin's investigation involved only lease agreements in Massachusetts. \u001d  Hedge funds are an increasingly popular form of investing that operate under minimal government supervision but have recently come under greater scrutiny. U.S. hedge funds traditionally have catered to the rich, as well as pension funds and university endowments, but are increasingly luring less wealthy investors. \u001d  Unlike mutual funds, which generally hold stocks and bonds, hedge funds can invest in anything from commodities to real estate. Some funds even buy whole companies, while others buy and sell stocks like day traders - but with billions of dollars at stake. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 11:56 ET (16:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bfd5450bc458d9ce4e4bfaf0dd3d9ea6","symR":["CKNN"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Cash Systems, Inc.

They said they would fight the ban in court when it goes into effect. \u001d  Why did the casinos need extra time to remove ashtrays from gambling areas? I could see the casinos getting extra time if a law was passed to mandate smoking and they had to go out and buy ash trays. \b \u001d  KNOCK, KNOCK. \u001d  \"Yes?\" \u001d  \"Mr. Murphy, this is officer Hanratty of the Jersey City Environmental Squad. The city has banned wood-pulping machines in apartments effective today. But we're going to give you an extra week to get the machine out of your apartment.\" \u001d  \"But, Officer Hanratty, I don't have a wood-pulping machine in my apartment.\" \u001d  \"Very well then, Mr. Murphy. We'll give you a week to get one so you'll have something to remove.\" \u001d  Also, what special grounds can the casinos have for getting the smoking ban overturned when already it's state law in New Jersey bars, restaurants and bowling alleys? \b \u001d  \"You don't understand, Your Honor. The pressure of squandering mortgage money and money for the kids' education puts enormous weight on the shoulders of casino gamblers, which can only be alleviated by lighting up one cigarette after the other.\" \b \u001d  Ruthie and I have not smoked for more than three and one-half years so we don't personally care what the casinos do or get away with not doing when we make our bimonthly excursions to Atlantic City. \b \u001d  Me & Shep \b \u001d  When I was in the Drama Society at Holy Cross College, I landed the smallest part in the \"Fantasticks,\" which was \"The Man Who Dies.\" I had a total of five lines which were spoken in a single burst. \u001d  Paul Freeman, a classmate who was doing the \"Playbill\" for the performance began my brief bio with \"This mercurial meteorite...\" \u001d  This did not sit well with at least one other cast member who wondered how he was the co-star and I had five lines and yet I, not he, was \"this mercurial meteorite.\" \u001d  He hadn't figured out yet, as Paul and I had, that most of life was BS anyhow. For all it mattered I could have been referred to as \"This pusillanimous planetoid ...\" \u001d   I was reminded of my Playbill listing for The Fantasticks when I Googled Shepard Smith, anchor for FOX Cable News. \u001d  An official Web Site referred to Mr. Smith as \"the vibrant and always colorful Shepard Smith,\" which phrase possesses a Balderdash Quotient at least as high as \"this mercurial meteorite.\" The difference is that both Paul Freeman and I were having fun. Whereas, at FOX, someone believes they wrote something. \u001d  You know what I like about the people who give you the news in Britain? They are not oversold. They are referred to as news readers. \"Felicity is a news reader for the BBC,\" they say. \u001d  They do not over-promise over there. They promise us that Felicity can read and, by golly, by the end of the program(me) the assertion is borne out. \u001d  I'm assuming that Shepard Smith can read from a cue card but not ad lib. \u001d  Covering Gerald Ford's services in front of St. Margaret's Episcopal Church on Saturday, Mr. Smith delivered himself of this bon mot: \"President Ford engendered the common man.\" \u001d  I'm assuming Mr. Smith wanted to say \"epitomized,\" but I have no idea. He went smugly on from there. \b \u001d  Protect This! \b \u001d  Did you see where George Pataki, who was just replaced as governor of New York by Eliot Spitzer, requested and received a security detail of state troopers at a cost of at least $20,000 a week? \u001d  Few people outside New York State know who Mr. Pataki is. Fewer care. In the final year of his administration, he was off to Iowa and New Hampshire to beat his own drum for president of the United States in Aught Eight. \u001d  Mr. Pataki must have concluded, \"Hey, I'm running for president. Therefore, I must be somebody. Therefore, I must need protecting.\" \u001d  Of greater interest to me, Mr. Pataki's request for protection by state troopers was approved by the new governor, Eliot Spitzer. \u001d  Mr. Spitzer talks the talk about shaping up New York State. He doesn't walk the walk. He could have begun his first term in a smashing fashion by asking Mr. Pataki when the request was filed, \"Are you kidding me?\" \b \u001d  MaliBooBoo \b \u001d  Today Chevrolet takes the wraps off its new Malibu, which will be available to the public in about one year. \u001d  The new Malibu is the reincarnation of two other Malibus, both of which met with a mixed reception from the general public years ago. \u001d  As Joseph B. White wrote in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal: \b \u001d  \"Say `Chevy Malibu,' and some Americans think of a 1960s muscle car. Unfortunately for General Motors Corp., many more think, `rent-a-car.' \u001d  \"Now, GM is unveiling a revamped look for the Malibu sedan, as part of a broad effort to convince people shopping for a car priced below $30,000 to pause on their march to Toyota Motor Corp. or Honda Motor Co. dealerships.\" \b \u001d  With the redesigned Malibu, Chevy seeks to grab some of the market taken by the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord. \u001d  I am not, as you know, a marketing professional. But I do wonder why General Motors would choose Malibu as the name for a new sedan, which it hopes will challenge Toyota and Honda. \u001d  Why take a chance on a name that comes to market trailing clouds of mixed memories? \u001d  What not Chevy Thunder? Has that name been taken? \b \u001d  (Jim Murphy, resident iconoclast at Dow Jones Newswires and veteran observer of global business trends, can be reached at (201) 938-2145 or by e-mail at Jim.Murphy@DowJones.Com) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 13:30 ET (18:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c64f44ebc22313ef89fb51393e7c6477","symR":["12126.FR","5108.TO","GT","FR0000121261","JP3830800003"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Goodyear's US Workers Return To Work After 3-Month Strike","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T16:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12126.FR","5108.TO","GT","FR0000121261","JP3830800003"],"IndustryCodes":["TIR","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  AKRON, Ohio (AP)--Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.'s (GT) U.S. workers returned to work Tuesday after a three-month strike against the world's third largest tire maker. \u001d  Jack Hefner, vice president of Steelworkers Local 2 in Akron, said Tuesday that workers were happy to be back. \"Morale, I would say, is (they are) glad to be back to work,\" he said. \u001d  Workers at 12 plants in 10 states approved a three-year agreement Friday covering 14,000 employees that includes plans to close a Texas tire factory and creates a $1 billion health care fund for retirees. The contract was approved by all 12 locals and by the overall membership by a 2-to-1 margin. \u001d  The company said the pact will help reduce its costs by $610 million over three years and $300 million a year thereafter. \u001d  The company said it was looking forward to focusing on business. \u001d  \"What we expect is that both Goodyear and its workers now get back to being one team,\" Goodyear spokesman Ed Markey said. \"The focus is on serving the customer and beating the competition.\" \u001d  Goodyear is third among the world's biggest tire makers after Japan's Bridgestone Corp. (5108.TO) and France's Group Michelin (12126.FR). \u001d  While some workers said it will take time to mend wounds with management, others were optimistic about rebuilding their relationship with management. \u001d  \"Overall when we get back in there, they're going to be happy for us to get in there,\" said John Rutherford, president of USW Local 843L in Marysville, Ohio. \"I don't think they're going to be overbearing and slapping us back into shape. We're looking forward to getting back into the routine.\" \u001d  Rutherford held resentment only for temporary workers who filled their jobs for weeks. The strike began Oct. 5. \u001d  Goodyear ultimately agreed to put $1 billion into a health care fund for retired union workers' medical benefits, higher than the company's previous $660 million but less than the union's call for roughly double that amount. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 11:55 ET (16:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

\b   By Serena Saitto \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  BUENOS AIRES (Dow Jones)--After gaining 36% in 2006 and updating its record high level throughout the last quarter, the Argentine benchmark Merval index is seen keeping its positive momentum in the first quarter of 2007. \u001d  According to analysts, however, the continuation of this market's trend will depend on Wall Street's performance and on interest rates decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2007. \u001d  \"The market can still gain a lot in the first quarter as long as the U.S. stock market conditions stay positive and the Fed keeps its interest rates low,\" said Guido Denin, an equity analyst with Grupo SBS, a bank in Buenos Aires. \u001d  Analysts widely agree that the banking sector will keep on enjoying an upward trend, while the metals sector - which lagged other industries in the last quarter - should rebound from recent dips, despite a slight decline in global metals prices. \u001d  \"Steel makers Acindar (ACIN.BA) and Siderar (ERAR.BA) should catch up with their peers in the U.S., whose shares rallied a lot recently,\" driven by a boom in the industry's mergers and acquisitions, said Denin. He has a buy recommendation on both stocks and has six Argentine pesos ($1.96) target price for Acindar, and ARS27 for Siderar. \u001d  On Tuesday, Acindar closed up 1.24% at ARS4.88, while Siderar gained 1% to ARS24.65. \u001d  Juan Jose Vazquez, an analyst with Bull Market Brokers in Buenos Aires, sees the Merval index poised to enjoy a gain of between 12% and 15% this year. He believes the government's anti-inflation strategy of sector-by-sector price controls and export restrictions will squeeze companies' profitability and weigh further on direct investments into Argentina. \u001d  Vazquez agreed that the banking sector will stay positive, and also likes t said he is more cautious on the energy sector, and recommends selling shares of power transporter Transener (TRAN.BA). \u001d  The government imposed price freezes on a number of utilities as a result of the country's dramatic economic crisis of 2002, and a number of analysts have said that they are unlikely to be removed during this election year. \u001d  Still, despite the government's distortive industrial policies, the market should benefit from the fifth consecutive year of economic rebound. Economists widely expects Argentina to grow by about 7%, after four years of economic growth above 8%. \u001d  All analysts agree that the trend of the Merval's bellwether Tenaris (TS), the world's largest steel tube maker, remains positive despite the extended rally it enjoyed during the last quarter. \u001d  \"With the fourth quarter results, Tenaris will start consolidating U.S. tube maker Maverick into its accounts, and during 2007 it will start showing the synergies coming from the acquisition,\" said Vazquez. \u001d  The stock gained more than 15% in December, and closed Tuesday up 2.83% to ARS76.10. \b   Table of Recent Trends \b   Index: Merval \b \b             End       End      End      End      End \b             4Q/06     3Q/06    2Q/06    1Q/06    4Q/05 \bIndex        2,090.46  1637.3   1711.09  1800.58  1543.31 \bQtr-to-Qtr \bChanges      +27%      -4.3%    -4.9%    +16.7%   -8.9% \b \b   Currency: Argentine Peso \b \b             End      End      End      End       End \b             4Q/06    3Q/06    2Q/06    1Q/06     4Q/05 \bPeso Vs Dlr  3.069    3.10     3.0850   3.0825   3.03 \bQtr-to-Qtr \bChanges      +1%    -0.48%   -0.1%    -1.7%    -4.1% \b \b4Q Index High:  2,090.46 (12/29) \b4Q Index Low:   1,627.61 (10/03) \b2005 Close:     1,543.31 (12/29) \bLatest Close:   2,139.14 (1/2) \b \u001d  (This is the first in a series of seven articles on prospects for Latin America's biggest stock markets in the first quarter). \b \u001d  -By Serena Saitto, Dow Jones Newswires; 5411-4311-3125; serena.saitto@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:27 ET (21:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c887c2815a5ffeb28c39b3aef437aaca","symR":["COLBUN.SN","ENDESA.SN","EOC","XTA.LN","CLP3615W1037","CLP3710M1090","GB0031411001"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Xstrata Submits Chile $600M Hydropower Proj For Evaluation","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T17:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["COLBUN.SN","ENDESA.SN","EOC","XTA.LN","CLP3615W1037","CLP3710M1090","GB0031411001"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","MNG","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SANTIAGO (Dow Jones)--Diversified miner Xstrata PLC (XTA.LN) submitted for evaluation the environmental impact statement for a $600 million hydroelectric power plant in southern Chile, the company said Tuesday. \u001d  The Rio Cuervo power project, managed by Xstrata unit Energia Austral, is expected to come on line in early 2012, producing 600 Megawatts of power. \u001d  The power project was originally designed by mining company Falconbridge, which Xstrata acquired last year. \u001d  The Rio Cuervo plant has met major opposition from local farmers, salmon producers and tourism companies along with environmental groups. \u001d  Signals from the government have been mixed, though securing adequate energy supply is a top issue for the administration of socialist President Michelle Bachelet. \u001d  Public Works Minister Eduardo Bitran recently said the Xstrata project threatened to flood too large an area per projected megawatt of power and recommended the installation of run-of-river generators instead. \u001d  A joint venture of power generators Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA (EOC) and Colbun SA (COLBUN.SN) is preparing the environmental impact study of its own for a series of hydropower projects in the same region. \u001d  In Chile, Xstrata controls or has stakes in the Collahuasi and Lomas Bayas copper mines and the Altonorte custom copper smelter. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.xstrata.com \b \u001d  -By Carolina Pica and Stephan Kueffner, Dow Jones Newswires; 56-2-460-8544; chile@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 12:45 ET (17:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c8984ce999234cc067b151e58e18f885","symR":["LEN","LENB"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Lennar and LNR Expand Their Strategic LandSource Partnership to Include MacFarlane Partners' Venture and CalPERS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T11:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LEN","LENB"],"IndustryCodes":["HOM","HPR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MIAMI, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Lennar Corporation (NYSE: LEN and LEN.B), one of the nation's largest homebuilders, and LNR Property Corporation (\"LNR\"), one of the nation's leading real estate, finance, management and development companies, announced today that they have reached an agreement to admit a new partner into their existing strategic joint venture, LandSource Communities Development LLC (\"LandSource\").  The new partner is MW Housing Partners, which is co-managed by MacFarlane Partners and includes the California Public Employees' Retirement System (\"CalPERS\"). \b \u001d  As of July 1, 2006, LandSource had assets with a book value of approximately $1.3 billion, with its primary investment being The Newhall Land and Farming Company (\"Newhall\"), which owns 15,000 acres of land in the rapidly growing Santa Clarita Valley, approximately 30 miles north of downtown Los Angeles. With 23,000 residential homesites, Newhall owns some of the last remaining large, undeveloped, but entitled, land in the greater Los Angeles area. It also owns 700 acres of commercial land and other property in the Santa Clarita Valley. Under the terms of the agreement, the LandSource assets are valued at approximately $2.6 billion, with a potential increase adjustment to that value of over $600 million. \b \u001d  The agreement also provides for a new non-recourse debt facility. In exchange for a 62% interest in LandSource, the MW Housing venture will contribute cash and property with a combined value of approximately $900 million. The property, which is part of an existing land bank relationship between MW Housing Partners and Lennar, is being contributed based on today's fair market value. Lennar will continue to have options to purchase those homesites at the market price at the time of the exercise. \b \u001d  Commenting on the transaction, Stuart Miller, President and CEO of Lennar, and Jeffrey Krasnoff, President and CEO of LNR, issued a joint statement, \"We are very pleased to expand our partnership to include MacFarlane Partners and CalPERS, which will add their strong financial resources and expertise in creating one of the nation's premier land companies. LandSource has created value through the continued development of Newhall and growing its land portfolio in targeted high growth markets. Today's announcement is a validation of this value creation, as we combine our respective residential and commercial expertise with the collective expertise and capital resources of our new partner.  LandSource, building on the unique talent of our Newhall team in mixed use development, will become a new strategic platform for opportunistic land acquisition and value creation.\" \b \u001d  \"We are excited to be investing in such prime property in Los Angeles, a market that we have favored for its long-term growth prospects,\" said Victor B. MacFarlane, founder and managing principal of MacFarlane Partners. \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that few pension managers and investors have the resources and the capabilities to participate in thanks in large part to the flexibility and vision of our long time partner, CalPERS.\" \b \u001d  The transaction will result in a distribution of approximately $660 million each to Lennar and LNR. As part of the transaction, LandSource will grant options to Lennar to purchase property contributed by the MW Housing venture.  Both Lennar and LNR will retain options and rights of first offer to purchase property currently owned by LandSource. While the MW Housing venture will have a 62% financial interest in LandSource, it will have 50% voting control of the entity. Lennar and LNR will continue to jointly serve as the administrative member of LandSource and will be responsible for its day-to-day operational management.  LandSource will also enter into agreements with each of the members under which the members will be compensated for management services. \b \u001d  The transaction is subject to completion of financing, certain closing conditions, regulatory approvals and adjustments and is expected to close in February 2007. \b \u001d  Lennar Corporation, founded in 1954, is one of the nation's leading builders of quality homes for all generations. The Company builds affordable, move-up and retirement homes primarily under the Lennar brand name. Lennar's Financial Services segment provides primarily mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both buyers of the Company's homes and others. Previous press releases and further information about the Company may be obtained at the \"Investor Relations\" section of the Company's website, www.lennar.com. \b \u001d  LNR Property Corporation has been engaged in the development, ownership and management of commercial properties and land since 1969.  Until October of 1997, LNR operated as a division of Lennar Corporation at which time it was spun off to become a separate public company.  In February 2005, LNR was acquired by entities controlled by affiliates of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. LNR manages real estate properties, loans and securities for its own account and for others exceeding $5 billion and is responsible for the special servicing of over $200 billion of real estate loans which collateralize commercial mortgage backed securities in the United States and Europe. \b \u001d  Through MW Housing, MacFarlane Partners has invested in single-family housing land and development projects since 1995 on behalf of its venture with CalPERS, the nation's largest public pension fund, with more than $220 billion in assets. Based in San Francisco, MacFarlane Partners is one of the leading real estate investment management firms in the United States, with $11.7 billion in real estate assets under management. \b \u001d  Some of the statements in this press release are \"forward-looking statements,\" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The program represents the first time at a state level that such a partnership has been created. The program will enable people to electronically apply for the Food Assistance benefit through more than 45 H&R Block tax offices in three metro area counties. \b \u001d  \"Access to healthy, nutritious food isn't always easy for many low-income families,\" stated Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius. \"There are nutrition assistance efforts out there, but the application process can be daunting and many families are missing out as a result. This partnership with H&R Block will help change that and give more families the assistance they're eligible for,\" said Sebelius. \"Plus, streamlining the application process is a great addition to our efforts to make government operate more efficiently making it so we can deliver more services with less overhead.\" \b \u001d  Currently, the State of Kansas estimates that, while nearly 31,000 people in Johnson, Wyandotte, and Leavenworth counties receive food assistance each month, there are more than 24,000 individuals who are likely eligible but not enrolled in the program largely due to challenges with awareness, accessing applications and understanding the basic guidelines for eligibility. The state's Food Assistance benefit averages over $4,000 per year for a family of four. \b \u001d  The H&R Block Benefits Enrollment Network (BEN) program will be piloted in Johnson, Wyandotte, and Leavenworth counties beginning in January of 2007. During tax preparation by H&R Block, potentially eligible individuals will be offered the assistance of specially-trained benefits specialists, at no additional charge, who can then guide them through the benefits application process. The application, along with supporting documentation, will then be sent electronically to the state where an SRS case worker manages the remainder of the process. Follow-up and resolution of the application process can take place by phone or in person at a county office. \b \u001d  \"H&R Block is in a unique position to help our clients receive all the benefits to which they are entitled,\" said Mark Ernst, chairman and chief executive officer of H&R Block. \"We have been expanding our ability to serve as our clients' tax and financial partner for the last several years and this partnership with the State of Kansas represents a new chapter in this effort. We are proud to be partnering with the State of Kansas through Governor Sebelius' leadership,\" continued Ernst. \"With the Benefits Enrollment Network, H&R Block improves upon its mission to help people get the support they need to improve their financial situations and build better lives for themselves and their families.\" \b \u001d  The Kansas Food Assistance Program is a nutrition assistance benefits program which allows eligible people to purchase nutritious food from their local grocery stores. SRS reports show that only 64.5% of Kansans who are eligible for the program currently participate (there are approximately 182,821 persons currently participating). This leaves over 100,000 persons who could receive food assistance if they would apply, and the need is present in all areas of the State. For example, Johnson County, one of the most populous and wealthiest counties in the state, SRS data indicates over 24,400 potentially eligible individuals but only 39.7% of them participate in the program. \b \u001d  \"Our goal is to change the equation across the state and our vision is for every eligible Kansas family to access every benefit they can, which in this case can mean up to $4,000 a year in food assistance for a family of 4,\" said Don Jordan, Acting Secretary of Social and Rehabilitation Services for the State of Kansas. \"Over the course of the next few months, we will work with H&R Block to measure the effectiveness of this program to determine its impact on Kansas families.\" \b \u001d  \"It's about our clients. It's always been about how we can help,\" said Cheryl Boos, an H&R Block Tax Professional in Kansas City. \"The Benefits Enrollment Network now allows us to help our clients even more. We are very excited about this opportunity and I know my clients will be too.\" \b \b   About H&R Block \b \u001d  H&R Block seeks to serve as its clients' tax and financial partner. Over the last several years the Company has developed and introduced numerous innovations to help working families choose healthier financial alternatives, get more of the benefits to which they are entitled and help create the ability for individuals and their families to become more financially secure and independent. H&R Block is the world's largest tax services provider. Having prepared more than 400 million tax returns since 1955 the company pioneered e-filing and consistently helps approximately 25 percent of those families who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit each year. In 2005, that represented over $10 billion, an average of about $1,800 per family. \b \b    CONTACT: H&R Block \b             Denise Sposato, 816-854-4547 \b             dsposato@hrblock.com \b             or \b             Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services \b             Abbie Hodgson, 785-296-0760 \b             AHodgson@srs.ks.gov \b \b    SOURCE: H&R Block \bCopyright Business Wire 2007 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 07:00 ET (12:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c98d2d8f2972c38a82dff41c7fb85d61","symR":["SHY.XX"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Royal Hospitality Acquires Shoney's","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T15:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SHY.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["RES"],"Story":"\bRoyal Hospitality Acquires Shoney's \b \bATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 02, 2007-- \u001d  Royal Hospitality Corp., a company affiliate of Atlanta-based Royal Capital Corp., announced today that it is acquiring Shoney's Restaurants from Shoney's LLC.

Approximately $4.0 billion of debt is affected by these actions. \u001d  The upgrades are based on RTN's recent announcement that it will sell Raytheon Aircraft (RAC) to two private equity firms for $3.3 billion and use some of the proceeds to retire debt.  The upgrades are also based on the continuing solid performance in RTN's government and defense businesses and strong cash generation in 2006.  Fitch could take further positive rating actions in the next year depending on RTN's financial strategy, cash deployment, and operating performance. \u001d  Fitch believes that the RAC transaction and the related debt retirement will materially strengthen RTN's financial profile.  RTN expects the transaction will generate $2.5 billion of cash after taxes, fees, and the funding of RAC's pension plan. Subject to the completion of the transaction (expected in the first half of 2007), RTN's board of directors has authorized the early retirement of approximately $1.0 billion of debt and $750 million of share repurchases.  The early retirement of debt will be in addition to $685 million of debt maturing in 2007.  Fitch estimates that RTN's debt will decline by more than 40% as a result of the early debt retirement and debt maturities in 2007, and RTN should continue to have substantial liquidity after these cash deployment actions.  Fitch believes that there is a high degree of certainty that the transaction will be completed. \u001d  RTN's ratings reflect the competitive position of the company's defense businesses, high levels of U.S. defense spending, large backlog, and liquidity position.  Concerns center on program risks within the DOD budget, some shareholder-focused elements of the company's cash deployment plan, the sizable pension deficit, and losses at Flight Options. \u001d  At Sept. 24, 2006, RTN had a liquidity position of $2.7 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion of cash and $2.1 billion credit facility availability, offset by $582 million in short-term debt and current maturities.  RTN retired $408 million of maturing debt in May.  RTN's debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the last 12 months ending Sept. 24, 2006, was 1.6 times (x) compared to 2.1x in 2005 and 2.8x in 2004.  Adjusted for non-cash pension expense these ratios were 1.4x, 1.7x, and 2.2x.  EBITDA-to-Interest coverage improved to 8.8x for the last 12 month period compared with 6.8x in 2005 and 4.4x in 2004. \u001d  High defense spending levels continue to support RTN's ratings and RTN's government and defense operations, which currently account for more than three-quarters of the company's revenues and will account for nearly all of RTN's revenues after the RAC sale.  RTN's government and defense revenues grew 6.3% in 2005 and should grow at least at mid-single digit rates in 2006.  Government and defense margins rose 70 bps to 11.8% in 2005 and 50 bps to 12.0% in the first three quarters of 2006.

(ACE), reached an agreement before the new year. \u001d  Froehlich declined to discuss details. However, the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper said the insurers would contribute EUR168 million ($222 million), out of an outstanding EUR175 million ($231 million) stemming from the 2003 settlement of the lawsuit over the merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp. \u001d  The newspaper said that U.S. insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG) had already paid $25 million (EUR18.9 million) and that DaimlerChrysler had paid the rest. \u001d  The head of Ace in Germany, Lothar Riedle, also confirmed an agreement but declined to elaborate. \u001d  Chrysler shareholders in the U.S., who argued that they were duped into approving the deal that combined Chrysler and Daimler-Benz when executives from both companies portrayed it as a merger of equals, had filed a class-action suit seeking $22 billion in damages. \u001d  The lawsuit cited a 2000 interview with former DaimlerChrysler Chairman Juergen Schrempp in which he said billing the combination as a merger rather than a takeover was \"for psychological reasons\" only. \u001d  Daimler had counted on liability insurance on Schrempp to cover part of the settlement, but several companies had refused to pay. \u001d  The class-action suit was independent of another similar lawsuit filed by Kirk Kerkorian. The billionaire investor claimed that Daimler-Benz engineered a takeover of Chrysler, then cheated him out of an acquisition premium by claiming it was a merger of equals. A Delaware court rejected his suit. \u001d  DaimlerChrysler shares rose 1.6% to EUR47.66 ($62.92) in Frankfurt trading. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 10:15 ET (15:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ca4f14c7950c3c046942d1cfbb7b8340","symR":["WFD"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": New Westfield Financial, Inc.

That figure is set to fall in 2007, as companies scale back their gas drilling programs because of lower prices. Since front-month gas futures prices hit a record high of $15.37 per million British thermal units in December 2005, they've moderated considerably due to ongoing mild weather and resulting higher inventory levels. \u001d  Canadian companies have been particularly hard hit. A strong Canadian dollar in recent years has meant they've been realizing lower returns for their production than their U.S. rivals. In addition, the country has a high proportion of shallow gas wells that deplete quickly and aren't as profitable to drill at times of lower prices. \u001d  An oil boom in Western Canada, where the majority of the country's conventional gas reserves are found, has also ramped up drilling costs in Canada more sharply than in the U.S. As a result, major producers including the country's top three: EnCana Corp. (ECA), Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) and Talisman Energy (TLM), have slashed their gas exploration budgets for 2007 and invested elsewhere. \u001d  The Petroleum Services Association of Canada said in November that it expects 21,500 oil and gas wells to be drilled across Canada, a 10% drop from the expected final tally for 2006 of 23,900 wells. \b \b   Lower Output Expected \b \u001d  FirstEnergy's King sees Canadian gas supply dropping by as much as 800 million cubic feet a day by July. Growing demand for gas by oil firms operating in Alberta has boosted domestic consumption by 300 million cubic feet a day in the past few months. \u001d  That sets the stage for a potential reduction in exports of 1 billion cubic feet a day in mid-2006, or \"the largest reduction in export volumes in a generation,\" King said. \u001d  Last month, analysts J. Marshall Adkins and James M. Rollyson from Raymond James also forecast a decline of 1 billion cubic feet a day in Canadian exports this year. \u001d  Lower Canadian exports are \"certainly a possibility,\" said Bart Melek, senior economist at Toronto-based BMO Nesbitt Burns. \u001d  \"With current gas inventory levels, it's unlikely that the price will recover any time soon, especially with the warm weather we're seeing in North America,\" he said. \"That's certainly going to result in much lower drilling activity in Western Canada.\" \u001d  The reduced drilling won't just affect the amount of natural gas produced in Canada. Service and supply firms are already feeling the impact of a weaker drilling schedule. Steel pipe and plate maker Ipsco Inc. (IPS) cut its fourth-quarter 2006 outlook last month, citing the lower amount of natural gas drilling activity in Canada as a cause.

Teaming up with a deep-pocketed Wall Street firm could help MLN avoid liquidity problems and resume funding loans. \u001d  In the meantime, MLN said it \"will temporarily discontinue its wholesale operations,\" citing recently deteriorating conditions in the industry. Phone recordings at multiple MLN wholesale offices said the company is no longer funding loans or accepting applications for new loans. \u001d  \"Until we see credit quality and margins return to acceptable levels we have determined that MLN needs to pause from wholesale broker originations,\" said MLN President and Chief Executive Mitchell Heffernan. \u001d  MLN is the nation's 15th-largest subprime lender, according to National Mortgage News. Based in Middletown, Conn., the company says its goal last year was to produce more than $12.1 billion in loans, 80% of which would be in the subprime space. MLN, a privately held company that does business nationwide, says that both its prime and subprime units have stopped funding loans and accepting applications. In an email sent late last week to employees and reviewed by Dow Jones Newswires, top MLN executives said the company will keep selling loans that have been originated \"over the last few months.\" \u001d  MLN's outside public relations representatives referred inquiries to company executives. MLN officials, including the chief executive and general counsel, didn't respond to phone calls or emails. \u001d  In addition to its mortgage-originating business, MLN also has a big servicing arm with a portfolio of about $18 billion and more than 100,000 accounts, according to the company's Web site. In Tuesday's statement, MLN said it will continue to operate its servicing platform and its retail-lending franchise. \u001d  The decision by MLN to stop funding new loans and to consider alternatives for its wholesale business is the latest sign of an ongoing shakeout in in the subprime mortgage industry, which is getting squeezed by a cooling housing market and rising delinquencies. Late last year, for example, Sebring Capital and Ownit Mortgage Solutions shut down citing unfavorable conditions in the mortgage industry. \u001d  Some subprime issuers recently have faced liquidity crunches as their so-called warehouse lenders withdraw credit lines. MLN's message to employees last week said the company stopped funding loans and accepting new applications \"as a result of unresolved issues with our warehouse banks.\" A recording on an MLN phone system also cited \"warehouse loan issues.\" \u001d  Among MLN's warehouse lenders is GMAC's residential-mortgage arm, ResCap. In mid-December, a ResCap spokesman said that \"We have a relationship with MLN which includes purchases of loans and warehousing. We continue to support MLN through these programs.\" The ResCap spokesman declined to comment on the latest developments at MLN. \u001d  The decision on funding is an ominous sign for MLN. \"Once you say you're not funding any loans any more, the game is over,\" said Brenda B. White, a managing director at Deloitte & Touche Corporate Finance. She noted that employees may quickly start to jump ship. MLN, however, characterized its halt to funding as a suspension, and industry experts said MLN might be able to arrange a new source of short-term capital, allowing it to resume funding loans. \u001d  -By David Enrich, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2123; david.enrich@dowjones.com \u001d  -By Lingling Wei, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2089; lingling.wei@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:47 ET (20:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d0aabfb8bf96556ddd9def653729496f","symR":["DJ"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Redesigned Wall Street Journal Hits Newsstands Today","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T07:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DJ"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   Redesigned Wall Street Journal Hits Newsstands Today \b \b   Half Million Free Copies of Journal Available At Newsstands \bNationwide \b \b   NEW YORK, Jan. 2, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- The redesigned \bWall Street Journal hit newsstands this morning, and to encourage trial \bthe Journal is free nationwide as part of the largest complimentary \bnewspaper sampling in its history.

(BLS), ending two months of heated negotiations over the merger. \u001d  After AT&T on Thursday pledged further concessions, the two Democrat FCC commissioners Michael Copps and Jonathan Adelstein voted in favor of the merger, which is the largest in the history of the U.S. telecommunications industry. \u001d  \"This merger promises to result in greater competition in the broadband and video markets. Broadband deployment to all Americans remains one of the highest objectives for us at the Commission,\" said FCC Chairman Kevin Martin in a statement. \u001d  The merger will solidify AT&T's position as the dominant player in the U.S. telecom market. The combined company will have a market capitalization of around $225 billion, more than double its nearest rival Verizon Communications' (VZ) approximate market capitalization of $109 billion. \u001d  The merged entity will have 11.5 million broadband customers and 67.5 million access lines. \u001d  In a crucial concession, AT&T said it would guarantee \"neutral routing\" on all Internet traffic over its system for two years when the merger closes. \u001d  The debate over net neutrality had emerged as one of the key issues in the takeover. AT&T's pledge will now put pressure on its rivals, specifically Verizon, to make the same commitment. \u001d  AT&T also ceded ground on the rates it charges high-volume business customers, saying in areas in which it operates where is no regulation of pricing it will lower rates to the level they were at before regulation was lifted by the FCC. It committed itself to maintaining these lower rates for 48 months after the close of the merger, which closed Friday. \u001d  Rivals had argued the financial muscle of the merged company would allow it price any competition out of the lucrative market. \u001d  A report from the Government Accountability Office in November concluded there was evidence that prices had risen substantially in areas where the FCC granted companies the right to set prices without regulatory intervention. \u001d  This finding seriously undermined AT&T's claim that there was rigorous pricing competition in these areas. \u001d  It had previously said it would freeze rates for 30 months for all business, or special access in industry jargon, customers. AT&T also agreed to sell some of the unused spectrum it would retain following the merger. \u001d  In a statement released on its Web site, the federal agency said that \"significant public interest benefits are likely to result from this transaction.\" \u001d  It said that while in some markets such as special-access competition there was the potential for some anticompetitive effects, commitments by AT&T would remedy the harm. \u001d  The three concessions by the company, in addition to several previously made, see AT&T going some way towards the demands made by commissioners Copps and Adelstein. The two Democrats had been at loggerheads with FCC Chairman Kevin Martin and fellow Republican commissioner Deborah Taylor Tate, who wanted to approve the merger with few if any conditions attached. \u001d  The Democrats had been emboldened in their claims for further concessions by the November election results, where their party took control of both houses of Congress. The Justice Department antitrust unit approved the merger in October. \u001d  After determining that a deal couldn't be reached among the four commissioners, Martin sought the involvement of the fifth panel member Republican Robert McDowell. He had not taken part in the negotiations because his former employer, lobbying group Comptel, has publicly opposed the merger. Government ethics regulations state in the first year of service, commissioners must not be involved in any issue where there is the possibility of a conflict of interest. \u001d  FCC General Counsel Sam Feder agreed to waive the potential of conflict of interest for McDowell. But in a serious blow to Martin's chairmanship, McDowell still refused to take part, saying he didn't agree with Feder's assessment. \u001d  This forced AT&T's hand and the company was forced to give more ground in order to win approval of the merger. Following McDowell's announcement 10 days ago, negotiations continued throughout the Christmas holidays. \u001d  Friday, McDowell issued his own statement in which he expressed his delight that his colleagues and AT&T were able to come to agreement so quickly after he officially excused himself. \u001d  Other concessions previously agreed upon by AT&T include offering standalone DSL broadband Internet access to customers in its geographic area for $19.99 a month for 30 months after the completion of the deal, and offer free broadband modems to new broadband customers. \u001d  It has committed itself to upgrading its fiber facilities to 85% of its geographic area by the end of 2007, meaning more customers in this area will have access to AT&T broadband service. \u001d  The company will also speed its deployment of video services, now committing itself to reaching at least 1.5 million homes in BellSouth's territory by the end of 2007. So far, it has launched the service in 11 markets, including San Antonio and Houston. It plans to reach 19 million homes in its own 13-state region by the end of 2008. \u001d  It will donate $1 million to a fund for the purposes of promoting public safety. \u001d  Another concession offered Thursday was the pledge to repatriate 3,000 BellSouth jobs to the U.S. which had been moved overseas by the end of 2008. \u001d  Public interest groups reacted to the approval, congratulating Copps and Adelstein in particular. \u001d  \"All things considered, it would have been better that AT&T were not allowed to acquire BellSouth,\" said Andrew Schwartzman, president of Media Access Project. \"Commissioners Copps and Adelstein clearly got the best possible deal, making a bad merger less bad.\" \u001d  The FCC had been under considerable pressure, not the least from powerful Hill lawmakers who have been watching the proceedings with a close eye. \u001d  Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who will assume the chairmanship of the House Commerce Committee next week, said that while he was pleased the matter was resolved, he has \"significant concerns over the process followed at the FCC during these final weeks.\" He said the committee may very look at the FCC merger review process in the new Congress. \u001d  It is known that both Martin and AT&T wanted to resolve the impasse over the merger before the Democrats take control of Congress next week, which could have led to further delays as Dingell and others held oversight hearings into the merger. \u001d  The concessions on net neutrality will likely garner the most attention and will have the most significant repercussions for the telecommunications industry more widely going forward. \u001d  The debate over how to guarantee all providers of content on the Internet are treated the same by companies like AT&T and Verizon who control the backbone of the internet became one of the most heated in Washington in 2006. \u001d  Congress tried, but ultimately failed, to pass a law ensuring that content from competitors to those companies controlling the hardware isn't slowed down on its way to consumers' homes, and staffers for Democrat lawmakers and FCC commissioners have referred to the matter as a debate over \"the future of the Internet\". \u001d  It is also the issue that competitors most feared. With AT&T's commitment on neutrality, it will put significant pressure on them to do the same. \u001d  AT&T had argued the marketplace would ensure it treated all content providers the same and therefore there was no need for regulatory intervention, but these assurances were not enough for Copps and Adelstein. \u001d  Companies like search engine giants Google Inc. (GOOG) and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) as well consumer groups have lobbied Congress and the FCC aggressively on the net neutrality issue. \u001d  Special data and voice networks used by corporate customers will not be subject to the rules and AT&T's own nascent video offerings will also be exempted. \u001d  The further concessions on the special access market will be the most costly to AT&T in the short term. \u001d  According to one analyst, it could see rates for business customers drop by up to 15% in the areas that AT&T has said it will reduce rates. Across its operating area it should give competitors a leg up in offering telecommunications service to companies. \u001d  The completion of the merger means that AT&T will take over 100% of wireless carrier Cingular Wireless, which had been a joint venture with BellSouth and considered the asset most sought after by AT&T. AT&T is expected to begin phasing out the Cingular brand beginning early next year, replacing it with the AT&T moniker. \u001d  In late trading, AT&T shares are up 26 cent, or 0.7%, to $36.01. Shares closed in regular trading Friday up 25 cents at $35.75 on volume of 28.6 million compared with average daily volume of 25.2 million. Shares reached a new 52-week high of $36.21, surpassing the previous high of $36 reached Dec. 15. \u001d  -By Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6637; corey.boles@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 07:31 ET (12:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d4c0a2357304e7804d45d5acacbc7b24","symR":["CME"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"CME Posts Seventh Consecutive Record Yr As Total Volume Reaches More Than 1.3 B Contracts; Exchange Daily Volume Averages 5.3 M Contracts, Up 28 % Vs 2005>CME","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T16:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CME"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 11:56 ET (16:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d4ec5bacbff649ab9f69f357ffa90dfd","symR":["BP","BP.LN","GB0007980591"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UK PRESS: Commodities Traders Offered Lock-in Pay Deals","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T07:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BP","BP.LN","GB0007980591"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","OIL","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Commodity traders are being offered multi-million-pound lock-in payments, the Financial Times reports Tuesday, as their value - particularly of energy traders - has risen sharply over the past 18 months. \u001d  Guaranteed payments represent a salary and bonus package that will be paid to a trader regardless of the subsequent trading performance of the bank, the FT says. \u001d  Given this situation, aggressive entrants into the commodities markets are increasingly being driven to look elsewhere to find top traders, the paper says, noting industry estimates that at least 30 traders have left BP PLC (BP) in the past 18 months to go to either banks, private oil traders or hedge funds. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.ft.com \b \u001d  -By London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9330 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 02:56 ET (07:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d4f1909ecd20ec80c46303dab64fdb3a","symR":["ABFS"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"ABF Freight Adds Central, Southern U.S. To Network","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T22:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABFS"],"IndustryCodes":["TRK","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 17:11 ET (22:11 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d54420d80b2b5d7ea21ab28e57238937","symR":["QLGC"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": QLogic Executives to Present at Needham Growth Conference","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T13:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["QLGC"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   QLogic Executives to Present at Needham Growth Conference \b \b   ALISO VIEJO, Calif., Jan. 2, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- QLogic \bCorp.

But the service, stymied by low acceptance among consumers and difficulties with studio negotiations, never took off, and Intertainer shut down in 2002. It then sued the major studios for anticompetitive behavior and settled out of court last year. \u001d  The suit was filed Friday in U.S. District Court for the Eastern district of Texas. Intertainer, which continues as a corporate entity although its movie service no longer exists, seeks unspecified damages. \u001d  Apple and Google didn't immediately return calls for comment.

(Nasdaq:INMD), the largest fertility-services company in the United States announced the newest addition to its provider network, the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital at Manhasset, New York. This practice is the seventh addition to the IntegraMed network of fertility practices over the past 12 months, signaling continued strong growth. \b \u001d  The Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital at Manhasset has been at the forefront of reproductive sciences for more than 30 years and is proud of its high pregnancy success rates and world renowned research achievements. In 1999, the Division of Human Reproduction relocated and opened its new comprehensive Center - a 14,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility on the campus of North Shore University Hospital at Manhasset - designed to meet the privacy, comfort, educational and emotional needs of our patients seeking fertility treatment. The Center offers a full spectrum of infertility care for women and men via the area's most advanced andrology and embryology laboratories. \b \u001d  \"Our team of physicians is committed to providing superior care, so it was a logical move to be part of the IntegraMed network - which is known for having among the best fertility practices nationally,\" said David L. Rosenfeld, MD, Medical Director of the Center for Human Reproduction. \"As an Affiliate in the IntegraMed network we will be able to share ideas and practices with other top-quality physicians - and we'll be able to offer IntegraMed's Shared Risk(R) Refund Program to our patients.\" Shared Risk is a multi-cycle treatment plan, where patients pay a fixed price up front to qualify for up to 6 cycles of in vitro fertilization treatment - and a significant refund if they don't end up with a take-home baby. \"Shared Risk is a service to our patients that shows we're willing to care for our patients' financial, as well as clinical, needs\" noted Dr. Rosenfeld. Also on The Center for Human Reproduction's team are Doctors Gerald M. Scholl, Avner Hershlag, Matthew A. Cohen and Micheline C.

And given that we have added 6 other practices across the country over the past year means other physicians are paying attention, too.\" \b \u001d  As an Affiliate in the IntegraMed provider network, The Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital will initially have distribution rights to the Company's consumer products and services - the fastest growing segment of the Company's business.

Fast-forward to 2006, when animal chiropractic services, online schools and meal-preparation companies became so popular, the nation's largest publisher of Yellow Pages directories by revenue created new categories for them. \b \u001d  \"In addition to being a great way to find local businesses, the AT&T Yellow Pages also reflects how we live,\" said Bob Mueller, director of marketing communications, AT&T Yellow Pages.  \"Keeping our animals healthy and active, learning online, and buying meals already prepared have become facets of modern life, and we reflect those trends in our books,\" Mueller said. \b \u001d  The addition of a new heading is not taken lightly at the company. It happens only after the Headings Product Team determines that a critical mass of businesses is active in that industry, and that chances are strong for future growth. It's tough to make the cut: Relatively few of the many proposals the Headings Team receives annually from sales people and advertisers are ever approved. This year, 36 new headings were added to the book (see complete list below). \b \u001d  A new animal chiropractic heading came as no surprise to Leslie Means, executive director of the American Veterinary Chiropractic Association in Bluejacket, Okla. The number of practitioners certified by the group has risen to 900 worldwide since 1990, when it became the first organization dedicated to certifying animal chiropractic practitioners and accrediting educational programs worldwide. \"We've known for some time that more vets and chiropractic doctors were treating animals with these services,\" Means said. \"So having AT&T Yellow Pages put it there in black and yellow -- for all to see -- makes perfect sense to us,\" she said. \b \b    AT&T Yellow Pages 2006 Heading Additions \b \u001d  Animal Chiropractic; Assisted Living In Home Care; Assisted Living Products & Services; Attorneys-Child Custody Law; Attorneys-Motorcycle Accidents; Attorneys-Trucking Accidents; Business Valuation; Carpets & Rug Binding; Ceramic Equip & Supplies Whsle; Churches Association of Free Lutheran Congregation; Churches Emerging Postmodern; Churches Seven Churches of God in Christ; Concrete Wall Contractors; Dentists Family Dentistry; Dentists Teeth Whitening Services; Engineers Retaining Walls; Glass Bullet Resistant; Home Improvements Disability Contractor; Immigration Services; Meal Preparation; Off Road Vehicles; Off Road Vehicles Parts & Equip; Paving Stones Concrete Contractors; Photographers Sports; Post Cards Collectible; Pottery Instruction; Project Management; Real Estate; Staging Service; Schools Online; Stair Lifts; Surrogacy Information & Services; Virtual Tours; Water Blasting Equip & Services; Water Lines Installation Replacement & Repair; Water Stores Retail; Wheelchairs Parts & Accessories. \b \b    Products and services are provided by subsidiaries of AT&T Inc. \b \u001d  This AT&T release and other news announcements are available as part of an RSS feed at http://www.att.com/rss . \b \b    About AT&T \b \u001d  AT&T is a premier communications holding company in the United States and worldwide, with operating subsidiaries providing services under the AT&T brand.

The notion of a bid from VT Group or BAE also may have helped lift shares 400% in the last couple of years. \u001d  But the Royal Navy's cutbacks may undermine investors' assumptions about Babcock, especially the view that its diversified businesses make it low risk. \u001d  More than half the navy's ships are set to be mothballed. So desperate is the Ministry of Defence to save money to pay for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that two aircraft carriers that have been in the pipeline for years may now be canceled. Or so suspects the recently retired head of the navy, Sir Alan West. \u001d  This may seem far fetched, but then it was unimaginable until recently that the government could be so shortsighted and irresponsible as to consider closing one of the U.K.'s three remaining three naval bases. \u001d  The ministry may have no choice but to close Portsmouth - the only base that could accommodate 65,000-ton aircraft carriers - if it is forced to ax a base. Plymouth's Devonport dry docks and Faslane have been saved by the decision to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent. \u001d  The final assembly work for the carriers is supposed to take place at its Rosyth site, which accounts for 16% of its turnover and profit. And 40% of Rosyth's work is naval. \u001d  Navy cutbacks would also threaten to lower the value and growth potential of Devonport Management just as the ministry considers whether to force Halliburton subsidiary KBR to sell its 51% stake. One of various possibilities is that Babcock buys it. \u001d  In the meantime, investors must cross their fingers and hope that Babcock's First Engineering does not lose its place as one of Network Rail's contractors as Network Rail seeks to cut the contractors to four from six. \u001d  That could wipe out 20% of Babcock's business, but First Engineering, which has been winning contracts and gaining market share from Jarvis, is run by a former Network Rail executive, and may be well placed to be among the four. \u001d  Babcock's interim results in November were excellent, with underlying profit growth of 19% and revenue growth of 14%. And free cash flow is also on an improving trend. \u001d  But until the uncertainty about Babcock's rail and navy business is resolved, investors may question whether it still deserves to be trading at a modest premium to the sector -  on a P/E of 18.2X and an EV/EBITDA of 11.3 times expected earnings in 2007. \u001d  (Martin Fluck joined Dow Jones Newswires in 2006.

(NYSE:HIT), and digital home solutions provider Blue Peach today announced the Blue Peach NAS Digital Media Server with next generation multimedia search provided by the Hitachi Entier relational database management system (RDBMS), which delivers an application-optimized platform with unique, powerful local search capabilities and reduces code by a factor of up to 20-fold. The addition of the Entier database will provide developers using the Blue Peach Digital Media Server solution the ability to design devices that allow consumers to search for the digital entertainment content they want in a more natural manner. \b \u001d  Developers and device manufacturers using the Blue Peach Digital Media Server, a commercial off-the-shelf platform for manufacturers of digital media devices such as digital video recorders (DVRs), digital cameras and MP3 music players, now will be able to offer consumers cutting-edge content management functionality thanks to Entier. This functionality allows users to personalize search by tagging, browsing and finding the exact piece of content, the way they want, quickly and efficiently. \b \u001d  With Entier, the Blue Peach Digital Media Server solution enables consumers who are using Blue Peach to network their home entertainment devices a robust and efficient way to search and gain access to music, movies and other digital files from any networked device in the home. By incorporating Entier and its next-generation search capabilities, the new Blue Peach solution enables consumers to not only find specific files but also find entertainment content to suit their mood, without being constrained by vendor-defined categories such as artist or title. \b \u001d  \"Today's digital entertainment devices put an unprecedented amount of content at consumers' fingertips,\" said Steven King, vice president of sales and marketing, Hitachi Embedded Business Group. \"Storing, categorizing and finding all that content, however, has become an increasingly complicated task. It is especially difficult in a media server environment such as the Blue Peach Digital Media Server, which can contain a wide variety of content and tens of thousands of individual content files. Consumers need more than generic search capabilities to find content in a manner more along the lines they think: 'Find me pictures from my last vacation,' 'Find me music with this mood for my dinner party.' To do this, vendors need a fully functional database management system to host the data, accompanied by the new advanced search features supplied by Entier to quickly and efficiently manage and find their music, pictures, video and other content in a more personalized and powerful way.\" \b \u001d  Blue Peach CTO Rich Schmitt said: \"Managing digital content in the home is a new challenge that requires a new, high-powered solution. The digital home will be more like a traditional business enterprise. Data availability, reliability and scalability are required. The Entier solution allows us to achieve these goals within an embedded environment more effectively, as it reduces development code by up to 20 fold in the key areas around search and data management. Blue Peach's networked digital home solutions allow manufacturers to make it easier than ever for consumers to manage and enjoy their digital content whenever they want, on any networked device. The Hitachi Entier embedded database is uniquely suited to this task.\" \b \u001d  The Blue Peach Digital Media Server allows for the centralized storage, aggregation and categorization of digital content. Consumers can use the Digital Media Server to network all their digital media players (DVRs, MP3 players, digital cameras, etc.) and personal computers, allowing content to be searched, browsed and played on any networked device in the home. The Blue Peach Digital Media Server offers standards-based interoperability with video, audio and photo players, and can be integrated with Blue Peach's network-attached storage and RAID software, and integrated with leading commercial Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and proprietary kernels. \b \u001d  The Entier embedded database management system is based on the technology that makes Hitachi's HiRDB one of the top-selling RDBMS products in Japan. Entier is designed for small footprint consumer devices that require a fast, powerful standards-based database manager. While a typical RDBMS provides simple search of data, Entier offers two powerful application-optimized search technologies that make a device easier to use, more responsive, while at the same time dramatically reducing the amount of code an embedded application developer needs to write. \b \u001d  The first of these application optimizations provides the ability to search multidimensional, or \"3D,\" data. This means that an Entier-enabled device can conduct a spatial, or multidimensional, search using the SQL language. By searching a variety of qualitative tags defined by the consumer, Entier can search for content that has qualities similar to other files - for example, finding music of a certain tempo or a movie not too scary for young children. Secondly, Entier offers incremental text search, which progressively executes the search, narrowing down the results with each keystroke. This is useful for any application that involves searching for specific entries by name, such as song or movie titles. \b \u001d  The Hitachi Embedded Business Group will be exhibiting with Mentor Graphics at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas beginning Jan. 8, 2007, at the Sands Convention Center, booth 72156. \b \b   Availability \b \u001d  For more information regarding the Blue Peach Digital Media Server, please call 877-BLU-PEACH or email info@bluepeach.com \b \b   About Blue Peach \b \u001d  Blue Peach develops software and hardware products that enable the ongoing device revolution. Our products are specifically designed to share digital multimedia content among network enabled consumer electronic products. Our products are designed with portability onto traditional embedded RTOSes resulting in a digital home suite appropriate for most OEM products. Blue Peach's flagship product is the Blue Stream NAS Digital Media Server; a full-featured integrated hardware and software platform based on the Intel IOP321 I/O and IntelR 80219 general purpose PCI processors, Mentor Graphic's NucleusPLUS RTOS, and Blue Peach's digital home product suite. www.bluepeach.com. \b \b   About Hitachi \b \u001d  Hitachi Entier is a sophisticated, lightweight data manager for consumer, commercial and mobile devices.

That was down from 31.2% in November, although ahead of December 2005's 29.3% share. \u001d  For the whole of 2006, Fiat secured a 30.7% slice of Italy's new car market, up from 28.0% for 2005. \u001d  While Fiat put a brave face on the drop, noting that December's numbers meant its market share was above 30% for the entire year, last month's percentage was its lowest in 2006, beating January's 30.8%. \u001d  The setback comes at a pivotal moment for Fiat as it bids to secure the turnaround from years of losses achieved under charismatic Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne through a program of cost cuts and asset sales. \u001d  At the end of this month it launches its first major new model in 17 months, the Fiat Bravo. But the Bravo is positioned in the mid-range family car segment of the market, a segment in which it has struggled in the past, rather than the compact segment in which it has repeatedly demonstrated it ability to come up with winning models. \u001d  Analysts had speculated that Fiat, whose core auto division returned to profit through the first nine months of 2006 on strong sales of its flagship compact model, the Grande Punto, might find it difficult to hang onto market share through the end of the year as competitors rolled out new models in its segment of the market. The Grande Punto was launched in Italy amid much fanfare in September 2005. \u001d  Sales of Fiat's eponymous brand, though boosted in recent months by the Grande Punto, fell to 23.4% of all new cars registered in December from 24.1% a month earlier. \u001d  That meant the Fiat brand ended the year with exactly the same share of the market it had in January 2006. \u001d  Overall, the number of new cars registered in Italy, Fiat's biggest market by far, dropped 2.6% in December to 139,172 from 142,819 in the same month a year earlier. \u001d  For the full year, Italian new car registrations grew 3.7% to 2.32 million from 2.24 million in 2005. \u001d  Meanwhile, French December car registration data, posted earlier Tuesday, also showed a slowdown for Fiat last month, taking the shine off what has been a good year for the company in France, where it outperformed the market as a whole. \u001d  Its new car registrations in France slipped 7.6% in December to 5,500 vehicles from 5,950 in the same month a year earlier. The overall French market for new cars shrank 11%. \u001d  For the full year, Fiat still posted growth of 7.5% in new car registrations in France, while the French market for new cars as a whole slipped 3.3%. \b \b   Ministry Web site: http://www.infrastrutturetrasporti.it \b   Company Web site: http://www.fiatgroup.com \b \u001d  -By Kenneth Maxwell, Dow Jones Newswires; +39-02-5821 9901; kenneth.maxwell@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 14:11 ET (19:11 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"dbfaa266ec802b34e14623ee68d8cdd0","symR":["GFI","GFI.JO","ZAE000018123"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gold Fields Exec VP Walker Dies In Car Accident >GFI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T10:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GFI","GFI.JO","ZAE000018123"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Gold Fields Ltd.

The transaction will result in a cash distribution to Lennar and its current partner, LNR Property Corporation, of approximately $660 million each.  The transaction is expected to generate profits for financial statement purposes of approximately $500 million for Lennar, of which approximately $125 million will be recognized at closing and approximately $375 million will be deferred over future years. The Company will also enter into option contracts with LandSource to purchase land contributed by the new partner and will retain its option contracts and rights of first offer to purchase land owned by LandSource prior to the transaction. In addition, the Company will receive management fees over the next eleven years and will retain an interest in LandSource of approximately 19%. \b \u001d  As of July 1, 2006, LandSource had assets with a book value of approximately $1.3 billion, with its primary investment being The Newhall Land and Farming Company. Under the terms of the agreement, the LandSource assets are valued at approximately $2.6 billion, with a potential increase adjustment to that value of over $600 million. \b \u001d  In the context of the LandSource announcement, the Company is providing preliminary deliveries, new orders, backlog and selected financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2006, including fourth quarter 2006 estimated asset valuation adjustments. \b \u001d  During the quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2006, the Company delivered 14,006 homes and a record 49,568 homes, respectively, compared to 14,403 homes and 42,359 homes in the same periods last year, an increase of 17% for fiscal year 2006. New orders for the quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2006 were 9,606 and 42,212, respectively, down 6% and 3%, compared to the same periods last year.  The Company's total dollar value of homes in backlog as of November 30, 2006 was $4.0 billion, compared to $6.9 billion as of November 30, 2005.  Although deliveries increased during the fiscal year, the Company experienced materially lower gross margins on home sales during the quarter and year ended November 30, 2006, compared to the same periods as last year, as a result of deteriorating market conditions in the homebuilding industry. \b \u001d  The Company is in the process of completing its inventory valuation analysis, and presently anticipates that it will incur pretax inventory valuation adjustments, write-offs of deposits and preacquisition costs related to land under option that the Company does not intend to purchase and valuation adjustments to its investments in unconsolidated entities within a range of $400 million to $500 million during the fourth quarter of 2006. \b \u001d  Prior to the valuation adjustments and write-offs, the Company expects its fourth quarter earnings to be within a range of $0.70 per share to $0.75 per share.  Subsequent to the valuation adjustments and write-offs, the Company expects a loss within a range of $0.88 per share to $1.28 per share for its fourth quarter ended November 30, 2006. \b \u001d  Stuart Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Corporation, said, \"The recapitalization of LandSource uniquely positions it with substantial capital and sponsorship to access the $10 billion to $15 billion of real estate that is coming back on the market.  The resulting cash distribution to us and our current partner, LNR Property Corporation, of approximately $660 million each, validates the substantial value that has been created in this venture.\" \b \u001d  Mr. Miller continued, \"Market conditions continued to weaken throughout the fourth quarter and we have not yet seen tangible evidence of a market recovery.  While we are hopeful that low interest rates, strong employment and a healthy economy will help stimulate a recovery in 2007, we have continued to focus on strengthening our balance sheet by delivering our backlog, selling inventory aggressively and renegotiating our land positions.  We ended the 2006 fiscal year with zero outstanding on our $2.7 billion revolving credit facility and over $600 million of cash on the balance sheet. \b \u001d  \"Given the steep decline in many of our markets, we are completing our asset-by-asset review and will adjust asset balances to reflect fair value in the current market environment.  Accordingly, we expect to record pretax impairment charges of $400 million to $500 million.\" \b \u001d  These results are preliminary and unaudited and will be reviewed by the \bAudit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.   The Company will release earnings for the quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2006 before the market opens on January 17, 2007.  Additionally, the Company will hold a conference call on January 17, 2007 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to further discuss the LandSource transaction and the Company's results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. \b \u001d  The call will be broadcast live on the Internet and can be accessed through Lennar's website at www.lennar.com.  If you are unable to participate during the live webcast, the call will be archived at www.lennar.com for 90 days. \b \u001d  In order to listen to the live event, a participant must have a multimedia computer with speakers and Windows Media Player.

As a result of Eaton's active acquisition program, Fitch views Eaton's leverage as being somewhat high for the rating category. However, the ratings incorporate Fitch's assumption that Eaton will use its free cash flow to control debt and leverage over the long term. The company has exercised disciplined financial policies in the past and it has the capacity to reduce debt quickly in the absence of material acquisitions or share repurchases. Eaton has successfully integrated previous acquisitions and continues to realign its business portfolio to reduce its exposure to the cyclical truck and automotive markets. These factors help to offset rating concerns about competitive environments in many of Eaton's markets as well as the expected downturn in the truck segment in 2007. \u001d  Argo-Tech makes fuel pumps and systems for aerospace engines and airframes as well as fueling systems for commercial and military aerospace markets. The business will boost Eaton's aerospace revenues to approximately $1.5 billion upon completion of the acquisition expected in the first quarter of 2007. AT Holdings' non-aerospace businesses will not be included in the transaction. \u001d  Fitch currently rates Eaton Corporation as follows: \u001d  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --Senior unsecured bank facilities 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'; --Commercial Paper 'F1'. \u001d  The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Internally, we have strict quality measures in place to achieve this, which includes working closely with our chassis suppliers, like Ford, to maintain the integrity of the chassis while also building a superior product. We work extremely hard to achieve this rating from Ford, and will continue to strive to meet and exceed customers expectations with the quality found in our motor homes.\" \b \u001d  The highest honor Ford awards to vehicle modifiers, the QVM rating is based on an assessment of a modifier's engineering capability, design and build process controls, management commitment and quality control procedures. According to Ford, the purpose of the program is to assure vehicle modifiers have the capability and processes in place to complete the vehicle in a repeatable manner that maintains the integrity of the Ford chassis system, meets Federal and other standards in place at the time of the build, and provides end users with a quality built vehicle that meets their expectations. Winnebago Industries has received Ford's \"fully meets\" classification since the program's inception in 1997. \b \u001d  In addition, Winnebago Industries recently received its 11th consecutive Quality Circle Award from the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (RVDA). Quality Circle Award winners are determined by the Dealer Satisfaction Index (DSI) survey, which RVDA conducts annually with its dealer organization.

Over 99% of the votes cast at the meeting were voted in favour of the special resolution authorizing the Reorganization. The business of the Fund will be carried on through four limited partnerships directly or indirectly owned by the Fund. The Fund received an income tax ruling from the Canada Revenue Agency on December 12, 2006 in respect of the reorganization. For Unitholders, the Reorganization does not result in a change to the number, type or ownership of the outstanding units of the Fund. In addition, there will be no impact on the daily operations of the Fund. \b \b\"We are pleased our Unitholders have overwhelmingly endorsed the reorganization that has now been concluded,\" stated Michael Andrews, President and CEO of the Fund. \"We believe that this simplification of our structure is a model that will help maximize Unitholder value.\" \b \bIn 2005 Amtelecom paid net corporate income tax of $0.15 million which represented 2% of cash available for distribution to Unitholders. A similar amount is expected to be paid in 2006. Over time, taxes at the corporate level were forecast to grow significantly, given the Fund's current growth and expected reduction in the tax benefit derived from the issuance costs of its Initial Public Offering in 2003. The conversion to a flow through structure should result in the elimination of corporate income taxes from the Fund's income trust model thereby maximizing the amount of cash available for distribution to Unitholders. Moving Amtelecom into a fund-on-partnership flow through structure allows for maximum tax efficiency over the next four year years until the federal government's proposed measures to introduce a tax at source of 31.5% on distributions for publicly traded flow through entities, which would include the Fund, takes effect beginning in the year 2011. \b \bAbout Amtelecom Income Fund \b \bAmtelecom Income Fund is an unincorporated, open-ended, limited purpose trust established under the laws of the Province of Ontario to invest in telecommunications and closely related businesses. The Fund, through its wholly owned operating partnerships and subsidiaries, is the local telephone service provider to several regions in southwestern and central Ontario currently providing services through approximately 26,900 residential and business access lines. The Fund also provides cable television service to approximately 8,800 subscribers and Internet services to approximately 13,000 subscribers. \b \bCertain statements in this press release are forward-looking and are subject to important risks and uncertainties.

(NYSE: ORA) today announced that two of its subsidiaries have entered into Supply and Engineering, Procurement and Construction contracts with Ngawha Generation Ltd., a subsidiary of Top Energy Limited (\"Top Energy\") for a new geothermal power plant in Ngawha, New Zealand.  The contracts are for a total of approximately $20 million, with construction of the power plant expected to be completed within 20 months from the contract date.  Top Energy is an environmentally friendly, local electricity network company in New Zealand. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20040422/LATH066LOGO ) \b \u001d  This is the second order for an Ormat geothermal power plant from the company.  Top Energy has been operating an Ormat 12 MW geothermal power plant in Ngawha since June 1998.  Both plants will produce approximately 75% of the electricity used by Top Energy's 26,000 consumers, thereby further reducing the amount of electricity, which would otherwise be generated by scarce non- renewable resources that produce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. \b \u001d  Upon completion of the plant, the total installed capacity of Ormat's power plants in New Zealand will exceed 200 MW.  The Ngawha plant contract is the tenth Ormat supply contract in New Zealand, six of which are repeat contracts for the supply of geothermal power plants in New Zealand. \b \u001d  Lucien Y. Bronicki, Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer of Ormat Technologies, said, \"This contract brings a new geothermal power plant to New Zealand and provides further confidence in Ormat's effectiveness and reliability. We are more than pleased with our progress over the past 25 years in New Zealand and remain confident that the efficient and sustainable use of geothermal resources, with its emission reduction and the prudent and modular development, will continue to attract medium and small developers such as medium size utilities, land owners and private investors, as well as the traditional large utilities\". \b \u001d  Mr. Bronicki continued, \"New Zealand is a significant resource for geothermal development, which we believe will provide Ormat with additional growth opportunities that we look forward to developing.\" \b \u001d  The new plant will optimize energy utilization by converting both geothermal steam and brine from geothermal wells into electric power energy. Unlike the flash steam turbine plants that deplete the resources by consuming water in the cooling towers, the new plant, as all existing Ormat plants in New Zealand will reinject 100% of the geothermal fluid by using air-cooled condensers.  The 100% reinjection serves both to sustain the reservoir and to produce electrical power with virtually no environmental impact. \b \b    About Ormat Technologies \b \u001d  Ormat Technologies, Inc. is a vertically integrated company primarily engaged in the geothermal and recovered energy power business.  The Company designs, develops, builds, owns and operates geothermal power plants.  Ormat is a pioneer in Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology and a leader in the manufacture of ORC power equipment. \b \u001d  It also designs, develops and builds, and owns and operates, recovered energy-based power plants.

The following is a summary of its prospectus, as provided to the SEC: \b \bTHE COMPANY \u001d  Omneon Video Networks, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., provides digital content storage and processing systems for media companies. \u001d  The company develops a range of video servers, active storage systems and related software applications that media companies use to simultaneously ingest, process, store, manage and deliver digital media in a wide range of formats. \u001d  The company's customers include system integrators, such as Ascent Media Group and Netorium, and end users, such as British Broadcasting Corp., British Sky Broadcasting, Discovery Communications Inc. and Turner Entertainment, a division of Time Warner Inc. (TWX). \b \bOFFERING INFORMATION \u001d  Omneon Video filed to sell up to $115 million in common stock, but didn't detail the terms of the offering. \u001d  The company said some of the shares will be offered by selling stockholders. It won't receive any proceeds from the sale of stock by the selling stockholders. \u001d  Omneon Video said it intends to use the net proceeds to the company for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include possible acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. \u001d  The company said it has applied for listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol OMNE. \u001d  JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank Securities, Canaccord Adams Needham & Co. and JMP Securities are listed as underwriters for the offering. \b \bEARNINGS \b                     Nine Months Ended Sept. 30, \b                         2006             2005 \bRevenue              $60,271,000      $36,328,000 \bGross profit          36,610,000       22,084,000 \bOperating income       5,809,000        2,242,000 \bNet income             6,328,000        1,407,000 \b \bGROWTH STRATEGY \u001d  The company said it intends to continue to expand its leadership in the broadcast video server market, provide active storage solutions to the digital media industry, expand its portfolio of content management applications, continue to involve customers in strategic product planning, pursue partnerships and complementary acquisitions and expand into new and adjacent markets. \b \bRISK FACTORS \u001d  The company has been profitable in recent periods. However, the company had an accumulated deficit of $56 million as of Sept. 30, 2006. This accumulated deficit is attributable to net losses incurred from its inception in 1998 through 2004 before it first achieved profitability. \u001d  The company said it may not succeed in maintaining or increasing profitability and could incur losses in future periods. \u001d  The company faces intense competition. Its major competitors include Avid Technology Inc. (AVID), Harris Corp. (HRS), SeaChange International Inc. (SEAC) and Thomson S.A. (TMS). \u001d  The company has significant international operations and derives a large portion of its revenues from international customers, which exposes it to significant risks. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2006, the company derived 63% of total revenues from international customers. \u001d  The company uses system integrators to sell its products. These system integrators can have a substantial influence on purchase decisions by end users. The company's business could be harmed if these system integrators do not market and support the company's systems successfully. \u001d  The company introduced its MediaGrid product, an active storage system, in April 2006, and only began deriving revenues from sales of this product during the third quarter of 2006. MediaGrid system may require further refinements before broad customer adoption can be achieved. \b \bMANAGEMENT \b \bName                Age   Position \bJoseph S. Kennedy   60    president and chief executive \bLawrence R. Kaplan  56    chairman \bDonald M.

Prior to joining the company, Kennedy served as president, CEO and chairman of Pluris Inc., a developer of scalable Internet routers, from June 1999 to March 2002. \u001d  Kaplan is a co-founder of Omneon and has served as chairman since June 2003 and as a director since inception.

(SBUX) is cutting trans fats from the doughnuts, muffins and other treats in half of its U.S. stores, and plans to eventually drop the artery-clogging fats from company-operated coffeehouses across the country. \u001d  The world's largest specialty coffee retailer has been working to eliminate trans fats from its food menu for about two years, spokesman Brandon Borrman said Tuesday. \u001d  \"This is just something we have been working on, and our focus has always been on providing our customers with healthy and nutritious food options,\" Borrman said. \u001d  Trans fats, listed on food labels as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, are believed to be harmful because they wreak havoc on cholesterol levels. \u001d  Stand-alone Starbucks stores in Seattle; San Francisco; Chicago; Los Angeles; San Diego; Boston; New York; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; and Portland, Ore., will have zero trans fats in their food as of Wednesday, Borrman said. \u001d  Getting the other half of U.S. stores to follow suit will take more time, as the company adjusts recipes with regional bakers and food suppliers. \u001d  However, Starbucks already had quietly replaced the fats in its nationally distributed food products, such as its seasonal pumpkin muffins and gingerbread, Borrman said. \u001d  In December, New York became the first American city to ban artificial trans fats in restaurants and eateries. With some exceptions, restaurants will be barred from using spreads and frying oils containing artificial trans fats by July 1. \u001d  All other foods in the city, including doughnuts, cookies and pies that use partially hydrogenated vegetable oil for texture, will have to be trans fat-free by July 2008. \u001d  New York's ban didn't play a part in Starbucks' switch, Borrman said. \u001d  Starbucks has about 5,600 company-owned coffeehouses in the U.S. Other retail sites, such as kiosks in airports and grocery stores, are licensed by the company but operated by other businesses. \u001d  Starbucks posted net fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $117.3 million, or 15 cents a share, in October, on revenue of $2 billion. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 14:01 ET (19:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e26bb50c67fd7d8a552e6762a22b7156","symR":["500257.BY","PFE","TEVA","TEVA.TV","IL0006290147","INE326A01029","US7170811035"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Lupin Pharma Gets Tentative Approval Of Generic Zoloft","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T16:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["500257.BY","PFE","TEVA","TEVA.TV","IL0006290147","INE326A01029","US7170811035"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Lupid Ltd.'s Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc. unit said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted tentative approval for the company's abbreviated new drug application for Sertraline Hydrochloride tablets, 25, 50 and 100 milligrams. \u001d  Pending final approval, Lupin's Sertraline tablets will be the AB-rated generic equivalent of Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE) Zoloft tablets, indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder. \u001d  The branded product had annual sales of $3.1 billion for the 12 months ended July 2006, based on IMS sales data, said Lupin, which is based in India. \u001d  Final approval is expected in February. \u001d  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

We risk, for example, having to pay heavy adjustment costs because of sharp economic expansions and contractions, as well as nipping growth in the bud.  The ideal recipe is to achieve a gradual normalization of interest rates as the economy itself gets back to normal.\" \u001d  In the interview, Muto said he sees the current economic expansion as sustainable. \u001d  \"As the virtuous cycle of production, income and expenditures - a basic economic mechanism - remains sturdy, there is a good chance that this expansion has staying power. \u001d  \"Sluggish consumption stems from temporary factors such as unseasonable weather and consumers holding off on purchases as they wait for the launch of new products. \u001d  \"While base wages are hardly budging, overtime and bonuses are rising. The impact of the strong corporate earnings is steadily spilling over to the household sector through dividend payments and other channels.\" \u001d  The key to sustaining the current recovery, he noted, is \"The mechanism through which corporate profits trickle down to households.  This process, however, is delayed.

Other than in the aftermath of the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, when much of New York's financial district was in chaos, closures for more than one business day have been rare. The only other times it happened this century were at the end of World War II in August 1945, during Roosevelt's 1933 banking holiday in the depth of the Great Depression and following the U.S. entry into World War I. \u001d  The New York Stock Exchange - which traditionally has set the tone for market closings - hesitated until Friday morning before deciding on a full-day closure, allowing the Nasdaq Stock Market (NDAQ) to preempt it by making its decision Thursday evening. That early announcement could be interpreted as a coming-of-age for the electronic exchange, which started operations in 1971, nearly 180 years after the tradition-steeped NYSE opened its doors. John Thain, NYSE Group Inc. (NYX) president, quickly responded Friday with the decision to close. \u001d  \"My NYSE Group colleagues and I join all Americans in mourning the loss of President Ford, a man of great integrity and vision, and a dedicated public servant,\" he said in a statement. \"It is appropriate that we honor President Ford and celebrate the life of a truly great American.\" \u001d  Several attempts to reach the NYSE were unsuccessful Tuesday over possible reasons for delaying its decision until Friday. An ostensible reason for avoiding a full four-day closure of U.S. equity markets was that a terrorist incident or major geopolitical event over the New Year's Day holiday might prompt an exaggerated selloff in stocks or a damaging surge in volume when trading resumed after such a long break. \u001d  \"That is a concern, but traders had enough warning on this and knew you'd have this block,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist for Hartford Financial. \u001d  Traders holding risky positions vulnerable to outside events typically reduce risk heading into long holiday weekends - especially in the post September 11 era. As of Tuesday afternoon, there was no significant market-moving news to roil equities, with virtually every European and Asian equity market registering gains. The Federal Reserve Bank delayed the release of the minutes from its Dec. 12 Federal Open Market Committee meeting until Wednesday, removing a potential catalyst for volatility. \u001d  Krosby noted that technological advances in overnight or off-exchange trading and overseas listings gave institutions that really needed to transact more ability to do so. Indeed, with the exchanges operating as for-profit institutions answerable to shareholders, the loss of revenue could have been a concern, though it is outweighed by the respect that should be shown for the occasion, said Krosby. \u001d  \"It's a loss of business, but it is respect for a president,\" she said. \"Presidents don't die every day.\" \u001d  Most recently, markets were closed for a full day following the deaths of former presidents Reagan in 2004 and Nixon in 1994. Other full closings in the 20th century have been to remember the deaths of presidents Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy, as well as three British monarchs - Victoria, Edward VII and George V. Half-day closings were held for presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, Woodrow Wilson and Grover Cleveland. Markets were also closed for events such as J.P. Morgan's funeral, for parades celebrating figures like Charles Lindbergh and Douglas MacArthur, and for the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. \u001d  The markets have closed for less weighty reasons, too. There have been several instances in which the markets shut down after heavy activity in order to allow back offices to catch up with paperwork. \u001d  (Spencer Jakab, a columnist who provides insightful and unique takes on the stock market, previously wrote about the energy market.

This device combines superior PSRR (power supply rejection ratio) for stability and low noise for integration, making it ideally suited for GSM (global system for mobile) portable wireless applications. \u001d  In GSM cell phones, the RF PA switches on and off at a rate of 217Hz. During the on state, the RF PA sends data to the base station and the off state allows the phone to conserve battery power. During this on/off state the cell phone battery can drop as low as 500mV from its nominal voltage. The ISL9003A with a PSRR of 90dB is immune to these wide voltage drops, providing a very stable output voltage rail and continuous 150mA of load current. \u001d  The ISL9003A, with an output noise of just 20uVRMS, also provides a discrete solution that enables integration of several modules or functions into a cell phone.  This low noise, along with the PSRR, allows this device to be interfaced with an RX transceiver module or a camera module in a cell phone, as applications like this require a high level of performance that is not often achieved in integrated PMIC solutions. \u001d  \"The ISL9003A provides outstanding low noise and low quiescent current and ripple rejection, critical for handheld and cell phone applications.  All of these features are housed in a very tiny package solution of 1.6x1.6mm uTDFN,\" said Andrew Rhind, vice president and general manager of Intersil's Consumer Power products group.  \"High performance is achieved through a circuit that delivers fast transient response to varying load conditions, and in a quiescent condition the ISL9003A adjusts its biasing to achieve the lowest possible standby current consumption.  This is an incredibly high-performing part that gives customers the extra level of performance required for handheld and cell phone applications.\" \u001d  High Performance and Low Power Consumption \u001d  The ISL9003A has a no-load quiescent current of 30uA (typical) and 0.5uA shutdown current and is stable with 1uF of MLCC output capacitance with an ESR of up to 200 Ohms.  It comes in many fixed voltage options with +/-1.8%output voltage accuracy over temperature, line and load.

He expects the U.S. economy to show \"sustained but very moderate strength\" next year, with the rate of growth possibly slipping from this year's level but remaining positive. \u001d  Lieber said factors supporting his forecast include recent weakening of the dollar - which should help buoy U.S. exports - as well as continued spending for U.S. military operations in Iraq. \u001d  His fund, with about $100 million in assets and rated three stars out of five by Morningstar, has returned just shy of 10% year to date as of Thursday compared with about 12% for its mixed-asset peer group, and 14.13% for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in the same period. For three years, the fund has returned 10.8%, compared with 9.3% for the peer group and 11.3% for the S&P. \u001d  Lieber said it's no surprise that the fund has lagged the S&P 500 because it attempts to mitigate downside risk with a healthy dose of fixed-income assets. In addition, he said a prior bet on homebuilding stocks has recently hurt the fund's return as the sector has retrenched, although he thinks the housing market is likely to rally next year. \u001d  \"In a few months, demand will turn around,\" Lieber said. \u001d  Such a stance is in keeping with the Alpine Dynamic Balance Fund's generally contrarian bent. Lieber said he looks for stocks that appear undervalued, and he also takes a long-term view. \u001d  \"We tend to buy issues which are at least out of fashion, if not out of favor, and then we sit patiently,\" he said. \u001d  Stocks he likes at the moment include conglomerate General Electric Co. (GE), which has been on the rise in recent weeks and is up about 7% this year. \u001d  Regardless, Lieber contends the stock, trading recently around $38 a share, could climb by another $10 or so, although he declined to predict when. He said GE has an excellent collection of businesses but has largely been overlooked by investors because they think it's too big and cumbersome. \u001d  \"It hasn't attracted the fast money,\" Lieber said. \u001d  Likewise, Lieber cited Temple-Inland Inc. (TIN), up about 1% year to date at about $46 a share. Temple-Inland has a division that makes corrugated packaging, as well as a forest-products division and a banking division. \u001d  Lieber said the company could spin off all three operations - by turning the forest-products division into a real estate investment trust, for instance - and get more value from them. \u001d  \"The assets will be worth substantially more than the present price\" under such a scenario, he said. \u001d  Thor Industries Inc. (THO) is another stock he likes. The company makes a variety of recreational vehicles and buses. Thor shares, trading recently around $44, are up around 9% for the year. \u001d  Despite the rise, Lieber said, high energy prices have been a drag on Thor's stock, with investors fearing that customers will shy away from large, fuel-hungry vehicles. Lieber doesn't see that happening, however, pointing out that the company has logged solid performance. \u001d  He thinks the stock is poised to revisit its 52-week high of $56.93 set on April 4, and possibly continue climbing from there. \u001d  \"I don't see why it can't even go higher,\" he said. \u001d  (Bob Sechler covers Texas for Dow Jones Newswires.) \u001d  -By Bob Sechler, Dow Jones Newswires; 512-236-9637 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e899627d42437012ff35e72236638e28","symR":["GM","US3704421052"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(1/2) Can The New-Look Malibu Help Jump-Start Chevy?","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T05:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GM","US3704421052"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \b   By Joseph B. White \u001d  Say \"Chevy Malibu,\" and some Americans think of a 1960s muscle car. Unfortunately for General Motors Corp., many more think, \"rent-a-car.\" \u001d  Now, GM is unveiling a revamped look for the Malibu sedan, as part of a broad effort to convince people shopping for a car priced below $30,000 to pause on their march to Toyota Motor Corp. or Honda Motor Co. dealerships. \u001d  Today, GM officially takes the wraps off the complete design for the 2008 Chevrolet Malibu -- almost a year before the first production models are scheduled to hit showrooms. (Part of the car has been seen in teaser photos) GM is trying to generate as much early buzz as possible for the redesigned car, in part to build investor confidence in its turnaround strategy. Chevrolet, GM's highest-volume division, plans a significant launch in early 2008 that GM officials say will compare to the image overhaul executed several years ago for Cadillac. \u001d  The new Malibu \"will be the beginning of a very big transformation for our car lineup,\" says Cheryl Catton, general director of marketing for Chevrolet cars. \u001d  GM's Vice Chairman for product development Robert Lutz says the new Malibu's more refined looks, improved ride and quieter interior are a milestone in the company's multiyear effort to upgrade the look and feel of its sedans and coupes. Now Chevy is going for a more international feel --  a European look with an inside that borrows from 1960s American style. \u001d  \"It's a poster boy for what we are trying to do,\" says Mr. Lutz, who joined GM in 2001 with a mandate to lead a revitalization of its vehicle design. \u001d  The Malibu faces a difficult assignment that has overwhelmed a series of new GM cars over the past decade. GM retired the Malibu name in the 1980s and then brought it back in 1997 and slapped it on a midsize, front-wheel drive sedan nothing like the brawny rear-drive muscle cars that bore that name during the 1960s and 1970s. \u001d  Starting in the late 1990s, Chevrolet tried to position the car as an alternative to the conservatively styled Japanese sedans that dominate the midsize segment. GM engineers carefully tried to match the functions, features and specifications of the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. As for styling, Mr. Lutz says, the thinking was \"if the Camry is doing so well and it's bland, it means they like bland. Unfortunately, bland only works for the Camry.\" \u001d  Although Chevrolet has thousands more dealers than Toyota, Malibu's retail sales volume of about 100,000 to 125,000 cars a year is less than a third the Camry's total annual sales. As of December, the Malibu sold for an average of $17,939, after an average customer cash rebate of $2,438, according to  data collected from dealers by the Power Information Network. The Accord and Camry had no customer cash rebates, and were selling for an average $22,402 and $23,441 respectively. Ford Motor Co.'s Fusion midsize sedan was selling for an average $20,081 with a customer rebate of $1,069. \u001d  GM won't try to outsell the Camry with the new Malibu, in part because GM also positions its larger Impala sedan as a Camry fighter. But GM does want to close the pricing and profitability gap. Mr. Lutz says that's where better design comes in. \u001d  On the outside, the 2008 Malibu looks German, with an exterior profile and proportions similar to a Volkswagen Passat. \u001d  Mr. Lutz and GM vice president for design Ed Welburn point to what makes the 2008 Malibu different from the current car: Wheels that are pushed to the edges of the sheet metal, to avoid the look of a bulky car balanced on roller skates; a chrome molding around the side glass; European-style small turn signals, or \"markers\" on the fenders. The wheelbase -- the distance between the front and rear wheels -- is about 6 inches longer than the current sedan. \u001d  The  interior is a more dramatic departure. The  dashboard has a \"dual cockpit\" look. \"It's almost a direct lift from the '58-59 Corvette interiors,\" says Mr. Lutz. \u001d  John Mack, who led the Malibu's interior design team, says most versions  will come with two-tone interiors, such as \"cocoa and cashmere.\" \u001d  All these touches cost money, as do the materials and engineering that will make the Malibu quieter inside and new standard safety equipment such as side curtain airbags and stability control. GM engineers have tried to offset  added costs by using more parts from the prior model, sharing parts with other cars such, and redesigning the body to reduce the use of expensive steels. Mr Lutz says if by putting $200 into features that make the car look better GM can cut a $4,000 rebate to $1,800 \"you are $2,000 ahead.\" \u001d  GM wants to sell fewer Malibus to one kind of customer: Rental car agencies. Those sales almost always return lower profits than sales to individuals. Instead of selling about 34% of Malibus to fleets, GM hopes to sell only about a quarter of the redesigned Malibus that way. Mr. Lutz says done right, rental sales could help GM. By selling better looking cars -- without \"gray rat's fur upholstery and dark gray plastic parts\" -- renting a GM car \"becomes a national demonstration program where people actually pay to drive a GM car, and they say, 'Holy smokes, it's fabulous.'\" \u001d  --- \u001d  Gina Chon contributed to this article \u001d  --- \u001d  WSJ.com: See pictures of more Malibu models through the years, at WSJ.com/OnlineToday. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 00:00 ET (05:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e8b9a5d08d0ad48e116b905573c7ced5","symR":["UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Massachusetts Probing UBS, Hedge Fund Ties","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XGTI","XNYA","XSMI","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BOSTON (AP)--The top securities regulator in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is investigating whether leased office space and other services that investment banks provide to hedge-fund traders have created a conflict of interest that could hurt investors. \u001d  Secretary of State William Galvin said in an interview Tuesday that Switzerland-based UBS AG (UBS) was cooperating with his request for documents that he hopes will show whether hedge funds are paying higher-than-normal brokerage fees to compensate the investment bank for office space. \u001d  Galvin declined to say whether he had requested such information from banks other than UBS, or from hedge funds. But he said he was examining such lease arrangements industrywide, including services such as receptionists provided to traders in so-called hedge-fund hotels. \u001d  At issue is whether such enticements to win hedge funds' trading business lead to higher management fees that investors pay the funds, and whether the fees are adequately disclosed to investors. \u001d  \"This is about special privileges for special customers,\" Galvin told the Associated Press. \"It's really about fairness to average investors and openness in the financial-services industry.\" \u001d  Galvin said his investigation was at a preliminary stage, and it was too early to say whether the probe might lead to enforcement actions resulting from any findings of securities-law violations. \u001d  Rohini Pragasam, a spokeswoman for UBS in the firm's U.S. headquarters in New York, said the bank was cooperating with Galvin's investigation. She declined to comment further. \u001d  Galvin said information from UBS would be presented under oath. He said he didn't issue a subpoena because UBS is voluntarily cooperating in the probe, which was disclosed in stories in the New York Times and the Boston Globe on Tuesday. \u001d  UBS leases space to hedge-fund traders in a downtown Boston office tower, serving as a so-called prime broker handling trading services for hedge funds. The space comes with receptionists, espresso machines and consultants to manage information systems, the Times said. \u001d  The Times said UBS leases 400,000 square feet of space to hedge funds in a number of cities. \u001d  Galvin's investigation involves only lease agreements in Massachusetts. \u001d  He said he wasn't aware of regulators in other states or at the Securities and Exchange Commission looking into the same issues his office is investigating, although the SEC has recently put the hedge-fund industry under tighter scrutiny. \u001d  Phone messages seeking comment from the SEC and securities regulators in other states weren't returned Tuesday. SEC offices were closed in honor of the national day of mourning for former President Gerald Ford. \u001d  Hedge funds are an increasingly popular form of investing that operate under minimal government supervision. U.S. hedge funds traditionally have catered to the rich, as well as pension funds and university endowments, but are increasingly luring less wealthy investors. \u001d  Unlike mutual funds, which generally hold stocks and bonds, hedge funds can invest in anything from commodities to real estate. Some funds even buy whole companies, while others buy and sell stocks like day traders - but with billions of dollars at stake. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:23 ET (20:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e904e935675f399c85fb4188de9a6099","symR":["SIRI"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Sirius To Report Positive Free Cash Flow For 4Q >SIRI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SIRI"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XNQ1","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 15:34 ET (20:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e94ae17f5a16f3f1a4a20412efd3f3b3","symR":["TRPS"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Tripos Announces Definitive Pact To Sell Discovery Research Business>TRPS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T22:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TRPS"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 17:26 ET (22:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e9788570116dd5893d21c4960c726d1f","symR":["EBAY","GOOG","IACI","MSFT","YHOO","US2786421030","US5949181045","US9843321061"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Google Steps Up Self-Promotion With Plugs On Own Sites","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T12:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EBAY","GOOG","IACI","MSFT","YHOO","US2786421030","US5949181045","US9843321061"],"IndustryCodes":["CSV","ISV","RTB","RTS","SOF","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \b   By Riva Richmond \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  (This article was originally published Friday) \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Google Inc. (GOOG) may finally have learned how to promote itself without compromising its principles. Like its own legions of advertisers, it is marketing its products on Google.com. \u001d  The Mountain View, Calif., company shook up the advertising world - and made a very good living - by selling subtle text advertisements designed to give advertisers leads without irritating consumers. \u001d  In a similar vein, it has shunned flashy marketing for its own products and services. Unlike rivals like Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) and IAC/InteractiveCorp. (IACI) unit Ask.com, Google doesn't use banner ads or buy expensive television spots that might boost brand awareness and site traffic. And it maintains a famously austere homepage, displaying a simple set of links to search services, including those for the Web, images, video, news and maps. There are a few others available, if you click on \"more.\" \u001d  The minimalist marketing strategy has provoked periodic whistles of disapproval from investors and industry watchers concerned that many of Google's newer products - Finance, Real Estate, Answers - have been floundering because people don't know about them. They worry that feeble self-promotion could keep Google from maintaining its torrid growth rate and make its big investments in cool new products a waste of time and money. \u001d  Yet, slowly but surely, Google has been finding its own true-to-character techniques for pitching its expanding array of wares. Recently, it appears to be using its own immensely popular search site to invite users to try another product, typically in a way that is couched more as a helpful hint than a salesman's pitch. \u001d  \"They're starting to promote all these other products\" that were created or acquired during the last couple of years, says LeeAnn Prescott, an analyst at Hitwise. \u001d  The slow change underscores the tension between Google's simpler past as a search engine - epitomized by the clean homepage that won over millions of users - and its more complicated, portal-like future. The crisp look can't be shed without peril, but a menu of services requires a little clutter. \"Nobody's going to find these new tools unless they do something to promote them,\" Prescott says. \u001d  Recently, the company has run sizable promotions for its browser-toolbar download in a box at the top right corner of its homepage. It has also recently encouraged homepage visitors to download the latest version of the Firefox Web browser, a growing rival to Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) Internet Explorer browser that uses Google as its default search engine. \u001d  Google has long promoted the toolbar, and other products, on its homepage. But the recent plugs have been closer in style to banner ads - being at the top and employing graphics - than the low-key one-liners under the search box that Google has used before (Friday it is running: \"Get disorganized in 2007. Use Google Desktop to find your files.\") \u001d  Both the toolbar and the relationship with Firefox aid Google's search-query market share because they make using Google more convenient - no visit to Google.com is necessary - and can cement user loyalty. \u001d  More pitches of this sort can be expected, but Google may be unwilling to use the power of its sleek homepage much more aggressively. \u001d  \"We are committed to the clean, uncluttered user interface of the Google homepage. From time to time we promote products on the Google homepage in order to help people continue to find and access information that's important to them,\" a Google spokeswoman said in an email. \u001d  She declined to say how effective these product plugs are, but said Google constantly makes \"adjustments\" to Google.com pages to help users find information and to test new designs and user interfaces. \u001d  But it appears that even small changes can have a big impact. According to research from Hitwise, traffic to Google's Blog Search service surged 168% over a two-week period in October after Google put a simple link to the service on its Google News homepage. About 60% of its blog search traffic has come directly from Google News since then, compared with 1% before the change, Hitwise says. \u001d  \"What they're doing is very subtle,\" Prescott says. And it's \"effective, clearly, but it's almost like they do it kind of late,\" pointing out that Google Blog Search was sitting around for a long time before the company began to push it. \u001d  Hitwise has tracked how Google's past in-house promotions have led to surges in use of its services. It noted a jump last winter for Book Search, to the fifth-most-used Google service from the ninth, after Google ran a simple message at the bottom of some search-results pages reading: \"Try your search again on Google Book Search.\" \u001d  Indeed, Google's own search-results pages could be the company's best marketing tool. \u001d  \"The most effective way to promote a product is just showing it to (users) when it's relevant to what they're looking for,\" said Google Vice President Marissa Mayer in April. \u001d  \"In terms of driving traffic...that technique actually yields the most users,\" compared to links on the homepage or other types of marketing, she said, adding that it is \"the best way for us to build up a meaningful awareness of the product.\" \u001d  Google has been more liberal lately in its use of the search-results pages as a marketing tool, and in a number of different ways. \u001d  It is offering user \"tips\" that feature its products. For instance, a search for \"calendar\" produces a page topped with this friendly offer: \"Tip: Want to organize your schedule and share events with friends? Try Google Calendar.\" And searches for \"blogs\" and \"blog search\" yields a tip inviting users to create their own blog using Google's Blogger software. \u001d  These results pages, and others for books and maps, give Google's products top positions in its algorithmically determined list of relevant links, together with links to competitors' products. \u001d  In other cases, Google uses its advertising system to attract attention to its creations. For instance, a search for \"payment service\" yields a page with Google's Checkout service as the top sponsored link, while eBay Inc.'s (EBAY) rival PayPal service has the No. 6 spot. Google has said it places AdWord ads using the same interface, budgeting and return-on-investment considerations used by its advertiser customers. \u001d  -By Riva Richmond, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5670; riva.richmond@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e9ccb9a36d897c6c52fd0af2c24537b6","symR":["TDS","USM"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": TDS and U.S. Cellular to Present at the Citigroup 17th Annual Entertainment, Media and Telecommunications Conference","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T19:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TDS","USM"],"IndustryCodes":["CTS","TLS","XDJGI","XFFX","XRUS"],"Story":"\bTDS and U.S. Cellular to Present at the Citigroup 17th Annual Entertainment, Media and Telecommunications Conference \b \b\b \b   CHICAGO, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. \b(Amex: TDS, TDS.S) and United States Cellular Corporation (Amex: USM) will be \bpresenting at the Citigroup 17th Annual Entertainment, Media and \bTelecommunications Conference in Las Vegas on Jan. 9, 2007. \b\b \b   LeRoy T.

Dan said, \"The year 2006 was truly historic for the CBOT, as we improved access to the Exchange and launched several new and innovative products.  The extension of Agricultural futures to the CBOT electronic trading platform, side-by-side with open auction trading during daytime hours, combined with rising demand for Agricultural risk management tools, contributed to volume growth and expanded the Exchange's global reach.  We are proud of our accomplishments of the last 12 months, and we appreciate the confidence our market participants have shown in our products and platforms.  We look forward to providing them with new trading opportunities in 2007.\" \b \b    Ag Complex Volume Record Contributes to 40 Percent ADV Increase Over 2005 \b \u001d  In 2006, the CBOT set new high marks for total Agricultural volume (128,177,090 contracts), Agricultural futures volume (106,511,215 contracts) and Agricultural options volume (21,665,875 contracts).  ADV for the Agricultural complex reached a record 510,666 contracts in 2006, up 40 percent compared with 2005.  Increased volume on the CBOT electronic trading platform, as well as the open auction environment, contributed to the record Agricultural volume totals in 2006.  For the year, electronic ADV in the CBOT Agricultural complex was 72,571 contracts, 10 times greater than the total from 2005.  Open auction Agricultural ADV was 420,745 contracts in 2006, 23 percent greater than 2005. \b \u001d  Record 2006 volume totals in CBOT Corn and Wheat futures and options contracts contributed to the overall growth across the Exchange's Agricultural complex.  The new Corn complex record, 58,557,281 contracts traded in 2006, led to a 72 percent ADV increase compared with 2005.  The new Wheat complex record stands at 18,822,846 contracts, leading to a 58 percent increase in ADV over 2005.  The CBOT also experienced increases in its Soybean complex (7 percent), Oats complex (22 percent), and Rough Rice complex (42 percent) when comparing 2006 year-end ADV with year-end ADV from 2005. \b \b    Record Metals Complex ADV Nine Times Greater Than 2005 \b \u001d  The CBOT Metals complex experienced considerable growth in 2006 - total CBOT Metals volume reached 12,398,522 contracts for the year, nine times greater than the total from 2005.  Total 2006 ADV in the Metals complex was 49,397 contracts, nine times greater than 2005's final ADV total. \b \u001d  During 2006, the Exchange's Gold complex set an ADV record - 42,547 contracts, 10 times greater than the ADV from 2005.

And total ADV for mini-sized Gold futures was 7,948 contracts - four times greater than 2005. \b \u001d  The CBOT Silver complex also set an ADV record in 2006, with 7,006 contracts traded each day, six times greater than the prior year.  The Exchange's Full-sized (5,000 oz.) Silver futures contracts contributed to the new high mark in the Silver complex in 2006, as total year-end ADV reached a record 4,815 contracts, 13 times greater than 2005.  In December, the CBOT grew its Silver complex to 43 percent market share of the North American listed Sliver futures market.  A month earlier, the Exchange's Silver complex accounted for 34 percent of the North American listed Silver futures market. \b \b    ADV in CBOT Financial Complex Sets Record; Up 15 Percent Compared With \b \b     2005 \b \u001d  CBOT Financial complex ADV was 2,544,002 contracts in 2006, an increase of 15 percent compared with ADV from 2005.

For the year, an average of 420,839 Financial options were traded each day - a 9 percent increase compared with 2005 and a new CBOT record.  In 2006, 17 percent of all Financial options trades at the CBOT were executed electronically.  2006's ADV for electronically-traded Financial options was 72,150 contracts, more than double the total from 2005. \b \u001d  In the CBOT Interest Rate Swap complex, ADV has continued to increase since early July, when new market makers Citigroup and Goldman Sachs began to provide liquidity.

Ford served in the nation's highest office only briefly, taking the reins for just two and a half years after Richard Nixon resigned, and ultimately losing the presidency to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in part because of voter outrage over his pardon of Nixon. But however abbreviated his tenure in the executive branch, Ford was a tireless civil servant who spent decades on Capitol Hill before assuming the vice presidency from another scandal-tainted predecessor, Spiro Agnew. Bush reflected that when Ford became president, \"it was because America needed him, not because he needed the office.\" \u001d  Indeed, Ford often has been credited with calming the nation and restoring the dignity of the presidency following the harrowing days of Watergate. Tom Brokaw, the former NBC News anchorman, praised Ford for carrying \"no demons, no hidden agenda, no hit list or acts of vengeance\" to the Oval Office, in a clear reference to the feeling of paranoia that pervaded the final days of the Nixon administration. But those who worked shoulder to shoulder with the late president reminded the thousands assembled in the National Cathedral this morning that Ford should be remembered for more than simply fixing a damaged office - he also should be remembered for running it well. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger hailed Ford's efforts to balance the nuclear-arms race with the Soviet Union and to broker peace deals in the Mideast. \"In his understated way, he did his duty as a leader, not as a performer playing to the gallery,\" Kissinger said. \"Gerald Ford had the virtues of small-town America.\" \u001d  Bush's father, former President George H.W. Bush, also hailed Ford's small-town aura, calling him a \"Norman Rockwell painting come to life.\" (The senior Bush also injected some levity into the somber proceedings by joking about the famous awfulness of Ford's golf game, saying that Ford knew it was getting better since he was pinging fewer spectators with his slices.) The service marked the final Washington ceremony remembering Ford. His remains will be taken to Michigan for a final public viewing and private memorial and be interred on a hill overlooking his museum. \b \b   Markets On Hold \b \u001d  Stock markets closed up shop for the Ford funeral, giving traders four days off in a row for the first time since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Bond markets were open, though trading was on a shortened schedule, with markets due to close at 2 p.m. EST. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was around 4.69%. The dollar was slightly lower in light trading. Crude-oil prices fell in electronic trading, dipping about 55 cents to $60.50 a barrel. The Ford memorial led the Federal Reserve to delay the release of the minutes of its December meeting until Wednesday, and the Institute for Supply Management, which was due to release its latest factory index this morning, also pushed its report back a day. \b \b   Nucor To Acquire Harris Steel \b \u001d  Continuing a wave of consolidation among metals producers, Nucor Corp. (NUE) said it will acquire Harris Steel Group Inc. (HSG.T) for roughly $1.1 billion. Nucor last month turned in a weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter outlook, thanks in part to declining steel prices; the average spot market price of hot-rolled steel sheet dipped to around $565 a ton in November from about $600 a ton in October and from around $630 a ton over the summer. Harris had disclosed in December that it was in third-party talks that could lead to a sale. The deal would require approval by U.S. and Canadian regulators. \b \b   Artemis Keeps Suez Options Open \b \u001d  French billionaire Francois Pinault's Artemis investment-holding company said it is keeping all of its options open on a possible bid for water-and-energy giant Suez (12052.FR). The massive Suez, which is struggling to complete a $60.5 billion merger with state-run utility Gaz de France (1020848.FR), has drawn interest from a host of potential hostile suitors. But a knot of financial, political and other tangles has prevented any would-be predators from proffering a bid. Suez said it wanted more clarity, dismissing the Artemis position as \"vague and imprecise\" and complaining that it \"gives no clear indication of its real intentions, and does not give information in a satisfactory manner to the financial market.\" \b \b   Lennar Warns Of Weak Results \b \u001d  Home-building bellwether Lennar Corp. (LEN) said its fourth-quarter earnings will come in much slimmer than the company predicted. Excluding an expected $400 million to $500 million charge from the evaluation of its land holdings, Lennar projected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 70 cents to 75 cents a share. When it released third-quarter results in September, Lennar said it expected earnings of $1 to $1.30 a share. Separately, Lennar and LNR Property are giving up a 62% stake in their LandSource joint venture to MW Housing Partners. Lennar and LNR will receive around $660 million each as part of the deal. \b \b   CheckFree To Acquire Carreker \b \u001d  CheckFree Corp. (CKFR), a maker of online bill-paying software, has agreed to buy Carreker Corp. (CANI) for $206 million, in a move that expands the company's presence in payment processing and consulting services to the financial industry. The terms value Carreker, which put itself up for sale in June, at $8.05 per share, a 5% premium over the stock's Friday closing price of $7.64. CheckFree sees the transaction closing by March 31, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. \b \b   Kollek, Former Jerusalem Mayor, Dies \b \u001d  Teddy Kollek, the mayor who presided over Jerusalem's reunification after the 1967 Mideast war, has died at the age of 95. Kollek, who liked to be called Teddy by all, strolled the city streets without a bodyguard during his long years in office - he served nearly three decades, from 1965 to 1993 - and his home number was listed in the phone book so that residents could dial him up with complaints about potholes or playgrounds. Born May 27, 1911, in Hungary and raised in Vienna, Kollek came to British-mandate Palestine in 1935. \u001d  For continuously updated news from the Wall Street Journal, see WSJ.com at http://wsj.com. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 13:17 ET (18:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ebebfb992a80b6e67d30fe74a8a55fff","symR":["CIX.UN.T","CA1254961099"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CI Financial Posts December Net Sales Of C$224M >CIX.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T21:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CIX.UN.T","CA1254961099"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  CI Financial Income Fund (CIX.UN.T) had net sales of C$224 million (US$193 million) in December and record assets under management of C$62.7 billion at the end of the year. \u001d  It said its December sales consisted of net sales of C$269 million from CI Investments, net sales of C$23 million at United Financial, and net redemptions of C$68 million of structured products. \u001d  CI, Toronto, is a wealth-management company. \u001d  -Tara Zachariah; 416-306-2100; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:20 ET (21:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ec355495ec79955e14962f7eb69c81ff","symR":["DET.UN.T","SP.UN.T","CA84756U2020"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"News On Duke Energy Income Fund (DET.UN.T) Now Under SP.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T22:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DET.UN.T","SP.UN.T","CA84756U2020"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS"],"Story":"\u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 17:00 ET (22:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ec3ff6d46831e4297a405d4f37a0e16f","symR":["HRH"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Hilb Rogal & Hobbs Completes Acquisition Of Glencairn Group Limited>HRH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T22:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HRH"],"IndustryCodes":["INP","INS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 17:04 ET (22:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ecbcbbbb4e9a548ba10bd2732b8063d8","symR":["AVID"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Avid to Present at Needham & Co.

(CHT) plans to spend over NT$50 billion in the next five years on upgrading its fixed-line network, a company official said Tuesday, as the firm tries to spur growth in its broadband Internet and data revenue. \u001d  \"By upgrading onto fiber-optic based network we hope to provide faster Internet connections and more value-added services,\" Chunghwa Telecom Investor Relations Director Shen Fu-fu said. \u001d  The company will replace its copper lines with fiber-optic lines under a new project, the Next-Generation Network, that it is launching this year. Fiber-optic networks are faster than conventional Internet connections and allow consumers to watch high-definition television and to download movies in minutes. \u001d  \"A (fiber-optic) network will also allow us to save on maintenance costs,\" said Shen. \u001d  Chunghwa Telecom is scheduled to brief reporters about the network upgrade at a press conference Wednesday. \u001d  Analysts said the upgrade is inevitable for integrated phone firms such as Chunghwa Telecom. \u001d  The network upgrade will allow Chunghwa Telecom to fend off competition from cable TV operators and also offer \"triple play\" services, or voice, video and data, said Yuanta Core Pacific Securities analyst Lu Chia-lin. \u001d  \"Chunghwa Telecom wants to regain its lost advantage versus competitors after the government declared the last mile a bottleneck facility,\" said Lu. \u001d  Taiwan's telecommunications regulator approved Dec. 26 declaring the \"last mile,\" or the fixed lines connecting end-users to their nearest relay stations a \"bottleneck facility,\" effectively ending Chunghwa Telecom's near-monopoly over the lines. \u001d  The NCC obliged Chunghwa Telecom, a former government monopoly, to lease the lines to other fixed-line operators according to the cost of the lines' construction, which will likely cut the rates Chunghwa Telecom now charges. Previously, the island's three private operators had to negotiate with Chunghwa Telecom to rent the last mile. \u001d  Six years after Taiwan deregulated its fixed-line telecom market, Chunghwa Telecom still controls most of these lines. \u001d  The NGN project won't only allow Chunghwa Telecom to offer faster Internet connection, but will allow it to offer High Definition TV services to offset falling voice revenue, Lu said. \u001d  As of the end of November, Chunghwa Telecom had 146,500 subscribers to its fiber-optic network, Shen said. The company plans to launch 50 megabits per second and 100 megabits per second Internet services in 2007, she said. \b \u001d  -By Alex Pevzner, Dow Jones Newswires; 8862-2502-2557; alex.pevzner@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 04:47 ET (09:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"efc1249fd9279e2de02cc6dbec6f9246","symR":["CFDAY","CIW.XX","VOD","VOD.LN","VRZ.XX","GB00B16GWD56"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CFA IPO Spotlight: Glu Mobile Prospectus Info","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T18:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CFDAY","CIW.XX","VOD","VOD.LN","VRZ.XX","GB00B16GWD56"],"IndustryCodes":["CTS","TLS","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \b   DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Glu Mobile Inc. filed an initial public offering Dec. 19 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell up to $92 million in common stock. The following is a summary of its prospectus, as provided to the SEC: \b \bTHE COMPANY \u001d  Glu Mobile is a San Mateo, Calif.-based publisher of mobile games. \u001d  The company has developed and published a portfolio of more than 100 games and it says it has links to more than 150 wireless carriers and other distributors. \u001d  The company publishes some of its games based on third-party licensed brands, such as Deer Hunter, Diner Dash, Monopoly, Sonic the Hedgehog, World Series of Poker and Zuma. Glu Mobile's own game brands include Alpha Wing, Ancient Empires, Blackjack Hustler, Stranded and Super K.O. Boxing. \b \bOFFERING INFORMATION \u001d  Glu Mobile filed to sell up to $92 million in common stock, but didn't detail the terms of the offering. \u001d  All of the shares are being sold by Glu Mobile, the filing said. \u001d  The company plans to list its stock on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol GLUU. \u001d  Goldman Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers, Banc of America Securities LLC and Needham & Co. are listed as underwriters for the offering. \b \bEARNINGS \b                      Nine Months Ended Sept. 30, \b                       2006             2005 \bRevenue           $31,863,000        $18,871,000 \bGross profit       20,665,000         10,910,000 \bOperating income   (8,658,000)       (12,327,000) \bNet income         (9,999,000)       (11,348,000) \b \u001d  Figures in parentheses are losses. \b \bGROWTH STRATEGY \u001d  The company said it will continue to create award-winning games through ongoing investment in technical development capabilities. \u001d  The company has developed more than 100 games. It said some of its successful games give the company the potential to develop and publish a series of sequel titles. \u001d  The company said it believes that wireless carriers are increasing their focus on the leading mobile-game publishers in order to improve the consistency and quality of the games that they offer on their handsets. The company intends to take steps to increase market share with existing carriers and distributors and add more relationships, particularly in new geographic markets. In addition, the company also intends to continue to increase its non-carrier distribution capabilities through alternative channels such as Internet portals. \b \bRISK FACTORS \u001d  The company has incurred significant losses since inception, including a net loss of $17.9 million in 2005 and a net loss of $10 million in the first nine months of 2006. As Sept. 30, 2006, the company had an accumulated deficit of $43.7 million. \u001d  The company has only a limited history of generating revenues, and the future revenue potential of its business in the emerging mobile game market is uncertain. \u001d  Many of the company's mobile games are based on or incorporate intellectual property that it licenses from third parties, and most of its revenues are derived from these games. The company said it may not be able to renew these licenses or obtain additional licenses. \u001d  The company currently relies on wireless carriers, in particular, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel, Cingular Wireless and Vodafone Group PLC (VOD), to market and distribute its products. The loss of or a change in any of these carrier relationships could materially harm the company's business, operating results and financial condition. \b \bMANAGEMENT \u001d  L. Gregory Ballard, 53 years old, has served as Glu Mobile's president and chief executive since September 2003. Prior to joining the company, Ballard consulted for Virgin USA Inc. from April 2003 to September 2003. \b \bSTOCKHOLDERS \b \bShareholder                 Cmn Shrs Before Offer % \bNew Enterprise Associates    14,456,388       22.8% \bBAVP L.P.                     7,202,459       11.4% \bGlobespan Capital Partners    5,633,073        8.9% \bSienna LP                     4,709,217        7.4% \bDavid C.

Recent data have belied the prior belief that the U.S. economy had cooled enough to let the Federal Reserve cut rates early this year. Instead, worry about a rate hike has the potential to stop the market's rally because of fears that higher rates will crimp consumer spending and deal a further blow to the housing market. The Fed's Dec. 12 meeting minutes, due Wednesday, may provide a clue. \u001d  On Thursday, the country's largest retailers announce their sales figures for December - the biggest shopping month of the year, and a bellwether for consumer spending. Investors have to brace for potential disappointment. \u001d  Wal-Mart Stores' better-than-forecast 1.6% gain in December sales at established U.S. stores will fail to alter the long-term outlook for the world's largest retailer by revenue until clearer signs of a turnaround emerge, according to The Wall Street Journal. \u001d  The Labor Department caps the week with its reports on December nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate. The market expects the data Friday to show payrolls rose by 110,000 and unemployment held at 4.5 percent. \u001d  Corporate-profit growth is likely to slow to the single digits this year and next after rising over 12% a year since 2002, economists said in a survey. \u001d  FOREX: The dollar is trading lower in Europe, after having gained against the yen Friday on investors' growing aversion to the low-yielding Japanese currency. The greenback fell Friday versus the euro amid expectations of more interest rate hikes this year by the European Central Bank. \u001d  BONDS: The economic data this week will help the market decide if yields have to go higher. \u001d  \"We're heading in (to 2007) on firmer economic footing than we thought we would,\" said John Canavan, interest rate strategist at Stone & McCarthy in New York. \"The data recently have clearly been more firm than people had expected.\" \u001d  This week's reports follow a largely sour end of the year for Treasurys. Investors lowered their expectations for an early 2007 ease lower in interest rates. \u001d  Canavan anticipates last week's selloff to carry over into the New Year, as investors returning from holiday respond to the week's bond-negative data. The ISM index - at 49.5 last month - could offer a bit of support to the market though, Canavan said. He expects an index reading of 48.8. That's below the Dow Jones Newswires consensus estimate for a reading of 50. Readings below 50 signal a contraction in growth. \u001d  \"Because of the extent of the downturn (last week), there might be a little bit of a temporary snapback,\" Canavan said. \"The ISM index could be interesting though.\" \u001d  Analysts at Barclays Capital in New York also expect a slight decline in the index, to 49.0 in December. \u001d  OIL: Many analysts are looking for crude-oil futures this year to average more than $60 a barrel because of robust demand growth in Asia and the Middle East, efforts by OPEC to trim supply and market-rattling instability in energy-rich countries such as Nigeria and Iraq. \u001d  But slower economic growth in the U.S. and a production spurt from non-OPEC countries should keep prices below the 2006 average of roughly $66 a barrel, analysts said. And with expectations of fewer refining bottlenecks, gasoline and other fuels should be less expensive - though not cheap when compared with costs from just a few years ago. \u001d  \"There will be an easing of conditions, but not a dramatic reversal,\" said Antoine Halff, an analyst at New York-based Fimat, who cautioned that supply disruptions - whether the result of hurricanes or political upheaval - have the potential to cause short-term spikes. \u001d  \"Nigeria looks increasingly unstable,\" Halff said, adding that internal politics in Iraq could hamper that country's all-important oil sector, too. The other country to keep an eye on is Iran, whose nuclear ambitions recently prompted United Nations sanctions. \u001d  On Friday, light sweet crude for January delivery rose 52 cents to settle at $61.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up a penny from where they ended last year. \b \u001d  ASIAN SUMMARY: Shares Advance As Oil Eases Lower \bUSD-Yen             118.68       loss  0.35    dn 0.3% \bAUD-USD             0.7942       gain  0.0048  up 0.6% \bNikkei 225          Closed \bHang Seng           20217.07     gain  252.30  up 1.3% \bS&P/ASX 200         5645.90      gain  1.60       0.0% \bTaiwan Index        7921.03      gain  97.31   up 1.2% \bS.Korea Kospi       1434.13      loss  0.33       0.0% \bSpot gold           $637.20      gain  1.20    up 0.2% \bBrent Crude Oil     $60.76       loss  0.10       0,0% \bJGB 10-year Yield  Closed \b(All values as of 0550 GMT) \u001d  STOCKS: With Japan's markets closed for a holiday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng took center stage, trading around all-time highs, paced by red-hot stocks of companies in China. Korean shares fluctuated, with buyers focused on tech shares in anticipation of another good year for them. Gains in banks and resources pushed the Australian share market up slightly. \u001d  FOREX: The yen made up losses against the dollar from last week, although Japan's holiday cut volumes, while it held steady against the euro. \u001d  METALS: Gold edged higher to $637.20, having fairly clear sailing until $642. But that move may have to wait for later in the week when major markets are backing in full swing. Copper futures were slightly lower. LME metals face the same situation, due to ongoing market closures in U.S. and Asia. LME 3-month copper was last at $6,300/ton, up $20 on the Dec. 29 PM kerb. \u001d  OIL: Prices were slightly lower, while traders focused on reports that heating oil demand may decline because of mild winter weather in the U.S. But dealers said the $60.00 level could bring out some speculative buyers on short-term events.

Last week's money supply data, showing a surge, is helping the euro by reinforcing market expectations for at least one more rate hike by the European Central Bank. \u001d  BONDS: Government bonds are likely to start mixed in a week that features December's euro-zone confidence survey, German unemployment data and purchasing managers indexes from manufacturing and service sectors for the euro area. \u001d  Euro-zone confidence in December was likely similar to November levels, with the overall economic sentiment indicator expected to stay close to the recent peak in line with the strong German Ifo index released earlier in the month. \u001d  \"The German Ifo pointed to sustained strength in industry confidence,\" said BNP Paribas economists. \"In contrast, consumer confidence still has room to improve.... Recent improvements in the labor market suggest we should see further rises.\" \u001d  German unemployment data for November, due early Wednesday, is likely to see another drop in jobless figures. \u001d  \"Unusually mild weather in the first half of December, a favorable seasonal effect and the trend improvement in the German economy likely resulted in a further decline in unemployment,\" said Bank of America economists in a research note. \u001d  On average, economists expect German unemployment to fall 45,000, while the jobless rate is forecast to fall to 10.1%. \u001d  The December manufacturing PMI, due Tuesday, is likely to show an increase in line with the rise in the Ifo, although some economists are expecting a fall in the index. \u001d  The December services PMI, due Thursday, is expected to show no change from the strong 57-plus level that represents strong demand. \u001d  Also due this week is the flash December consumer price inflation index for the euro zone, which is set to remain unchanged from the November figure of 1.9%, but a pickup is expected this year. \u001d  In the U.K., the first week of 2007 will be fairly quiet, with the purchasing managers indexes from the manufacturing and services sectors likely to be little changed from November. \b \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 01:02 ET (06:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f30c3555514e008ac0a97e6f67fff691","symR":["F.MI","FIA","IT0001976403","F.MI","FIA","IT0001976403"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Fiat Grp Shr Of Italy Dec New Car Mkt 30.3% Vs 31.2% Nov","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T17:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["F.MI","FIA","IT0001976403"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI","XMIB","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 12:02 ET (17:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f3a351d55c90ea710e204f0d5190ad56","symR":["GD"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"General Dynamics Unit Gets $145M Contract From Army >GD","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T21:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GD"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","DFN","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  General Dynamics Land Systems, a unit of General Dynamics Corp.

Canadian markets were closed Monday for New Year's Day. \u001d  With no Canadian economic data or other events scheduled until Thursday, the Canadian dollar looked to external factors to set direction Tuesday, though most of the day's activity was relatively aimless and mostly reflected the influence of simple transactional flows. \u001d  The Canadian unit drifted slightly higher early in the day to reach its intraday high in the C$1.1630 area as a consequence of a broader global weakening of the U.S. dollar, but it gradually ceded its modest gains and sharply underperformed most major currencies versus the U.S. \u001d  Friday's key Canadian December employment report looms as the major event of the week from a Canadian dollar perspective, though the currency may also take some cues from the global impact on the U.S. dollar from the U.S.'s own December job report Friday, as well as Wednesday's Institute for Supply Management December index of manufacturing activity. \u001d  Many currency watchers expect the Canadian dollar to remain under some downward pressure, both from sagging crude oil and natural gas prices, and also a sense that a recent string of poor Canadian economic indicators will lead the Bank of Canada into again downgrading its growth estimates and perhaps switching to a more dovish policy stance. \u001d  \"I think for now the market is still in sell-Canada mode,\" said Steve Butler, director of foreign exchange at Scotia Capital in Toronto. \"I think the Canadian dollar should continue to underperform until something changes for the better and there's some new reasons to buy Canada again.\" \u001d  These are the exchange rates at 4:12 p.m. EST (2112 GMT), 8:00 a.m. EST (1300 GMT), and late Friday. \b   USD/CAD     1.1640     1.1635     1.1667 \b   EUR/CAD     1.5454     1.5440     1.5398 \b   CAD/JPY     102.03     102.17     102.08 \u001d  -By Paul Evans; Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2022; paulr.evans@dowjones.com \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  January 02, 2007 16:15 ET (21:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f53a52061afe403c2acc008089927465","symR":["MAA"],"date":"2007-01-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Mid-America Apartment Communities Announces Dates for Fourth Quarter Earnings Release, Conference Call and 2006 Taxable Composition of Distributions","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-01-02T20:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MAA"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\bMid-America Apartment Communities Announces Dates for Fourth Quarter Earnings Release, Conference Call and 2006 Taxable Composition of Distributions \b \b\b \b   MEMPHIS, Tenn., Jan. 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Eric Bolton and Simon \bWadsworth invite you to join them in a discussion of fourth quarter operations \bat Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

Up to 80 patients are expected to be enrolled in the trial at three centers in the United States: the Virginia G. Piper Cancer Center in Scottsdale, Arizona; the University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson; and the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) is partially funding the trial under a Clinical Trials Agreement with the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen). The principal investigator for the trial is Daniel D. Von Hoff, MD. \b \u001d  \"Trx-1 is known to control diverse molecular pathways that contribute to the growth, survival and drug resistance of many cancers,\" said D. Lynn Kirkpatrick, Ph.D., Biomira's Chief Scientific Officer. \"By inhibiting Trx-1, PX-12 may have utility in a variety of cancer indications, including pancreatic cancer, an aggressive malignancy for which there are limited treatment options and significant unmet medical needs.\" \b \b    About PX-12 \b \u001d  PX-12 is an irreversible inhibitor of thioredoxin (Trx-1), a protein that regulates many transcription factors including hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). These factors play a critical role in cancer cell growth, survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Increased thioredoxin levels in cancer cells have been linked to the aggressive proliferation of solid tumors, including colon, lung, and gastric cancers. PX-12 has successfully completed Phase I safety evaluation and is currently being studied in a Phase IB trial for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. An initial Phase I trial involving 38 patients with advanced metastatic cancer showed that PX-12 was well tolerated and produced a decrease in plasma concentrations of thioredoxin that was significantly correlated with increased patient survival. Seven of the 38 patients achieved stable disease of up to 322 days. \b \b    About the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) \b \u001d  The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization, is focused on developing earlier diagnostics and smarter treatments.
