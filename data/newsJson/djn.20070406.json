SpA (PC.MI) and the Benetton family to control Telecom Italia, left Rossi's name off of a list of proposed board nominees released this week ahead of a shareholders' vote April 16. \u001d  Rossi would have been effectively ousted unless other shareholders with combined stakes of more than 18% nominate him on a different list. \u001d  Rossi had said on Wednesday he wouldn't resign even if Pirelli chose to exclude him from its list of director nominees, but by Thursday, newspaper La Repubblica reported Rossi was considering resigning. \u001d  Although two of Telecom Italia's largest shareholders, Mediobanca SpA (MB.MI) and Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G.MI), said late Wednesday they hadn't been consulted by Pirelli on management changes, they didn't submit a different list of candidates for the board of directors at Wednesday's deadline. Olimpia shares control of Telecom Italia under a shareholders' pact with investment bank Mediobanca and Generali, which together own 5.2%. \u001d  News of the talks follows a period of stormy relations between Pirelli Chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera and Prime Minister Romano Prodi over how much influence foreign firms should have in Telecom Italia. The possibility of a deal with American and Mexican companies kicked up a storm of opposition within the Italian government. Cabinet ministers have called for another solution that would protect the company from possible foreign control. \u001d  France Telecom (FTE) and Telefonica SA (TEF) are considering individual counteroffers to tentative bids by AT&T Inc. (T) and America Movil SA de CV (AMOV), a Mexican company, for a combined 66.6% stake in Olimpia. Pirelli announced Sunday that it was starting one month of exclusive talks with the U.S. and Mexican companies over the sale of the Olimpia stake. \u001d  Meanwhile, Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISNPY) said it is ready to team up with other financial institutions to end the battle for control of Telecom Italia and keep the company in Italian hands, without ruling out a partnership with AT&T and America Movil. \u001d  Tronchetti Provera's proposed replacement for Rossi is Pasquale Pistorio, a Telecom Italia director and former chairman of semiconductor firm STMicroelectronics NV (STM), according to people familiar with the matter. \u001d  However, Mediobanca and Generali responded by saying they didn't agree with Tronchetti Provera's nominees and hinted that he had violated the shareholders' pact by submitting them. The fight among the principal shareholders also threatens to aggravate the management uncertainty that has plagued the company since last fall. After his disagreements with Prodi spilled into the open, Tronchetti Provera resigned in September as Telecom Italia chairman. \u001d  -Jonathan Vuocolo; 201-938-5964; Jonathan.Vuocolo@dowjones.com \u001d  (Jason Singer, Gabriel Kahn, Giada Zampano and Sabrina Cohen contributed to this story.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 10:07 ET (14:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0159029f9a159c9b850951e3d11d0ed9","symR":["GSPBEX.RS","ROSN.RS","YUKO.RS","RU0007661625","RU0009054449","RU000A0J2Q06"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Yukos' Samaraneftegaz To Be Sold In Mid-May - Receiver -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T14:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GSPBEX.RS","ROSN.RS","YUKO.RS","RU0007661625","RU0009054449","RU000A0J2Q06"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  The lot, which includes Samaraneftegaz, three oil refineries and other assets, will be sold off with a starting price of 154.97 billion rubles ($6.98 billion), Eduard Rebgun, Yukos' court-appointed receiver, told Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  Two other lots of assets have also already been approved for sale.

(AP)--The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday it will increase the frequency of investigations at plants that make peanut butter and similar products, saying this year's salmonella outbreak showed peanut butter is riskier than health officials had thought. \u001d  All Peter Pan and Great Value peanut butter that ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG) made at its Sylvester, Ga., plant was recalled in February after health officials linked the product to a salmonella outbreak that has sickened more than 400 people nationwide. \u001d  \"Up until this point, peanut butter has not been considered a high-risk food,\" said Dr. David Acheson, chief medical officer of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"We now know peanut butter can be a vehicle for salmonella.\" \u001d  Acheson said peanut butter will almost certainly move up on the FDA's list of high-risk foods, and the agency bases its inspection schedule on the relative risk of foods. He said peanut butter is not likely to knock fresh produce off the top of that list, because the risks are highest with foods that don't get cooked later. \u001d  Acheson said salmonella infections could happen at other peanut butter plants, but he believes the industry has been paying attention. \u001d  \"I would be pretty certain that every other peanut butter producer is having the same thought we are and is paying a lot of attention to it to make sure that it doesn't happen,\" \u001d  The explanation for the salmonella outbreak ConAgra officials offered Thursday fits with what the FDA found, Acheson said, but the government investigation has not been completed. \u001d  FDA officials will decide whether to pursue any sanctions against ConAgra after the investigation, Acheson said. \u001d  ConAgra spokeswoman Stephanie Childs said Thursday the company traced the salmonella outbreak to three problems at its Sylvester plant last August. \u001d  The plant's roof leaked during a rainstorm, and the sprinkler system went off twice because of a faulty sprinkler, which was repaired. \u001d  The moisture from those three events mixed with dormant salmonella bacteria in the plant that Childs said likely came from raw peanuts and peanut dust. \u001d  The plant was cleaned thoroughly after the roof leak and sprinkler problem, but the salmonella remained and somehow came in contact with peanut butter before it was packaged, she said. \u001d  The FDA last inspected the ConAgra plant in 2005 and did not find any problems. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 14:49 ET (18:49 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"04fb6783106135387325cba87b31611d","symR":["12148.FR","7203.TO","AAPL","BGP.XX","CRP.XX","DCX","DCX.XE","DISH","GOOG","MG.A.T","MG.B.T","MGA","NYT","TM","TRA.XX","UAUA","CA5592224011","CA5592225000","DE0007100000","FR0000121485","JP3633400001","US0378331005"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"=WSJ.COM/Morning Brief: Climate Report Brings -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T12:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12148.FR","7203.TO","AAPL","BGP.XX","CRP.XX","DCX","DCX.XE","DISH","GOOG","MG.A.T","MG.B.T","MGA","NYT","TM","TRA.XX","UAUA","CA5592224011","CA5592225000","DE0007100000","FR0000121485","JP3633400001","US0378331005"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","AMG","AUT","BRD","CPR","ENT","FIS","ISV","MED","OTA","PUB","RTB","RTS","X225","XATI","XCA4","XDAX","XDJGI","XENX","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5","XSTX","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  International Herald Tribune: Turkey said that it was suspending talks with Gaz de France on joining a major natural gas pipeline consortium, a political move aimed at putting pressure on both Paris and Brussels that EU officials said could further delay one of the European Union's biggest energy projects. \u001d  Reuters: The nation's largest pilots' union will try to roll back bankruptcy concessions at UAL Corp.'s (UAUA) United Airlines and other carriers now that the industry is doing better and executives are reaping rewards, the labor group's president said. \u001d  New York Times: A senior official at the federal Education Department sold more than $100,000 in shares in a student-loan company even as he was helping oversee lenders in the federal student-loan program. \u001d  Times of London: The new British super-union being formed from a merger of Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union is preparing for talks with United Steelworkers in the U.S. to create the first international union. \u001d  BusinessWeek: While corporate profits have been on a tear for more than three years, a profit slowdown now appears to have started, and margins are getting squeezed.

What's clear is that, whatever other trends have helped foreign exchanges grow, bureaucratic headaches have made the U.S. a less popular place to trade securities. \u001d  \"I think the problem here is that our regulatory system is obsolete and inadequate,\" said James Angel, a professor of finance at Georgetown University. \"We see company after company going private and foreign issuers lining up to leave. That is a warning sign - the canary in the coal mine is dead.\" \b \b   Horse And Buggy Regulatory System \b \u001d  It's unclear how much of a conclusion should be drawn from the market size statistic, especially one that compares the exchanges in the European Union and Russia combined, countries with a total population of 600 million, versus the U.S. alone with half as many people. Vadim Zlotnikov, chief investment strategist at Sanford C. Bernstein, said primary listing is more of a demand than a supply issue, and that in any case, the U.S. is a shrinking part of the global economy. \u001d  For the record, the U.S. retains the lead in terms of market capitalization by a significant margin. The Financial Times cited raw data by Thomson Financial that gave a full weighting to companies that have cross-shareholdings or to mostly state-influenced concerns like Russia's Gazprom (GSPBEX) or Franco-German aerospace and defense company EADS (5730.FR). According to data from index-provider MSCI-Barra, which includes investability in its criteria, the 18 largest European stock markets plus Russia had a combined market value of $9.4 trillion, or just 72% of the U.S. Dow Jones Indexes, which includes a larger number of issuers, puts 29 European stock markets' total capitalization at $11.4 trillion, or just 71% of their measure of the U.S. total. \u001d  Nonetheless, as the relative share of the U.S shrinks, there are several other signs that trading activity is shifting to more favorable climes. For example, 2006 was the first year that saw more capital raised in so-called Rule 144A private transactions than on all three major U.S. exchanges combined, a signal that issuers like our deep pool of capital but not the regulatory yoke that accompanies it. The London Stock Exchange surveyed 80 companies that listed there in 2005, and 90% cited draconian Sarbanes-Oxley rules as a factor in their decision not to list in the U.S. Angel cites statistics showing that it is twice as expensive to conduct an initial public offering in the U.S. as in Europe and that registration takes four to six months versus four to six weeks in London. \u001d  \"As the rest of the world has gotten better, we've got stiffer competition, and our horse and buggy regulatory system just can't cut it,\" Angel said. \b \b   Race To The Bottom \b \u001d  The competitive disadvantages of the U.S. as a financial center haven't gone unnoticed by political and business leaders. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has been a vocal proponent of easing the regulatory burden. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce put together a group of current and former executives to study the issue, the Commission on the Regulation of U.S. Capital Markets in the 21st Century. In a report released last month, they called for a reform and modernization of the government's regulatory approach, a folding of Sarbanes-Oxley oversight into the Securities and Exchange Commission, limiting auditors' legal risks, and discouraging quarterly earnings guidance, among other measures. \u001d  Former Commerce Department official and financier Jeffrey Garten is among a group that has cautioned against too radical an overhaul of regulations, warning that a \"race to the bottom\" in terms of standards could harm investors. He wrote in a December editorial that the loss of massive IPOs of opaque Chinese and Russian companies to foreign stock markets is not necessarily a problem. \u001d  But this focus on investor safety ignores financial innovations. American retail investors can gain plenty of access to foreign-listed companies through exchange-traded funds and are in any case bombarded with a number of questionable offerings that are homegrown. Angel noted that, while legitimate companies incur heavy costs and face enforcement actions over relatively minor infractions, \"pump and dump\" schemes seem to operate with almost complete impunity. \u001d  \"We have enforcement people who basically write parking tickets to law-abiding citizens and let mafiosi kill people,\" he said, noting that even some senior SEC officials have spent little or no time on trading floors and that its budget has failed to keep up with growth in the markets. Angel said the U.S. does not need to lower its standards in order to attract more business since investors are attracted to good regulatory regimes and that in fact a \"race to the top\" has been the trend as foreign markets have greatly improved oversight. \u001d  \"Investors have a natural risk aversion,\" he said. \"It's not a matter of the standards so much as a competent and effective enforcement of the measures.\" \u001d  Rather than creating a new body, critics of the American regulatory regime have advocated combining agencies like the SEC, PCAOB, CFTC and others into a single competent authority. A model mentioned by many is Britain's Financial Services Authority. \u001d  Angel is pessimistic about such measures being implemented in anything but piecemeal fashion. He noted that major reforms, such as the creation of the SEC in 1934 or Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, following the 1929 crash and the Enron debacle, respectively, were in response to crises. But the increasing irrelevance of international borders may bypass some of the regulatory hurdles, at least for foreign issuers. In a hopeful sign for U.S. exchanges, the SEC proposed a pilot program that would allow foreign initial public offerings to be marketed in the U.S. if a regulator with \"equivalent\" rules had vetted it. \b \u001d  (Spencer Jakab, a columnist who provides insightful and unique takes on the stock market, previously wrote about the energy industry). \b \u001d  -By Spencer Jakab, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2429; spencer.jakab@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 07:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0663b5a5bf1896a4442dc27470e6f030","symR":["FPL","FPL"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"FPL Grp CEO's 2006 Total Pay Valued At $9.5M >FPL","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T12:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FPL"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 08:34 ET (12:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0693a83ff1ea37ad8bbf06730b328675","symR":["NRT.AU","NVGN","AU000000NRT0"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder EL CORONADO HOLDINGS LLC Buys 23,000 Of NOVOGEN LIMITED >NVGN","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T16:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NRT.AU","NVGN","AU000000NRT0"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XISL","XORD"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: NOVOGEN LIMITED \bSYMBOL: NVGN \b \bFILER: EL CORONADO HOLDINGS LLC \bTITLE: Beneficial Owner \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/4/07             Purchase                 23,000       $9.93        $228,328 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 2,309,930 (Direct)  36,800 (Indirect) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

(ION) sought Thursday to squash speculation that a planned restructuring of the debt-laden television network is on its last legs. \u001d  Ion Media is mulling rival restructuring offers, including one from investment firm Citadel LP with support from General Electric Co.'s (GE) NBC Universal, which holds an effective controlling interest in Ion Media. \u001d  A group of Ion Media's preferred stockholders has complained the offer shortchanges them and submitted their own recapitalization plan for the company. \u001d  Citadel sweetened its proposed plan last week but said it will withdraw its proposal if Ion Media doesn't respond by 5 p.m. ET Friday. \u001d  Ion Media Chief Executive Brandon Burgess told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday that there is an \"increasingly active and constructive dialogue among all parties,\" ahead of the deadline. \u001d  Opponents of the restructuring plan appear to have little leverage to block a potential deal with Citadel. NBC has exclusive rights to negotiate a potential transaction with Ion Media through May 7, and appears unlikely to support a party other than Citadel. \u001d  Supporters of the Citadel restructuring plan also say it improves the lot for Ion Media, which has a groaning debt load and needs to invest in its programming. \u001d  At the end of last year, Ion Media had $1.1 billion in debt, roughly 10 times the company's 2006 earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization. In recent years, the company has been forced to borrow money and sell assets as its operating expenses and interest payments on its debt has outstripped its cash flow from operations. \u001d  \"It would be shocking for the board not to approve such an attractive proposal, which puts Ion on solid financial ground and benefits all stakeholders,\" said a source with knowledge of the deal. \u001d  Citadel and NBC first proposed a restructuring plan in January that would buy out 65 million public shares for at least $1.41 apiece. Shares of Ion Media ended trading Thursday at $1.31, unchanged on the session. \u001d  The Citadel restructuring offer has been revised twice, in part to address opposition from a group of Ion Media preferred shareholders who believe the plan is unfair to them. \u001d  The latest revision, disclosed last week, would inject $100 million in fresh cash into the TV company formerly known as Paxson Communications, improves the price paid to some preferred holders and gives them a potential stake in the private company. \u001d  For its part, NBC made concessions to get the deal done. In 1999, the media giant paid $415 million for a stake in Ion Media, but it is barred from exercising an option to acquire control of the company because of media-ownership regulations. \u001d  A representative for the rival preferred-shareholder group, which includes AIG Global Investment Group, didn't return several calls for comment. \u001d  The group's restructuring offer contemplated a potential recapitalization through the bankruptcy courts. \u001d  Ion Media said in a statement Thursday that the preferred stockholders \"are not creditors and cannot compel the company to make a bankruptcy filing.\" \u001d  -By Shira Ovide, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5287; shira.ovide@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 07:32 ET (11:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"07d4ca33b4c6afdc31ef4b1d610c24f4","symR":["SNIC"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Sonic Solutions To Restate Fincls; Take Material Chgs >SNIC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SNIC"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Sonic Solutions (SNIC) expects to record additional noncash charges for stock-based compensation expenses and will restate financials, after a voluntary investigation found measurement dates associated with these grants need to be adjusted. \u001d  The Novato, Calif., company expects the charges to be material, but can't determine the amount of the charges or the impact on results.

Kastel Sucurac (Split) from the Croatian Privatization Fund.  Split is an electric arc furnace steel reinforcing bar mill with a wire mesh facility.  This is the second of Croatia's two operating steel mills for which CMI has submitted a purchase offer.  In February, CMC announced that CMI had submitted a bid for the Valjaonica Cijevi Sisak (Sisak) pipe mill.  All bids for the Sisak mill were subsequently rejected by the Fund which has requested new bids for Sisak due by April 17, 2007.  CMC is studying the tender request for Sisak and intends to have CMI submit a bid on or before April 17 for that facility.  Both of these privatization efforts are in preparation for Croatia's anticipated membership in the European Union in 2009. \b \u001d  CMI is apparently one of six bidders who submitted bids in connection with the proposed privatization of Split.  Split has approximately 170,000 metric tons of rebar capacity along with 30,000 tons of mesh capacity.  Sisak has currently approximately 70,000 metric tons melting capacity and about 300,000 metric tons of tubular manufacturing capacity in its existing product line which include seamless, welded and cold processed pipe. \b \u001d  CMI's bid for Split, which includes the share purchase price, assumption of a portion of the debt due to or guaranteed by the Croatian government as well as the assumption of trade payables, is approximately 155.7 million Croatian kuna (approximately U.S. $28 million).  This amount does not include additional working capital requirements for increasing the production levels. The bid is subject to execution of a definitive purchase contract. \b \u001d  In addition to continuing the existing operations at the Split mill, CMI contemplates future expansions including capital expenditures and working capital increase of at least 300 million Croatian kuna (approximately U.S. $54 million).  The existing level of the employee work force, less normal retirements or other natural attrition, will be retained for a minimum of three years under the terms of an agreement CMI has already reached with the trade union representing employees at the facility. \b \u001d  Hanns Zoellner, President of CMC's Marketing and Distribution segment, stated, \"We are very excited about the prospects for Split and look forward to promptly commencing discussions with the Fund to conclude a purchase contract. We know the rebar business as CMC is the 3rd largest manufacturer in the United States and with the experience and success we have enjoyed following the acquisition of a majority interest in CMC Zawiercie, our Polish mill, we are confident we can achieve the same results in Croatia at Split.  Even more exciting is the possibility that CMC will also acquire the Sisak mill.  CMC's marketing group annually markets close to 500,000 metric tons of tubular products globally and has previously sold pipe products produced by Sisak.  If our efforts to acquire both Croatian mills are successful, we can see significant synergies in their operations.  Our worldwide marketing capability in both product lines should improve results at both facilities. \b \u001d  \"These moves fit our strategy to expand production capability in the key markets of Central and Eastern Europe.  The acquisition of Split and Sisak would definitely fit with CMC's strategic objectives.\" \b \b    Forward-Looking Statements \b \u001d  This news release contains forward-looking statements regarding the possible transaction discussed.

CMC can provide no assurance with respect to the timing, value or final determination by the Fund or CMC to proceed with any transaction.

The Marines have the lead on the acquisition program, which previously had estimated a 4,000-vehicle, one-year effort. \u001d  Funding looks certain, said Brig. Gen. Michael Brogan, head of Marine Corps Systems Command. He said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., has already submitted amendments to Pentagon budget legislation, augmenting existing plans to fund the MRAP program as needed. \u001d  \"Given that amount of money, I won't have financial restrictions on how fast we can produce the vehicles,\" Brogan said. \"I will need industry to deliver on the promises.\" \u001d  The Marines will buy vehicles from any company that can meet their blastproof standards, Brogan said. Already, many companies are on contract to provide test vehicles, and some have received extra orders based on existing information. Big contracts will come soon, once the evaluations wrap up. \u001d  Long-term maintenance isn't a big worry, Brogan said. In the short run, the Marines plan to hire contractors for maintenance and spare parts. \u001d  If the vehicles stay in the arsenal, the Marines will work with the contractors to keep spare parts and trained mechanics on hand. Brogan said the vehicles share many common components, such as engines and suspensions. \u001d  \"Fundamentally, these are trucks,\" Brogan said. \u001d  The MRAP vehicles could have a life span of up to 10 years if they survive their deployment, Brogan said. That means they'll phase out as the Pentagon's next-generation all-purpose vehicle phases in, Brogan said. That next project is called the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle; a contractor has not yet been selected. \u001d  Companies with MRAP contracts so far include General Dynamics Corp. (GD), Force Protection Inc. (FRPT), Armor Holdings Inc. (AH), Textron Inc. (TXT), BAE Systems PLC (BAESY), Oshkosh Truck Corp. (OSK), Protected Vehicles Inc., Navistar International Corp.'s (NAVZ) International Military and Government LLC, and General Purpose Vehicles LLC. \u001d  The MRAP program will face more oversight as it expands. Defense Department Under Secretary Kenneth Krieg, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, is preparing to convert MRAP into the top tier of acquisition programs, invoking additional senior supervision. \b \b   Force Protection Boosts Capacity \b \u001d  Capacity has been one of the biggest limitations on the MRAP program. U.S. industry had little capacity for churning out heavily armored vehicles because it was considered a \"boutique\" item, Brogan said. \u001d  One company making the sought-after vehicles has turned to outsourcing and new joint ventures to boost capacity. South Carolina-based Force Protection has new agreements with General Dynamics Corp. and Armor Holdings Inc. to help the company increase its production. \u001d  Force Protection is the sole provider in the MRAP category three, with its heavily armored Buffalo mine clearer. It also has contracts for the smaller Cougar models in categories one and two, along with the other MRAP contenders. \u001d  The Buffalo costs around $850,000 per copy. The Cougar has a sticker price of around $500,000 each, depending on configuration. \u001d  Since its Buffalo and Cougar entered the Pentagon inventory, Force Protection has struggled to keep up with demand. Defense Department officials have said their capacity limitations was one of the motivations for launching the broad-based MRAP effort. \u001d  With the joint ventures, Force Protection will get the engineering and manufacturing support it needs to dramatically boost output, said Mike Aldrich, Force Protection's vice president for marketing and government relations. \u001d  \"For the past year, we have been focused on proving to the government that we've settled down our production lines, that we can deliver on time or ahead of schedule, that we can produce more vehicles next month than we had the month before,\" Aldrich said in a telephone interview. \u001d  Force Protection made 300 vehicles in all of 2006. It began 2007 with a 700-vehicle backlog, and Aldrich said the company expects it will be able to keep up with the year's demand. He declined to provide updated forecasts, saying the Defense Department had asked the company to be more reserved in its production comments so that enemy insurgents wouldn't know exactly how many new vehicles had made it to Iraq and Afghanistan. \u001d  Force Protection investors have had a dramatic ride over the past year. The company's stock rose steadily in the fourth quarter of 2006, but it has dropped sharply in the first months of 2007. It's been trading recently around $19, off its recent high of $22.95 on Jan. 18.   In addition to all the new business, the company also has survived a management split that saw one of its founders leave to start Protected Vehicles, a new competitor. \u001d  Aldrich said Force Protection, which recently gained a NASDAQ listing, aims to provide steadier returns in the future. \u001d  \"Overall, what we are trying to build is a growth stock that is value-based,\" Aldrich said. \"We believe that the value of protecting and saving lives is very significant.\" \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; rebecca.christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0d154e9e1a253e7c06eeff09ee29cead","symR":["FRA.XE","DE0005773303"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Praktiker And Rival In Court Over Ad Flap - Handelsblatt","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T04:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FRA.XE","DE0005773303"],"IndustryCodes":["TRS","XDJGI","XISL","XMDAX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  German home improvement retailer Praktiker (FRA.XE) is battling in court with rival Obi over allegedly deceptive advertising, according to Handelsblatt's Web site on Thursday. \u001d  Praktiker confirmed that a court ordered it to cease and desist, under the threat of fines, from advertising that its prices are generally lower than Obi's, according to Handelsblatt. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.handelsblatt.de \b \u001d  -Dow Jones Newswires; dennis.baker@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 00:27 ET (04:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0dd7188af2ea79d30722e8b287901cbd","symR":["EMBT"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Embarcadero Puts March 31 Cash, Equivalents At $74M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T13:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EMBT"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 09:35 ET (13:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0e65221911bf11297c41c91094054506","symR":["CAO","CAO"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CSK Auto Expects To File 10-Qs, 10-K As Soon As Possible","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T12:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CAO"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 08:01 ET (12:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0f2704423f3a3a1da6442bad602a7758","symR":["FNM"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Ofheo Chief Won't Recuse Himself In Case Vs Ex-Fannie Execs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T11:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FNM"],"IndustryCodes":["MFN","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (This article was originally published Thursday.) \b \u001d  By Damian Paletta \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The top regulator for mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae (FNM) said Thursday he wouldn't recuse himself from the 101 administrative court charges his agency filed against former Chairman Franklin Raines, former Chief Financial Officer J. Timothy Howard and former Controller Leanne Spencer. \u001d  The former executives alleged in court filings that James Lockhart, director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, had prejudiced himself against them in public statements. \u001d  \"I am capable of judging this matter with honesty and integrity based on the specific evidence and law in the record that will be developed,\" Lockhart said in a 20-page court filing submitted Thursday. \u001d  In December, Ofheo levied charges against Raines, Howard and Spencer, alleging they were partly to blame for the massive accounting and financial scandal at Fannie Mae that eventually led to a $400 million fine from federal regulators. \u001d  Ofheo and the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that former Fannie Mae executives manipulated earnings to trigger huge bonuses. \u001d  All three have denied wrongdoing in the case. \u001d  Ofheo's charges against the three were filed with an administrative law judge, which is different from a federal court. This process would eventually result in the judge handing his decision back to Lockhart before it became final. The defendants have said this is unfair, in part because Lockhart already has said he felt that mismanagement by former senior executives led to the problems at Fannie Mae. \u001d  \"I conclude that neither the facts nor the law support Respondents' arguments that I have prejudged... or that I am predisposed to rule against them,\" Lockhart said in the filing. \u001d  A ruling in the case isn't expected until next year. \u001d  U.S. Administrative Law Judge William B.

He took off one day, then went to work to realize his boyhood dream: to become a portfolio manager. \u001d  Today, the 25-year-old serves in that capacity at Roge Partners Fund, where he co-manages about $16 million in assets. \u001d  Roge certainly wasn't a typical youngster. He decided long ago to model his life and career after Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKA, BRKB) Chief Executive Warren Buffett. There are some similarities. Buffett, the investing wizard from Omaha, Neb., started working at his father's brokerage when he was 11. The younger Roge also started working with his own investment-advisor father at an early age. \u001d  Roge's father, Ronald, is chairman and chief executive of Bohemia, N.Y.-based R.W. Roge & Co., which serves as advisor to the younger Roge's fund, created in October 2004. The elder Roge also is a co-manager of the world stock fund, which primarily invests in financial services firms and in other companies both in the U.S. and abroad. \u001d  Roge Partners Fund's 2007 return rate was 3.24% as of Wednesday, compared with the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which has risen 1.97% this year, according to Morningstar. In 2006, the Roge fund had a return of 20.9%, compared with the 15.8% increase in the S&P 500. \u001d  For the younger Roge, people are the most important criteria to investing, and by that he means management teams that have a solid record of returns. Other criteria include being \"good allocators of capital\" and high rates of return, according to Roge. \u001d  \"We look at great management teams. We're not interested in turnaround situations,\" Roge said. \u001d  The largest holding in the mutual fund is Capital Southwest Corp. (CSWC), a venture capital investment firm based in Dallas. Its chairman, William Thomas, has been at the firm since 1962. \u001d  Capital Southwest has provided seed money to many successful companies that eventually went public, including Heelys Inc. (HLYS), best known for its children's shoes that have a removable wheel in the heel. Heelys had its initial public offering late last year. \u001d  Capital Southwest's shares are currently trading at about $148 a share, up 63% from their 52-week low last May. Roge believes the stock is worth more than $170. \u001d  Another stock in the fund is Legg Mason Inc. (LM), which is run by its longtime chairman and chief executive, Raymond \"Chip\" Mason. Among its strengths, Roge said, are its acquisition of Citigroup Inc.'s (C) fund management business in exchange for Legg Mason's broker-deal unit. Roge also likes Legg Mason's 80% ownership of the Permal Group, a hedge fund firm. \u001d  Legg Mason shares are down 32% from their 52-week high on April 7, 2006. Still, the shares have been trading recently at about $96, up 20% since Aug. 1. \u001d  Roge's fund also holds shares in the Tilson Focus Fund (TILFX), which had about 14% of its assets invested in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway at the end of October, according to Morningstar. Whitney Tilson, one of the fund's co-managers, writes a column for the Motley Fool financial Web site. \u001d  Tilson is someone \"who is extremely well-connected and shares ideas with top people in the industry,\" Roge said. Glen Tongue is the other co-manager of the fund, which was down 0.08% this year as of Wednesday. \u001d  Tongue has solid experience running a hedge fund, so he and Tilson \"together make a great team,\" Roge said. \u001d  (Carmen Fleetwood covers Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and convergence issues in technology for Dow Jones Newswires.) \u001d  -By Carmen Fleetwood, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5216; carmen.fleetwood@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:00 ET (19:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0f4451f9936fa26c58c42e7777e495b3","symR":["12057.FR","BRL","SNY","FR0000120578"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Barr Confirms Patent Challenge of Ambien CR(R)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12057.FR","BRL","SNY","FR0000120578"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bBarr Confirms Patent Challenge of Ambien CR(R) \b \b\b \b   WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., April 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Barr \bPharmaceuticals, Inc.

Three successful THAAD tests were conducted at WSMR, including the intercept of a unitary target in July 2006.  Earlier this year, the first flight test conducted at PMRF demonstrated THAAD's ability to intercept a threat representative target in the high endo-atmosphere. \b \u001d  THAAD is designed to defend U.S. troops, allied forces, population centers and critical infrastructure against short- to intermediate range ballistic missiles.  THAAD comprises a fire control and communications system, interceptors, launchers and a radar.  The THAAD interceptor uses hit-to-kill technology to destroy targets, and is the only weapon system that engages threat ballistic missiles at both endo- and exo-atmospheric altitudes. \b \u001d  A key element of the nation's Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), THAAD is a Missile Defense Agency program, with the program office located in Huntsville, AL.  The agency is developing a BMDS to defend the United States, its deployed forces, friends and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges and in all phases of flight. \b \u001d  Lockheed Martin is a world leader in systems integration and the development of air and missile defense systems and technologies, including the first operational hit-to-kill missile.  It also has considerable experience in missile design and production, infrared seekers, command and control/battle management, and communications, precision pointing and tracking optics, as well as radar and signal processing.  The company makes significant contributions to all major U.S. missile defense systems and participates in several global missile defense partnerships. \b \u001d  Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., Lockheed Martin employs about 140,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture and integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. \b \u001d  Video of this test will be uplinked on April 6th to satellite and will be available in three separate time windows from three different satellites.

The coverage led to a shake-up in the company's management and an investigation by the Defense Department Inspector General. \b \u001d  WISH-TV's Karen Hensel and I-Team 8 earned a Peabody Award for its investigative series Command Mistake, uncovering startling truths about the safety of U.S. Military helmets currently used in Iraq and why they lacked $30 in padding that could make the difference between walking away from a blast and suffering brain injury or even death. \b \u001d  \"We are extraordinarily proud that WTNH-TV and WISH-TV are two out of only four local stations in the country to receive the Peabody Award - considered one of journalism's most prestigious honors,\" said Vincent Sadusky, president and chief executive officer of LIN TV. \"It is another example of how great television can make a positive impact on the lives of so many.\" \b \u001d  The Peabody Awards are American broadcasting's most honorable prize.

The staff determination letter indicated that this matter serves as additional basis for delisting the Company's securities from the Nasdaq Stock Market. No other listing deficiency was cited in the April 2nd staff determination letter. \b \u001d  As previously reported, the Company's securities will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market during the review of the Nasdaq Listing and Hearings Review Council (\"Listing Council\").

SpA (PC.MI) moved to oust Rossi because of a conflict over strategy. \u001d  Telecom Italia Deputy Chairman Carlo Buora will temporarily assume Rossi's powers, Telecom Italia said in a statement, to keep the company running smoothly. Rossi's mandate was for regulatory issues and legal affairs. Buora will remain deputy chairman. \u001d  Rossi Wednesday had said he wouldn't resign even if Pirelli chose to oust him, but by Thursday, newspaper La Repubblica reported that Rossi was considering resigning. \u001d  Pirelli owns 80% of Olimpia, an unlisted holding which in turns owns 18% of Telecom Italia. \u001d  The news follows a period of stormy relations between Pirelli Chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera and Rossi over strategy and over Tronchetti Provera's several attempts to sell his controlling stake to foreign telecoms operators. \u001d  Tronchetti Provera's aim to exit Telecom has brought him into open conflict with Prime Minister Romano Prodi, since Prodi is keen to see the company remain in Italian hands. That conflict resulted in Tronchetti Provera's resignation as Telecom Italia chairman late last year. \u001d  Rossi was brought in as chairman to make peace with the government. \u001d  After months of inconclusive talks with potential buyers, Tronchetti Provera stunned the business community last week when he announced a possible deal with America's AT&T (T) and Mexico's America Movil SA de CV (AMOV). \u001d  Cabinet ministers, reacting to the announcement, have called for another solution that would protect the company from possible foreign control. \u001d  Tronchetti Provera's moves have also angered other Telecom Italia shareholders. \u001d  Two of Telecom Italia's largest shareholders, Mediobanca SpA (MB.MI) and Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G.MI), said late Wednesday that they hadn't been consulted by Pirelli on management changes. Mediobanca was not consulted on the AT&T talks either, another person familiar with the matter said. \u001d  Olimpia shares control of Telecom Italia under a shareholders' pact with investment bank Mediobanca and insurer Generali, which together own 5.2%. \u001d  France Telecom (FTE) and Telefonica SA (TEF) are considering individual counteroffers to tentative bids by AT&T Inc. and America Movil for a combined 66.6% stake in Olimpia. \u001d  In addition to those potential buyers, Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISNPY) said it is ready to team up with other financial institutions to end the battle for control of Telecom Italia and keep the company in Italian hands - although without ruling out a partnership with AT&T and America Movil. \u001d  Mediobanca is being pressured by the government and other members of Italy's business establishment to find a \"national solution,\" a person familiar with the matter told Dow Jones Newswires earlier this week. \u001d  Tronchetti Provera's proposed replacement for Rossi is Pasquale Pistorio, a Telecom Italia director and former chairman of semiconductor firm STMicroelectronics NV (STM), according to people familiar with the matter. \b \u001d  -By Jennifer Clark, Dow Jones Newswires; 39 335 833 5761; jennifer.clark@dowjones.com \u001d  (Jonathan Vuocolo, Jason Singer, Gabriel Kahn, Giada Zampano and Sabrina Cohen contributed to this story) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 13:31 ET (17:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1cfbf8725bb7d51adc58d6841509a560","symR":["A","STGN"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Agilent:Deal Is 28% Premium To April 5 Stratagene Close Price","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["A","STGN"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","ITC","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:02 ET (15:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1d1a95a643e26cfa53082cf3db5661ec","symR":["CRP.XX"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": S&P Places Remington Arms On Watch Positive","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CRP.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's: \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Standard & Poor's) April 6, 2007--Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said today that it placed its ratings, including the 'CCC+' corporate credit rating, on Remington Arms Co.

The index stayed securely in positive territory relative to its 52-week moving average. On that basis, the index was up by 3.9% after a recent peak 4.8% increase in the week ended Jan. 26. This measure is favored by ECRI as a leading indicator and except for a 15-week interruption when it was unchanged or in negative territory last summer has been in positive territory since June 2005. The recent move back into positive territory and suggests some pick up in the economy later this year after a pronounced slowdown in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2006. (JJM) \u001d  10:17 (Dow Jones) The dollar has extended its gains made on the back of a better-than-expected March employment report, hitting a fresh intra-day high against the yen at Y119.39 and pushing the euro to a fresh low at $1.3367. Meanwhile, Feb wholesale inventories were in line with expectations, also helping dollar sentiment.

Could boost GDP estimates. Also, since wholesale inventories contain a lot of imports, this could point to a widening in the trade deficit, due to be reported next Friday. (JJM) \u001d  10:03 (Dow Jones) Rick Klingman, head of Treasury trading at ABN Amro in New York, said \"all the bids dropped with about thirty seconds to go\" before payrolls but he \"didn't see any volume trade on lower prices.\" (LPN) \u001d  9:55 (Dow Jones) It looks like Credit Suisse Group is renewing the bonds of friendship with two of its former executives, David Matlin and Mark Patterson, who left the bank in 2002 to start their own distressed buyout shop. Three years ago, Credit Suisse declined to invest in a $1.7B fund MatlinPatterson was raising, even though the bank had contributed a $450M to MatlinPatterson's first fund. But MatlinPatterson now seems to be letting bygones be bygones. As it prepares to close its newest fund, which is expected to attract $4.5B - a huge sum for funds that invest in ailing companies - the firm is once again counting Credit Suisse among its investors, people close to the situation said.

While the market may recover, and while we will attempt to restore our gain on sale margins by raising interest rates charged to consumers, our working assumption must be that current market conditions will persist and that our gain on sale margins will not recover through the balance of the year.\" \u001d  -Gabriel Madway; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:39 ET (16:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1d65f06a0a38610a543738e806ba4e39","symR":["DSCP"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Datascope To Pay Ex-Fincl Chief $250,000 Severance >DSCP","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T13:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DSCP"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 09:56 ET (13:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1dd5a93cc49cd4b58826a027b2b03749","symR":["PNCL"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Pinnacle Airlines, Inc.

Eni's share includes $1.3 billion for oil and gas fields in the Yamal region, offering access to strategic Russian reserves. This move nevertheless carries high risks related to the challenging Russian operating environment for foreign players, partly mitigated by Eni's strategic agreements with OAO Gazprom and the group's longstanding relationship as an important offtaker of Russian gas. The remaining $3.7 billion for a 20% stake in JSC Gazprom Neft is, however, negative as it reflects balance sheet lending in favor of OAO Gazprom, which we expect to acquire the stake over the next two years (as per its call option). The ratings on Eni are unchanged given the company's strong financial flexibility, with year-end 2006 net financial debt down to EUR7.7 billion, robust free cash flow of EUR7 billion (before dividends), and strong adjusted funds from operations to debt of 123%.

NV said Friday it would ask Brazilian regulators to approve a new higher offer for Arcelor SA's (5786.FR) Latin American steel units that adds up to EUR4 billion to the cost of the companies' deal to become the world's largest steelmaker. \u001d  This comes after Brazil's Securities and Exchange Commission ordered Mittal to buy out minority shareholders of Arcelor Brasil (ARCE3.BR) on the same terms as the offer for shares in the Luxembourg-based parent company, telling it an earlier offer of up to EUR2.6 billion was too low. \u001d  Mittal said the new offer would be open for 30 business days, after which the company planned to cancel Arcelor Brasil as a public company. \u001d  Arcelor Brasil shareholders could choose between an offer of 11.7 Brazilian reals (EUR4.30) in cash plus shares in new company Arcelor Mittal (MT) or BRL11.7 plus a cash amount in the same currency equal to the value of Mittal shares traded in New York on the business day immediately before the auction date. \u001d  It didn't give a total cash value of the offer per share. \u001d  The company said it would pay out a maximum 10.9 billion Brazilian reals and 76 million Arcelor Mittal shares - 5% of the company's capital on a fully diluted basis. \u001d  Mittal had earlier contested the Brazilian regulator's view that buying Arcelor meant a change of control in the Brazilian unit and would require a separate offer. \u001d  At least two private investment funds filed complaints with Brazilian regulators asking the combined Arcelor Mittal be forced to make a public buyout offer for Arcelor Brasil's outstanding shares. \u001d  When Arcelor Mittal complete their combination this summer, they will form a steel titan with close to 10% of global production. Arcelor Brasil will be a key component of the new company, currently representing 7% of joint Arcelor-Mittal sales and 11% of both companies' combined shipments. \u001d  The Brazilian company was formed in late 2005, when Arcelor combined its controlling stakes in steel slab manufacturer Companhia Siderurgica Tubarao, or CST, long steel maker Belgo-Mineira and galvanized steel producer Vega do Sul. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 10:08 ET (14:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"20a1898acf829129507ec2c9da38f61b","symR":["S"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Gameloft Partners With Sprint To Launch 3D Games","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T16:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["S"],"IndustryCodes":["CTS","TLS","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:22 ET (16:22 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2126192657d77918164fb5c54d01e1d3","symR":["AHM","MTB"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"2nd UPDATE:Amer Home Mortgage Cuts Views On Lower Loan Bids","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T19:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AHM","MTB"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Adds spokeswoman in third-to-last paragraph and share price in last paragraph.) \b \b   By Lingling Wei \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. (AHM), an investment trust specializing in prime and near-prime home loans, on Friday sharply cut its first-quarter and full-year earnings forecasts, in another sign that the woes in the riskiest mortgage market are spreading. \u001d  Like other independent, nonbank mortgage companies that heavily depend on Wall Street and yield-hunting institutional investors for profits, the Melville, N.Y., company said it saw \"far fewer buyers offering materially lower prices\" last month in the markets for loan pools and for mortgage-backed bonds. Those changes, said Chief Executive Michael Strauss, reduced the amount it earned from loan sales and forced the company to write down the value of certain mortgage assets. \u001d  American Home now expects to earn between 40 cents and 60 cents a share in the first quarter, compared with the $1.11-$1.17 range it projected in January. For 2007, it forecasts earnings of $3.75 to $4.25 a share, down from its previous view of $5.40 to $5.70. The company also said it is cutting its quarterly dividend to 70 cents from $1.12. \u001d  The list of companies reporting problems with loan sales is growing. Just a week ago, M&T Bank Corp. (MTB), in which Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKA, BRKB) is a big investor, said it was having trouble selling certain near-prime mortgage loans. Instead, the Buffalo, N.Y., bank said it would keep the loans on its books, a move that could knock about $7 million off its first-quarter earnings. \u001d  Worried about rising past-due loans, investment banks that buy and repackage mortgages into securities have retreated from what had been one of the fastest-growing businesses on Wall Street since the late 1990s. The issuance of securities backed by loans to people with tarnished credit records has plunged. And there is growing evidence that the subprime meltdown is spilling over to the markets for loans boasting higher credit quality. \u001d  Last year, American Home made $58.9 billion in loans to about 196,000 borrowers with weighted-average FICO score of 716, including so-called Alt-A borrowers whose credit records are deemed good-enough to forgo proof of their claimed income or assets. In addition to lower secondary-market demand for its loans, the company also blamed high delinquency rates and the resulting greater loan-loss reserves for its reduced earnings forecasts. \u001d  American Home said \"a disproportionate share\" of its nonperforming loans consists of Alt-A mortgages it was forced to buy back due to early defaults or other reasons. The company said it has stopped offering loans that have resulted in \"a high proportion\" of repurchases and expects the charge stemming from loan buybacks to diminish toward the end of the year. \u001d  A spokeswoman said the types of mortgages the company has cut back on include those that don't require income verification. \u001d  \"While the (secondary) market may recover, and while we will attempt to restore our gain on sale margins by raising interest rates charged to consumers,\" Strauss said, \"our working assumption must be that current market conditions will persist and that our gain on sale margins will not recover through the balance of the year.\" \u001d  Shares in American Home closed Thursday down 41 cents, or 1.56%, at $25.84. The U.S. stock market is closed Friday for Good Friday. The stock has been down 26% since the beginning of this year. \u001d  - By Lingling Wei, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2089; lingling.wei@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:08 ET (19:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"21849d65a19b80b55fd3da7d66dccef5","symR":["GAN.YY"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": S&P Revises Groupama Outlook To Positive","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T14:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GAN.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["INF","INS"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's: \b \u001d  PARIS (Standard & Poor's) April 6, 2007--Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said today that it revised its outlook on French insurer Groupama S.A. and its core subsidiaries to positive from stable. At the same time, the 'A' long-term counterparty credit and financial strength ratings were affirmed. \u001d  \"The outlook revision reflects continuing improvement in Groupama's operating performance, confirmed by strong 2006 earnings,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Lotfi Elbarhdadi. \"This improvement indicates Groupama's ability to take advantage of good market conditions and to increasingly control the volatility of its earnings through better underwriting discipline. Also factored in are Groupama's ongoing efforts to rationalize and strengthen its international presence.\" \u001d  The ratings reflect Groupama's improving operating performance, its leading competitive position in France, and its strong capitalization. Partly offsetting these positive factors are still-high, although declining, operating expenses, constraining the quality of earnings, and a significant reliance on earnings generated in the French non-life sector. \u001d  Groupama wrote EUR13.9 billion in gross premiums in 2006--EUR6.9 billion in property/casualty insurance, EUR2.5 billion in accident and health (A&H), and EUR4.5 billion in life--with 17% written outside France. \u001d  \"The positive outlook reflects our expectation that the earnings improvements in 2006 are sustainable, based on better claims control, and improved quality of earnings through reduced expenses and greater diversification,\" said Mr. Elbarhdadi. \u001d  The non-life combined ratio is expected to remain below 102% even in the case of worsening market conditions, helped by further expense ratio reductions. Life business is expected to grow profitably and to post strong performance. The outlook also reflects Groupama's ability to maintain strong capitalization and financial flexibility. \u001d  The current ratings could be raised over the 2007-2008 horizon if the non-life combined ratio remains stable and below 102%, and if life business profitability reported on a European embedded value basis shows ratios in line with those of local peers. Alternatively, the outlook could return to stable if the quality of capitalization or competitive position were to deteriorate, if the non-life combined ratio were to become higher than 102%, or if life operating performance were significantly below that of peers. \b \u001d  Copyright (c) 2007, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 10:07 ET (14:07 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"22af930d421b231301722a2f025f340b","symR":["CBM"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Cambrex To Stop Paying Qtrly Divs, Use Funds For Growth","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBM"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:21 ET (15:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"22c8e00512de14d96f1ba2fccd6cf0df","symR":["A","STGN"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Stratagene, Agilent See Deal Closing In About 90 Days","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["A","STGN"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","ITC","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:03 ET (15:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"23325191b0d722504dc56ffe90fcca0f","symR":["FCMC"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Chmn AXON Buys 5,000 Of FRANKLIN CREDIT MGMT CORP >FCMC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FCMC"],"IndustryCodes":["MFN","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: FRANKLIN CREDIT MGMT CORP \bSYMBOL: FCMC \b \bFILER: AXON THOMAS J \bTITLE: Chairman of the Board \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/4/07             Purchase                  5,000       $4.94         $24,700 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 3,418,749 (Direct) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

(NYSE:FCL) affiliates, Cumberland Coal Resources, LP (Cumberland) and Emerald Coal Resources, LP (Emerald) are separately conducting negotiations with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Today, each of these employers has provided additional comments regarding the ongoing strike at the Cumberland and Emerald mines in southwestern Pennsylvania. Hourly workers represented by the UMWA walked off the job at 12:01 AM on April 4, 2007. \b \u001d  Cumberland and Emerald remain hopeful that talks with the UMWA will result in an agreement to sign the 2007 National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement (National Agreement) thereby allowing nearly 1,000 striking Cumberland and Emerald employees to return to work. The UMWA has endorsed the National Agreement as the \"industry-wide agreement\" to be signed by all operating UMWA represented mines. After confirming they would be in the same competitive position as their peers, who also signed the same National Agreement, Cumberland and Emerald separately notified the UMWA of their willingness to sign that same agreement on February 21, 2007. This notification came long before their 2002 contracts expired in order to provide certainty to their workforces. Most other entities that signed the National Agreement did so well after their contracts expired. \b \u001d  In response to comments made earlier by UMWA president, Cecil Roberts, regarding the recent profitability of the two mines, spokesman for Cumberland and Emerald, Peter Vietti, said, \"All the companies that signed the National Agreement were more profitable in recent years, and that is why the UMWA was able to negotiate such an exceptional National Agreement. This profitability is good for everyone.\" \b \u001d  Vietti added, \"The Cumberland and Emerald mines have been profitable operations in the last few years, thanks both to the hard work of their dedicated employees and the significant investment the companies have made in assets and technology. During the five-year term of their just expired collective bargaining agreements, Emerald invested over $110 million and Cumberland invested over $145 million to enhance safety and remain competitive. Due in large part to this ongoing investment, the number of hourly employees increased over 13 percent in this same period. Just as important, the profitably of the mines provides the cash flow needed to support very generous employee benefits, including medical benefits, that are paid by Cumberland and Emerald to their employees and current and future retirees.\" \b \u001d  Vietti further noted, \"The companies, their employees, and the local communities are in this business together, and they hope the profitability continues. This allows them to purchase millions of dollars in goods and services from local businesses, to support various charitable donations, and enhances their ability to support community wide efforts such as the new aquatic center.\" \b \u001d  Although market conditions are inevitably cyclical, Cumberland and Emerald have benefited from a strong market in recent years. In just the last three years the average price for coal from the northern Appalachia region has ranged from the mid-twenties to over fifty dollars per ton. Although the raises the employees receive over the next five years are certain, the business cycle is not. \b \u001d  Just as the UMWA has stated on numerous occasions, Cumberland and Emerald believe the National Agreement will provide an exceptional wage and benefit package for their employees. Employees will receive a 20 percent wage increase, a $1,000 signing bonus, and enhanced pension benefits. When wage roll-ups and other improvements are factored in, the overall hourly cost to Cumberland and Emerald for signing the National Agreement will be increased by 32 percent. \b \u001d  \"These mines have enjoyed success in recent years, and Cumberland and Emerald believe the National Agreement allows their employees to share in that success,\" said Vietti. \"This is the same agreement their regional competitors have signed, and Cumberland and Emerald are comfortable they will not be competitively disadvantaged by signing it as well. On a level playing field, their employees can compete with anyone. These entities need the ability to provide a competitive, reliable source of coal to their utility and industrial customers. In the end, customers who buy the coal must be convinced of a mine's ability to compete, remain profitable and supply coal without interruption.\" \b \u001d  Vietti concluded, \"Nobody benefits from a strike, and both of these employers remain ready to sign the National Agreement. Timely resumption of operations benefits our employees, their families, and the communities in which they live. A quick resolution is in everyone's best interests.\" \b \u001d  Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc., through its affiliates is a major U.S. coal producer with 13 coal mines and related facilities in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

(YUM), which operates KFC and Pizza Hut. \u001d  The ACFTU, the national umbrella group for government-approved unions, is in the midst of a campaign to boost the group's presence in foreign companies, which employ some 25 million people in China but until recently resisted allowing labor organizing. \u001d  \"We have never given up our efforts to talk foreign companies into setting up workers' unions,\" Hang said. \"Their Guangdong branches have given us the very promising response that they will set up union branches within this year,\" she said in a telephone interview from the trade federation's headquarters in Beijing. \u001d  McDonald's China spokesman George Gu could not immediately be reached. A spokeswoman for Yum said she could not comment immediately on the issue. \u001d  But pressure on the fast-food giants has mounted since a Chinese newspaper reported that the companies underpay their part-time workers in some areas of China by up to 40% below the minimum wage of about $1 an hour. \u001d  Chinese labor officials have launched investigations, while the companies have said they are seeking clarification of recently amended labor laws to ensure compliance. \u001d  China does not allow workers to organize independently, requiring all such activities to take place under the oversight of the ACFTU. Labor activists are frequently jailed and harassed. \u001d  In recent years the organization, long considered more an ally of state-controlled management than of workers, has lobbied foreign companies to allow the creation of union cells in their China operations. The ACFTU says its goal is to prevent worker-management confrontations. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 04:42 ET (08:42 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2c14cb31506fa49117ac279b7921cebb","symR":["SNTO"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Sento Delayed Annual Mtg To Retain New CEO","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SNTO"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 16:08 ET (20:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2cb6b43d7c2940efcdd02d631c6600f3","symR":["EMBT"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Embarcadero Going-Private Deal Follows Review Of Options","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T13:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EMBT"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 09:32 ET (13:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2cf8b691c1f7959a58b43b0f8b7898a9","symR":["FICC"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Fieldstone Investment To Cut Wholesale Oper Centers To 3 From 9","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FICC"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 16:21 ET (20:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2d0e10465ccfb75bfca888082f8afd4b","symR":["12040.FR","FR0000120404"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Groupe Arnault Finalizes Go Voyages Purchase","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T08:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12040.FR","FR0000120404"],"IndustryCodes":["LOD","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--Groupe Arnault subsidiary Financiere Agache Private Equity finalized the purchase of Go Voyages March 30, the company said in a statement Friday. \u001d  Groupe Arnault, along with management of Go Voyages, announced in February they would purchase of the travel agency from French hotels group Accor SA (12040.FR). \u001d  The deal is worth about EUR281 million. \u001d  The European Commission cleared the deal last week. \u001d  Go Voyages posted EUR402 million in revenue for 2006 and has 300 employees.

(OTC Bulletin Board: CRLI), parent company of CRL Systems, Inc. dba Orban, in response to a surge of demand from broadcasters and other customers, has increased production of its audio processors and other professional electronics to reduce order backlog and to speed up deliveries to customers. \b \u001d  Beginning mid-March, the company's production staff began working an additional two hours daily and a Saturday assembly shift was added to the work week.  Both changes will remain in effect until production can satisfy demand quickly, which is estimated to be by mid-May.  The company has a large backlog of orders totaling approximately $3.0 million dollars, a result of strong bookings and delays brought on by production down-time caused by the company's moving its corporate offices and manufacturing from San Leandro, California to Tempe, Arizona.  Additionally, production has been impacted by difficulty in procuring components that comply with the EU \"reduction of hazard substances\" (RoHS) directive.  This requires that electrical and electronic equipment placed on the EU market after July 1, 2006 contain restricted levels of lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, and brominated flame retardants. \b \u001d  \"Our management and sales units are indebted to our production staff.

The 8500 builds on the proven, competitive sound of the 8400 while adding features that make it the ideal choice for FM stations simultaneously transmitting iBiquity's HD Radio(R), Eureka 147 (DAB), or a netcast.  Orban designed all of the 8500's circuitry using the latest components and built in enough DSP power to support future improvements like those in the 8500's upcoming Version 2.0 software. \b \u001d  In 2006, the company consolidated its Orban and CRL production units into a new 36,000 square foot corporate headquarters and manufacturing plant in Tempe, Arizona.

VioQuest has two targeted therapeutics in Phase I/IIa clinic trials: VQD-002 which inhibits phosphorylation of Akt that is seen at abnormally high levels in breast, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, and hematologic tumors; and Lenocta(TM), an inhibitor of specific protein tyrosine phosphatases, which has shown compelling preclinical activity in both renal and melanoma cancers.  In addition, VioQuest and the U.S. Army are planning to submit an NDA to the FDA in 2007 for Lenocta(TM) for the treatment of leishmaniasis.  VioQuest's subsidiary Chiral Quest, Inc., a pioneer in asymmetric chemocatalysis and custom synthesis, offers its proprietary technology products to well-known pharmaceutical and fine chemical companies worldwide to improve their production efficiencies and, in some instances, to increase the overall safety and efficacy of the underlying drug.

These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as anticipates, expects, plans, believes, intends, and similar words or phrases. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from these statements. Among other things, there can be no assurances that the FDA will approve VioQuest's planned NDA submission relating to Lenocta(TM) for the treatment of leishmaniasis, and even if approved, there is no assurance that VioQuest will be able to successfully commercialize Lenocta(TM) for the treatment of leishmaniasis or any other indication, or that VioQuest will receive any proceeds in connection with a sale or other disposition of its Chiral Quest division. Other risks and uncertainties include the possibility that the results of clinical trials will not support VioQuest's claims, the possibility that VioQuest's development efforts relating to its product candidates, including Lenocta(TM) and VQD-002, will not be successful, the inability to obtain regulatory approval of VioQuest's product candidates, VioQuest's reliance on third-party researchers to develop its product candidates, its lack of experience in developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products, and the possibility that its licenses to develop and commercialize its product candidates may be terminated.

(\"Wellman\") and the existing ratings on the company's debt and revised the outlook to negative. This concludes the review started November 1, 2006, when Wellman's corporate family rating was downgraded to B3 from B2 and kept under review for further downgrade. The following summarizes the ratings: \u001d  Wellman, Inc. \u001d  Corporate family rating -- B3 \u001d  Probability of default rating -- B3 \u001d  $185mm First lien term loan due 2009 -- B1, LGD3, 31% \u001d  $265mm Second lien term loan due 2010 -- Caa1, LGD5, 78% \u001d  The rating confirmation reflects the improving operating environment for the company's products and ongoing efforts to restructure its business which should provide increased financial flexibility. Wellman has announced price increases in 2007 and expects stronger product demand in the second quarter to improve free cash flow. Moody's expects that the company's restructuring of its US operations will result in cost savings and proceeds from planned asset sales will be applied towards debt reductions. \u001d  The negative outlook reflects uncertainty about Wellman's ability to improve its low margins, operating losses, and to maintain at least $45 million of availability under its revolving credit facility. The outlook also reflects Moody's beliefs that the PET resin industry cash margins will decline further in 2007 due to new capacity additions and Asian imports. Although Moody's expects the company's liquidity to improve modestly in 2007 due to one-time cash inflows, depressed margins and deteriorating market conditions will likely prevent the company from keeping its fixed charge ratio above 1.0x. If Wellman allows the availability under its $225 million revolver to fall below $45 million for eight consecutive days and its fixed charge coverage ratio is less than 1.0x, it could result in an event of default under the credit agreement if not waived by the banks. In Moody's opinion, given the strong collateral coverage on the revolver, Wellman should be able to obtain such a waiver, if required. However, the collateral coverage does not guarantee that they will receive a waiver, especially if the company remains free cash flow negative over the next 12-24 months. \u001d  The outlook might be moved to stable if the company were successful in improving its operating margins, selling non-core assets, reducing debt, refinancing existing debt prior to its maturity and industry conditions were supportive of the rating. Wellman could potentially generate a significant amount of cash from several one-time items over the next 12-24 months. The company estimates that working capital improvements, operational improvements, insurance proceeds relating to Hurricane Katrina damages and the sale of non-core US and European assets may provide more than $100 million over the next 12-18 months. While these one-time items would greatly improve the company's liquidity, Wellman ultimately needs to improve its margins and operating cash flows which remain susceptible to raw material volatility and pressure on prices and margins from lower cost competitors and imports. \u001d  There is little upward pressure on the ratings currently and any future upgrade would require the company to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow and largely reduce the outstanding revolver balance with cash from the one-time items mentioned above. If Wellman remains free cash flow negative and does not generate meaningful cash from the one-time items mentioned above, Moody's could lower the company's ratings. \u001d  Wellman manufactures and markets PET (polyethylene terephthalate) packaging resins under the PermaClear brand name and polyester staple fibers under the Fortrel brand name. Wellman operates five manufacturing sites - three in the US, one in Ireland and one in the Netherlands. Wellman is headquartered in Fort Mill, South Carolina and had revenues from continuing operations of $1.3 billion for the LTM ended December 31, 2006. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:38 ET (15:38 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2e6ffac1b69cff07d4347e7dfd01d0d8","symR":["SHFL"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Shuffle Master: Trustee Alleges Default For Delayed 10Q","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T11:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SHFL"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Shuffle Master Inc.

Humes, the Navy's mine warfare program manager, told reporters this week ahead of the Navy League Sea-Air-Space Exposition that the service will begin using in May two airborne laser mine detection systems, or ALMDS, produced by Northrop Grumman Corp. \u001d  The Melbourne, Fla.-based division of Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) won a $35.7 million contract in April 2006 for two of the minesweeping pods, which can be used day or night and in all weather conditions. They are being installed on MH-60S helicopters built by Lockheed Martin Corp. at Lockheed's Oswego, N.Y., facilities. \u001d  The pods are capable of surveying waters more than 40 feet deep for potential mines, according to Northrop. The aim is to search and detect mines from the air without ever having to make contact with the water - eliminating potential fatalities for Navy divers. \u001d  Northrop is developing a separate system to destroy mines from the air under a three-year $36.9 million contract awarded in August 2002. The Rapid Airborne Mine Clearance System, or RAMICS, will use a 30mm gun, also to be equipped on the MH-60S helicopters, to detonate the mines. \u001d  ALMDS is an integral part of the mine warfare mission package designed for the Navy's four new littoral combat ships being built by Falls Church, Va.-based General Dynamics Corp.

commonly known as APP China - said: \"We trust the U.S. Commerce Department will quickly correct this mistake.\" \u001d  While analysts and executives of some paper companies agree that the impact from the latest sanctions on China's paper industry is limited, APP China's position as the country's largest exporter of coated paper means the company could face a bigger fall out. \u001d  APP China's flagship, Gold East Paper (Jiangsu) Co., was one of two companies named by the U.S. Commerce Department and was slapped with a 20.35% import duty, the highest level. \u001d  In an email response to questions from Dow Jones Newswires, Gold East Paper said the U.S. decision is the \"sort of strong-handed trade, which not only hurts the normal trading of the two countries' paper industries but also seriously violates the globalization of the world economic system advocated by the U.S.\" \u001d  On March 30, the U.S. said imports of Chinese coated free sheet paper would face preliminary countervailing duties ranging from 10.9% to 20.35% as subsidies enjoyed by Chinese companies put U.S. producers at a disadvantage. \u001d  The U.S. decision harks back to China's own moves nearly four years ago to protect its paper makers. In August 2003, China's Ministry of Commerce imposed antidumping duties between 4% and 71% on coated art paper imported from South Korea and Japan after finding that low-priced goods from those countries were harming Chinese producers. \u001d  \"Since China imposed antidumping duties on Korean and Japanese paper, the domestic production capacity grew very  quickly and exceeded the domestic demand, and China started exporting coated paper recently,\" said Li Shixin, a paper analyst at Guosen Securities. Li said that in 1997 China was importing 90% of the coated paper used domestically and only really started exporting coated paper in the past two years or so. \u001d  Li said the U.S. decision hits APP China harder since it was assessed the biggest duty rate, and APP China's Gold East Paper exports more than 50% of China's total coated paper exports. Li estimates that China exported between 300,000-400,000 tons of coated paper last year. Imports of coated free sheet paper products from China rose by about 177% in 2006 and were valued at US$224 million, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. It said imports from China in 2006 were 264,026 tons, versus 99,182 tons in 2005. \u001d  APP China said that Gold East Paper's annual coated paper production capacity was 2 million tons, making it one of the biggest producers of coated paper in the world. But an official at APP China said he couldn't say how much Gold East Paper exported. \u001d  Shandong Chenming Paper Holdings Ltd. (000488.SZ), which was also named by the Commerce Department and faces a 10.9% import duty, said that while it was \"unhappy\" with the U.S. move, the sanctions would have only a small impact on its business. \u001d  China's coated paper exports to the U.S. represent only a small part of the industry's total sales, said Shandong Sun Paper Industry Joint Stock Co.'s (002078.SZ) board secretary Yu Shijin on Friday. \u001d  \"The domestic market is developing and the demand is rising. So the impact (on domestic paper prices) isn't likely to be big,\" Yu said. \u001d  A Chinese commerce ministry official over the weekend said that Beijing is \"strongly dissatisfied\" with the U.S. government's decision and asked the U.S. to reconsider and correct it but no concrete measures have been presented so far. \b \u001d  -By Jane Lanhee Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; (86-21) 6120-1200; jane.lee@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 07:05 ET (11:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"314e57c4340be5e2261bc4c7727491d3","symR":["NATK"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": NATK Announces New Executive Team","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T19:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NATK"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MARSHALL, Texas, April 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- North American Technologies Group, Inc.

(CBS), and Kiran Chetry, recently added from News Corp.'s (NWS) Fox News, would be replacing them. \b \u001d  This is what transpired on the call, according to The Wall Street Journal's Web site: \"As for Ms. Chetry, who joined CNN in February from Fox News Channel, 'One look at her tells you why she deserves the spot,' Mr. Klein said. 'She's a terrific anchor who lights up the screen.'\" \b \u001d  Ugh. \b \b   Camera-Ready \b \u001d  When I profiled Klein in this column last Aug. 16, I wrote that he was \"irrepressible\" and that \"to his credit, he possesses an inherent self-confidence to say whatever is on his mind and then consider the consequences.\" \b \u001d  Klein has stressed that CNN, alone, devotes its morning programming to news - not to celebrity gossip and promotions or beauty and health and cooking advice. If you want a diet of serious, no-frills coverage, CNN is your network. \b \u001d  This is a terrific comfort to news junkies, and CNN deserves plenty of credit to buck the \"happy talk\" trend in what passes for breakfast-hour \"news\" shows. \b \u001d  Now, Klein should know better than to give someone an impression that CNN cares, above everything else, about looking sexy. Even if this was the last thing on his mind, it came through, and it didn't have to. \b \u001d  Of course, all of the TV-news operations want to present a certain camera-friendly image. (Remember, CBS once altered a photo of anchor Katie Couric to make her look more photogenic.) It's a constant dilemma for TV-news executives to strike a balance between presenting journalists who have good looks and gravitas. Klein said he firmly believes that Chetry and Roberts are journalists before anything else. \b \u001d  At this point, both O'Briens will stay on at CNN. Soledad O'Brien will be focusing on reporting primarily domestic firestorms. Klein told me Thursday afternoon that he wants her to be viewed as a \"domestic Christiane Amanpour,\" which is high praise. \"I'm a big Soledad fan.\" \b \u001d  Miles O'Brien, who is one of the biggest aerospace experts on television, can now concentrate on his favorite areas of coverage. \b \b   No Car Chases \b \u001d  When I spoke with Klein, he chastised me for putting too much stock in the way his words looked in print and noted that I hadn't heard the call. He said that comparing the \"sexy\" comment of five years ago with anything he said this week was \"a completely specious argument.\" \b \u001d  \"What I was referring to was the ineffable qualities of both anchors,\" he added. \"There's no doubt about it. You watch them and you know why they're an anchor team. Combining them will be even greater than the individual parts.\" \b \u001d  Since he came aboard a few years ago, Klein has proven himself to be one of the most astute and aggressive news executives around. He has scrambled to boost CNN's ratings while not diminishing its focus. You don't see coverage of car chases or burning buildings on CNN, where only a few years ago, these nonstories were given high priorities. He has sharp instincts. \b \u001d  Klein should've stuck to praising CNN's news-gathering ability, not the network's good-looking newscasters. Roberts, Chetry and the viewers all deserve better. \b \b   Sam Zell \b \u001d  Billionaire Sam Zell has an opportunity to be a media star. I hope he doesn't blow it. \b \u001d  Zell, who agreed to acquire Tribune Co. (TRB) last week, should make rebuilding morale at the Los Angeles Times his top priority. \b \u001d  Tribune's mismanagement has put the newspaper's employees through hell. \b \u001d  Zell has an obligation to Times staffers to reassure them that he is interested in their well-being. As a smart investor, he should also recognize that he needs the Times to perform at its best to help his investment succeed. \u001d  (Jon Friedman is media editor for MarketWatch in New York.) \u001d  -Jon Friedman; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 07:22 ET (11:22 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"32fda6ccfa64ec0363b748b6a10c4982","symR":["EFX","TALX","US2944291051"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Talx Holders To Vote On Equifax Deal May 15","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T14:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EFX","TALX","US2944291051"],"IndustryCodes":["FAD","FIS","SVC","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 10:10 ET (14:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"335361e8373ca5d2fb7e4e99f53c5f2c","symR":["WMC.XX"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Moody's Rates Ace 2007-WM2 Subprime Mtge Deal","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T13:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WMC.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Moody's Investors Service: \b \bMoody's Rates Ace Securities 2007-WM2 Subprime Mortgage Deal \bApproximately $753 Million of Asset-Backed Securities rated \b \u001d  New York, April 06, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned Aaa ratings to the senior certificates issued by ACE Securities Corp.

It said the company's capital management and financial transparency also improved. \u001d  Sullivan's compensation package included a $1 million salary, unchanged from 2005, as well as 175,000 options, 19,200 performance restricted stock awards and 2,000 senior-partner units that may vest in 2010 and 2012, based on performance, according to a proxy statement AIG filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u001d  Sullivan's pay package also included $703,432 in other compensation, which included $257,498 for personal use of corporate aircraft, $135,014 for personal use of company cars and $278,250 for housing, home security and related expenses. \u001d  Using the SEC's methodology for calculating total executive compensation -which some critics say is flawed - Sullivan's total pay package amounted to about $21.23 million. \u001d  AIG also disclosed that it received a shareholder proposal asking that the company make at least 75% of all future executive equity compensation performance-based. Compensation based on performance could include stock options with premium-priced exercise prices or exercise prices that are tied to an industry index, or options or restricted stock that vest only if the company's stock price reaches and maintains a certain price. \u001d  AIG recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal, saying the company's time-vested grants of options and performance-vesting restricted stock units align executives' and shareholders' interests, but wouldn't be recognized as performance-based under the proposal.

(GBTVQ), wants to fund the broadcaster's exit from bankruptcy through a $200 million rights offering. \u001d  Harbinger, along with fellow preferred shareholders GoldenTree High Yield Master Fund and MFC Global Investment Management (U.S.) LLC, said they'd \"put their money where their mouth is\" by backstopping the offering and pumping $200 million into Granite. \u001d  The proposed deal was outlined in a term sheet filed Thursday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. The preferred shareholders want Bankruptcy Judge Allan L. Gropper to end Granite's exclusive control of its bankruptcy case so that they can put forward their own Chapter 11 restructuring plan. \u001d  Harbinger and the other shareholders are objecting to Granite's \"pre-negotiated\" Chapter 11 plan with Silver Point. They say the deal unfairly benefits Granite's founder and chief executive, W. Don Cornwell, at their expense. \u001d  A hearing to extend Granite's sole control of its case is scheduled for Wednesday. If successful, a confirmation hearing on its Silver Point-backed Chapter 11 plan, scheduled for April 16, can go ahead without interference from Harbinger. But if Gropper ends Granite's exclusive control, Harbinger said will file an alternative plan based on the rights offering, the company has said. \u001d  Under Granite's existing Chapter 11 plan, Silver Point and other bondholders will trade $295 million owed them in return for control of the company. \u001d  Both Chapter 11 plans would pay Granite's unsecured creditors in full. Harbinger's proposed plan would pay Silver Point the $74 million it lent Granite last year. Bondholders, who are owed $405 million, would have their bonds reinstated or get new bonds in the reorganized company. \u001d  The preferred shareholders would also provide $25 million in exit financing. \u001d  The big difference between the rival plans is their treatment of Granite's preferred shareholders. Under the Harbinger plan, shareholders will have the chance to participate in the rights offering or cash out in an amount equal to 9% of what they're owed. \u001d  Granite's Chapter 11 plan calls for preferred shareholders, owed about $200 million, to get about 2% in the reorganized company. \u001d  Harbinger, a New York hedge fund, has been successful in using a rights offering to gain control of companeis operating in Chapter 11. Earlier this year, Harbinger was able to lead a group of shareholders of SeraCare Life Sciences Inc. to finance the biotech company's bankruptcy exit. SeraCare reached a deal with the shareholders after scrapping a management-backed Chapter 11 plan \u001d  Harbinger and Silver Point have been fighting over Granite for the better part of a year. Each put forward a restructuring proposal for Granite last June. \u001d  Harbinger's restructuring proposal called for Cornwell to resign as CEO, but as Granite's controlling shareholder, he had the power to scuttle the deal. \u001d  According to a court-appointed examiner, Cornwell said he would step down if Harbinger agreed to his terms. The examiner, Andrew C. Hruska, said Cornwell may have used his position as controlling shareholder to force the TV broadcaster to accept a financing deal that benefited himself at the company's expense. \b \u001d  -Patrick Fitzgerald, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-3544; patrick.fitzgerald@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 17:07 ET (21:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"36ff653713dbfa86fe3cb1fbf7f0e39f","symR":["PC.MI","TI","TIA","TIT.MI","IT0000072725","IT0003497168"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Telecom Italia Chairman Guido Rossi Has Resigned >TI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T12:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PC.MI","TI","TIA","TIT.MI","IT0000072725","IT0003497168"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TIR","TLS","XDJGI","XMIB","XNYA","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MILAN (AP)--Telecom Italia SpA TI) Chairman Guido Rossi resigned Friday, just days after Telecom Italia's largest shareholder moved to oust him from his post, the company said in a statement. \u001d  Olimpia, the holding company set up by Pirelli & C.

(Nasdaq: SSYS), announced today winners in its third annual \"Extreme Redesign: The Ultimate 3D Printing Challenge,\" a global design and 3D printing contest for high school and college students. The winners were announced at 1 p.m. CDT during a webcast ceremony hosted by the Dimension 3D Printing Group. To view this event, see the instructions listed below on page two of this release. \b \u001d  The winners, Mike Rouse (Solar Street Sign) of Warren Career Prep Center/Cousin High School in Warren, Mich. and Mike Kochman (Off-Road Cell Phone Carrier) of Columbus State Community College in Columbus, Ohio, where chosen from a pool of more than 1,200 design entries from around the world. Both first place winners will receive $2,500 scholarships, with the remaining four finalists receiving $1,000 scholarships each. \b \u001d  Mike Rouse, the high school winner, won for his Solar Powered Street Sign design. The design modifies a common street sign with the addition of a solar collector and lights mounted above the sign. The sun charges a battery during the day and uses the stored power to run the lights illuminating the sign at night. Using only the power of the sun, the goal of the design is to enable drivers to view street signs more safely and easily at night. \b \u001d  Mike Kochman, the university category winner, won for his Off-Road Cell Phone Carrier design. The carrier is a waterproof case clamped to either upper fork tube on a motorcycle. The design allows riders to keep cell phones and other small, important items dry and safe while riding. \b \u001d  The other final contestants from the high school category recognized at the ceremony are Jonathon Crompton (Ski Pole Radio) of Sherwood High School in Sherwood, Ore. and Zach Stephens (Twist and Measure) of Westfield High School in Carmel, Ind.

The curriculum and student activities included in the kits have been endorsed by Foundation founder Erin Gruwell, whose story inspired the film Freedom Writers, debuting on DVD April 17, 2007. \b \u001d  As part of the kits, PHE is sponsoring a contest that challenges students to write a 300-word essay on their inspiration to change. Essays will be nominated for official entry by teachers in each participating school and one winner will be chosen from each of eight geographic regions in the United States to receive a $1,000 scholarship prize. Each of the regional winning essays will then be judged by Gruwell herself who will select a grand prize winner to receive an additional $5,000. One grand prize winner also will be chosen in Canada to receive a $5,000 scholarship from among all Canadian entries. \b \u001d  \"I am thrilled that Paramount is working with the Freedom Writers Foundation to provide teaching materials to schools that will help spread one of our core philosophies: that a successful educational curriculum should value, uphold and honor diversity,\" said Gruwell. \"My hope is that this program will help inspire students everywhere to reach their potential.\" \b \u001d  Freedom Writers stars Hilary Swank as Erin Gruwell, a high school teacher in Long Beach, California, who encouraged her class of at-risk students to overcome the gangs that divided them and the educational system that was failing them, and to tell their stories in their own words. The journals the students were inspired to write ultimately became the book The Freedom Writers Diary. The film features an outstanding cast of young actors, many of whom grew up in troubled circumstances and were able to draw upon their own experiences to portray Gruwell's students with gritty authenticity. The DVD includes feature-length commentary with director/writer Richard LaGravenese and Hilary Swank, deleted scenes, the featurettes \"Making 'A Dream'\", \"Freedom Writers Family\", \"Freedom Writers: The Story Behind The Story\" and a photo gallery. \b \u001d  Paramount Home Entertainment (PHE) is part of Paramount Pictures Corporation, a unit of Viacom (NYSE:VIA) (NYSE:VIA.B), a global entertainment company that produces and distributes filmed entertainment through the Paramount Motion Picture Group. PHE is responsible for the worldwide sales, marketing and distribution of home entertainment products on behalf of various parties including: Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks SKG, Paramount Vantage, Paramount Classics, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, CBS, PBS and Hasbro and for providing home entertainment fulfillment services for DreamWorks Animation Home Entertainment. \b \b   About The Freedom Writers Foundation \b \u001d  Erin and the Freedom Writers established the Freedom Writers Foundation in 1997. Since then, she has shared her teaching methods with educators in an effort to replicate the Freedom Writers' success in classrooms across the country. The Foundation has encouraged, inspired, and motivated thousands of teachers and students with the same methods Erin used with the Freedom Writers in Room 203. \b \u001d  The Foundation trains teachers and provides scholarships for deserving students with a key metric as a clear indicator of success - the reduction of high school drop-out rates. This epidemic is recognized by government leaders, major foundations, and educational institutions. Using the Freedom Writers Method, the Foundation is actively addressing the situation with proven results in cities across the country. Erin's students graduated from high school and more students at schools throughout the country are graduating in higher numbers due to the innovative teaching methods taught at the Freedom Writers Institute. www.freedomwritersfoundation.org \b \b    CONTACT: Paramount Pictures \b             Brenda Ciccone, 323-956-8091 \b             Brenda_Ciccone@paramount.com \b \b    SOURCE: Paramount Pictures \bCopyright Business Wire 2007 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 08:55 ET (12:55 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"37679185ae33435f30bf07753320925c","symR":["KR","US5010441013"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Kroger Chmn: Mgmt, Bd Have No Interest In Leveraged Buyout","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T21:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KR","US5010441013"],"IndustryCodes":["FDR","RTS","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Kroger Co.

(OTCBB:PBME) (\"PBI\") has been awarded a contract to provide specialty laboratory testing services for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA). These testing services are in support of a major long-term clinical study that is being conducted by the NIA, known as the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The BLSA is a multidisciplinary observational study of the physiological and psychological aspects of human aging and diseases and conditions that increase with age. Information from the BLSA is expected to define strategies to improve quality of life in old age and prevent and delay loss of independence. \b \u001d  PBI will provide the NIA with a series of tests for hormones and inflammatory and bone markers relevant to the BLSA study. The study has already been in progress for several decades and is expected to continue for a further 30 years before completion. Under the contract, PBI will perform testing on batches of archived samples immediately, followed by continued testing on an annual basis, potentially for up to 30 years, pending continued federal funding and approval. \b \u001d  Ron Helm, Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Biometrics, commented, \"We are delighted to have the opportunity to work with the NIH and the NIA on this landmark study of human aging, which is expected to make a major contribution to our understanding of the aging process. The BLSA is a major federally funded study that is bringing a rigorous scientific approach to the study of aging, and many believe it will have an impact similar to the Framingham Heart Study and the Women's Health Initiative. At PBI, we focus on therapeutic areas related to chronic diseases of aging, such as dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, osteoporosis and arthritis, and therefore we are ideally positioned to support studies such as the BLSA.\" \b \u001d  Helm continued, \"As this contract indicates, our expertise across multiple categories of biomarkers offers Pacific Biometrics a competitive advantage that we believe will enable us to pursue a growing number of opportunities going forward.

The provision, a cornerstone of U.S. bankruptcy law, blocks creditors from immediately seizing property for payment of a debt. \u001d  In 2005, Congress amended the bankruptcy law to add mortgage loans and \"interests in mortgage loans\" to the definition of financial instruments that could be included in repurchase agreements. The expanded definition, in many cases, put subprime mortgage lending outside the purview of bankruptcy law. \u001d  The definition changes were driven by powerful Wall Street and government forces -- the Bond Market Association, and the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, said Richard Levin, a partner in Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom's restructuring department. The Working Group includes the U.S. Treasury Secretary, the Federal Reserve chairman and the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u001d  \"The Bond Market Association probably had the largest role in lobbying for the changes,\" Levin said. \"Secured creditors, not surprisingly, don't like their loans subject to bankruptcy and over time they've learned ways to exempt themselves. They use bankruptcy-remote vehicles and they also get Congress to make amendments.\" \u001d          Repos Get Special Exemption Under Bankruptcy Law \u001d  Subprime lenders like New Century depend on credit lines from investment banks. The credit lines are backed by mortgage loans and are characterized as repurchase agreements, or repos. The repos are afforded a special exemption under bankruptcy law and provide the banks a \"safe harbor\" from the automatic stay. \u001d  Levin and other bankruptcy professionals maintain the exemptions have done what they were intended to do: encourage lending to home buyers with shaky credit by giving creditors more protection. \u001d  But with the change to the bankruptcy laws, New Century's warehouse lenders -- Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Citigroup Inc. (C), Credit Suisse Group (CS), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) -- were free to seize their collateral and, in some cases, sell it. \u001d  The result: New Century and other subprime lenders - ResMae Mortgage Corp., People's Choice Financial Corp., Mortgage Lenders Network USA Inc. - that have filed for bankruptcy in recent months are little more than shells by the time they reach Chapter 11. \u001d  New Century, the country's second-largest subprime lender, collapsed into bankruptcy proceedings April 2, saying it had more than $7 billion in \"principal indebtedness\" in the form of repos. \u001d  The company is selling its servicing business, which handles loan payments and processing, to Carrington Capital Management LLC, Greenwich, Conn., for $139 million, and a small number of loans and residual interest in some trusts to Greenwich Capital for $50 million, subject to bankruptcy court approval. \u001d   Hedge fund Citadel Investment Group LLC  picked up ResMae's assets for about $24 million after Credit Suisse balked at buying $160 million in new mortgage loans generated by ResMae after its bankruptcy filing. But in both cases, the billions of dollars in loans securing the credit lines were already gone. \u001d                    \"There Is No Debtors' Lobby\" \u001d  \"What this really means is that in this area of the law there is no balance between the rights of secured creditors and the ability of a mortgage lender to reorganize, because the secured creditors get to stand up the minute a bankruptcy filing is made and take their marbles and go home,\" said Levin. \"There is no debtors' lobby.\" \u001d  New Century, of course, also hasn't disclosed all of its assets. For example, it hasn't yet specified the assets of its operating subsidiary, New Century TRS Holdings Inc. That unit holds the servicing operations and loans and trusts that are going on the auction block next month. The unit on Thursday asked  a judge for more time to file a detailed accounting of its assets and liabilities. \u001d  With bankruptcy looming, New Century said last month that all of its warehouse lenders were pulling their funding. Under the repo agreements with its lenders, New Century was on the hook for $8.4 billion, an amount the company couldn't pay. \u001d  Officials at New Century declined to comment. But in an affidavit filed in the company's Chapter 11 case, New Century's assistant general counsel, Monika McCarthy, said some warehouse lenders had already seized their loans and were selling them on the secondary market. \u001d  Last week, just days before New Century filed for bankruptcy, Morgan Stanley announced it was selling about $2.5 billion in mortgages that it seized from the company.

(C) to help fund the U.S. financial giant's bid to buy Nikko Cordial Corp. (8603.TO). \u001d  In what would amount to the biggest syndicated loan in Japan ever, Mizuho, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and Citigroup's Citibank N.A. \"are preparing to provide\" a Y1.4 trillion line of credit, with an option for an additional Y300 billion, a source close to the matter said Friday. \u001d  Such a loan would shatter the previous record of Y1.28 trillion that Softbank Corp. procured last year to buy the Japan operations of U.K. mobile phone operator Vodafone Group PLC. \u001d  Citigroup said Friday it planned to procure a yen-denominated loan to help fund its bid for Nikko, though it didn't provide the names of the lenders or elaborate on details such as the amount or the timeframe. \u001d  The news suggests Citigroup is determined to successfully complete its tender offer to buy Nikko Cordial despite criticism from some Nikko shareholders about Citigroup's offering price. In addition to the benefit of low Japanese interest rates, the yen-denominated loans may help Citigroup reduce its exposure to currency fluctuation risks. \u001d  The U.S. bank is aiming to buy at least a majority of Nikko Cordial in a Y1,700 per-share tender offer that runs through April 26. \u001d  Citigroup considers an acquisition of the Japanese brokerage an important way to expand its business in the world's second biggest economy. Charles Prince, the bank's chief executive, has said he wants to raise the percentage of Citigroup's overseas revenue to 60% from the current level of 44%. Acquiring Nikko Cordial would help it achieve that goal because Japan's stock market is the world's second largest after the U.S. and its government bond market is the world's biggest. \u001d  If completed, the transaction would be the largest purchase of a Japanese company by a foreign acquirer, according Dealogic Ltd., a data tracker. \u001d  Shinichi Ina, banking analyst at Credit Suisse Securities, said that financing from major Japanese banks would enable Citigroup to build a relationship with them, something that could be worth more than money. \u001d  \"(Syndicated loans from Japanese banks) would help Citigroup operate its business more easily here in Japan,\" Ina said. \u001d  Spokesmen at Mizuho Corporate Bank, Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ  and Sumitomo Mitsui declined to comment. \u001d  Citigroup said in a statement that \"this yen loan facility, which is for general corporate purpose, is part of Citigroup's global borrowings program and it will help us better match the currency requirements of the recently announced Nikko Cordial transaction.\" \u001d  News of the potential loan comes on the same day that another major Nikko Cordial shareholder expressed dissatisfaction with Citigroup's current offering price. Southeastern Asset Management Inc. said earlier Friday it placed an order to sell a 6.6% stake in the brokerage at Y1,900 per share. \u001d  \"Southeastern has decided that it will accept Y1,900 per share... (and) has placed a limit order to sell 64,424,500 shares,\" a spokesman for the U.S. fund said. \u001d  A number of investors have been critical of the pricing of Citigroup's bid, which has already been revised higher from its initial Y1,350 per share offer after a surprise decision by the Tokyo Stock Exchange not to delist the brokerage for its accounting problems. \u001d  Bermuda-based investment fund Orbis Investment Management Ltd., which has also voiced dissatisfaction with Citigroup's asking price, placed a limit-sell order at Y1,900 for some 70 million Nikko Cordial shares earlier this week. \u001d  Some market players believe that if there are more sell orders above Citigroup's offer price, the U.S. bank may be forced into upping its offer once again. \u001d  Shares of Nikko ended up 0.9% at Y1,715 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after rising as high as Y1,720. \b \u001d  -By Hiroyuki Kachi and Jamie Miyazaki, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; hiroyuki.kachi@dowjones.com, jamie.miyazaki@dowjones.com \u001d  (Atsuko Fukase contributed to this story.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 02:08 ET (06:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3f56e0d05b332cc3d0ab81b31847485a","symR":["CBM"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Cambrex Announces Declaration of Special Cash Dividend, Closing on New Credit Facility, and Discontinuance of Regular Dividend","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBM"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., April 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Cambrex Corporation (\"Cambrex\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: CBM) announced today that its Board of Directors approved a one-time payment of $14.00 per share to shareholders through a special cash dividend.

Given our strong market position, experienced management team, sharp strategic focus, current momentum and positive market conditions, we are excited about our shareholders' ability to also participate in the Company's future performance and growth.\" \b \u001d  The special dividend is payable on May 3, 2007 to shareholders of record as of April 20, 2007. The dividend is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions to the drawdown of funds under the new credit facility on the dividend payment date.  Because of the magnitude of the special dividend, the New York Stock Exchange has determined that the ex-dividend date will be May 4, 2007, the business day following the payment date.  Shareholders of record on the April 20, 2007 record date who subsequently sell their shares of common stock prior to or on the payment date of May 3, 2007 will also be selling their right to receive the special cash dividend. Accordingly, shareholders are advised to contact their financial advisors before selling their shares. \b \u001d  For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution will be a dividend to the extent it is paid out of the Company's current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles.  Based on these rules, the Company currently estimates that 55%-65% of the payment will be treated as a dividend for tax purposes, with the balance being a return of capital. This estimate is preliminary and subject to change based upon a comprehensive review and analysis of the Company's history as well as actual results for the entire 2007 taxable year.  Shareholders will receive a Form 1099-DIV in early 2008 notifying them of the portion of the special cash dividend that is treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shareholders are encouraged to consult with their own tax and financial advisors regarding the implications of this special distribution. \b \u001d  The Company also announced that, effective immediately, the Board of Directors is discontinuing its quarterly dividend payment and will instead allocate these cash outlays to support its growth initiatives. \b \b    Forward Looking Statements \b \u001d  This news release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Rule 3b-6 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including, without limitation, statements regarding expected performance, especially expectations with respect to sales, research and development expenditures, earnings per share, capital expenditures, acquisitions, divestitures, collaborations, or other expansion opportunities.

With long-distance freight hauling increasing steadily in the U.S. - and diesel consumption in Europe and Asia growing even faster - fuel producers are looking to diesel for profit growth as the race to supply the U.S. gasoline market gets more competitive. \u001d  \"There's a hydrocracker trend,\" said Horace Hobbs, a Houston-based industry consultant with Muse Stancil, referring to processing units vital to the production of very-low sulfur diesel fuel mandated for use since late 2006. \"If you have high diesel prices, that'll drive you to hydrocrackers.\" \u001d  Energy companies are gauging changes in fuel markets and making plans for billions of dollars of refinery modifications. Having already invested billions into upgrades that were mandated by clean-air regulations, refiners - still flush with cash from high profits - face tough decisions on how to alter their production facilities. \u001d  Refiners can't build their way to greater profits just by enlarging plants to process more crude oil. \u001d  \"People think there's a global refining capacity shortage, but there isn't,\" said Mike Wilcox, head of downstream oil consulting for Edinburgh, Scotland-based Wood Mackenzie. \"There's regional tightness, but that's not the same thing.\" \u001d  U.S. refiners are under pressure from equity markets to boost near-term profits with every plant modification while contending with rising cost inflation, lengthening project timelines and the ultimate moving target - supply and demand. \b \b        Capitalizing On Diesel Demand Growth \b \u001d  Outright gasoline demand in the U.S. is triple that of diesel but the rate at which diesel demand is growing is double that of gasoline. Good economic times have meant that heavy-duty trucks are logging more and more miles to keep up with the rising demand for goods. \u001d  The profits refiners can realize from processing a barrel of crude oil into transportation and heating fuels already reflect that greater diesel demand, according to the largest independent refiner in North America. \u001d  In a presentation to analysts this week, Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) President Greg King touted the strong outlook for diesel, saying that, so far in 2007, the profit margin in processing the fuel on the Gulf Coast is $15 to $22 a barrel, 23% higher than a year ago and more than double the five-year average for the first quarter. \u001d  Burgeoning diesel demand growth is the guiding principle behind the expansion and upgrade of Marathon Oil Corp.'s (MRO) refinery in Garyville, La., company president Gary Heminger said. \u001d  Output at the 31-year-old plant, the last new refinery built in the U.S., will be evenly split between diesel and gasoline after plant capacity almost doubles to 425,000 barrels a day by the end of 2009. The standard configuration for complex refineries calls for gasoline and gasoline components to account for two-thirds of output, with diesel and other fuels making up the balance. \u001d  Major expansions and upgrades for two other Gulf Coast refineries also feature increased diesel production capacity. Motiva Enterprises LLC's project for its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, includes a hydrocracker as does the plan for Valero's St. Charles refinery in Norco, La. \u001d  The Motiva plan, partially underway but pending final approval, would more than double the Port Arthur refinery's capacity to 610,000 barrels a day. Valero is seeking permits to expand its St. Charles plant to 380,000 barrels a day, which would make the refinery the largest in the company's 17-plant system. \u001d  The pairing of increased diesel production with the transformation of the two plants into mega-refineries is no coincidence. \u001d  \"We believe the global demand for diesel is going to grow more rapidly than gasoline and this expansion would capitalize on that trend,\" Rich Marcogliese, Valero's head of refining operations, told analysts in a conference call in late 2006. \b \b        Sticking Close To Home \b \u001d  Outside the U.S., diesel use has grown even more - by 5.5% on year in Western Europe and by 9.6% in Korea as of January, according to the International Energy Agency. \u001d  But foreign competitors to U.S. refiners are better placed to meet that galloping demand growth. New refineries, some massive, springing up in Asia and the Middle East, are closer to the fastest-growing markets - and biggest oilfields - than any in the U.S. \u001d  And the diesel produced in the U.S. takes longer to ignite, rendering it useless for European diesel engines and, thus, incompatible with the export market closest to the U.S. \u001d  \"I don't see the U.S. as an exporter of diesel,\" said Muse Stancil's Hobbs. Economies of scale and proximity to growth markets favor gigantic refineries planned for Saudi Arabia, South Korea and India.It's likely that these plants will be able to undercut U.S. refiners on prices in the global market. \u001d  Basing refining close to the crude supply and diesel demand \"is more efficient than first hauling the crude to where the refinery is and then moving the product to where the demand is,\" Hobbs said. \b \u001d  -By Beth Heinsohn, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4435; beth.heinsohn@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 08:47 ET (12:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"40650bc244df8331b21318df9dbe5be6","symR":["SCI"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Service Corporation International Announces Early Participation Results and Pricing of Cash Tender Offers","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T12:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SCI"],"IndustryCodes":["CSV","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  HOUSTON, April 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Service Corporation International (NYSE: SCI), a provider of deathcare products and services, announced today that the early participation period for its cash tender offers to purchase any and all of its 6.50% Notes due 2008 and 7.70% Notes due 2009 ended yesterday at 5:00 p.m., New York City time.

Wesling is helping them with budgets, cash flow and estate plans and estimates it will take several months to get their finances in order and get them comfortable handling matters on their own. \u001d  \"I do believe the kind of work that needs to be done with these particular clients is a little less number crunching and much more helping them through the transition,\" says Wesling, a fee-only planner who's been an advisor for the past 12 years following a two-decade career in the military. \u001d  FinancialPoint pays the hourly fee it negotiated with Wesling, which he says is lower than his usual fee. \b \b   Need, But Not Demand \b \u001d  Many financial advisors are keen to help the military in this time of war, but service members and their families don't seem to be clamoring for advice. \u001d  Just 54 beneficiaries received face-to-face counseling through FinancialPoint in 2006, according to Charles Strang, director of Prudential Financial Inc.'s (PRU) Office of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, which administers the insurance programs offered by the Veterans Affairs Department. Prudential contracted with FinancialPoint to provide financial advice to beneficiaries. \u001d  FinancialPoint counselors can answer questions by phone and develop financial plans from questionnaires beneficiaries complete and return. They can also refer individuals to the external certified financial planners they've vetted. \u001d  Prudential is working with the Veterans Affairs Department to develop a survey for eligible beneficiaries to determine why they have or haven't taken advantage of the free financial assistance available to them. \u001d  The supply of financial advisors interested in doing pro bono work for service members also seems to outnumber the available opportunities. \u001d  \"There's need out there, but there's not necessarily demand,\" says Jonathan Sprague, director of pro bono services at the Financial Planning Association, which represents about 28,500 advisors and other financial professionals. \"The people who need it don't necessarily understand what we can do.\" \u001d  A 2005 report from the NASD Investor Education Foundation illustrated the need for financial education among service members. \u001d  Almost a quarter of the nearly 1,600 active military personnel and spouses who participated in an online survey said they occasionally or usually have difficulty paying bills. And nearly a third said they'd had a negative investment experience that could have been avoided with greater knowledge. \u001d  The Defense Department launched a campaign in 2003 to educate service members and their families about personal finance in an effort to help them manage their money and protect themselves from predatory practices. The department partnered with federal agencies and nonprofit organizations to support employees at military installations who are responsible for providing education and counseling. \u001d  The FPA is working to become one of those official partners. In the meantime, Sprague is encouraging regional association chapters to form alliances with organizations that already work with the military. \b \b   FPA Pro Bono \b \u001d  The FPA has a memorandum of understanding with Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Volunteers from the association's Washington chapter have presented educational sessions to injured service members and their families and have provided advice in one-on-one sessions following the presentations. \u001d  The presentations address the steps in the financial planning process, including the need to determine goals and devise a plan. \u001d  The FPA's San Diego chapter recently partnered with a nonprofit group called Operation Homefront, which offers emergency and educational services and morale-boosting programs to military families. \u001d  The San Diego chapter volunteers will hold their first one-on-one advising session for military families April 17. They'll also provide group education seminars if there's interest, says Jon Beyrer, public relations director for the chapter and a certified financial planner at Blankinship & Foster LLC. \u001d  Participating advisors must attend two 1.5-hour training sessions to learn about the benefits, compensation and programs for military personnel, Beyrer says. The advisors also receive reference manuals. \u001d  The FPA has pro bono guidelines for advisors, which essentially require them to be certified financial planners or work under the supervision of a CFP, prohibit them from marketing their services or selling products to pro bono clients, and oblige them to provide the same level of service they'd provide a paying customer. \u001d  ComPsych also provides legal, financial, psychological and other services to 10,000 companies and government agencies around the world. Part of that work includes advising military reservists employed bythose organizations. \u001d  Budgeting is a big issue for reservists who are called to active duty, in part because their employers aren't required to make up the difference if their active duty pay is lower than their salaries. And business owners who are called up must worry about keeping the business going. \u001d  The NASD Investor Education Foundation has a number of resources for the military, including educational forums at military installations and an interactive Web site with information on saving and investing and service members' rights and responsibilities. \u001d  Its military education program was initially funded with the bulk of fines levied against a Texas financial services firm called First Command Financial Planning Inc. NASD and the Securities and Exchange Commission fined the company $12 million in 2004 for misleading practices related to the sale of investment plans to military personnel. \b \u001d  (Kristen McNamara writes about business issues facing financial advisors.) \b \u001d  -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5392; kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 07:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4665ac572af5f4cabdaf1225db34de1c","symR":["VG","VZ","US92343V1044"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"3rd UPDATE: Judge Tells Vonage It Can't Seek New Customers","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T19:53:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VG","VZ","US92343V1044"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","ISV","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Adds comment from Verizon in the last two paragraphs.) \b \b   By Roger Cheng and Corey Boles \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--A U.S. federal judge ruled that Vonage Holdings Corp. (VG) will not be able to seek new customers, calling into question its ability to survive in the long run. \u001d  It's a damaging result for Vonage. U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton imposed an immediate stay against Vonage, effectively preventing it from signing up new customers to its Internet-based telephone service. The company, however, will be able to provide service to its existing base of 2.2 million customers. \u001d  Hilton said he had weighed a number of factors in reaching his decision. These, he said, included whether a stay could in fact lead to Vonage's bankruptcy. He also said he had to evaluate how the public's interest would be affected and concluded that given the competitiveness of the telecommunications industry, there would be no impact either way. \u001d  According to Rebecca Arboghast, a telecommunications analyst with Stifel Nicolaus who was at the hearing, if the ruling is upheld, it will be difficult for Vonage to \"continue in a viable way.\" \u001d  Vonage's request for a stay of the injunction represented a near-last resort for the company, since a negative ruling would effectively shut down its Internet telephone business. The company is working on a way of developing a system that doesn't use Verizon patents, but it's unclear how much progress it has made in that avenue. \u001d  The Holmdel, N.J., Web phone service provider will appeal the original ruling that it had infringed on Verizon's patents, but the process could take more than a year. The quicker alternatives - a settlement or technology workaround - will take time and focus away from its core operation. \u001d  Still, the ruling is slightly better than the worst-case scenario of Vonage being forced to shut down its entire service. \"It seems like a relatively fair compromise under the law,\" said Mark Kesslen, a partner at law firm Lowenstein Sandler PC that focuses on intellectual property. \"But it hurts Vonage tremendously in a period where it's all about new client acquisition.\" \u001d  Verizon filed a brief Thursday pushing for the judge to deny Vonage's request. \"A stay of injunction would violate the fundamental purpose of a stay pending appeal: preservation of the status quo.\" \u001d  Hilton concluded Friday's proceedings by saying he would enter the injunction order this coming Thursday, which in effect means that the injunction would begin at that date. \u001d  Vonage was dealt a serious blow March 23 when Hilton said he would issue a permanent injunction against Vonage. Shares plunged 26% that day. The only saving grace at the time was the judge's decision to wait two weeks before entering the injunction, allowing for more time to decide on the stay request. \u001d  The decision came after a jury found Vonage had infringed on three patents controlled by Verizon. The patents relate to connecting Internet phone calls with the traditional phone network, call forwarding and the use of wireless fidelity, or wi-fi, technology. Verizon claimed it lost hundreds of thousands of customers to Vonage while it used Verizon's patents. \u001d  Under the original jury ruling, Vonage would have to pay $58 million in damages and pay a 5.5% royalty rate for the technology. Verizon had sought $197 million. \u001d  \"Verizon built a patent portfolio and is using it in an aggressive way to maintain and control its market share,\" Kesslen said. \b \b   A Bad Start \b \u001d  Vonage stumbled out of the gates with its initial public offering in May and has been hit with a myriad of problems. The company made a name for itself as the largest independent provider of Internet phone service, positioning itself as a low-cost alternative to the traditional phone companies. It, however, faces increasing competition from the cable providers, who have bundled their television service with a similar Web-based phone offering. The concern was partially the reason Vonage had to delay its IPO. \u001d  When Vonage did go public, it botched its IPO after offering shares to its customers, many of whom balked at paying for the stock they agreed to purchase. The company has been plagued by shareholder lawsuits and is still seeking compensation from its customers over the issue. \u001d  Those shareholders who stuck around saw nothing but grief from Vonage. After pricing at $17, the stock has continually hit all-time lows amid a barrage of negative news. Shares closed at $3.37 on Thursday. \u001d  In its most recently reported quarter, Vonage posted the weakest subscriber growth figure in two years. The company has eaten into some of the phone companies' subscriber base, but its impact is still minor. In 2006, Verizon lost 3.1 million residential phone customers, ending the year with a base of 27.8 million subscribers. \u001d  As a result of the anticipation over the decision, Vonage delayed filing its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission due to the uncertainty of the outcome at the time. \u001d  A spokesman for Vonage wasn't immediately available for comment. \u001d  In a statement, Verizon said it expects Hilton's ruling to be upheld on appeal. \u001d  \"Judge Hilton exercised the court's equitable discretion to craft a middle path that allows Vonage to continue serving its existing customers while protecting Verizon's patents from increased infringement during the appeal process,\" said John Thorne, deputy general counsel at Verizon. \u001d  -By Roger Cheng, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2020; roger.cheng@dowjones.com \u001d  -By Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6637; corey.boles@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:53 ET (19:53 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"470af51f24c85ae916f99f1fc706a436","symR":["CFDAY","MKTSQ"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Advanced Marketing Seeks Until Aug 10 To File Ch 11 Plan","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T17:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CFDAY","MKTSQ"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS"],"Story":"\b \b   By Peg Brickley \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  WILMINGTON, Del. (Dow Jones)--Bankrupt book seller Advanced Marketing Services Inc. (MKTSQ) is asking a court to push off until August 10 the deadline by which it must file a Chapter 11 plan. \u001d  The company's time runs out April 28 if it doesn't win an extension of the so-called exclusive Chapter 11 plan filing period. \u001d  The California company filed for bankruptcy in Delaware Dec. 29, 2006, holding out hope it could reorganize and emerge from Chapter 11 as a standalone company. \u001d  Secured creditor Wells Fargo Foothill Inc., however, refused to fund a long-running bankruptcy, and worried publishers quit supplying the business. \u001d  By March, Advanced Marketing had sold its wholesale operation, which shuttled books to membership warehouse clubs such as BJ's Wholesale Club Inc, and its distribution business, Publishers Group West, which helped small independent publishers get their books to retail shelves. \u001d  Perseus Books LLC bought the Publishers Group West business, on terms that allowed it to pay off some of what the Advanced Marketing affiliate owed to independent publishers. \u001d  Baker & Taylor LLC has agreed to buy the wholesaling operations in a deal valued at more than $60 million. \u001d  In court papers filed Thursday, lawyers for Advanced Marketing say there's still work to be done before a Chapter 11 plan that sets out how cash raised in the sale of the businesses will be distributed. \u001d  Remaining operations are being wound down, and publishers are reclaiming unsold books. Both processes will affect the amount of debt that Advanced Marketing will have to tackle in its Chapter 11 plan, court documents say. \u001d  Bankruptcy law gives companies a limited amount of time to propose a Chapter 11 plan to pay creditors without competition from rival plans. \u001d  -By Peg Brickley, Dow Jones Newswires; 302-521-2266; peg.brickley@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 13:27 ET (17:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4756c125b3231b0ecf49f4d469dfe273","symR":["NTBK"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"NetBank: No Current Plans To Replace Kelton On Bd >NTBK","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NTBK"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","SAL","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 16:41 ET (20:41 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"47745f853cc77b14b82b675f7a0bf0ce","symR":["CSE"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Pres GRAHAM Surrenders 41,560 Of CAPITALSOURCE INC >CSE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T14:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CSE"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: CAPITALSOURCE INC \bSYMBOL: CSE \b \bFILER: GRAHAM DEAN C \bTITLE: President \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/4/07             Surrender*               41,560      $24.99      $1,038,584 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 408,783 (Direct) \b \b  * - Insiders can surrender shares back to the company to pay taxes or cover \b      the cost of an option exercise. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

Shares banked and spun, closing down 15% going into the holiday weekend. \u001d  Rackable, whose equipment powers the giant server farms needed to run online properties like Amazon.com (AMZN) and Yahoo (YHOO), said increased competition from Dell (DELL) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) cut into its gross margins, slashing projections 30%. The company said it still expects quarterly revenue between $70 million and $75 million, but backed off earlier guidance on its margins, crushing Wall Street consensus projections of first-quarter earnings of a nickel a share. \u001d  The company didn't provide specific earnings guidance, but said it now expected gross margins of 12.5% to 14%, down from previous guidance of 18% to 20%. By that measure, Canaccord Adams' Mark Kelleher estimated a loss of four cents a share for the quarter; Troy Jensen of Piper Jaffray dropped his quarterly estimate to a loss of three cents. Rackable, which is scheduled to release earnings on April 26, earned 23 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. \u001d  \"Intense competitive conditions for business at our largest customers continued throughout the first quarter of 2007, which negatively impacted our gross margin and bottom line,\" Chief Executive Tom Barton told analysts and investors on a Thursday morning conference call. \u001d  The bad news is a continuation of Rackable's woes from the fourth quarter of 2006, when Dell, storming in with much lower prices, effectively snatched away the smaller company's competitive advantage, prompting a massive year-to-year drop in earnings. \u001d  Rackable reported earnings of four cents a share in the last three months of 2006, down from 33 cents a share in the same period in 2005. Shares plummeted nearly 40% in a single session after it issued preliminary guidance on Jan. 16. \u001d  CEO Barton said the company also took a charge from the cancellation of one customer, but said \"we believe that our position and our value proposition with our customers remains very strong.\" \u001d  The company plans to expand its customer base and enter into longer-term partnership arrangements with its largest customers. \"We are very focused on stabilizing gross margins on these accounts,\" he said. \b \bThe Analysis \u001d  Rackable had a great run as an upstart, slipping into the server market a couple of years ago with superior processors from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and stealing a march on H-P and Dell, which were using less efficient Intel (INTC) processors. About six months ago, management at Dell, Rackable's largest rival, fought back. \u001d  The results were clear last quarter, and the impact hasn't abated, says Canaccord's Kelleher. \u001d  \"It was very clear that Dell was going to continue to press them on price,\" he said. In a note published Thursday, he observed that gross margins had sunk to the lowest level in the company's history, and wrote that \"we believe management has been extremely clear as to its dire competitive position.\" \u001d  Piper Jaffray's Jensen said Rackable's order backlog for the first half of the year looks solid and is an encouraging sign, but added intense pricing competition means margins will keep ebbing throughout 2007. \u001d  It's a tough spot, according to Kelleher. While Rackable contends that Dell is selling its equipment at a loss to take away market share, its remedy of diversifying its customer base may not afford real relief. Rackable's top three customers are responsible for about 60% of its revenue, CEO Barton said. \u001d  \"They talk about Dell coming after them in their key accounts, so they say they have a lot of hope they can get other key accounts,\" Kelleher says. \"But I don't think Dell is going to be happy with just those accounts -- I think they'll go after all their accounts. And HP is also there. They're in a very competitive market without a lot of proprietary differentiation.\" In his note, Kelleher reiterated his Sell rating on the stock and added, \"we continue to believe that Rackable's business model is flawed.\" \u001d  In pool, a player without a clear shot can look for an unseen angle, hope superior skill and fortuitous spin gets the ball to a pocket, or work at blocking his opponent with a tough leave. All these strategies may exceed Rackable's capacities as a small player up against giants. \u001d  Competitive pressures are compounded by inventory problems Rackable incurred in the December quarter, when it stocked up on dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, components just before a major price collapse. Since DRAM accounts for 20% to 30% of the cost of a Rackable server, the company hasn't helped its cause, says Kelleher. It will either have to sell through its pricey purchase, which will take very effective negotiations with its existing customers, who are already being wooed with lower prices by Dell, or take an inventory charge. \u001d  \"Most of what could go wrong went wrong last quarter,\" he says, but that doesn't mean the problems have gone away. \b \bThe Bottom Line \u001d  Sometimes Goliath wins, even if there's sympathy for a plucky underdog. Dell is bigger, broader and richer than Rackable, and it's not going away. Rackable has a market cap of about $409 million. Dell's is $52 billion, and Hewlett-Packard's $111 billion, leaving them plenty of room to outspend the upstart rival. \u001d  \"Let's say I'm pessimistic on future prospects,\" Kelleher says. \"I don't see how they get out of it. I don't think it's a management issue -- they played the cards they were dealt as best they could, and they've been very forthright. If you ask what should they have done differently, I don't know.\" \u001d  The rapid drop in gross margin estimates pushed Jensen to drop his 2007 earnings estimate to 43 cents a share from a previous 90 cents. His 2008 projection dropped to 85 cents a share from $1.17. \u001d  While plans to expand its data-storage business sound plausible, Kelleher says there's about 1,600 pounds' worth of gorilla in that market as well, since Network Appliance (NTAP) and EMC (EMC) already have dominant positions. \u001d  If the company can take the market's punishment for a couple of quarters and plow proceeds into research and development, it may yet find a way to outmaneuver its deep-pocketed competition, but it'll be a tough task. \u001d  \"Gross margins are going to be about 13% this quarter,\" Kelleher says. \"At that level, you don't have enough money to invest in R&D to develop a proprietary defense against Dell.\" \u001d  Investors still hanging on to the stock should probably rack up their shares and find a better tech game. \u001d  -For more information and analysis of companies and mutual funds, visit SmartMoney.com at http://www.smartmoney.com/ \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"48b3cf23c8d5578b4d263c2ebbfdd5aa","symR":["SLB","SLB"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Schlumberger Responds to \"Mini-Tender\" Offer by TRC Corporation","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T16:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLB"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bHOUSTON, April 6 /CNW/ - Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) announced today that it has been notified of an unsolicited \"mini- tender\" offer by TRC Capital Corporation to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of Schlumberger common stock, representing approximately 0.13 percent of Schlumberger outstanding shares.

On March 22, 2007, the Company appeared at a hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the \"Panel\") to present its plan for regaining compliance with the Nasdaq filing requirement. The Panel has not yet rendered its decision in connection with that hearing. \b \u001d  Nasdaq has offered the Company an opportunity to make a submission in response to the Additional Staff Determination and the Company intends to make such a submission to the Panel by the Nasdaq deadline of April 9, 2007.

However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for continued listing. \b \u001d  As previously announced on February 1, 2007, Sonic has commenced a voluntary review of its historical and current stock option grant practices and related accounting. Based on the review, the audit committee and Sonic management have preliminarily concluded that, under applicable accounting guidance, Sonic lacks sufficient documentation for certain historical option grants and that the measurement dates associated with these option grants will need to be adjusted. Further, as previously announced, the audit committee, after consultation with management and the Company's board of directors, has determined that the Company's annual and interim financial statements may no longer be relied upon. \b \u001d  Sonic believes it will have to record additional non-cash charges for stock-based compensation expense and restate previous financial statements, and that such charges will be material. Sonic is not yet able to determine the amount of such charges or the resulting tax and accounting impact of these actions. Sonic intends to file its restated financial results and related periodic reports as quickly as possible. \b \b   About Sonic Solutions \b \u001d  Sonic Solutions (Nasdaq: SNIC - News; http://www.sonic.com) is the leader in digital media software, providing a broad range of interoperable, platform-independent software tools and applications for creative professionals, business and home users, and technology partners.

Late on Sunday, Pirelli & C. SpA (PC.MI) announced that it had started one month of exclusive talks to sell a combined 66% of its stake in Olimpia SpA, which controls Telecom Italia, to AT&T Inc. (T) and America Movil SA de CV of Mexico (AMOV). \u001d  The move, which would make foreign companies the two single largest shareholders of Telecom Italia, alarmed the Italian government, which promptly urged Italian investors to come up with an alternate solution. \u001d  People familiar with the matter said earlier this week that France Telecom SA (FTE) and Telefonica SA (TEF) are considering individual counteroffers to the AT&T (T) and America Movil suggested bids. The two European telecoms firms are also considering teaming up with Italian financial institutions to prepare a more politically palatable offer for the Olimpia stake. \u001d  Meanwhile, Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISNPY) said it is ready to team up with other financial institutions to end the battle for control of Telecom Italia and keep the company in Italian hands, without ruling out a partnership with AT&T and America Movil. \u001d  Olimpia, the holding company set up by Pirelli and Italy's Benetton family to control Telecom Italia, withdrew its support of Rossi by leaving his name off of a list of proposed board nominees released this week. \u001d  That means Rossi effectively would have been ousted at the shareholders meeting had other shareholders not actively backed him. Two of Telecom Italia's largest shareholders, Mediobanca SpA (MB.MI) and Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G.MI) suggested earlier this week that they might have done so, but they never did. Pistorio is Olimpia's proposed replacement, people familiar with the matter say. \b \u001d  -By Jennifer Clark, Dow Jones Newswires; 39 335 833 5761; jennifer.clark@Dowjones.com; and Jonathan Vuocolo; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5964; Jonathan.Vuocolo@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:25 ET (16:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4a920837248ae43c6b6973bf906ce402","symR":["C","GS","LEH","MS","TPG.XX","TXU","US1729671016","US38141G1040","US5249081002","US8731681081"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Politics, High Price Likely Deterred Rival TXU Corp Bidders","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T13:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["C","GS","LEH","MS","TPG.XX","TXU","US1729671016","US38141G1040","US5249081002","US8731681081"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","ELC","FIS","SCR","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \b   By Christine Buurma \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The lack of rival bids put forth for energy company TXU Corp. (TXU) by private equity firms and other prospective acquirers was likely due to the company's high price tag and perceived opposition from Texas lawmakers and regulators, experts say. \u001d  The Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group were said to have approached power companies last month in search of partners to offer a bid for TXU that would rival the $32 billion offer a consortium of private equity firms presented in February. But the firms have since scrapped plans to submit a rival bid, said a person close to the matter. \u001d  TXU announced in late February it had agreed to be acquired for nearly $32 billion, plus the assumption of more than $12 billion in debt, by a group led by private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and TGP. The other buyers are Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup Inc. (C) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH). Under the terms of its agreement with the firms, TXU was free to solicit and consider rival bids through April 16. However, no rival bids are expected. \u001d  New York-based Blackstone and Washington-based Carlyle were among nine firms that signed confidentiality agreements with TXU as prospective bidders, the source said. Few, if any, energy companies were among the nine firms, which were largely financial investors, said another person familiar with the matter. \u001d  TXU said Monday it wasn't expecting any additional buyout offers beyond the KKR group's bid. \u001d  Spokespeople for Blackstone, Carlyle and TXU declined to comment on rival bidding activity. \b \b   Thorny Politics, Big Banks \b \u001d  Prospective bidders were likely reluctant to throw their hats in the ring for TXU in light of proposals from Texas lawmakers that could prevent the deal from closing, observers concluded. In addition, the bid by KKR, TGP and the banks was seen as formidable and difficult to beat, both for its size and the fact that the banks are dominant players in the U.S. power market, leaving the pool of alternatives fairly small. \u001d  In recent months, Texas lawmakers have proposed addressing rising electricity rates in the state's deregulated power market by limiting the amount of power generation companies can own and giving state regulators the authority to strike down utility mergers like the TXU deal, among other measures. \u001d  \"The political risks involved in the transaction have become greater\" because of the bills in the legislature, one analyst said. \u001d  Prospective bidders for TXU were likely concerned the legislative proposals could make an acquisition of TXU difficult to complete, said Daniele Seitz, an analyst with Dahlman Rose & Co. in New York. \u001d  A bill by Texas state Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, would require TXU or any company that controls 20% or more of a wholesale power market to sell some of its power plants in areas where it holds market power. The proposal aims to foster greater competition in the state's electricity market. \u001d  \"If you are an entity that wants to buy a company for its generating assets and then you have to divest them, that's very problematic,\" Seitz said. \u001d  The bill passed the Texas Senate last month and is now before the state House of Representatives. \b \b   TXU Under Fire \b \u001d  TXU drew fire from Fraser and other lawmakers last month after state regulators issued a report that found the company manipulated the Texas wholesale power market. \u001d  \"This report only further strengthens my argument for reducing market power of the electric companies who are continuing to abuse the public,\" Fraser said on March 12. He added that his bills would \"help alleviate the stranglehold the current electricity companies have on the market.\" \u001d  Another bill by Fraser, who chairs the state Senate Business and Commerce Committee, would give the Public Utility Commission of Texas the power to block, or approve, utility mergers and acquisitions like the TXU deal. That bill is still pending in the state Senate Regulated Industries Committee. \u001d  A separate proposal by state House Speaker Pro Tempore Sylvester Turner, D-Houston, would require the PUCT to review mergers or acquisitions of state-regulated utilities and reject any transactions found not to be in the public interest. \u001d  Turner introduced the plan as an amendment to a bill that would give state regulators the authority to reduce electricity prices for some retail customers, including TXU ratepayers. The Texas House debated the bill late Wednesday but postponed voting on the measure. \u001d  In arguing against the amendment Wednesday, Rep. Phil King, R-Weatherford, said introducing state regulatory scrutiny of utility mergers in \"midstream,\" after a merger has already been announced would send a negative message to investors. \u001d  \"If we put in new requirements after the fact, investors will think we changed the law after (they made an) investment and it'll scare them away,\" King said. \u001d  Turner said the PUCT should review utility mergers to ensure they're in the public interest. \"If the Public Utility Commission can't make that determination, whether a merger or acquisition of a state utility is in the public interest, who can?\" he asked. \b \b   Capital Challenge \b \u001d  Firms considering a bid for TXU were probably also dissuaded by the amount of capital needed to beat KKR's and TPG's $32 billion bid, Seitz said. \u001d  \"There are a limited number of entities that can really finance such an acquisition,\" she said. Raising such a large sum of money from investors is no small feat, even for large private equity firms like Blackstone and Carlyle, Seitz said. \u001d  The investor consortium led by KKR and TPG offered $69.25 per share for TXU, a 25% premium to the average closing share price over the 20 days ending Feb. 22. \u001d  In addition to the high price tag, companies looking to submit rival bids for TXU likely found it difficult to round up investment bankers to advise them on making offers because most of the large Wall Street banks were either bidding on the company themselves or advising TXU, Carlyle or Blackstone, analysts said. Lazard Freres was advising TXU on the deal, while Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are part of the investor consortium backing Blackstone's and Carlyle's bid. \b \u001d  -By Christine Buurma; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; christine.buurma@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 09:22 ET (13:22 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4a98f3169e7b7d44e37fc87fb977dbbe","symR":["AIG","US0268741073"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"AIG CEO Sullivan Got 2006 Pay Package Valued At $21.2M >AIG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AIG","US0268741073"],"IndustryCodes":["INF","INS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  American International Group Inc.

Now, nine years later, it appears he could be in the background on a deal to undo it. \u001d  Stallkamp is a partner in Ripplewood, according to a Canadian newspaper report. \u001d  IRN Inc. auto industry analyst Erich Merkle said he liked the idea of Ripplewood's involvement. \u001d  \"Ripplewood could put a little financial muscle into the bid, and they would have a deep bench of auto execs to run Chrysler - Tom Stallkamp, Mark Hogan from Magna\" and Chrysler Group President Tom LaSorda, Merkle was quoted as saying. \u001d  The Free Press said part of the appeal of a buyout firm partnering with an industrial partner is a belief that a private equity firm wouldn't be able to handle running an automaker on its own. Labor unions, fearing huge job cuts, have voiced strong opposition to a lone partner equity buyer, the report said. \u001d  \"I don't believe any PE (private equity) group could successfully run Chrysler by themselves,\" Merkle told the paper. \u001d  Ripplewood spokesman Jeff Taufield declined to comment, as did Chrysler's parent company, DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX), and Magna. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 10:45 ET (14:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4c9c7c9a74124537c9f6737279440204","symR":["KIM"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Kimco Realty to Present at CSFB Real Estate Conference","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T11:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KIM"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bNEW HYDE PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 06, 2007-- \u001d  Kimco Realty Corporation's (NYSE: KIM) management will give a general overview of the Company followed by a question and answer session at the CSFB Real Estate Conference on April 11, 2007 in New York City. \b \b    What:  Kimco Realty Management Presentation at CSFB Real Estate \b           Conference \b \b    When:  April 11, 2007 at 2:30 P.M., E.T. \b \b    Where: http://www.kimcorealty.com/investor/meeting.asp \b \b    How:   Live over the Internet - simply log on to the Web at the \b           address above \b \u001d  If you are unable to participate during the live webcast, audio from the conference will be available on Kimco Realty's website, www.kimcorealty.com.

(DALRQ) and Collins & Aikman Corp. (CKCRQ) bankruptcy cases to cast their votes for the companies' reorganization plans. The next day, Asarco LLC will hear if it gets more time to come up with a plan to get itself out of bankruptcy. \u001d  This, and more next week in U.S. bankruptcy courts. \b \b   Monday \b \u001d  With the goal of emerging from bankruptcy by late April, Delta Air Lines will find out if it has the creditor support it needs to start implementing its turnaround plan. Creditors have until then to cast their votes. \u001d  A judge will still need to approve Delta's plan, even if creditors give it the go ahead. A confirmation hearing is scheduled for April 25 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. \u001d  Delta, which has been under bankruptcy court protection for a 18 months has said it expects to launch a stock-exchange listing in early May. \u001d  On the same day creditors will decide whether to give Delta's plan their stamp of approval, creditors in Collins & Aikman's case will also be checking for hanging chads on the auto maker's plan ballots. \u001d  Collins & Aikman's proposed plan would create a litigation trust to pursue potential lawsuits related to operational and accounting issues that arose before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2005. \u001d  Collins & Aikman filed for Chapter 11 protection May 17, 2005, amid allegations of fraud by investors who claimed they had been misled by the company's financial condition. \b \b   Wednesday \b \u001d  The judge in Asarco's bankruptcy case will decide whether to grant the mining company until Nov. 10 to submit a turnaround plan. If Judge Richard S. Schmidt sides with Asarco, the company will have until Jan. 29, 2008, to rally creditor support for its plan. \u001d  An OK from the judge extends what is known in bankruptcy court as an \"exclusivity period,\" which gives the company the sole right to file a turnaround plan and prevents other parties from presenting their own plans and interrupting the debtor company's restructuring efforts. Asarco will need to tackle significant hurdles in its bid to reorganize its business and exit Chapter 11. \u001d  The company faces about $6.5 billion in environmental claims filed by the federal government and more than a dozen states. The company also faces 95,000 asbestos-related claims that could total more than $1 billion. \u001d  Wednesday is also a big day for creditors in Dana Corp.'s (DCNAQ) bankruptcy. The official committee of unsecured creditors wants the ability to retain its status in the case while continuing to trade the auto-parts supplier's securities. \u001d  Dune Capital LLC wants the judge overseeing Dana's Chapter 11 case to approve protocols for a \"screening wall\" that would enable the private-equity firm to serve on the committee while it trades claims and notes for its own benefit and that of its clients. \u001d  Dana, of Toledo, Ohio, has been operating under Chapter 11 protection through the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan since March 2006. All financial transactions must be submitted for judicial review. \u001d  Judge Burton Lifland is expected to consider the request for the \"wall\" at Wednesday's hearing in Manhattan. \u001d  Also Wednesday, Solutia Inc.'s (SOLUQ) financial adviser Rothschild Inc. will find out if it's still on track for a $500,000 payday following the sale of a company unit. \u001d  A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in Manhattan is scheduled to review the details of the sale procedure at the midweek hearing. \u001d  The chemical maker's Dequest business is on track to be acquired by Thermphos Trading GmbH, Swiss concern, for $67 million, according to James M. Sullivan, Solutia's senior vice president and chief financial officer. \u001d  Solutia's efforts to sell Dequest are part of the company's larger efforts to increase the pool of cash to pay creditors and emerge from bankruptcy protection. Rothschild's fee could grow by another 5% of the sale price if the unit sells for more than $75 million at auction. \u001d  Dequest produces phosphonates and other additives that enhance water quality for industrial and domestic use. The unit's customers use such products in industrial detergents, industrial cleaners and enhanced oil recovery operations. \u001d  The deadline for other parties interested in Dequest to submit competing offers is April 30. \b \b   Thursday \b \u001d  Calpine Corp. (CPNLQ) will hear if it will be allowed to spend up to $60 million on construction of a plant that will generate power for the San Diego area. The company said in court papers that its Otay Mesa Energy Center, slated for completion in May 2009, is expected to increase value for Calpine's bankruptcy estate and its creditors. \u001d  The company has been operating under Chapter 11 protection through the Manhattan bankruptcy court since December 2005 and must receive Judge Lifland's approval before making financial expenditures. Previous court decisions concerning the power plant's construction gave Calpine the green light to engage lending groups to secure long term financing arrangements to cover Otay Mesa's building costs. \u001d  The company said it's close to finalizing a 10-year, $377 million financing package that would allow construction to be completed. \u001d  It also said it needs permission to suspend the so-called automatic stay preventing court actions against companies in Chapter 11. That action is needed, Calpine said, to advance financing discussions and reassure lenders that they can take action against the company in the event it defaults on the package. \u001d  (This item appears in Dow Jones' Daily Bankruptcy Review newsletter.) \u001d  -By Laura K.

(DHOM) became the latest home builder to feel the sting of the U.S. housing slump, reporting a 54% drop in homes sold during the first quarter. \u001d  The Dublin, Ohio, company sold 218 homes in the first quarter, for a total sales value of $43.5 million, down from 475 homes, or $89.3 million, a year earlier. \u001d  The company, the most recent home builder to report lower sales of new homes, noted that this was its best sales performance since the second quarter of 2006. The housing sector has been struggling with an inventory glut, a surge in cancellations from jittery buyers and a slump in demand, forcing most home builders to slash prices and offer other incentives to spur sales. \u001d  Sales in the industry have also been hurt by the meltdown in the subprime-mortgage lending sector. \u001d  Dominion Homes delivered 48% fewer homes during the quarter, for a total of 165 homes. The backlog as of March 31 was 319 contracts, with a sales value of $64.9 million, compared with 590 contracts, with a sales value of $118.2 million, a year ago. \u001d  Earlier this year, the company completed a four-year renewal of its credit facility to help \"weather an anticipated loss in 2007 as a result of the depressed housing market, and to respond aggressively when the market rebounds.\" \u001d  Last month, KB Home (KBH), one of the nation's largest home builders, posted an 84% drop in fiscal first-quarter earnings as orders and prices for new homes dropped. Toll Brothers Inc., (TOL) the closely watched luxury-home builder, reported a 67% drop in fiscal first-quarter profit and offered little hope the overall housing market is improving. \u001d  Dominion Homes will release full first-quarter results on May 4. \u001d  -Josee Rose; 201-938-5400; josee.rose@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:19 ET (19:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"51cef093ecfd6b65f16279be0a1d1e96","symR":["CGPI","CGPI"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CollaGenex Pharmaceuticals Files $100M Mixed Sec Shelf>CGPI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CGPI"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 16:45 ET (20:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"51d389e81a0461fc24eacec9e794e7c8","symR":["AIG","US0268741073"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder STARR INTERNATIONAL CO INC Sells 800,000 Of AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL >AIG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T19:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AIG","US0268741073"],"IndustryCodes":["INF","INS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP \bSYMBOL: AIG \b \bFILER: STARR INTERNATIONAL CO INC \bTITLE: Beneficial Owner \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/4/07-4/5/07      Sale                    800,000      $67.21     $53,769,120 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 276,538,405 (Direct) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said approval of the accord - the IPCC's second of four reports on global warming - \"has been a complex exercise,\" while one frustrated participant told the Associated Press: \"The authors lost.\" Several scientists objected to government delegates' editing of the final draft, and some said they would never take part in the process again, the AP reports. While the first IPCC chapter, released in February, concluded there is a 90% probability that the burning of fossil fuels and other activities contribute to global warming, as Nature explains, Friday's report offers the most extensive international effort yet to define the effects. And that's where the IPCC scientists were clashing with governments, specifically China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the U.S., the Financial Times and other media reported. \u001d  Among the changes in language was removal of the phrase \"strong evidence\" in discussing how global warming would hurt biodiversity, according to Dow Jones Newswires' Anne Jollis. Instead, the finished report says: \"available evidence shows that global warming would have negative effects on biodiversity.\" The report does offer the first evidence that man-made climate change is having a discernible effect on plants and animals around the world, co-Chairman Martin Parry said, adding: \"For the first time, we're no longer arm waving with models; this is empirical data, we can actually measure it,\" as the BBC reports. The most vulnerable areas of the world, he said, are: \"The arctic, where temperatures are rising fast and ice is melting; sub-Saharan Africa, where dry areas are forecast to get dryer; small islands, because of their inherent lack of capacity to adapt, and Asian mega-deltas, where billions of people will be at increased risk of flooding.\" \u001d  Increases of just one degree to two degrees Celsius can hurt the production of cereal crops at low latitudes, even as it helps such crops at higher-latitude regions like Scandinavia. \"There is some evidence that cereal yields are already declining in semi-arid areas,\" Parry said. The IPCC finds that by the end of this century, the rising seas and spreading deserts caused by global warming could hurt the economic growth of all countries, with poorer nations suffering the worst, Dow Jones reports, citing delegates. Those figures may undermine the White House's current arguments on the regulation of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. Earlier this week, President Bush, in discussing a Supreme Court decision on the subject, asserted that any means of addressing global warming \"cannot hurt economic growth.\" \u001d  The report says areas of the world with rain shortages are likely to get drier, even as threats of flooding, severe storms and coastline erosion increase for coastal areas, the AP reports. A new study in Science shows a broad consensus among climate models that \"anthropogenic climate change\" will have serious implications for water resources across the American Southwest. \"If these models are correct, the levels of aridity of the recent multiyear drought, or the Dust Bowl and 1950s droughts, will, within the coming years to decades, become the new climatology\" of the region, Science says. The Los Angeles Times notes that \"the transformation may already be underway. Much of the region has been in a severe drought since 2000, which the [Science] study's analysis of computer climate models shows as the beginning of a long dry period.\" \b \b   What Kerkorian Adds To The Chrysler Bidding \b \u001d  Kirk Kerkorian just can't keep his hands off the auto business, and as low as his offer for Chrysler may be, it seems sure to roil the bidding. Kerkorian offered $4.5 billion to take the struggling U.S. car maker off DaimlerChrysler's (DCX) hands, as the Detroit Free Press puts it, and that makes him the fourth known bidder with more aspirants expected to join the fray. In a letter to DaimlerChrysler Chairman Dieter Zetsche, Kerkorian's Tracinda investment company said it could bring experience, expertise and financial strength to the company that \"will greatly benefit Chrysler and its employees, suppliers and customers.\" In a separate letter to Zetsche, former Chrysler finance chief Jerry York, who is also Kerkorian's right-hand man on auto issues, added that Chrysler \"needs a new owner with patience to do what is needed to turn Chrysler into an independently viable company again,\" which could take five to seven years, the Free Press says. \u001d  Kerkorian's bid looks likely to raise the stakes for rivals, which already include Cerberus Capital Management, an alliance of Blackstone Group and Centerbridge Partners, and auto-parts supplier Magna International Inc. (MGA), as The Wall Street Journal notes. \"Mr. Kerkorian has a long track record as both a hard-nosed investor and combative Chrysler shareholder, and his leap into the bidding could give DaimlerChrysler more leverage in any negotiations with Chrysler's other suitors,\" the Journal says. In one way, his offer echoes another prominent takeover deal these days, Sam Zell's agreement to take control of Tribune Co. (TRB). That deal would leave much of Tribune's equity in the hands of Tribune employees. And the Journal reports that Kerkorian's bid \"contains an unusual twist: Tracinda said it would offer the United Auto Workers union, which represents about 65,500 of Chrysler's 82,400 employees, a 'substantial portion' of Chrysler equity as part of a deal to lower the cost of providing health care for hourly workers.\" \b \b   Web Watching Undercuts The Repeats \b \u001d  Anathema to some television viewers, repeats are nonetheless a lucrative source of income for the networks and production companies that turn out the series. Or so they have been until now. In the wake of television episodes' migration to the networks' Web sites, ratings for on-air repeats are eroding, Variety reports. \"There are some shows I don't even bother TiVo-ing because I know I can just watch the episodes on the Web site,\" one network exec admits to the trade publication. \"At some point it has to have an impact on the ratings. ...You're training the audience to watch these shows on other platforms.\" Still, the networks are charging for the ads that accompany the online streaming of their shows, and many think that will ultimately be a bigger source of overall viewership, Variety notes. \"We're trying to create a circle of life,\" ABC scheduling executive Jeff Bader says, adding that \"there are many places to watch a show, but primetime is where it begins.\" Still, Variety points out, online revenue doesn't come close to matching that generated by traditional television viewing. \u001d  On another potential old media-new media battle line, Sam Zell, the real-estate magnate set to assume control of the Tribune empire, last night told a Silicon Valley audience that there needs to be \"a new deal and new formulas\" between newspapers and Internet companies, the Los Angeles Times reports. \"If all the newspapers in America did not allow Google to steal their content for nothing, what would Google do, and how profitable would Google be?\" Mr. Zell asked. His answer, according to the Times: Not very. Tonight Zell is scheduled to meet with entertainment mogul David Geffen in what The Wall Street Journal describes as \"the latest in a series of discussions about the future of the Los Angeles Times,\" perhaps the most prominent division of Tribune. People close to the situation tell the Journal talks between the two men are a continuing informal conversation about the paper, which Geffen expressed an interest in buying last year. And on another newspaper front, Institutional Shareholder Services, the independent corporate advisory group, Thursday urged New York Times Co. (NYT) shareholders to withhold their backing for the company's board \"to pressure the company over dissatisfaction with its performance and ownership structure,\" as the N.Y. Times reports. \b \b   Also Of Note  \b \u001d  Guardian: As 15 British sailors and marines were celebrating their release by the Iranian government, the bloody reality of the conflict in which they were embroiled struck British soldiers Thursday on the streets of southern Iraq, where four on patrol were killed by a roadside bomb in one of the worst attacks on British forces since the invasion of Iraq four years ago. \u001d  Washington Post: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has handed out more than $70 billion in grants, loans and loan guarantees since 2001 as part of its sprawling but little-known Rural Development program, but more than half of that money has gone to metropolitan regions or communities within easy commuting distance of a midsize city, including beach resorts and suburban developments. \u001d  The Hill: Detroit's auto makers are flexing their political muscle by launching a major lobbying effort intended to get the administration to take a tougher stand on Japanese currency policies they claim give Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) and other Japanese exporters a trade advantage. \u001d  Bloomberg: The U.S. may file a complaint at the World Trade Organization as early as next week over what it calls China's piracy of copyrighted movies and books, according to four people briefed by the Bush administration. Consideration of the move follows the Bush administration's reversal last week of two decades of policy by levying new duties on some imports from China. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 08:02 ET (12:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"584ea7033775cc7575b0edddc768629f","symR":["NEWC"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"New Century: Ct OKs Continuation Of Customer Pgms","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T13:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NEWC"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 09:15 ET (13:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"58ace11e143e8df65e167ff6c9bebaa8","symR":["TXU","US8731681081"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"TXU Asks PUC To Disregard Filing","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T19:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TXU","US8731681081"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:30 ET (19:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"58e1a8de2dab4615ea3fc801c68bf89e","symR":["NCBC"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": John Q.

The investment will result in additional generating capacity of 9 megawatts (mw) at the two plants that currently have a combined generating capacity of approximately 49 mw. \b \u001d  \"This planned investment in our hydroelectric generating stations is a testament to our commitment to the environment and renewable sources of energy,\" said Jim Laurito, president and CEO of NYSEG and RG&E. \"Optimizing the output of these plants is also an important step in diversifying the fuel mix for generating electricity.\" \b \u001d  Most of the work will take place at Station 2 at High Falls. Planning will begin in 2007 to double the size of the facility and its current 6.5 mw generating capacity. This work is expected to be complete in 2009. In addition, the existing generator at the plant will be rewound to make it more efficient, netting an additional generating capacity of 1 mw. This work will be done in 2008. \b \u001d  RG&E also plans to rewind a generator and complete related work at Station 5 at Middle/Lower Falls next summer. This project will add approximately 1.5 mw of generating capacity at the plant. \b \u001d  Completion of these projects will provide direct benefits to the environment because the additional environmentally-friendly generation will offset generation from fossil-fuel sources. Each year, the additional generating capacity at Stations 2 and 5 will mean nearly 14,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2), nearly 60 tons of sulfur dioxide and nearly 20 tons of nitrogen oxides from fossil-fuel sources will be avoided. The CO2 emissions avoided are the equivalent of planting more than 1.8 million trees or not driving more than 27 million miles. \b \u001d  RG&E and its sister company NYSEG together are the third largest generator of renewable energy in the state. \b \b    One mw of generating capacity is enough to serve approximately 700 homes. \b \u001d  About Energy East:  Energy East Corporation is a respected super-regional energy services and delivery company serving about 3 million customers throughout upstate New York and New England.

No material that violated Japan's safety standards for meat imports were found in the shipment, it said. \u001d  Japan, a nation that is extremely nervous about food safety, especially imported meat, banned American beef imports in December 2003 after the first case of mad cow disease in the U.S. \u001d  The ban was eased once in December 2005, but tightened again the following month after prohibited spinal bones were found in a veal shipment. Tokyo eased the restrictions again in last July year, but allows only meat from cows aged 20 months or younger. \u001d  Beef is growing into a bilateral trade issue. U.S. President George W. Bush recently urged Japan to reopen its markets fully to U.S. beef, removing the 20-month-old or younger requirement. \u001d  Before the ban on American beef three years ago, Japan had been the top destination for U.S. beef, importing US$1.4 billion worth a year. \u001d  Last month, Japan suspended beef imports from California meatpacker Jobbers Meat Packing Co. after finding packages of beef sausage in a shipment in violation of a regulation imposed over mad cow concerns, the government said Friday. \u001d  Japan bans the import of U.S. products such as sausage that contain processed beef under restrictions because of what Japan says are risks of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy. \u001d  Eating meat contaminated with mad cow disease is linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, a rare but deadly nerve disorder. \u001d  In February, Japan stopped beef imports from a Nebraska processing plant operated by Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) after finding boxes of beef, which had not been verified as from cattle 20 months old or younger, as required by Japan. \u001d  Japan limits imports of beef that has been through stringent checks at selected U.S. meat processing plants, but still imports American beef from about 30 processing plants that haven't had any problems. \u001d  Last week, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s (WMT) Japan unit, the Seiyu supermarket chain, became the first major Japanese retailer to start selling American beef, although even Seiyu has begun a cautious rollout, selling U.S. beef at 20 of its 400 nationwide stores. \u001d  Other major retail chains are staying away from U.S. beef because Japanese consumers are worried about the risks of eating American beef. \u001d  Less finicky Japanese have welcomed the return of American beef, and the beef bowl at a Japanese fast-food chain - slivers of grilled U.S. beef served over hot rice - is a big hit. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 00:48 ET (04:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5ad7cf397ac5a51c2b901e9dafa917b4","symR":["ABX","ABX.T","CA0679011084"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Annual Report for Barrick Gold Corp.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABX","ABX.T","CA0679011084"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  Barrick Gold Corp.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=ABX or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5aeac5f6b4e850f4ce29e72472c677ac","symR":["SLB"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Schlumberger: Doesn't Recommend, Endorse TRC Cap Offer","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T16:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLB"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:28 ET (16:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5b5e4e1bbfbf13ea07ca09475dffeade","symR":["IDEV","VLRX"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Valera Pharma Intends To Delist From NASDAQ >VLRX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IDEV","VLRX"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Valera Pharmaceuticals Inc.

(AA) will lead off earnings season next week with a profit report that's likely to reflect two of the first quarter's major themes: A rebound in the metals markets while key U.S. industrial sectors continue to languish. \b \u001d  Analysts expect the Pittsburgh-based aluminum producer to show a profit of 75 cents a share, up 7% from continuing operations in the year-ago period, when it reports results for the first three months of the year after Tuesday's closing bell. \b \u001d  First-quarter earnings for Alcoa, a litmus for other blue-chip companies, are expected to slow from the fourth quarter, when earnings per share climbed 58% from the final three months of 2005, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial. Excluding one-time items, its profit rose by 111% last quarter. \b \u001d  On the plus side, resurgent aluminum prices are again likely to underpin profits at Alcoa, which is now vying with Russia's UC Rusal for the title of the world's largest aluminum producer. \b \u001d  The average cash price of aluminum traded on the London Metal Exchange gained 16% from a year ago, to $2,800 a metric ton - or $1.27 a pound - and rose 3% from the fourth quarter. Falling inventories, a strike in metals-rich Guinea and climbing copper prices bid up aluminum, say analysts. \b \u001d  \"We had events in aluminum that indicated tighter fundamentals, and while that was occurring, we had an ongoing rally in other metals that helped propel aluminum,\" said John Mothersole, analyst at economics research firm Global Insight. \b \u001d  But Alcoa encountered some rough ground over the quarter, including the general strike in Guinea, the African republic where it has a joint venture producing bauxite, or aluminum ore. \b \u001d  Credit Suisse analyst David Gagliano cited the strike and increased start-up costs at an Alcoa smelter in Iceland when he cut his first-quarter profit forecast by a nickel, to 76 cents a share, in a note published Thursday. \b \u001d  What's more, aluminum producers have faced a chill from the U.S. housing and automotive sectors, two of the biggest markets for the metal. Demand from aircraft manufacturers has been running high thanks to their own new orders, but \"aerospace, while performing well, in terms of volume is not very big,\" noted Global Insight's Mothersole. \b \u001d  Still, retrenchment in Alcoa's major U.S. markets may be overshadowing other big growth drivers - such as construction demand in Asia, says Citigroup analyst John Hill. \b \u001d  \"Headline-grabbing U.S. housing is masking a non-China emerging markets construction boom,\" wrote Hill in a note to investors. He rates Alcoa, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as a buy. \b \b   S&P 500: 10% growth? \b \u001d  A more modest expansion in Alcoa's profit is likely to mirror the slower growth expected for the entire S&P 500 than registered in the fourth quarter and in the year-ago first quarter. \b \u001d  Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research are forecasting this latest quarter will show an 8.3% gain in S&P 500 company earnings compared with the first three months of 2006. \b \u001d  Zacks' own analysts predict companies will perform better than forecast and post gains between 10% and 11%. But that's still likely to be slower than the approximate 13% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2006 or the 15% rate in the year-earlier quarter. \b \u001d  Dampening earnings strength in the first quarter are comparisons with the year-ago period, when some big companies benefited from a post-Hurricane Katrina construction boom, said Zacks senior market analyst Charles Rotblut. \b \u001d  \"In general, the economy was a little bit stronger last year,\" he said. \b \b   Alcoa Is Tops Among First-Quarter Gainers \b \u001d  For Alcoa shareholders, the March quarter was as much about merger rumors as it was about basic supply fundamentals. \b \u001d  Alcoa's shares climbed 13% in the first quarter, outpacing all other blue-chip stocks, spurred by speculation the company would be the target of a large buyout. \b \u001d  In February, Alcoa shares jumped as much as 10% after the Times (of London) reported that overseas mining giants BHP Billiton (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RTP) were each considering bids for the company. \b \u001d  Announced cross-border deals added to the merger buzz. India's Hindalco said in February it would buy U.S.-Canadian aluminum-sheet producer Novelis Inc. (NVL) in a bid to rapidly expand capacity. \b \u001d  This consolidation trend resulted in last month's three-way merger of Russian aluminum producers Rusal and Sual with the alumina assets of commodity trading firm Glencore International AG. \b \u001d  The new company, UC Rusal, says it is the world's largest aluminum producer with expected output of 4 billion metric tons. That production would top Alcoa's 2006 primary aluminum production of 3.6 billion tons, though Alcoa says it has the capacity to produce a lot more - 4.2 billion, or more than its Russian rival. \b \u001d  Even without a big buyout, analysts say there's reason to think some kind of restructuring could be in store for Alcoa. They point to the company's decision to divest part of its finished-products business, announced in November. \b \u001d  If margins in Alcoa's downstream business lag its peers in its upcoming first-quarter report, \"this will add to restructuring pressure,\" said Citigroup's Hill. \u001d  -Laura Mandaro; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 13:03 ET (17:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5c0d699d76d68e157c682a311c2f268e","symR":["IMAX","IMX.T","CA45245E1097"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Imax In Forbearance Pact With Sr Note Holders >IMAX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T10:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IMAX","IMX.T","CA45245E1097"],"IndustryCodes":["RCS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 06:02 ET (10:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5c873a3eda2c1b2c912b4fc023d0d7d4","symR":["VG","VZ","US92343V1044"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"US Judge Tells Vonage It Can't Seek New Customers -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VG","VZ","US92343V1044"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","ISV","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Hilton also ruled that Vonage must lodge a $66 million appeal bond, which would be funds held in an account pending the outcome of subsequent appeals. \u001d  According to Rebecca Arboghast, a telecommunications analyst with Stifel & Nicolaus, who was at the hearing, said if the ruling is upheld it will be difficult for Vonage to \"continue in a viable way.\" \b \u001d  -By Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6637; corey.boles@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:32 ET (15:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5d2eaf80edcf9f97c098a352a0ebfec4","symR":["TY","TY"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Tri-Continental:Lipson's Western Investment Ends Proxy Fight","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TY"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 14:26 ET (18:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5d80d790067d54d117d6208220b0ac6a","symR":["AZA.MI","BAB","BAY.LN","DLAKY","EZJ.LN","IBLA.MC","LHA.XE","MLV.YY","SKY.YY","DE0008232125","ES0147200036","GB0001290575","GB0001641991","IT0003918577"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Airlines Cancel Flights To Budapest On Strike By Ground Crew","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T10:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AZA.MI","BAB","BAY.LN","DLAKY","EZJ.LN","IBLA.MC","LHA.XE","MLV.YY","SKY.YY","DE0008232125","ES0147200036","GB0001290575","GB0001641991","IT0003918577"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDAX","XDJGI","XFT1","XIBEX","XMIB","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BUDAPEST (AP)--Four international carriers canceled or diverted all their flights to and from Budapest airport Friday because of a two-day strike by ground crew. \u001d  Deutsche Lufthansa (LHA.XE), British Airways PLC (BAB), Alitalia SpA (AZA.MI) and easyJet PLC (EZJ.LN) on Friday cleared their schedules, and other carriers were expected to make decisions later, airport spokesman Domokos Szollar said. \u001d  Hungary's national carrier, Malev, as well as Czech Airlines, Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA (IBLA.MC) and SkyEurope Airlines AS should be unaffected because they employ their own ground personnel, he said. \u001d  The striking workers are seeking a 10% salary increase. \u001d  The strike, which began at 2:30 p.m. (1230 GMT) Thursday, could affect a total of some 160 flights over Easter weekend, Szollar said earlier. \u001d  Flights operated by the affected airlines represent about one-third of all air traffic at the airport. \u001d  Szollar said passengers will also notice a slowdown at check-in counters, baggage claims and when boarding aircraft. \u001d  British Airways said some flights would be diverted to Vienna, with passengers bussed to and from Budapest -

A charred housing market has been further scorched by the subprime-mortgage meltdown, flimsy capital-spending numbers would suggest that businesses have lost their checkbooks, and manufacturers have seen demand for pricey products like refrigerators and cars crash through the factory floor. No matter. Employers added 180,000 jobs to nonfarm payrolls last month, a robust rate of hiring that suggests that worry that the economy is headed into recession is so much fevered babble. \u001d  It's of course dangerous to draw sweeping conclusions from any single data point. But hiring in January and February was revised up by a net 32,000 jobs. There was also good news on the wages front, as average hourly earnings came in 4% higher than the same time a year ago. And the unemployment rate fell back to 4.4%, matching its lowest level since May 2001. \u001d  Nigel Gault of the consulting firm Global Insight says the data should press the mute button on all that nervous chirping about growth slamming into reverse. He wrote that if \"businesses were pulling back on both capital spending and hiring, then recession scenarios would gain credibility. But businesses are still hiring, the unemployment rate has fallen again, and earnings growth remains solid.\" \u001d  Some economists pulling the report apart noted that the big rebound in construction jobs was probably a case of firms' staffing back up after some bad weather in February snowed in many framers and masons, and is therefore unlikely to be repeated. \u001d  David Resler of Nomura Securities said that residential construction employment is still \"continuing a yearlong downtrend that seems unlikely to end anytime soon.\" Economists at Bear Stearns noted that nonfarm payrolls posted a monthly average advance of 152,000 jobs during the first quarter, versus a 12-month average of 164,000. \"That is not the stuff that major slowdowns are made of,\" they wrote in a note to clients. \u001d  The report doused expectations that the Federal Reserve will start pruning back interest rates. Few financial markets were open for very long this morning amid the holiday, but the credit and futures markets cracked the door for a while, and investors in fed-funds futures backed out most of their expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates before the end of this summer. Economists also seemed to be quite certain that the data mean that a rate cut isn't even a remote possibility. \u001d  Drew Matus, a senior economist at Lehman Brothers, said it \"further limits the Fed's options,\" since the low unemployment rate and climbing wages will keep policy makers on inflation watch. Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, is even more strongly convinced that the next few Fed meetings will be pretty dull. \"With the labor market tight and if anything getting tighter and core inflation above the Fed's comfort zone, there is no way the Fed will ease for the foreseeable future unless we get a highly improbable economic collapse,\" Stanley wrote. Treasury yields surged on the news, pushing the 10-year yield up to 4.752%. The dollar rose. \b \b   Vonage Can't Sign Up New Customers \u001d  Dealing another blow to the struggling Internet phone company, a federal judge ruled that Vonage Holdings Corp. (VG) will be allowed to continue servicing existing customers but won't be allowed to sign up any new ones, after previously determining that the company violated patents held by Verizon Communications (VZ). Vonage said it is planning an immediate appeal; its lawyers said the injunction posted by U.S. District Judge Hilton is almost as devastating as an injunction that would have affected Vonage's 2.2 million existing customers. \"It's the difference of cutting off oxygen as opposed to the bullet in the head,\" Vonage lawyer Roger Warin said. \u001d  Verizon's lawyers had suggested the compromise injunction as a way to avoid shutting down the entire Vonage network. Judge Hilton said that he had weighed a number of factors in reaching his decision, including whether a stay could in fact lead to Vonage's bankruptcy. He also said he had to evaluate how the public's interest would be affected and decided that given the competitiveness of the telecommunications industry there would be no impact either way. \b \b   Karzai Talking To Taliban \u001d  Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai acknowledged Friday that he had recently met with Taliban representatives in an attempt to persuade the resurgent group to lay down its weapons. The Taliban, pushed from power in 2001 following the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, has been slowly regrouping over recent years and has lately stepped up its attacks on coalition targets in Afghanistan. Some analysts are deeply concerned that militants have been gathering strength for an expected spring offensive against the now NATO-led coalition and Karzai's government. \"We have had representatives from the Taliban meeting with different bodies of Afghan government for a long time,\" Karzai said at a news conference. \"I have had some Taliban coming to speak to me as well.\" \u001d  Hundreds of former members of the hardline Islamist Taliban have reconciled with the government since they were ousted from power, but many more have shunned Karzai to participate in a violent insurgent campaign in the south of the country that has left thousands dead. \b \b   British Troops Detail Detentions \u001d  The 15 British sailors and marines who were held captive for nearly two weeks by Iran said that they got through the ordeal \"by staying together as a team.\" At a news conference, they also tried to make clear that any purported confessions, aired by Iran television, that they were in Iranian waters when they were snared were made under duress. \"Let me make this clear - irrespective of what was said in the past, we were inside Iraqi waters,\" Lt. Felix Carman said. \u001d  Some had said on Iranian television after they were released that they were treated well by their captors but Friday their statement said that \"the past two weeks have been very difficult.\" Members of the crew also said they decided not to fight back against the guards who captured them, adding that they were blindfolded and isolated for much of their detention. One said that female captive Leading Seaman Faye Turney had at one point been led to believe that all the other prisoners had been released. \b \b   Ramadi Suicide Blast Kills 27 \u001d  A suicide bomber drove a truck loaded with explosives and chlorine gas into a security checkpoint in Ramadi, Iraq, killing at least 27 people and wounding dozens of others. Chlorine-laden bombs have become a more frequent occurrence in Iraq in recent days, raising concern about another shift in tactics by insurgents. Also Friday, British officials in Basra said a roadside bomb that caused the deaths of four British troops in that city this week was a type that hadn't been seen in the province previously. Two more of the bombs were discovered along routes that are heavily traveled by U.S. and British diplomats in Basra. \u001d  Also, the body of an Iraqi radio reporter, Khamail Muhsin, was discovered in Baghdad two days after she disappeared on Tuesday. She had been shot in the head. Muhsin worked for the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists nearly 100 journalists have been killed in Iraq since the opening of the war, including nearly 80 Iraqi journalists. \b \b   North Korea Bank Snag Cleared Up \u001d  A dispute over the release of $25 million in North Korean funds frozen in a bank in Macau was resolved, clearing the way for the resumption of talks on Pyongyang's nuclear disarmament. After two weeks of talks in Beijing, banking officials from the U.S., China, North and South Korea agreed on a \"technical pathway\" for the money to be returned to the regime, the State Department said. \"We support the release of all the funds. It is now a matter of technical implementation,\" spokesman Sean McCormack said. \u001d  Previously, U.S. officials had suggested privately that some of the $25 million held in the blacklisted and now-shuttered Banco Delta Asia in the Chinese territory of Macau might be tainted and not released. The Bank of China had also balked at handling the suspect funds. \b \b   U.N. Panel Finalizes Climate-Change Report \u001d  The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, after much back and forth on language between government officials and scientists, Friday reached agreement on the wording of a second document on climate change. The paper says that climate change will lead to devastating floods, droughts and fires that in turn could result in mass migrations and species extinction. This report is the second of four from the panel due this year. The first report in February laid out how global warming is unfolding; the latest explains what the effects of global warming will be. \u001d  Scientists had chafed at revisions made to the new report by government negotiators, saying that recommended changes watered down the report's findings, raising fears that they would refuse to sign off on the ultimate draft. The next two reports are due next month and in November. \b \b   More Management Changes At Wal-Mart \u001d  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) said that it had named William S. Simon, who oversaw the company's pharmacy, vision and mini-clinic businesses, as its chief operating officer for its U.S. stores. The world's largest retailer, which has been dealing with lagging sales in its U.S. operations, also said that Patricia Curran had been tapped as the division's executive vice president of people, a human resources position. Curran was executive vice president of U.S. store operations. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:21 ET (19:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5ffb43f71cd14e150005428dd03a9abf","symR":["HBDT","HBDT"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Health Benefits Direct Enters Share-Release Pact With Ex-CEO","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T17:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HBDT"],"IndustryCodes":["INL","INS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 13:05 ET (17:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6000019c26f364d9c4ca34b7c06915b1","symR":["BEAS","US0733251021"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": BEA Provides Update on Nasdaq Listing Qualification","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BEAS","US0733251021"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SAN JOSE, Calif., April 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ --- BEA Systems, Inc., a world leader in enterprise infrastructure software, today announced that, as anticipated due to the delay in filing its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007, it received an Additional Staff Determination Letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market stating that BEA continues to be out of compliance with the filing requirements of Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and, therefore, its common stock continues to be subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Global Select Market.  BEA received similar Staff Determination Letters resulting from the delay in filing its Form 10-Qs for the quarters ended July 31, 2006 and October 31, 2006 due to its ongoing stock option review. \b \u001d  On March 13, 2007, BEA announced that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council (the \"Listing Council\") had called for review the February 22, 2007 decision of the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the \"Panel\"), which had previously established a deadline of March 12, 2007 for BEA to become current in its public filings.  The Listing Council determined to stay the Panel's decision pending further action by the Listing Council.  BEA may submit additional information to the Listing Council for its consideration by May 4, 2007.  The Listing Council will then review the Panel's decision on the basis of the written record. \b \u001d  As previously disclosed, in August 2006, the Audit Committee of BEA's Board of Directors initiated a review of BEA's historical stock option grants, and on February 14, 2007, BEA announced the principal conclusions of the Audit Committee's review.  BEA is working with its independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, to restate its financial statements and become current in its public filings as soon as possible, and currently intends to do so by the end of June 2007.  There can be no assurance that BEA will be able to make such filings in this timeframe, that the outcome of the Listing Council's review will be favorable to BEA, or that BEA will remain listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. \b \b    About BEA Systems, Inc. \b \u001d  BEA Systems, Inc.

(NasdaqGM:TGIS), a leading operations and process improvement firm, announced today it has concluded the voluntary investigation into its stock option granting practices. \b \u001d  The results of the investigation and related restatement of certain of the Company's historical financial statements were included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 6, 2007 (\"Form 10-K\"). Investors are encouraged to review the details of the investigation and the restatement in the Form 10-K. This press release summarizes those matters. \b \u001d  The Company's Board of Directors, with concurrence and oversight by its Audit Committee, previously initiated a review of the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting in connection with the Company's assessment of its historical capitalization documentation and not in response to any specific concerns from within the Company about option practices or any inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory agency. \b \u001d  The Company's Board of Directors received a report on the results of the investigation on March 30, 2007 from the Company's outside counsel and specially retained forensic accountants. At that time, the Board also received recommendations for proposed remedial measures, which did not include any remedial measures pertaining to the Company's directors or senior management team. \b \u001d  The investigation team determined that from the Company's initial public offering in August 1993 to the date of its last option grant in January 2003, its historical stock option granting process has generally reflected a lack of either Board or Compensation Committee authorization for specific option grants, although a few instances exist where the Board or Compensation Committee took appropriate granting action under Delaware law and the Company's option plans. Instead, the investigation team determined that, from August 1993 to January 2003, the Company ran a CEO-centric option granting process with additional participation by the President from time to time and with minimal oversight by either the Board or Compensation Committee. The investigation team also determined that the Company's CEOs and/or Presidents through January 2003 thought that they had the apparent authority to grant options. \b \u001d  Based on the historical process deficiencies, the Company has concluded that it will be required to adjust the accounting measurement dates for certain of its stock option grants in accordance with the earliest evidence that the recipient of the grant as well as the number of shares subject to such award were set with finality. The investigation team also identified some evidence that could be construed as manipulative for certain option grants and option exercises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the investigation team concluded that the totality of the information obtained and reviewed does not indicate that (i) stock option grants were intentionally back-dated on a widespread basis in order to obtain more favorable pricing for directors, officers or employees or (ii) option exercises were intentionally manipulated on a widespread basis. The investigation team also concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting and its legal processes in connection with stock option grants and exercises have been ineffective. \b \u001d  After consideration of the report, the Board affirmed its confidence in the Company's senior management team and their continued ability to sign certifications with respect to the Company's periodic SEC reports and its financial statements. \b \u001d  The Company has self reported the internal investigation and the restatement to the Securities and Exchange Commission and intends to cooperate with any informational or other requests from the SEC. \b \u001d  In connection with the investigation, the Company's Board of Directors, with the approval of the Company's Audit Committee, has determined that the cumulative non-cash stock-based compensation expense adjustment described below was material and that the Company's consolidated financial statements for each of the first three quarters of fiscal the year ended December 31, 2006, each of the quarters in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 as well as the selected consolidated financial data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 should be restated to record additional stock-based compensation expense resulting from stock options granted during 1993 to 2003 that were incorrectly accounted for under GAAP, and related income tax effects. The Company's consolidated financial statements included in previously filed periodic reports with the SEC for such periods have not been amended. Instead, the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data included in the Form 10-K have been restated in order to reflect the referenced adjustments. \b \u001d  The Company has determined that the cumulative, pre-tax, stock-based compensation expense resulting from revised measurement dates of stock option grants was approximately $2.2 million during the period from the Company's initial public offering in 1993 through December 31, 2006. These amounts include approximately $2.1 million in non-cash stock based compensation charges and $0.1 million in cash-based taxes, penalties and interest. Conversely, the Company has recorded $0.1 million in tax benefits related to stock compensation charges. Previously reported total revenues were not impacted by the restatement. The adjustments made in the restatement relate to options covering approximately 1.9 million shares. The Company has recorded amounts as follows: \b \b   Fiscal Year    Stock-based     Income Tax,   Income tax   Decrease \b Ended December   Compensation    Penalty and     expense        in \b            31,    Expense(1)      Interest(1)   (benefit)      EPS \b                                                     (2) \b                ----------------                ------------ --------- \b          2006           $5,532       $100,613     ($34,367)    $0.00 \b          2005          $48,567              -     ($18,456)    $0.00 \b          2004          $53,722              -     ($20,414)    $0.00 \b          2003          $71,281              -     ($27,087)    $0.00 \b          2002          $49,293              -     ($10,657)    $0.01 \b      Pre-2002       $1,891,021              -           --        -- \b                ---------------- -------------- ------------ --------- \b     Total           $2,119,416       $100,613    ($110,981)    $0.01 \b \b   (1) Recorded as a $2.2 million expense with an offsetting $2.1 \bmillion increase to additional paid-in capital. Net decrease in equity \bis $0.1 million due to cash-based taxes, penalties and interest. \b \b   (2) Recorded as a decrease to tax expense and an increase to \bdeferred tax asset or decrease to income tax payable. Net increase in \bequity is $0.1 million. \b \u001d  In connection with the restatement, the Company assessed the impact of the findings of the internal investigation into its historical stock option grant practices and other tax matters on its reported income tax benefits and deductions, including income tax deductions previously taken for cash and stock-based executive compensation under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), which provides for a $1 million tax deduction cap on compensation awarded to certain top executives that is not considered performance-based. The Company determined that no adjustments were required to its (i) income tax expense previously reported in its Consolidated Statements of Income; (ii) tax benefits on stock option exercises previously reported in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity or (iii) deferred tax assets previously reported in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, the Company has determined that Section 162(m) may apply to option exercises in 2006 for 180,649 shares held by James T. Taylor, our CEO, which, when combined with other applicable employee remuneration, will be limited to a tax deduction of $1 million in 2006. We estimate the non-deductible amount for 2006 to be approximately $654,000, which will result in increased taxes of approximately $241,000. \b \u001d  The Company has also recorded $101,230 of income tax benefit in its Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2006 and in its Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2006 to recognize deferred income tax assets on stock-based compensation relating to unexercised stock options. This amount is not included in the tables above because it is a fourth quarter 2006 estimate, and not part of the restatement. \b \u001d  Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code provides that option holders with options granted with a below-market exercise price, to the extent the options were not vested as of December 31, 2004, may be subject to adverse Federal income tax consequences. Holders of these options will likely be required to recognize taxable income at the date of vesting for those options vesting after December 31, 2004, rather than upon exercise, on the difference between the amount of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of vesting and the exercise price, plus an additional 20 percent penalty tax and interest on any income tax to be paid. To the extent this process is available to affected employees, the Company has decided to follow the IRS Settlement Offer issued in February 2007 to pay penalty and interest, estimated at approximately $46,000, to the IRS on behalf of the employees and potentially gross-up employees for tax costs. The IRS offer only applies to option exercises by rank and file employees in 2006. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:47 ET (19:47 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"609ce311e70e48e2184b54df01d230f8","symR":["IMAX","IMX.T","CA45245E1097"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Imax In Forbearance Pact With Senior Note Holder >IMAX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T10:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IMAX","IMX.T","CA45245E1097"],"IndustryCodes":["RCS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Imax Corp.

The NDA for Torisel originally was submitted on October 5, 2006 and was granted priority review status.  As part of the ongoing review, Wyeth recently submitted additional information on tumor evaluation, as requested by the FDA.  On April 5, 2007, the FDA confirmed that as a result of this amendment, the action date for the NDA has been extended by three months, to July 2007, to allow the agency time to complete a full review of these analyses. \b \u001d  Renal cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 85 percent of kidney cancers.  The American Cancer Society estimates that 51,190 new cases of kidney cancer will be diagnosed this year, and more than 40 percent of patients will be diagnosed initially with advanced disease. \b \u001d  The pivotal study of Torisel showed that in patients with advanced RCC and poor prognostic features who had received no prior systemic therapy, Torisel significantly increased median overall survival, the primary endpoint, by 49 percent compared with interferon-alpha, an active comparator that has been the clinical standard of care.  The most common adverse events (incidence greater than or equal to 30 percent) in patients treated with Torisel or with interferon-alpha were asthenia (weakness), rash, anemia, edema, nausea and anorexia (loss of appetite). \b \u001d  \"We are encouraged by the review process so far, and, with the submission of these analyses, we remain optimistic about the prospects for strengthening the product labeling for launch in the third quarter of 2007,\" says Robert R. Ruffolo, Jr., Ph.D., President, Wyeth Research, and Senior Vice President, Wyeth.  \"We believe that Torisel has shown the potential in clinical trials to be an important therapeutic option for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.\" \b \b    About Torisel \b \u001d  Torisel was designed to inhibit the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) kinase, a protein within all cells that regulates cell proliferation, cell growth and cell survival.  If approved, Torisel will be the first mTOR inhibitor for the treatment of a cancer. \b \u001d  During the extended review period, Wyeth will continue to make Torisel available in the United States to patients who meet certain criteria through an Expanded Access Program (EAP).

(CAO) said it was unable to file its form 10K for the fiscal year ended Feb. 4 on time because \"substantial\" resources have been devoted to the restatements and completion of its form 10K for the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, 2006. \u001d  The Phoenix automotive parts and accessories retailer said it expects to file its 2005 amended quarterly reports as well as its 2006 annual and quarterly reports as soon as possible. \u001d  CSK said its 2006 cash flow was hurt by the restatement cost, the audit committee's accounting investigation and the restructuring of a majority of its debt at higher rates. \u001d  In fiscal 2006, the company paid about $26 million in fees for attorneys, accountants and consultants for services related to the restatement process and the accounting investigation, related securities litigation and the SEC investigation. \u001d  The company announced previously the financial statements for each of its fiscal years of 2003 and 2004, selected consolidated financial data for each of the four fiscal years ended Jan. 30, 2005 and interim financial information for each of its quarters in fiscal 2004 and for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 should be restated. \u001d  Later, giving details in a late-notification filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, CSK Auto said the refinancing of its debt \"significantly\" increased its interest cost on borrowed money for the fiscal year ended Jan. 29. The auto-parts retailer had to refinance its debt last July because of its inability to file its fiscal 2005 annual report on time. \u001d  As part of its refinancing, CSK Auto repurchased $225 million of its 7% notes and paid $100 million of its 3.375% exchangeable notes with borrowings from a new term loan facility, the company said. \u001d  The interest rate under the term loan facility was 8.375% at Feb. 4. In connection with the repurchase of the 7% notes, CSK Auto also paid $11.1 million to terminate an interest rate swap agreement intended to hedge the fair value of $100 million of the 7% notes. \u001d  Separately, CSK Auto said it opened 55 net new stores in fiscal 2006, compared with 27 in fiscal 2005. \u001d  -Veronica Dagher; 201-938-5400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \u001d  -Jared A.

Meanwhile, MainStay 130/30 Growth's objective is to seek long-term growth of capital, the SEC filing said. \u001d  Generally, each fund will hold long positions equal to 130% of the fund's equity assets and short positions equal to 30% of the fund's equity assets. \u001d  A long position is the state of actually owning a security, contract, or commodity. A short position is borrowing a security or commodity futures contract from a broker and selling it, with the understanding that it must later be bought back - hopefully at a lower price - and returned to the broker. \u001d  For the MainStay 130/30 Core Fund, New York Life Investment said it will invest in common stock and will take long positions in companies that it considers to have a high probability of outperforming the Russell 1000 Index over the next 6 to 12 months. \u001d  For the MainStay 130/30 Growth Fund, the investment adviser said it will invest mainly in large- and mid-capitalization stocks. For long positions, it will seek to identify companies that have a high chance of outperforming the Russell 1000 Growth Index over the long term. \u001d  New York Life Investment said for the MainStay 130/30 International Fund it will invest mainly in equity securities of foreign companies with attractive valuations and \"strong momentum characteristics.\" It said the proposed fund may invest in equity securities of companies that trade in emerging or developing markets with significant investments in at least three countries outside of the U.S. \u001d  The investment adviser said for long positions, it will seek to identify companies that are considered to have a high chance of providing a total return greater than the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia and Far East Index, or MSCI-EAFE Index. \u001d  According to the SEC filing, New York Life Investment plans to offer Class A, C and I shares for each new fund. \u001d  The maximum sales charge for the Class A shares of each fund is 5.5%, where there's no maximum sales charge for the Class C and I shares of each fund, New York Life Investment said. \u001d  The investment adviser didn't disclose the management fee for the class of shares in each fund. \u001d  New York Life Investment said Harvey J.

The billionaire entertainment mogul David Geffen and newsman Anderson Cooper head the list.  Chat show host Ellen DeGeneres, philanthropist Tim Gill, and Massachusetts congressman Barney Frank round out the top five in the first-ever list of its kind. \b \u001d  Others who make the top 50 include personal finance guru Suze Orman (#13), Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner (#11), actress Jodie Foster (#43), and Superman Returns director Bryan Singer (#32). \b \u001d  \"We expect some controversy for creating this kind of list,\" said Aaron Hicklin, editor-in-chief of Out. \"But it's a mark of real progress that the vast majority of men and women who made our Power 50 have attained their positions without feeling the need to hide their sexuality.\" \b \u001d  Editorial staff began assembling the list at the beginning of the year, basing their rankings on each candidate's cultural resonance, political influence, media profile, and wealth. \"We took the task very seriously,\" said Hicklin. \"We wanted the list to reflect, as accurately as possible, the standing of the people on it.\" \b \b    Also in the May Issue: \b \u001d  ON THE COVER: Breaking with tradition, the May cover of Out, shot by Rodney Smith, features two models holding masks of Jodie Foster and Anderson Cooper in front of their faces, a sly commentary on the way that semi-closeted celebrities hide in plain sight. \b \u001d  For the cover story, writer Michael Musto explores the Glass Closet, in which he identifies a number of gay celebrities and public figures who, while living gay social lives, \"cagily avoid any on-the-record revelations, a delicate dance that's difficult to pull off.\" Musto challenges those such as Anderson Cooper, Jodie Foster and Will & Grace star Sean Hayes, who dance around the question rather than give a yes or no answer. \"It's true that stars are free to put up whatever walls they want in order to maintain boundaries with the public,\" he writes, \"But even at their most controlling, straight stars never seem to leave out the fact that they're straight in interviews. Whenever a subject tells me, 'I won't discuss who I'm dating' or 'I resent labels,' I generally know not so much that they're passionate about privacy but that they're gay, gay, gay.\" \b \u001d  ALSO: Congressman Barney Frank talks exclusively about being the highest ranking openly gay politician in America: \"I get exempted from a lot of the prejudice because I'm good at what I do.

Credit Facilities \bApproximately $2.5 Billion of Debt Securities Affected \b \u001d  New York, April 06, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service assigned new ratings to Delta Air Lines, Inc. (\"Delta\") debt, including a B2 corporate family rating, a Ba2 (LGD2, 19%) on the first lien facilities, and a B2 (LGD3, 46%) on the second lien facilities. Moody's also assigned a Speculative Grade Liquidity Assessment of SGL-2. The outlook is stable. Delta expects to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of April, 2007. \u001d  \"With the cost reduction achieved through the bankruptcy reorganization, the airline's extensive route network and initiatives to realign capacity for improved profitability, Delta is positioned to be an effective network carrier\", according to Moody's analyst George Godlin. The restructuring has significantly improved financial metrics. \u001d  Delta's operating costs following emergence from bankruptcy should be among the lowest of the network carriers, and permit the carrier to compete more effectively and better withstand ongoing industry challenges. Financial improvements through bankruptcy are projected to exceed $3 billion on an annualized basis and are likely to be sustainable. However, Moody's notes that the average age of Delta's fleet is more than 11 years, and the airline has only approximately 60 narrow body aircraft aircraft scheduled for delivery over the next several years. Consequently, maintenance expense is likely to increase as these aircraft age, and Delta is likely to incur significant capital expenditures over time to address the refleeting issue. \u001d  Delta's plans to improve cash flow through revenue growth could be more challenging, however. Delta has a number of initiatives to close the gap between its Revenue per Available Seat Mile (\"RASM\") and the average RASM for other network carriers. These include a focus on more origination and destination traffic (rather than lower margin connecting traffic), shifting capacity from domestic routes to the higher yielding international destinations and better matching aircraft gauge to route density. The operating environment, however, is expected to remain difficult given high fuel costs and intense competition on domestic routes from other mainline carriers as well as Low Cost Carriers (\"LCCs\"). In addition, other carriers have been shifting capacity to international routes, and the capacity could increase even more as the European carriers in particular take advantage of direct access to more US destinations under the open-skies legislation that is expected to become effective during 2008. \u001d  The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation that Delta's post-emergence cost structure, revenue growth strategies and adequate cash on hand will provide satisfactory flexibility to withstand some of the near term competitive challenges in the industry. In addition, Delta should generate strong free cash flow over the near term which will steadily improve key credit metrics including Retained Cash Flow to Debt, Debt to EBITDA and EBIT to Interest. Downward pressure on the ratings could occur if Delta's EBITDA margin declines lower than 15%, or if Debt to EBITDA (using Moody's standard adjustments) exceeds 7 times or EBIT to interest expense (using Moody's standard adjustments) falls below 1 times. Given rising fuel costs and medium term capital expenditures associated with refleeting, Delta's ratings could come under pressure if balance sheet liquidity or cash flow significantly declines from anticipated levels. The rating could be raised if internally-generated cash flow is sufficient to sustain EBIT to Interest (using Moody's standard adjustments) greater than 2 times and Retained Cash Flow to Debt greater than 15%. \u001d  The SGL-2 Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating reflects the expectation of good liquidity over the coming 12 months. Delta is likely to generate strong free cash flow over the near term and steadily add to its cash balance upon emergence from bankruptcy. Moody's expects Delta will remain in compliance with all of its covenants in the near term. The SGL rating also reflects the company's limited borrowing capacity, since substantially all of Delta's assets that currently secure Delta's DIP facility also currently serve as collateral for the post-emergence credit facility. Delta is expected to have approximately $2.8 billion in balance sheet cash and equivalents upon emergence from bankruptcy in April, 2007. \u001d  Up to $2.5 billion in exit financing consists of a first-lien revolving credit facility of $500 million, a first-lien term loan facility of $1 billion, and a second-lien term loan of $1 billion. These facilities will be guaranteed by Delta's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and collateralized by security interests in substantially all of Delta's assets that currently secure Delta's DIP facility including aircraft, spare parts, route authorities, real estate and unrestricted cash. Proceeds from the new financing will be used to repay approximately $2.0 billion of Delta's DIP loans, with the remainder available for working capital and general corporate purposes. \u001d  Assignments: \u001d  ..Issuer: Delta Air Lines, Inc. \u001d  ....Corporate Family Rating of B2 \u001d  ....Probability of Default Rating of B2 \u001d  ....First Lien Bank Revolving Credit Facility, Assigned a rating of Ba2, (LGD2, 19%) \u001d  ....First Lien Term Loan, Assigned a rating of Ba2, (LGD2, 19%) \u001d  ....Second Lien Term Loan, Assigned a rating of B2, (LGD3, 46%) \u001d  ....Speculative Grade Liquidity Assessment of SGL-2. \u001d  Delta Air Lines, Inc., a major airline that provides scheduled passenger service throughout North America, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia, is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 10:32 ET (14:32 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"6fbf8884e7962f9d6318596713ae74d7","symR":["INDB"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Dir TEDESCHI Acquires 1,000 Of INDEPENDENT BANK CORP (MASS) >INDB","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T17:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["INDB"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: INDEPENDENT BANK CORP (MASS) \bSYMBOL: INDB \b \bFILER: TEDESCHI BRIAN S \bTITLE: Director \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/5/07             Exercise*                 1,000      $10.25         $10,250 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 35,818 (Direct)  1,200 (Indirect) \b \b  * - Exercised 10 days before expiration. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

In the wake of the Big Board's embrace of technology, about one-quarter of the 3,700 or so traders and others who used to work the floor have had to look elsewhere for employment, leaving a tangle of wires where computers and humans used to be. \u001d  That wasn't the ideal setting for exchange executives to welcome their new European merger partners at the ringing of the 4 p.m. bell on Wednesday. \u001d  But the NYSE was ready: In the days leading up to the big event, it installed flat-panel monitors at some of the idle workstations -- giving the appearance of hustle and bustle on the floor. Big Board officials also handed out ceremonial cowbells to employees. \u001d  There was good reason to expect trouble. Back in March 2006, when the NYSE bought electronic exchange operator Archipelago Holdings Inc., floor traders -- some of whom would lose their jobs as a result of the new technology -- booed loudly. Mr. Thain managed to keep smiling. The traders' boos drowned out the jingling of dainty silvery bells that the NYSE had distributed as souvenirs beforehand. \u001d  This time around, loud, low-register cowbells helped to mute the traders' booing. The bells even prompted some to conclude that the brokers were having a little fun: Some observers thought they heard traders utter \"moo\" rather than \"boo,\" which seemed to fit the barnyardlike tone of the event. \u001d  The floor brokers, meanwhile, were prepared with their own prop. Earlier in the day, they had constructed a dummy trader -- described as having a round pita-bread face and sporting a jacket and tie -- and set him up at one of the \"fake\" workstations, as they were referred to by some traders. \u001d  \"If you're going to be phony, we'll go along with your gag and make it even more ridiculous,\" said Warren Meyers, a longtime floor broker who saw the fake trader being assembled but didn't participate in its creation. \"There are some obvious barren spots where people have left. It looks embarrassing, so they [the NYSE] put some computers in.\" \u001d  Big Board officials quickly banished the dummy from the floor, traders say. But not before the fake clerk was snapped by at least one cellphone camera. In the end, it didn't mar the closing-bell ceremony, which was attended by scores of Euronext executives and other bigwigs from Europe and elsewhere. Among them: Jan-Michiel Hessels, chairman of the newly formed NYSE Euronext entity, and NYSE board member Bill Ford of private equity firm General Atlantic LLC. \u001d  A Big Board spokesman offered an explanation for the new monitors that the traders considered to be props. \"We're continually upgrading conditions on the trading floor,\" he said. \u001d  The episode highlights the increasingly emotional rift between floor traders and NYSE Euronext's management and shareholders. The floor traders long held exalted status at the Big Board. But big investors have pressed in recent years for more electronic trading, which advocates say is faster, cheaper and less vulnerable to cheating by dishonest floor traders. \u001d  Now some floor veterans, many from families that have worked at the Big Board for generations, are taking their bitterness out on Mr. Thain, one of the leading advocates of electronic trading. He recently allowed the exchange to shut one of its five trading rooms. \u001d  The resentment is most evident at the ringing of the NYSE's famous bell, which is televised live every day when trading opens at 9:30 a.m. and closes at 4 p.m. Every day, different honored guests are invited to ring the bells -- frequently chief executives of companies on the first day their stock trades. When the exchange has big news of its own, Mr. Thain sometimes takes to the podium with key associates to ring the bell himself. \u001d  In the hours before Wednesday's event, NYSE officials asked brokers to refrain from booing, a trader said. Many refused to comply, but the cowbells were much louder, and the clanging made the boos all but inaudible. \u001d  Some brokers suspected that the cowbells served another purpose: To deliberately make exchange guests and TV viewers think they were making \"moo\" cow sounds -- which, though strange, presumably don't bear the negative associations of rowdy boos. If so, the ruse worked: During the event, a CNBC reporter informed viewers that traders were mooing. \u001d  \"This is not booing, this is mooing like a cow,\" said CNBC on-air reporter Dylan Ratigan. \u001d  An NYSE spokesman said using the cowbells was \"consistent with past merger celebrations\" and that the exchange also decorated the exchange with international flags and had a large celebration in Paris. \u001d  For much of the 214-year-old exchange's history, the trading floor was the driving force of American capitalism and served as a powerful marketing tool for the NYSE, which offered tours to tourists and presidents alike and provided access to filmmakers, spreading the image world-wide. \u001d  \"I think the floor is a fantastic icon and a fantastic symbol,\" said Mr. Hessels. \"I personally hope it will be around for a long time.\" \u001d  The reduction in the size of the floor is just the latest change for the NYSE, once a members-only, not-for-profit organization which is now a publicly traded company owned by shareholders. In recent years it has closed its storied Luncheon Club, where famous types from Jack Bouvier to Dick Grasso held court, though a smaller version of the club recently reopened. It has also eliminated services such as a coat-check valet as well as an in-house barber. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6fe95ecd9d695abfced1084fda63b8dc","symR":["ARG"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Fred Manley Named President of Airgas East","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ARG"],"IndustryCodes":["CHC","CHM","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\bRADNOR, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 06, 2007-- \u001d  Airgas, Inc., (NYSE:ARG) today announced that Frederick E.

(FDC) for $29 billion, the people close to the situation said. \u001d  Industrial companies, especially competitors, haven't been invited to bid for Atos, which means the company will withhold its books from them, the people close to the situation said Friday. \u001d  Atos Origin last week said it was exploring \"strategic options\" after receiving expressions of interest from potential bidders, confirming an earlier Dow Jones Newswires story. Rothschild and Goldman Sachs (GS) are advising on the review. \u001d  People close to the situation had previously told Dow Jones Newswires that Permira, supported by Atos' largest shareholder - U.K. activist hedge fund Centaurus - could offer EUR58 a share for Atos after due diligence. Atos shares closed up 5.6% at EUR53 Thursday on takeover sentiment. The French market was closed Friday. \u001d  Atos wants a private-equity buyer who will agree to keep the company intact and allow management to pursue its current strategy, people close to the matter have said. \u001d  An industrial group might be able to offer the best price because it could generate synergies out of the deal. However, the most likely industrial buyers might want to shed parts of Atos, people close to the situation have also said. \u001d  Atos' activities consist of technology outsourcing, IT consulting, systems integration and niche businesses such as payment systems, and trading and financial software. \u001d  Atos'French rival, Capgemini (12533.FR) was reported Friday in the French press to be mulling a bid. But sources said Capgemini has been excluded from the authorized bidding process. A spokeswoman for Capgemini declined to comment. \u001d  There is nothing to prevent Capgemini or another industrial buyer from launching an unsolicited bid for Atos. However, hostile bids in the IT sector are rare, and analysts reckon they are difficult in a business in which much of a company's value is in human expertise. \u001d  Last summer, Atos warned of a slowdown in revenue, especially in the U.K. The company in January detailed a three-year restructuring plan. \u001d  Difficulties have hit Atos' share price, fueling repeated speculation that the company would receive a bid. \u001d  Both U.S. computer group Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and private-equity fund Blackstone Group have considered taking Atos private, people have said. \u001d  A spokeswoman for Atos declined to comment. Spokespeople for Permira, Eurazeo and Cinven declined to comment.

(GOOG) having a more dominant share of the Internet search market than comScore has been reporting, according to a financial analyst. \u001d  ComScore worldwide search stats are based on Internet traffic in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. Sometime this month, comScore's going to add Web use in Asian countries, thus changing its influential rankings of top Internet properties and other data it sells to hundreds of companies, according to Thomas Weisel Partners analyst Christa Quarles. \u001d  One change after comScore taps into Asia's 400 million Internet users is a more dominant Google, Quarles believes. ComScore is now reporting that in February, 73.8% of the Internet searching done outside the United States used a Google search engine; Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) ranked second, with 19.5%. \u001d  Quarles doesn't speculate about how much bigger Google's lead may get. She cited the new comScore numbers to come in a recent note to clients. \u001d  \"The (comScore) data is slated to include more Asian countries and, given the early read, will likely show Google has an even larger query share than the current data set indicates,\" Quarles said, in the note. \u001d  ComScore's in the midst of an initial public offering, choosing to trade under the symbol SCOR. The expanded international Internet search reporting helps comScore fend off criticism that its data is incomplete, and skews toward Europe and North America, Quarles adds. \u001d  A comScore spokesman said the company had no comment about speculation concerning products that may be in the works. \u001d  -Ben Charny; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:53 ET (16:53 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"74f95ba249f662c206a6811172301aa3","symR":["LCAPA"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Liberty Media Hldg: Tender Offer Oversubscribed","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LCAPA"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 09:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7518fee2b50d60de4ec7fd2868d6bd3e","symR":["CFDAY","HUW.XX","JKG.XX"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Firm's Demise Sends Bankruptcy Lawyers To Hunton & Williams","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T14:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CFDAY","HUW.XX","JKG.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC"],"Story":"\b \b   By Erika Lovley \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Six bankruptcy lawyers from Dallas-based Jenkens & Gilchrist LLC, which was forced out of business at the end of March in the aftermath of a tax-shelter scandal, are among 93 attorneys who have been picked up by Hunton & Williams LLP. \u001d  Partners Lawrence Chek, Michael S. Held, Gregory G. Hesse, Andrew E. Jillson, Lynnette R. Warman and counsel Michelle A. Mendez joined the firm Monday, days after Jenkens shut its doors for good under a deal reached with federal prosecutors. \u001d  \"None of us really anticipated what happened with the firm - it was kind of a surprise,\" said Warman, who spent 19 years at Jenkens. \"I'm extremely glad we were able to move to Hunton. I have very high expectations and it was a high move for everyone involved.\" \u001d  The jobs of nearly 600 lawyers were affected by the marketing of illegal tax shelters in Jenkens' Chicago office, which led to the closing of the entire firm. Jenkens, which had offices around the country, collapsed under the pressure of an Internal Revenue Service investigation, a $76 million federal fine and countless client lawsuits. \u001d  Hunton hired the 93 former Jenkens attorneys to widen its footprint in a variety of practices, including tax, real estate, and financial services. \u001d  The new bankruptcy hires began their work Monday in the firm's Dallas office, bringing Hunton's bankruptcy and restructuring headcount to 28. The firm's restructuring practice serves a range of businesses, from middle-market companies to major corporations. \u001d  \"I think they will fit into our firm and our practice beautifully. They are top-quality people,\" said Benjamin C. Ackerly, co-head of Hunton's restructuring practice. \u001d  The six new hires are part of Hunton & Williams' strategy to expand its bankruptcy practice in the next year. Restructuring industry experts are forecasting a significant rise in filings, spurred by the high rate of home foreclosures and rising interest rates. \u001d  \"You read all that and wonder if it's going to be a lot less than a soft landing,\" said Hunton managing partner Walfrido J. Martinez. \"But these are all highly credentialed people who have worked on significant and interesting bankruptcy matters across several industries.\" \u001d  Warman said she's looking forward to working with lawyers in Hunton's New York office, which she hopes will provide opportunities to work on major corporate bankruptcy cases. She's currently representing a pre-bankruptcy lender in the Chapter 11 case of Tanner & Haley Resorts. \u001d  \"Many of the large cases were filed between Delaware and New York,\" she said. \"The East Coast has had a lion's share of really large cases.\" \u001d  Several other bankruptcy lawyers are also considering joining the firm, Martinez said. The firm began talks with a few Jenkens & Gilchrist lawyers almost a year ago, and the number slowly grew. \u001d  The majority of the 93 former Jenkens & Gilchrist attorneys are joining the Dallas office, raising the office's headcount to 157 from 70. Hunton & Williams is planning to open a new Austin office and will announce the location of another consolidated office within the next few weeks. \u001d  \"Our strategic growth plan was to expand in Texas, so this was a great opportunity,\" said Hunton spokeswoman Cari Brunelle. \u001d  -Erika Lovley, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6615; erika.lovley@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 10:55 ET (14:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7519e766890463afa61e25d3dc8f87db","symR":["AHM","MTB"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: American Home Mortgage Cuts Views On Lower Loan Bids","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AHM","MTB"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Lingling Wei \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. (AHM), an investment trust specializing in prime and near-prime home loans, on Friday sharply cut its first-quarter and full-year earnings forecasts, in another sign that the woes in the riskiest mortgage market are spreading. \u001d  Like other independent, nonbank mortgage companies that heavily depend on Wall Street and yield-hunting institutional investors for profits, the Melville, N.Y., company said it saw \"far fewer buyers offering materially lower prices\" last month in the markets for loan pools and for mortgage-backed bonds. Those changes, said Chief Executive Michael Strauss, reduced the amount it earned from loan sales and forced the company to write down the value of certain mortgage assets. \u001d  American Home now expects to earn between 40 cents and 60 cents a share in the first quarter, compared with the $1.11-$1.17 range it projected in January. For 2007, it forecasts earnings of $3.75 to $4.25 a share, down from its previous view of $5.40 to $5.70. The company also said it is cutting its quarterly dividend to 70 cents from $1.12. \u001d  The list of companies reporting problems with loan sales is growing. Just a week ago, M&T Bank Corp. (MTB), in which Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKA, BRKB) is a big investor, said it was having trouble selling certain near-prime mortgage loans. Instead, the Buffalo, N.Y., bank said it would keep the loans on its books, a move that could knock about $7 million off its first-quarter earnings. \u001d  Worried about rising past-due loans, investment banks that buy and repackage mortgages into securities have retreated from what had been one of the fastest-growing businesses on Wall Street since the late 1990s. The issuance of securities backed by loans to people with tarnished credit records has plunged. And there is growing evidence that the subprime meltdown is spilling over to the markets for loans boasting higher credit quality. \u001d  Last year, American Home made $58.9 billion in loans to about 196,000 borrowers with weighted-average FICO score of 716, including so-called Alt-A borrowers whose credit records are deemed good-enough to forgo proof of their claimed income or assets. In addition to lower secondary-market demand for its loans, the company also blamed high delinquency rates and the resulting greater loan-loss reserves for its reduced earnings forecasts. \u001d  American Home said \"a disproportionate share\" of its nonperforming loans consists of Alt-A mortgages it was forced to buy back due to early defaults or other reasons. The company said it has stopped offering loans that have resulted in \"a high proportion\" of repurchases and expects the charge stemming from loan buybacks to diminish toward the end of the year. \u001d  \"While the (secondary) market may recover, and while we will attempt to restore our gain on sale margins by raising interest rates charged to consumers,\" Strauss said, \"our working assumption must be that current market conditions will persist and that our gain on sale margins will not recover through the balance of the year.\" \u001d  - By Lingling Wei, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2089; lingling.wei@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 14:07 ET (18:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"752f8a2745556dd88a4049e584a7248a","symR":["PLUS"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"EPlus Gets Nasdaq Delisting Notice For Not Holding Annual Mtg","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T12:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PLUS"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  EPlus Inc.

The TV network plans to launch a social network in June on its website, giving fans of \"Heroes\" and \"The Office\" a place to gather. That'll keep them on NBC's website, rather than on fan sites or, Lord forbid, YouTube. The network has a link on its homepage (\"Social Networking - Coming Soon\") promoting the service, lostremote.com notes, which will feature blogs, groups, widgets, profiles and \"friends\" - we assume they're not talking about Courtney Cox or David Schwimmer.

Court says VG can continue to service its existing customers, but can't sign up new ones. VG seems pretty aghast - they plan an immediate appeal - and it's easy to see why. Because it's hard to see how a company hemorrhaging money can survive long without new customers. (PJV) \u001d  11:18 (Dow Jones) Near-term federal funds futures look to close modestly lower, mimicking the losses in other rate-futures contracts as a strong payrolls report suggests a near-term rate cut from the Fed isn't likely. Market widely expects the FOMC to keep its rate unchanged at 5.25% for a seventh straight meeting on May 9. The July fed funds contract recently down 2 BP at 94.78 in late electronic trading, showing a 12% chance for a rate cut to 5% at the June 27-28 FOMC meeting. (JLT) \u001d  11:15 (Dow Jones) Treasury futures prices continue to trend near their new session lows near the end of trading. Prices shot lower early following the strong gain in March payrolls and never recover. June 10-year note contract sets a new 1-1/4 month low. In pit trading, contract settles down 18/32 at 107-12+. June 30-year bond contract sets a new 1-1/2 month low. At the end of pit trading, contract settles down 23/32 at 110-10.

Shortly after the open, prices plummeted on the strong gain in the March payrolls report. The Sept Eurodollar contract prices in a 72% chance for a rate cut to 5% in the 3Q. Contract down 9 BP at 94.78 in late trading. The Dec contract remains fully priced for a 5% rate by year's end, and shows a 36% chance of a 4.75% rate. Contract down 13 BP at 94.94 in late trading.

The index stayed securely in positive territory relative to its 52-week moving average. On that basis, the index was up by 3.9% after a recent peak 4.8% increase in the week ended Jan. 26. This measure is favored by ECRI as a leading indicator and except for a 15-week interruption when it was unchanged or in negative territory last summer has been in positive territory since June 2005. The recent move back into positive territory and suggests some pick up in the economy later this year after a pronounced slowdown in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2006. (JJM) \u001d  10:17 (Dow Jones) The dollar has extended its gains made on the back of a better-than-expected March employment report, hitting a fresh intra-day high against the yen at Y119.39 and pushing the euro to a fresh low at $1.3367. Meanwhile, Feb wholesale inventories were in line with expectations, also helping dollar sentiment. Lately, the euro was at $1.3370 from $1.3429 late Thursday, while dollar was changing hands at Y119.37 from Y118.68 late Thursday, according to EBS. (ILD) \u001d  10:09 (Dow Jones) Wholesale inventories rose by 0.5% in February after a downward-revised 0.6% gain in January (had been up 0.7%) even as sales rose by 1.2%, so, it's very unlikely that this was an unintended pileup. Could boost GDP estimates. Also, since wholesale inventories contain a lot of imports, this could point to a widening in the trade deficit, due to be reported next Friday. (JJM) \u001d  10:03 (Dow Jones) Rick Klingman, head of Treasury trading at ABN Amro in New York, said \"all the bids dropped with about thirty seconds to go\" before payrolls but he \"didn't see any volume trade on lower prices.\" (LPN) \u001d  9:55 (Dow Jones) It looks like Credit Suisse Group is renewing the bonds of friendship with two of its former executives, David Matlin and Mark Patterson, who left the bank in 2002 to start their own distressed buyout shop. Three years ago, Credit Suisse declined to invest in a $1.7B fund MatlinPatterson was raising, even though the bank had contributed a $450M to MatlinPatterson's first fund. But MatlinPatterson now seems to be letting bygones be bygones. As it prepares to close its newest fund, which is expected to attract $4.5B - a huge sum for funds that invest in ailing companies - the firm is once again counting Credit Suisse among its investors, people close to the situation said. (TT) \u001d  (http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/) \u001d  9:42 (Dow Jones) The ECRI index designed to anticipate cyclical turning points in inflation edged up in March, but remains in a longer downtrend since reaching a peak in October 2005. The smoothed version of the annualized growth rate stayed in negative territory in March at a negative reading of 3.1% from a downward-revised negative reading of 3.6% in February (had been down 3.3%). ECRI said that its Future Inflation Gauge edged up to 118.6 in March from a downward-revised 118.5 (had been 118.7).

(NWACQ) is undervaluing its assets as it moves toward its exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. \u001d  Judge Allan L. Gropper of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan on Thursday approved Harvey Tepner, an investment banker who specializes in corporate restructurings, to probe the shareholder group's claims. \u001d  Tepner, of New York investment banking firm Compass Advisors LLP, served as the financial adviser to the official committee of unsecured creditors in the Chapter 11 case of ATA Airline's parent ATA Holdings Corp. According to court papers, he charges $650 per hour for his services. \u001d  Tepner, who has \"extensive experience in bankruptcy and reorganization proceedings,\" has until May 14 to deliver his report. Gropper ordered that the examination not delay Northwest's Chapter 11 plan confirmation process. The company is slated to seek approval of the plan at a May 16 hearing. \u001d  Gropper ordered an examiner be appointed in the case last month at the request of an ad hoc committee of Northwest shareholders, who claimed the airline didn't \"canvass the market for potential buyers to get the highest and best price.\" \u001d  The shareholder group, which includes a number of hedge funds, are opposing Northwest's plan to raise $750 million through a rights offering to fund its bankruptcy exit. The shareholder group has also accused Northwest of concealing plans for a post-bankruptcy merger with Delta Air Lines Inc. (DALRQ). \u001d  Gropper, however, directed the examiner to investigate whether Northwest \"used customary and appropriate processes and procedures to value\" its assets. His order outlining the scope of the investigation is silent on the merger allegations. \u001d  Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest has called the hedge funds' merger claims \"entirely baseless.\" The company, which sought Chapter 11 protection in September 2005, said it will exit bankruptcy as a standalone carrier. \u001d  Northwest's Chapter 11 reorganization plan calls for its unsecured creditors to swap debt for new stock in the company, a move that would give the creditors a stake of at least 90% in the reorganized company. The creditors would also get to participate in a $750 million rights offering underwritten by JP Morgan Securities. \u001d  -Marie Beaudette, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1354; marie.beaudette@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 16:14 ET (20:14 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7a6c3f7c2737b9434e0848561628196e","symR":["GSPBEX.RS","RU0007661625"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Russian Minister Rules Out Gas OPEC At Doha","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T13:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GSPBEX.RS","RU0007661625"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  (Updates item published at 1103 GMT with comments from minister Khristenko.) \b   MOSCOW (Dow Jones)--Russian Minister of Industry and Energy Viktor Khristenko said Friday that a cartel for natural gas similar to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries won't be established next week when representatives of the worlds' 14 largest gas producing countries meet for talks in Doha, Qatar. \u001d  Instead, the members of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum will seek ways to improve transparency and stability in gas markets by facilitating market research and by improving communication between gas producers and consumers, Khristenko said. \u001d  Khristenko said concerns the group could mimic OPEC's efforts to regulate prices by restricting supply were unfounded, although he added the group would seek to improve coordination and cooperation between member states. \u001d  \"Does this mean we are going to sign a cartel agreement? Absolutely not,\" Khristenko said. \"We are not organizing against anyone, we're not going to do anyone any harm.\" \u001d  Some members of the GECF, most notably Iran, are openly calling for the eventual creation of a natural gas version of OPEC. Analysts have said that forming a producers' cartel for gas would be more difficult than for oil due to the nature of the gas market, which is based on long-term contracts.   Khristenko will attend the Doha meeting with a delegation of officials from Russian natural gas monopoly OAO Gazprom (GSPBEX.RS), including Chief Executive Alexei Miller and head of exports Alexander Medvedev.   Khristenko said he wasn't aware of any plans for deals to be struck on the corporate level at the forum, despite Gazprom's attendance.    Talk of a potential 'gas OPEC' follows mounting concern in Europe and the U.S. that Russia has shown a willingness to use its enormous energy resources as a political tool. Russia has denied that charge, however, maintaining energy pricing disputes with its neighbors are the upshot of a drawn-out transition to market principles from Soviet-legacy barter arrangements. \u001d  \"It is useful to some people to paint us as a monster,\" Khristenko said. \b \u001d  -By Greg Walters, Dow Jones Newswires; (+7 495) 974 8055; greg.walters@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 09:17 ET (13:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7b4309a032faa16e22f9f79a28424c13","symR":["CMC"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Commercial Metals Bids $28M To Buy Second Croatian Mill","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T16:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CMC"],"IndustryCodes":["STL","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:40 ET (16:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7b8d4356a601b3d2b839d681db017ee1","symR":["FCL"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Foundation Coal Affiliates In Talks With United Mine Workers","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FCL"],"IndustryCodes":["COA","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 14:26 ET (18:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7b9dcc6f325e90360a1289a0cd38ab38","symR":["AEC"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP SHANNON Surrenders 3,111 Of ASSOCIATED ESTATES REALTY CORP >AEC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T19:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AEC"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: ASSOCIATED ESTATES REALTY CORP \bSYMBOL: AEC \b \bFILER: SHANNON JOHN T \bTITLE: Vice President \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/5/07             Surrender*                3,111      $14.79         $46,012 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 55,625 (Direct) \b \b  * - Insiders can surrender shares back to the company to pay taxes or cover \b      the cost of an option exercise. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

Also, Unitrin benefits from the financial flexibility and operational support from Unitrin Inc., which maintains moderate financial leverage and solid fixed-charge coverage. \b \u001d  Negative rating factors include Unitrin's significant underwriting losses in the earlier years, which were attributable to inadequate rates and weather related losses, and exposure to market risk and potential volatility in surplus balances because of the group's large, concentrated common stock portfolio. However, the group's operating results improved in recent years, primarily due to corrective actions that were implemented by management and firm market conditions. \b \u001d  The ratings of the life/health career agent subsidiaries reflect their strategic role within the Unitrin, Inc. organization, strong niche presence in the home service life insurance market, well established career agency force and favorable operating performance. Furthermore, A.M. Best believes that the risk-adjusted capitalization of the three life/health subsidiaries, both on a combined and stand-alone basis, remains sufficient despite large dividend payments made to Unitrin, Inc. over the last several years. \b \u001d  Partially offsetting these positive rating factors is A.M. Best's belief that the life/health subsidiaries may be challenged to sustain premium growth and operating performance given the limited growth potential in the mature home service market and to sustain historical levels of earnings given the reduced levels of invested assets and the continuing low interest rate environment. \b \u001d  The rating actions on RNIC reflect its improved accident and health premium trends, favorable operating performance and adequate stand-alone risk-adjusted capitalization. Partially offsetting these positive rating factors is the challenge for RNIC to sustain its operating performance given its limited business profile marketing accident and health insurance products and Medicare supplement insurance to individuals and small business owners living in rural areas. \b \u001d  For a complete list of Unitrin, Inc.'s FSRs, ICRs and debt ratings, visit www.ambest.com/press/040601unitrin.pdf. \b \u001d  Founded in 1899, A.M.

This mine reconnaissance capability will allow a naval Strike Group Commander to quickly and safely assess the threat of mines in prospective areas of operations. \b \u001d  In 2005, the Naval Sea Systems Command awarded Lockheed Martin a low-rate initial production contract for three RMVs. In 2006, a contract for four more RMVs was awarded. Total contract value is $118 million.  The RMV is produced at Lockheed Martin's Riviera Beach, FL facility. \b \u001d  The RMV is the integral mobile subsystem of the Navy's AN/WLD-1 Remote Minehunting System (RMS).  The RMS includes the RMV, a launch and retrieval system for the RMV, the RMV-towed sonar sensor, advanced communications equipment and software that integrates RMS into the host ship's combat system. \b \u001d  The RMV is one component of the RMS which is currently installed on USS Bainbridge (DDG 96).  The RMS completed an operational assessment in the summer of 2006 and a technical evaluation in March 2007.  RMS is expected to conduct an Operational Evaluation in June of this year.  The RMS is scheduled for its first operational deployment aboard USS Bainbridge in late 2007. \b \u001d  \"The Remote Minehunting System (RMS) introduces a critical mine countermeasure capability to our forward-deployed naval forces,\" said Captain Joe Spitz, Deputy Mine Warfare Program Manager, Program Executive Office Littoral and Mine Warfare.  \"Sailors now have an organic unmanned mine warfare system that will allow them to detect and classify mines from a safe distance. RMS allows the Navy to send a remotely operated vehicle into dangerous waters, keeping Sailors out of the minefield.\" \b \u001d  \"I am extremely proud of our Lockheed Martin and Navy team for successfully reaching this key milestone,\" said Fred P. Moosally, president of Lockheed Martin's Maritime Systems and Sensors business. \"It marks the delivery of a significant capability to the Navy that will help keep our sailors and ships out of harm's way. This technologically advanced product delivers a critical capability to the Strike Group Commander, which will result in improved battle space awareness.\" \b \u001d  Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed Martin employs about 140,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. \b \bSOURCE  Lockheed Martin \b \u001d    /CONTACT: Jack Papp, +1-571-451-9573, jack.papp@lmco.com; or Katherine Pangas, +1-561-494-2096, katherine.pangas@lmco.com, both of Lockheed Martin \b    /Web site: http://www.lockheedmartin.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:04 ET (15:04 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"82256a3fb5e986a2f9ce1b680c86679f","symR":["WLP","US94973V1070"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"VP LEWIS Surrenders 515 Of WELLPOINT INC >WLP","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T19:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WLP","US94973V1070"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: WELLPOINT INC \bSYMBOL: WLP \b \bFILER: LEWIS RANDALL J \bTITLE: Vice President \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/4/07             Surrender*                  515      $82.56         $42,518 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 30,986 (Direct) \b \b  * - Insiders can surrender shares back to the company to pay taxes or cover \b      the cost of an option exercise. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

Otherwise, shipyards might be forced to lay off workers as the Navy defers fleet maintenance. \u001d  President George W. Bush has threatened to veto any war funding bill that comes with a deadline for withdrawing troops from Iraq. So far, Congress hasn't flinched, setting the stage for what could be a protracted standoff. \u001d  If the Pentagon runs out of cash, the Navy faces tough decisions about what to halt, Krekich said. Some maintenance can be deferred temporarily, but other work has safety implications. \u001d  \"There is, however, a possibility, and certainly the probability is not zero, that there could be a catastrophic accident, a failure that could result in injury,\" Krekich told Dow Jones on the sidelines of this week's Navy League annual conference. \u001d  \"Hopefully, there are folks out there (who) will look at it and say nope, we'll the ship up, or you can't go anywhere until that thing's fixed,\" he said. \u001d  From a shipyard perspective, Krekich said it's too late to seek commercial contracts to tide over the workforce, because the yards already have committed to Navy work. But the Navy could escape the worst of a funding crunch if Congress asks promptly to rescue ground forces from similar budget worries. \u001d  \"When the Army starts getting hit, that may cause enough of a concern that they'll fix the issue,\" Krekich said. \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; Rebecca.Christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:04 ET (16:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"84017c502a6740d9852a797788201006","symR":["LMT","RTN","US5398301094","US7551115071"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Lockheed/Raytheon Venture Successfully Launches Attack Missile","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T16:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LMT","RTN","US5398301094","US7551115071"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","DFN","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:02 ET (16:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8424d9117901551e022c10d7796afd6c","symR":["HAL","US4062161017"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"COO LANE Surrenders 378 Of HALLIBURTON CO >HAL","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T16:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HAL","US4062161017"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: HALLIBURTON CO \bSYMBOL: HAL \b \bFILER: LANE ANDREW R \bTITLE: Chief Operating Officer \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/4/07             Surrender*                  378      $31.74         $11,998 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 255,673 (Direct) \b \b  * - Insiders can surrender shares back to the company to pay taxes or cover \b      the cost of an option exercise. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

(NYSE:A) and Stratagene Corporation (NASDAQ:STGN) today announced they have signed a definitive agreement for Agilent to acquire Stratagene. Stratagene is a developer, manufacturer and marketer of specialized life science research and diagnostic products. \b \u001d  Under the terms of the agreement, Stratagene will operate as a division within Agilent's Life Sciences Solutions Unit. Upon consummation of the transaction, each share of Stratagene common stock will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $10.94 per share, a 28% premium to Stratagene's closing share price of $8.51 on April 5, 2007. A special committee of Stratagene's independent directors received an opinion from its financial advisor, Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, that the $10.94 per share price is fair from a financial point of view to Stratagene's stockholders. \b \u001d  The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement, including approval by Stratagene stockholders of the merger and regulatory review. Stockholders representing approximately 59% of the outstanding common stock of Stratagene have agreed to vote in favor of the merger. The parties expect that the merger, which was unanimously approved by Stratagene's board of directors, will close in approximately 90 days. \b \u001d  Stratagene's products are used by scientists in academia, government research and industry in molecular biology, genomics, proteomics, drug discovery and toxicology. Stratagene's portfolio includes reagents for life science research and instruments. The company also offers a range of diagnostics products, including applications for allergy testing and urinalysis. \b \u001d  The acquisition of Stratagene is expected to broaden the customer base for both Agilent and Stratagene. \b \u001d  \"We see Stratagene's technology, products and expertise as being highly complementary to Agilent's life sciences portfolio, enabling us to offer our customers more complete workflow solutions,\" said Nick Roelofs, Vice President and General Manager of Agilent's Life Sciences Solutions Unit. \"Stratagene has a strong R&D team as well as excellent presence in the important academic and government markets.\" \b \u001d  Dr. Joseph A. Sorge, Chairman, CEO and founder of Stratagene and its largest stockholder also announced that he has formed a new company to pursue molecular diagnostic applications. The new company will purchase for $6.6 million certain assets of Stratagene from Agilent immediately following the close of the transaction and will license from Agilent certain of their molecular diagnostic technologies. Navigant Capital Advisors provided the special committee of Stratagene an appraisal of the assets to be purchased and technology to be licensed by the new company and such arrangements were unanimously approved by the special committee of Stratagene's Board of Directors. \b \u001d  \"I'm looking forward to having more time to focus on research and discovery and making a difference in human healthcare,\" said Dr. Sorge. \"Our discussions with Agilent have been very friendly and cooperative and we expect a smooth transition. I believe that we have established a relationship that will allow each of us to pursue common interests going forward.\" \b \u001d  Founded in 1984, Stratagene is based in La Jolla, Calif. The company employs more than 400 employees worldwide, who are expected to join Agilent. Major company locations are Garden Grove, Calif.; Cedar Creek, Texas; Edinburgh, Scotland; Tokyo, Japan; Amsterdam, the Netherlands; and Kassel, Germany. \b \u001d  In light of the signing of the merger agreement, Stratagene will not hold its 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Instead, Stratagene expects to hold a Special Meeting of Stockholders to vote upon the approval of the merger as soon as practicable. \b \u001d  The foregoing press release is being filed by Stratagene pursuant to Rule 14a-12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to the extent that it may be deemed to constitute a solicitation. In connection with the proposed merger, Stratagene will file proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a special meeting of stockholders to vote on the proposed merger. It is anticipated that the special meeting will be held within 90 days with the exact timing dependent on the completion of necessary filings. Stratagene's stockholders are not being asked to take any action at this time. Stockholders are urged to read the proxy statement and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC when they become available because they will contain important information about the merger. Stratagene will provide stockholders free copies of the proxy statement and other documents when they become available. In addition, documents filed by Stratagene with the SEC will be available free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Stratagene and its directors may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in connection with the proposed merger. Information regarding the identity of the persons who may, under SEC rules, be deemed participants in the solicitation of stockholders of Stratagene in connection with the proposed transaction, and their interests in the solicitation, will be set forth in a proxy statement that will be filed by Stratagene with the SEC. Stockholders of Stratagene can obtain this information by reading the proxy statement when it becomes available. \b \b   About Stratagene \b \u001d  Stratagene is a developer, manufacturer and marketer of specialized life science research and diagnostic products.

(THC), an urban hospital operator attempting a turnaround after several years of financial and legal troubles, remains in Wall Street's doghouse. \u001d  Some Tenet watchers, however, see glimmers of change. With a stable management team and signs of improvement in key areas, they say Tenet is taking baby steps toward a recovery that should take two or three years. \u001d  Tenet says it is building relationships with physicians and is earning high ratings on measures of clinical and service quality, important components of its push to attract more patients. \u001d  \"This is a long-term turnaround recommendation,\" said Sheryl Skolnick, senior vice president of broker-dealer CRT Capital Group, which has buy ratings on Tenet's stock and debt and a two-year price target of $9.50 on the shares. Tenet closed Wednesday at $6.61. \u001d  Skolnick is \"beginning to see some evidence of things being less bad\" operationally, signs of the \"beginnings of a turnaround.\" The long-time hospital analyst isn't accustomed to holding a contrarian bullish view. Unlike many others, she was \"kind of impressed\" with some of Tenet's fourth-quarter results. \u001d  Tenet shares are down 12% since late February, when the Dallas company posted a wider-than-expected loss, a spike in admissions of uninsured patients and a decline in total admissions. Analysts' ratings amount to a \"sell,\" according to Thomson Financial. That's after the stock declined 8.5% in 2006, underperforming its peers. \u001d  Skolnick noted, however, that Tenet posted an increase in admissions of managed-care patients in the fourth quarter, despite a decline in commercially insured admissions, and that total admissions were down by a smaller level than in recent periods. \u001d  Skolnick, who visited with management recently, thinks Tenet has found the right leadership to establish a proper culture at a company emerging from a string of lawsuits, investigations and settlements. She doesn't own Tenet shares and knows of no investment-banking relationship between CRT Capital and the company. \u001d  A.J. Rice, portfolio manager at health-care hedge fund Pomeroy Capital and former Merrill Lynch analyst, takes a similar view. His fund owns some Tenet bonds. \u001d  \"I think they're doing the right things, it just takes a long time to move a big battleship like this,\" Rice said. It probably will take two or three years before Tenet returns to industry profitability levels, longer than the six-month fix many equity investors would want, he said. \u001d  Comparing Tenet's valuation to that of its peers is difficult, said Skolnick, since Triad Hospitals Inc. (TRI) and Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH) share prices are skewed by Community's pending acquisition of Triad, and the three other companies generally operate in smaller cities and towns or rural areas. While Tenet trades at a higher multiple of price to 2006 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization than others, it has more room for profit growth, she said. \u001d  Tenet has struggled to regain its footing since a Medicare billing scandal in late 2002. The company abandoned a policy involving excessive pricing of care reimbursed by Medicare for \"outlier,\" or very ill patients. Its efforts to pull itself out of trouble have come during a difficult period for the industry. \u001d  Soft admissions and high levels of uncompensated care of uninsured patients have pressured hospital operators. Tenet's problems contributed to its declining patient volume, as physicians questioned its ability to make adequate investments, other facilities heightened competition and it engaged in tough negotiations with insurers. \b \b   The Hard Way \b \u001d  Management points to progress, including success in stabilizing the business after reaching a $900 million legal settlement with the Justice Department last year. The settlement resolved allegations Tenet engaged in billing practices to inflate payments from Medicare and that it provided kickbacks to physicians to refer Medicare patients; it made no finding of illegal behavior. \u001d  The company also cites its high-quality ratings from the government and an increase in the number of referrals from physicians it is courting. \u001d  \"The only winning strategy is to deliver high quality,\" President and Chief Executive Trevor Fetter said in an interview. \u001d  Tenet is investing in technology and equipment, sending representatives to meet with thousands of referring doctors, and in some markets is directly hiring doctors or establishing clinics or joint ventures with them. In the fourth quarter, when admissions declined 0.9%, Tenet saw a 3.7% increase in referrals from physicians it had visited. \u001d  Fetter tinges his enthusiasm with caution. \"It's hard to say where we are in our turnaround because the external environment has been so dynamic. ... I think we have made quite good progress in building a stronger company.\" \u001d  Since 2002, Tenet has changed management and sold hospitals. Tenet, one of the largest U.S. health-care chains, runs 55 core hospitals. \u001d  Fetter, who took his current posts in the wake of the scandal, told investors recently that Tenet's culture has changed. Physician Stephen Newman recently became chief operating officer and former Raytheon Co. (RTN) executive Biggs Porter entered as chief financial officer last year. \u001d  Ending the last government probe of the outlier scandal, Tenet this week agreed to a civil Securities and Exchange Commission penalty resolving allegations it failed to disclose earnings increases from 1999 to 2002 were fueled by the inflated charges. \u001d  Tenet says it made progress last year on almost every key financial measure. But regaining investor confidence may still be a tough sell.

(HKFIQ) has won a bankruptcy court's permission to continue going-out-of-business sales at 134 of its fabric stores. \u001d  Judge Brendan L. Shannon of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., who last month gave the company interim approval to conduct the sales, signed off on a final order Thursday. \u001d  Shannon also directed Hancock to set aside $165,000 for taxing agencies that had objected to the sales to the extent they would extinguish the agencies' secured liens for property taxes the company owed before it filed for Chapter 11 protection. \u001d  The judge didn't address in the final order, however, some of the objections raised by a slew of Hancock's landlords. \u001d  According to court papers, the landlords didn't want the sales to have a detrimental effect on them and their other shopping-center tenants. They wanted the court to set a date for the sales to conclude; Hancock's proposed sale guidelines don't fix such a date. Lengthy going-out-of-business sales tend to hurt shopping centers and other tenants, the landlords argued. \u001d  Hancock Fabrics filed for Chapter 11 protection on March 21, with an agreement in hand to ratify its existing $105 million loan with Wachovia Bank, and a term sheet for a second loan - for up to $17.5 million - from Ableco Finance LLP, the lending arm of private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. \u001d   Hancock, based in Baldwyn, Miss., currently operates about 400 retail stores, all but two of which are leased. \b \u001d  -Kristina Doss, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1344; kristina.doss@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:50 ET (16:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"880036d7ad8d1f3f314a67d6f0b10dea","symR":["CSCO","US17275R1023"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Cisco to Unveil Strategies for Delivering Highly Secure Wireless Guest Access","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T12:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CSCO","US17275R1023"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\u001d  SAN JOSE, CA -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 04/06/07 -- \b   Who:   Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) executives Chris Kozup and Scott Pope \b \bWhat:  Cisco(R) to present strategies for offering simple, business-wide \b       wireless guest access while maintaining the integrity of information \b       and security of corporate systems.

(VG) will not be able to seek new customers, calling into question its ability to survive in the long run. \u001d  It's a damaging result for Vonage. U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton imposed an immediate stay against Vonage, effectively preventing it from signing up new customers to its Internet-based telephone service. The company, however, will be able to provide service to its existing base of 2.2 million customers. \u001d  Hilton said he had weighed a number of factors in reaching his decision. These, he said, included whether a stay could in fact lead to Vonage's bankruptcy. He also said he had to evaluate how the public's interest would be affected and concluded that given the competitiveness of the telecommunications industry, there would be no impact either way. \u001d  According to Rebecca Arboghast, a telecommunications analyst with Stifel Nicolaus who was at the hearing, if the ruling is upheld, it will be difficult for Vonage to \"continue in a viable way.\" \u001d  Spokesmen for Verizon Communications (VZ) and Vonage weren't immediately available for comment. \u001d  Vonage's request for a stay of the injunction represented a near-last resort for the company, since a negative ruling would effectively shut down its Internet telephone business. The company is working on a way of developing a system that doesn't use Verizon patents, but it's unclear how much progress it has made in that avenue. \u001d  The Holmdel, N.J., Web phone service provider will appeal the original ruling that it had infringed on Verizon's patents, but the process could take more than a year. The quicker alternatives - a settlement or technology workaround - will take time and focus away from its core operation. \u001d  Still, the ruling is slightly better than the worst-case scenario of Vonage being forced to shut down its entire service. \"It seems like a relatively fair compromise under the law,\" said Mark Kesslen, a partner at law firm Lowenstein Sandler PC that focuses on intellectual property. \"But it hurts Vonage tremendously in a period where it's all about new client acquisition.\" \u001d  Verizon filed a brief Thursday pushing for the judge to deny Vonage's request. \"A stay of injunction would violate the fundamental purpose of a stay pending appeal: preservation of the status quo.\" \u001d  Hilton concluded Friday's proceedings by saying he would enter the injunction order this coming Thursday, which in effect means that the injunction would begin at that date. \u001d  Vonage was dealt a serious blow March 23 when Hilton said he would issue a permanent injunction against Vonage. Shares plunged 26% that day. The only saving grace at the time was the judge's decision to wait two weeks before entering the injunction, allowing for more time to decide on the stay request. \u001d  The decision came after a jury found Vonage had infringed on three patents controlled by Verizon. The patents relate to connecting Internet phone calls with the traditional phone network, call forwarding and the use of wireless fidelity, or wi-fi, technology. Verizon claimed it lost hundreds of thousands of customers to Vonage while it used Verizon's patents. \u001d  Under the original jury ruling, Vonage would have to pay $58 million in damages and pay a 5.5% royalty rate for the technology. Verizon had sought $197 million. \u001d  \"Verizon built a patent portfolio and is using it in an aggressive way to maintain and control its market share,\" Kesslen said. \b \b   A Bad Start \b \u001d  Vonage stumbled out of the gates with its initial public offering in May and has been hit with a myriad of problems. The company made a name for itself as the largest independent provider of Internet phone service, positioning itself as a low-cost alternative to the traditional phone companies. It, however, faces increasing competition from the cable providers, who have bundled their television service with a similar Web-based phone offering. The concern was partially the reason Vonage had to delay its IPO. \u001d  When Vonage did go public, it botched its IPO after offering shares to its customers, many of whom balked at paying for the stock they agreed to purchase. The company has been plagued by shareholder lawsuits and is still seeking compensation from its customers over the issue. \u001d  Those shareholders who stuck around saw nothing but grief from Vonage. After pricing at $17, the stock has continually hit all-time lows amid a barrage of negative news. Shares closed at $3.37 on Thursday. \u001d  In its most recently reported quarter, Vonage posted the weakest subscriber growth figure in two years. The company has eaten into some of the phone companies' subscriber base, but its impact is still minor. In 2006, Verizon lost 3.1 million residential phone customers, ending the year with a base of 27.8 million subscribers. \u001d  As a result of the anticipation over the decision, Vonage delayed filing its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission due to the uncertainty of the outcome at the time. \u001d  - By Roger Cheng, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2020; roger.cheng@dowjones.com \u001d  - By Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6637; corey.boles@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:33 ET (16:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8a428b6db882d9e580f51af374d34aa5","symR":["ECL"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Ecolab Schedules Webcast and Conference Call on April 24th","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T17:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ECL"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bST.

That's a sharp drop from the 14 straight quarters of double-digit percentage profit growth that preceded it. \u001d  Alcoa Inc. (AA) will be the first Dow Jones Industrial Average component to report results, on Tuesday. General Electric Co. (GE), another Dow component, releases its results on Friday, April 13. \u001d  While much of the expected profit-growth decline is attributed to tough year-ago comparisons, analysts have also been cutting estimates, citing a slower economy. More signs of sluggishness could take a toll on the stock market, which is already acting in a choppy fashion. \b \b   Strong Metals Prices Boost Alcoa \b \u001d  Wall Street will be watching Alcoa closely Tuesday, to see if its financial results justify its 13% gain as the top-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrials. The aluminum giant, which traditionally kicks off earnings season, is expected to log generally solid results amid strong metals prices. \u001d  Any Alcoa comments about the direction of second-quarter metals prices will be scrutinized as well. Some observers expect further price gains, based on low industry inventories and high demand from China. \b \b   GE May Shed Light On Subprime Woes \b \u001d  General Electric reports first-quarter results Friday, April 13. Wall Street will be looking for insight into issues such as the potential impact of the subprime mortgage meltdown on GE's consumer finance division, called GE Money, as well as the company's ongoing efforts to sell its flagging GE Plastics division. \u001d  Results for GE's NBC Universal unit, which showed early signs of a turnaround in the fourth quarter, also will garner plenty of attention. \b \b   Mild March Should Help Retailers \b \u001d  Major retail chains report March sales Thursday, April 12. Analysts say that balmier temperatures in March helped free pent-up demand for spring fashions after a bitterly cold February; and an earlier Easter this year pulled more Easter-related sales into March from April. Fresh fashion trends have helped put specialty-apparel retailers like American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO) and Limited Brands Inc. (LTD) on track to post high single-digit percentage gains in sales at stores open at least a year, says Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Thomas Filandro. \u001d  While Target Corp. (TGT) forecasts an 11% to 13% same-store sales gain for March, its outlook implies a decline for April, Deutsche Bank's Bill Dreher says. He expects Federated Department Stores Inc. (FD) and J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) to post lackluster numbers for April following a strong March. Many analysts expect Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s (WMT) same-store sales to decline outright in April. \b \b   Turnaround Signs Sought From Pier 1 4Q \b \u001d  Investors will be listening closely to what new Pier 1 (PIR) Chief Executive Alex Smith has to say when the struggling home-accessories retailer reports fiscal fourth-quarter results Thursday, April 12. \"The stock could possibly move up if Mr. Smith provides even some indication he can turn around the ailing company,\" Lehman Brothers analyst Alan Rifkin says. Pier 1's announcement last month that it would cut 175 positions, or about 1.2% of its work force, is a good first step, Rifkin and others say. \u001d  Last month, Pier 1 hired Smith, a former TJX Cos. Inc. executive, to replace longtime CEO Marvin J. Girouard. \b \b   FDA Weighs Another Merck Arthritis Drug \b \u001d  Nearly three years after Merck & Co. (MRK) pulled its Vioxx arthritis drug from the market over safety concerns, U.S. regulators are considering whether to allow another Merck arthritis drug on the market. A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee is scheduled to meet Thursday, April 12, to discuss Merck's application for FDA approval to market the drug Arcoxia for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis. \u001d  The committee is expected to recommend whether the agency should approve Arcoxia; the FDA usually follows such advice but isn't bound by it. Arcoxia is currently available in more than 60 countries, but U.S. approval has been delayed for several years. Arcoxia belongs to the same class of drugs as the withdrawn Vioxx and Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE) Celebrex, which remains on the market. \b \b   RIM 4Q Buoyed By Corporate Sales \b \u001d  Research in Motion Ltd. (RIMM) reports its fourth-quarter and full-year results Wednesday. Analysts expect strong results propped up by sales of its Blackberry email device to large businesses. The consumer-focused Pearl has also done well. Merrill Lynch expects a multi-year acceleration in smartphone sales for RIM, particularly in the wake of disappointing performance by rivals. \b \b   Qualcomm-Nokia Pact Ends Amid Lawsuits \b \u001d  The licensing agreement between Qualcomm Inc.

(LMT) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC), program manager Rear Adm. Gary Blore told Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  The $24 billion Deepwater program aims to replace a wide range of boats, aircraft and other equipment over 25 years. The Coast Guard has struggled to keep the program on track amid technical difficulties and delays that have plagued the program's shipbuilding. \u001d  Lawmakers have criticized the Coast Guard's reliance on contractors for so much of Deepwater management. To assuage these concerns, the Coast Guard recently said it would buy 12 patrol boats separately, rather than going through the Lockheed-Northrop contract. \u001d  Unless Congress gives specific instructions otherwise, the Coast Guard wants to continue with its current contracts for the National Security Cutter ships and a variety of aircraft programs, Blore said in an interview on the sidelines of this week's annual Navy League conference. \u001d  For now, the Coast Guard isn't looking outside of the main indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity umbrella contract for additional work, he said. But the agency is keeping its options open. \u001d  \"There's no strategy to take more; there's no plan. We're going to do a business case analysis on each new step,\" Blore said. \u001d  \"We'll look at the opportunity of the IDIQ contract and what it presents us, and we'll look at the opportunity if we want to compete it directly from the Coast Guard,\" Blore said. \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; rebecca.christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:12 ET (15:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8d5a7f2f07b900f34fbddd132b02400c","symR":["LVLT"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Level 3 Commun CEO Pay Valued At $8.74M For 2006","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T21:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LVLT"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XNQ1","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 17:19 ET (21:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8d624a688b18ac411f750153b5b9a3f6","symR":["6701.TO","NIPNY","JP3733000008"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": NEC to Launch New Infrared Camera Module for Intruder Surveillance and Vision Enhancement","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T12:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6701.TO","NIPNY","JP3733000008"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","X225","XDJGI","XSTX"],"Story":"\u001d  TOKYO -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 04/06/07 -- \u001d   NEC Corporation (NASDAQ: NIPNY) announced that it will begin shipping a new uncooled infrared camera module, HX0830M1*, to manufacturers for use in a broad range of applications in various fields. \u001d  Manufactured by NEC, the module is compact, light and boasts a highly sensitive infrared detector capable of detecting far infrared energy in the 8 to 14 micron region. It is highly suited to heat surveillance and vision enhancement applications, and is also embedded with image processing circuits. \u001d  As the module can be operated through simple connection to a power supply and has a video output terminal and a simple button interface, it can be commercialized or embedded in infrared cameras without any kind of special development, making it highly suitable for use by manufacturers in a wide range of fields including infrared camera. Lead Time of the module is 3 months after receipt of order. In North America, NEC Corporation of America's Advanced Sensors Technology Department, based in Herndon, Virginia, will market the new product. \u001d  With an infrared camera, infrared wavelengths of light invisible to the naked eye that are emitted from an object are captured as degrees of luminance. These qualities make infrared camera modules ideal for a range of uses. For example, as the infrared sensor is unaffected by visible light and can detect objects as heat information even in places where there is no light, it could be used for intruder surveillance, security, disaster relief, survivor searches, and vision enhancement for aircraft, ships and vehicles. \u001d  In addition, because it is possible to visualize an object's surface temperature via two-dimensional distribution, both remotely and without making contact, it can be used for condition monitoring and maintenance of dangerous areas such as places with objects of high temperature, rotators, high voltages and in high locations that require acquisition of temperature distribution information. Because it can assess the heat conduction state, the module can be used for quality control of products and foods, for which heat processing and drying are performed, and in R&D and medical fields for such things as non-destructive inspections of products, building structures, and the like. \u001d  Furthermore, because the degree of transmission differs from visible light areas, depending on the material properties, it can penetrate through smoketo perceive an object. Leveraging this feature, the module has been used inthe fire fighting field to assess fire extinguishment and rescue status to minimize risk to fire fighters at the fire scene. \u001d  In the future, more applications are expected in such fields as biometrics and intelligent traffic systems (ITS). \u001d  The new product was developed to realize wider use of far infrared cameras that meet these needs of industry and the needs of society in safety assurance aspects such as security, disaster prevention and terror strategy. \u001d  With the commercialization of this product, full-scale production for uncooled infrared detectors has been initiated at the NEC's Fuchu and Sagamihara plants, securing volume production in Japan. By so doing, along with ensuring supply of sensors in Japan, and by supporting modular product, NEC intends to expand the application of infrared and usage in a wide range of fields, and to pioneer new fields of application. \u001d  In the future, NEC is planning to commercialize an uncooled infrared cameramodule with 640 by 480 pixel resolution. \u001d  In addition, the standalone uncooled infrared detectors, which are used in the modules, are also available. \u001d  Please see the features of this new product in the attachment. \u001d  [*] In contrast to infrared cameras where the sensors must be cooled, the uncooled type, which operates at normal temperatures, is used.

Compact, lightweight \"palm-size\" and achieves high picture quality \u001d  Developed in Japan, the module employs an uncooled infrared detector (HX0830) with the world's smallest [1] 23.5 micron pixel pitch. \u001d  The \"palm-size\" module of 38 mm by 38 mm by 65 mm realizes a combination ofdetector and image processing circuitry. \u001d  It achieves 320 by 240 pixel image resolution, under 0.075 (K), temperatureresolution and clear imaging. \u001d  2. Easy introduction via module format \u001d  As a camera module, it has an HX0830 uncooled infrared detector manufactured in-house. The aft portion of the sensor has circuitry to function as driver, read-out, image signal processing, power supply etc. With no more than the prescribed power supply, embedding in equipment is simple. \u001d  3. Equipped with multi-functionality \u001d  In addition to NTSC/PAL analog video output, digital video output is also provided. Furthermore, for the technical user, digital raw data output is possible for each pixel in real time. Module control is conducted via RS-232C, and customizations such as logo input, color pallet configuration,graphic overlay, are realized easily with the user interface tools. \u001d  [1] as of March, 2007, Internal Survey \u001d  Uses for far infrared cameras (examples) \u001d  Law enforcement and surveillance uses--  Surveillance of vital facilities such as electrical power stations, \b    plants, complexes, airports, communications relay stations, etc. \b--  Surveillance of suspicious persons in coastal areas and fishing \b    grounds \b \u001d  Facilities security surveillance and condition monitoring uses--  Fire surveillance of station premises, large-scale stores and public \b    cultural facilities \b--  Surveillance of abnormal heat generation in plant equipment and \b    electrical power equipment \b--  Monitoring of equipment in oil and gas tankers, warehouses, freight, \b    etc. \b--  Building structural inspection \b \u001d  Industrial uses--  Temperature control (quality control) for ovens, furnace, etc. on \b    food production lines, etc. \b--  Temperature control of high temperature objects on foundry lines and \b    welding lines, etc. \b \u001d  Situational assessment uses--  Assessment of traffic road flow, volcanic eruptions, pyroclastic \b    flows, etc. \b--  Disaster status check \b \u001d  Vision enhancement uses--  Forward safety check for nighttime ships, vehicles, etc. \b--  Field of vision check for airplanes (navigational aid, nighttime) \b \u001d  Rescue and survival uses--  Marine and alpine survivor discovery \b--  Victim discovery and firefighter visual aid at fire scene \b \u001d  Medical etc. uses--  Airport screening of persons with abnormal temperature (contagious \b    diseases, etc.) \b--  Blood vessel assessment assistance in cardiac and brain surgery \b--  ICU (Intensive Care Unit) body temperature observation assistance \b    (brain hypothermia, etc.) \b \u001d  R&D uses--  Heat distribution assessment of conduction state, non-destructive \b    examination in trial products \b--  Plant and animal observation \b \u001d     Contact: Kazuko Andersen NEC Corporation of America 212-326-2502 Kazuko.andersen@necam.com \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 08:01 ET (12:01 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"8f994f06672740ab59a5e933747265c0","symR":["BBD.A.T","BBD.B.T","BDRBF","ERJ","CA0977511017","CA0977512007"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Chinese Regional Jet Maker Expects To Snare 60% Of Local Mkt","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T07:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BBD.A.T","BBD.B.T","BDRBF","ERJ","CA0977511017","CA0977512007"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SHANGHAI (AP)--China's first homebuilt commercial jet is expected to grab up to 60% of the domestic market for midsize regional airliners over the next 20 years, the company's president said Friday. \u001d  China recently announced plans to build a large commercial jet by 2020, but Zheng Qiang, president of AVIC I Commercial Aircraft Co., said the project was still under study and no information had been relayed to his company. \u001d  China will need about 900 mid-sized regional jets over the next two decades, the company estimates, as economic growth drives an expansion of air travel and airlines look for planes best tailored to feeder routes. \u001d  Sales of the mid-sized ARJ-21, which has a seating capacity of 78-85, could come at the expense of Canadian airplane maker Bombardier Inc. (BBD.A.T) and Brazil's Embraer SA (ERJ). \u001d  Zheng said the ARJ-21's operating costs were up to 15% lower than its competitors, and put its list price at about $30 million - several million dollars less than comparable aircraft made by Bombardier and Embraer. \u001d  The initial focus for the ARJ-21 will be on the domestic market, but Zheng said the company also expects to sell the planes in Africa, other parts of Asia, and South America, where it enjoys strong Chinese government support. \u001d  Chinese airlines that have already ordered 71 of the planes weren't compelled to do so by the government, he said. \u001d  \"This is entirely down to our own marketing,\" Zheng said in an interview at the company's offices in downtown Shanghai. \u001d  The ARJ-21 is now under production with the first test flights planned for next year. Zheng said development costs totaled CNY6 billion ($776 million). \u001d  The plane's suburban Shanghai final assembly line initially will produce 15 units per year, rising to 50 per year by 2015, he said. The company will also open a service center in Shanghai later this year to provide training and maintenance for customers. \u001d  Test flights are a year behind schedule. Zheng said that was due to a push in 2005 to refine the plane's aerodynamics and overall weight. \u001d  \"We think these problems are pretty normal in any brand new airplane venture,\" Zheng said. \u001d  A collection of 19 foreign companies are supplying components to the plane, including engines from General Electric, a flight control system from Honeywell, and avionics from Rockwell Collins. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 03:40 ET (07:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8fb99773090ceca85c7a04d97dc7a6f1","symR":["NHI"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"National Health Investors, Inc.

I think these kind of weapons are just so foul,\" she said. \u001d  Steger confirmed the fund has divested from U.S. companies Textron Inc. (TXT), General Dynamics Corp. (GD), Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK), and from Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd. (S63.SG) after receiving hundreds of complaints. He said the company was \"reviewing\" its other military investments. \u001d  ABP's move is part of a larger trend of big funds agreeing to use the clout they wield as institutional investors to push social causes. \u001d  In the U.S., the biggest single pension fund is the California state employees fund CalPers, with US$232 billion in assets, and it has been among the most progressive. Recently, state lawmakers have been lobbying it to divest from any holding in companies that do business with Iran. \u001d  Matt Christensen, director of sustainable investment advocacy group Eurosif, said he applauded ABP's move to increase transparency. \u001d  In Europe \"ABP, the Norwegian state pension fund, Hermes in the U.K., all are doing things differently,\" he said. Hermes is owned by British Telecom's Pension Scheme. \u001d  Some funds skew their investments toward companies that are seen as having good social policies. Others use \"negative screening\" and divest from companies seen as unethical. \u001d  \"British funds tend to do more 'engagement' - talking to the companies that they invest in, saying 'do something about this, or we'll pull our shares,' \" Christensen said. Some U.K. funds also voluntarily disclose a list of their biggest investments. \u001d  Europe's largest fund, the $292 billion Norwegian state pension fund, maintains a public blacklist of companies it does not buy stocks in for ethical reasons. \u001d  Last year, \"untouchables\" included household names like Boeing Co. (BA), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT). \u001d  Professor Steven Thel of Fordham University said that by nature, large pension funds that service civil servants or large unionized fields like teachers and health care workers are subject to political pressure. \u001d  He said that while European funds have been wary of disclosing their holdings, there is little evidence that their performance would suffer from doing so. \u001d  \"There's a certain inertia,\" he said. \"Funds are worried about the consequences. But once they come out (and report) they realize it's not that onerous.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 14:42 ET (18:42 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"91106e02b1903105ff579b09477711ad","symR":["CAO"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": CSK Auto Corporation Announces Delay in Filing 2006 Results Pending Completion of Fiscal Year 2005 Restatement; Provides Additional Updates","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CAO"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\bPHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 06, 2007-- \u001d  CSK Auto Corporation (NYSE:CAO), the parent company of CSK Auto, Inc.

At any given time, I may be able to furnish you with the \"handle\" on the 10-year note, but that's usually the extent of it. If that's a character flaw, at least it is apparent. Those reading \"Mark to Market\" for clues on why Treasury yields are where they are and where yields might proceed next would do as well to read me for tips on how to make the cover of GQ. \u001d  Fortunately, I know a man who does know the Treasurys market. He is our own Laurence Norman. He is British, but I know without asking him that he strongly opposes the new Brit tactic of setting up closed-circuit cameras that trigger warnings to be barked at pedestrians seen littering. \u001d  Today is Good Friday. Almost all U.S. financial markets are closed, including the stock market. \u001d  The bond market would be closed too, except that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has decided to release the March jobs report at 8:30 a.m. EDT, as it would do if this were not one of the holiest days in Christendom. \u001d  BLS's reasoning is simple: Anyone at the agency who is anyone can take off to observe the crucifixion and death of Christ, while some bingo may easily be found to press the button on a report that is already signed, sealed and delivered. \u001d  Mr. Norman, writing in his\"ON THE RUN\" column on April 4, noted: \u001d  \"On the last three occasions the payrolls report has fallen on Good Friday, yields have seen hefty swings as limited liquidity has sparked exaggerated price moves. \u001d  \"With so much doubt surrounding the economic outlook and the Federal Reserve's next steps, conditions are ripe for a freaky Friday.\" \u001d  Treasurys trading desks will be well staffed this morning for a day which is the first time in eight years that the solemn prelude to the Easter weekend and the U.S. jobs report have coincided. \u001d  Aye,  Laurence, and how freaky might Friday get? \u001d  \"The last three occasions that payrolls fell on Good Friday were 1999, 1996 and 1994. \u001d  \"In 1999, the 10-year yield traded in a range of 10 basis points on the Friday in question, while in 1996, its range was 23 basis points and in 1994, 21 basis points, (Jason) Evans (head of Treasurys trading at Deutsche Bank) said.\" \u001d  As for the jobs report itself, Dow Jones Newswires forecasts that warmer weather in March than in February lifted the net number of new nonfarm jobs by 142,000 compared with 97,000 in February. Late returns from economists caused us to revise our forecast for the unemployment rate last month, to 4.6% from 4.5% in February. \b \b   Take A Hike \b \u001d  A person of apparent desperation calling himself Bob Cordell hit me with a spam Thursday afternoon, which began: \u001d  \"Hi JIM: I am writing to schedule a quick call to discuss a possible alliance with DOW JONES & COMPANY INC.

(MED) is aiming to boost its business by increasing direct sales to customers. \u001d  However, with a host of dieting products coursing through the market, the benefit to investors has yet to be proven. \u001d  Medifast's shares have dropped 64% from a high of around $21 in June to trade around $7. That's despite sales increases but in part because its cost to acquire new customers rose late last year. Medifast shares are trading at 19 times 2006 earnings of 40 cents, compared with 23 times for rival NutriSystem Inc. (NTRI), implying lower expectations for earnings growth from Medifast. \u001d  The company spent $5 million on information technology, manufacturing and distribution upgrades last year, and analysts who cover the stock say the company's value could rise as it increases advertising to gain a larger portion of the roughly $40 billion U.S. market for weight-loss programs and foods. \u001d  Medifast, which sells low-calorie meal replacements such as soups, shakes, oatmeal and bars, has a market capitalization less than a tenth of NutriSystem, which sells packaged full meals. Based in Owings Mills, Md., Medifast started out in 1980 selling its products wholesale to doctors, but hopes to expand by franchising its weight-loss clinics, helped by a new TV infomercial and increasing advertising spending and online support. \u001d  Acquiring customers at low cost is vital. Part of Medifast's share slump is due to concerns over whether its advertising spending will pay off. Medifast's customer acquisition cost peaked at $200 per customer late last year, according to Scott Van Winkle, an analyst with Canaccord Adams. \u001d  NutriSystem, unlike Medifast, got rid of its franchised weight-loss centers about four years ago to rely only on direct sales and advertising, causing its sales to balloon. Medifast, in contrast, has four different distribution channels apart from its Web site - its weight-loss centers, health clinics, call centers and doctors. It plans to bring its call centers in-house this year, saving $300,000 to $400,000. \u001d  \"Four different distribution channels allows people to chose the system they like,\" Chief Executive Michael S. McDevitt, 28, who joined the company in 2002 after working as an analyst for the Blackstone Group, a private-equity group in New York, and was its chief financial officer before taking over in March from retired Marine Col. Bradley T. MacDonald. \b \b   Preparing For Growth \b \u001d  Medifast plans to boost its advertising spending by $6 million from last year to around $20 million and hired a new head of marketing, Richard Zeeb, who has experience in direct marketing, last October. The company is expected to launch its 30-minute TV infomercial in mid-April. \u001d  \"I really think they're preparing, building the platform for some robust multiyear growth,\" said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Laura Richardson. \u001d  McDevitt said the company can grow to have a market capitalization of a quarter-of-a-billion dollars from its current $105 million without further infrastructure spending. \u001d  For 2007, the company expects revenue to increase by 15% to 19%, and after-tax profit to rise to 45 cents to 46 cents per diluted share. \u001d  Richardson expects earnings at the high end of that range, with more robust growth in 2008 as the TV advertising gets established in time for the post-Christmas diet season. \u001d  With an estimated 66% of U.S. adults either obese or overweight, meal-replacement plans are likely to become more popular because they are more convenient and require consumers to make fewer diet choices, analysts said. \u001d  But the meal-replacement market is still a fraction of the overall competitive diet market. It was worth around $2.8 billion in 2006, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm, and is expected to grow to more than $3 billion in 2008. \u001d  First Albany Capital analyst William Lennan, who started coverage of Medifast at neutral in March, said while meal replacement is a compelling product for \"no nonsense\" dieters, recent management turnover and inexperience, increasing advertising spending and declining revenue per customer at Medifast could lead to negative earnings surprises. \u001d  Medifast's first TV infomercial will be based on a talk show format, drawing on health and medical experts to position Medifast as a solution for obesity rather than a quick fix. The company advertises its products as \"clinically proven,\" but some nutritionists are skeptical. \u001d  For clinical backup, Medifast largely relies on a study by Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, published in abstract form in the American Diabetes Association Journal, showing benefits for diabetes patients who used Medifast products. Other studies are due out this year. \u001d  However, there is no published large-scale study showing low-calorie meal-replacement therapies such as Medifast's, which advertises losing 2 to 5 pounds a week, work over the long term. \u001d  \"Even if we believe there is some kind of standard for what clinically proven means, the issue isn't weight loss, it's maintenance of the weight loss,\" said Sharon Akabas, director of the master of science nutrition program at Columbia University's Institute of Human Nutrition. \u001d  McDevitt said Medifast teaches portion control, as consumers cook one \"lean and green\" meal a day with five Medifast meals on the initial plan, which costs about $9 a day, and then more during a maintenance plan. \u001d  The rate of dieters in the general population who return to their previous weight within two to five years after a diet plan stands at 90% to 95%, or at best 80% in some studies, Akabas said. \u001d  \"And if Medifast had a clinically proven treatment to weight loss and weight maintenance,\" she said, \"they would probably be the most successful company out there.\" \u001d  (BB&T Capital Markets expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment-banking services from Medifast and NutriSystem in the next three months.

If approved, Torisel would be the first drug in its class to target mTOR. \u001d  The key clinical study submitted to the FDA in support of Torisel's approval, involving more than 600 patients with advanced kidney cancer, showed those receiving Torisel lived an average of 3.6 months longer than patients receiving interferon-alpha, which was then the standard treatment for advanced cancer cases. \u001d  Since December 2005, the FDA has approved two other drugs to treat advanced kidney cancer: Sutent by Pfizer Inc.

Mitchell of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Birmingham, Ala., on Thursday approved Citation's Chapter 11 reorganization plan, which the company had filed with its bankruptcy petition in March. \u001d  The plan calls for Citation's lenders, led by JP Morgan Chase (JPM), to trade $191 million in debt for all of the reorganized company's common stock and a new $30 million loan. \u001d  The lenders have agreed to provide Citation up to $25 million in bankruptcy financing. \u001d  Claims held by the company's unsecured creditors totaling $33 million will be reinstated and paid in full in the ordinary course of business.

This estimate is lower than current analyst expectations. \b \u001d  Columbia's earning performance in the first quarter is being impacted primarily by compression of the net interest margin, which management believes is a consistent issue facing banks across the country.  As we continue to experience a stationary Fed Funds rate and hear uncertain economic news about the housing market and volatile oil prices, management expects our yield on earning assets to remain fairly flat for the remainder of 2007.  This forecast is based on an expectation the Fed Funds rate will remain unchanged.  We also expect increasing competition for core deposits, which will likely cause an increase in our cost of funds. \b \u001d  Although Columbia Bancorp's net interest margin has generally been above average among our peer group in the past, management expects margin compression will continue, resulting in earnings performance more in line with industry peers. \b \u001d  Also contributing to earnings performance is our provision for loan losses which is expected to be in the range of $950,000 and $1,050,000 for the first quarter of 2007.  Our provision will reflect adjustments to the allowance for loan losses resulting in part from a $1 million charge-off of a loan to a single borrower.  As of March 30, 2007, a settlement was reached between Columbia River Bank and the borrower and based on this settlement and our reserve allocation, management believes that Columbia is sufficiently reserved for this settlement.  Columbia continues to maintain overall healthy credit quality and strong loan growth. \b \u001d  \"With the steady growth in our Pacific Northwest economy sustaining consumer confidence in the region, we are confident we will continue to move the organization forward in its commitment to being the Bank of choice for our customers, shareholders and employees,\" stated Roger Christensen, Chief Executive Officer and President.  \"We remain committed to our strategic plans in order to build long-term value.\" \b \b    ABOUT COLUMBIA BANCORP \b \u001d  Columbia Bancorp (www.columbiabancorp.com) is the financial holding company for Columbia River Bank, which operates 21 full-service branches located in The Dalles (2), Hood River, Bend (3), Madras, Redmond (2), Pendleton, Hermiston, McMinnville, Lake Oswego, Canby and Newberg, Oregon, and in Goldendale, White Salmon, Sunnyside, Yakima, Pasco and Richland, Washington.  In addition, Columbia River Bank has three limited service branches located in retirement homes, one in Bend, Oregon and two in McMinnville, Oregon.  To supplement its community banking services, Columbia River Bank also provides mortgage-lending services through Columbia River Bank Mortgage Team and brokerage services through CRB Financial Services Team. \b \b    FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \b \u001d  This press release contains various forward-looking statements about plans and anticipated results of operations and financial condition relating to Columbia Bancorp. These statements include statements about Management's present plans and intentions about our strategy, growth, and deployment of resources, and about Management's expectations for future financial performance. Readers can sometimes identify forward-looking statements by the use of prospective language and context, including words like \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"plans,\" \"intends,\" or other similar terminology. Because forward-looking statements are, in part, an attempt to project future events and explain Management's current plans, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actions and our financial and operational results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, our ability to estimate accurately the potential for losses inherent in our loan portfolio, economic and other factors that affect the collectibility of our loans, the impact of competition and fluctuations in market interest rates on Columbia's revenues and margins, and our ability to open and generate growth from new branches and to expand in new markets as we expect. Some of the other, risks and uncertainties that we have in the past, or that we may from time to time in the future, detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Information presented in this report is accurate as of the date the report was filed with the SEC, and we cannot undertake to update our forward looking statements or the factors that may cause us to deviate from them, except as required by law. \b \bSOURCE  Columbia Bancorp \b \u001d    /CONTACT: Roger L.

Eduardo Castro-Wright, CEO of the U.S. division, now reports directly to Scott. \b \b   Telecom Italia Chairman Quits \u001d  Guido Rossi has resigned as chairman of Telecom Italia (TI) just two days after the company's largest shareholder attempted to push him out the door. Olimpia, the holding company set up by Pirelli and the Benetton family to control Telecom Italia, left Rossi's name off of a list of proposed board nominees released this week ahead of a shareholders' vote on April 16. He would have effectively been ousted unless other shareholders with combined stakes of more than 18% were to nominate him on a different list. Rossi had said on Wednesday he wouldn't resign even if Pirelli chose to exclude him from its list of director nominees. \b \b   China Extends Piracy Penalties \u001d  Trying to crack down on an issue that has been a key point of tension between the U.S. and China on the trade front, Beijing extended criminal penalties for movie and music piracy to individuals caught with smaller amounts of DVDs or compact discs. Now, anyone nabbed with 500 pirated discs will face criminal prosecution instead of fines, down from the previous 1,000 discs, reported the Xinhua official news agency. It said that the number of discs that triggers more severe penalties of up to seven years in prison was cut in half to 2,500. \b \b   New Century Gets Financing \u001d  New Century Financial, the subprime mortgage lender that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this week, said that a Delaware bankruptcy court approved as much as $50 million of debtor-in-possession financing. The firm filed for bankruptcy after major backers shut off the flow of cash and declared it in default. The company said it would immediately lay off 3,200 employees, more than half of its work force. \b \b   Truce For Google, AFP \u001d  Agence France-Presse said it had reached an agreement with Google Inc.

Last year, after he took home the prize for biggest bunny at a local fair, he sold six animals to North Korea for a pilot program to breed the rabbits for food. But the reclusive communist regime does not want Szmolinsky coming to the country. He said that officials told him they have everything \"under control.\" That ruffled Szmolinsky, who thinks the rabbits he sent are quite likely dead. \"North Korea has died for me -- they aren't getting anything from me, no more rabbits,\" he told the Associated Press. \u001d  -For continuously updated news from The Wall Street Journal, see WSJ.com at http://wsj.com. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:21 ET (19:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9e0a51d9fc9b0e1e501568bec2d31e72","symR":["SNTO"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Sento Receives Nasdaq Notice Regarding Delay in Holding Annual Shareholders Meeting","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SNTO"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bSALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 06, 2007-- \u001d  Sento Corporation (Nasdaq: SNTO), a right-channeling solutions leader, today reported it received a Nasdaq Staff Determination letter on April 2, 2007 indicating the Company had failed to comply with the requirement that it hold its annual meeting of shareholders, solicit proxies and provide proxy statements to Nasdaq by March 31, 2007, and that the Company's securities are, therefore, subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market in accordance with Marketplace Rules 4350(e) and 4350(g). \b \u001d  Sento anticipated receipt of this notice because it delayed holding its annual meeting of shareholders until May 22, 2007 to allow it sufficient time to retain the services of a new Chief Executive Officer. \b \u001d  In accordance with Nasdaq procedures, Sento has requested a hearing with the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to review the Staff Determination.

(FDC) - more often than not, the rumors fade and call buyers are left with an investment that is destined to expire worthless. \u001d  So instead of buying calls to position for a buyout, consider an alternative: selling put options. \u001d  Put sellers collect the option's price and are obligated to buy the stock if it falls below a certain level, which is why \"put selling is attractive in cases where there is a limited downside view on the stock,\" explained Goldman Sachs options strategist John Marshall in a recent note to clients. \u001d  Of course, put selling is applicable to any situation in which investors expect a stock to remain at or above current levels. From a screen for leveraged buyout candidates run by Goldman's portfolio strategist David Kostin, Marshall highlighted several stocks on which the put selling approach might work well - because they could make a good buyout target, or because they are prime for some kind of \"releveraging event,\" like a stock buyback or increased dividend, that could lift the stock. \u001d  Companies that turned up on the list include, Humana Inc. (HUM), Amdocs Ltd (DOX), and Legg Mason Inc. (LM). But reflecting the risk inherent in put selling, Marshall advises that even from this list traders should \"sell puts selectively on companies where strong fundamentals provide limited downside.\" \u001d  Still, options on one of the companies, Valero Energy Corp. (VLO), illustrates just how effective put selling can be. With Valero closing at $66.01 on Thursday, the January 62.50 puts ended the session with a bid price of $3.80, or about 6% of the current stock price. The put seller has to buy Valero stock if it falls below $62.50 - but for an effective price of $58.70. \u001d  \"You'd better want to own it for that before you sell the puts,\" advises William Lefkowitz, chief options strategist at vFinance Investments and a habitual put seller. \u001d  Clearly this isn't an approach for investors only interested in the juiced-up returns that can come from successfully picking the next target and buying out-of-the-money call options on it. Those investors have made as much as several hundred percent on their investments. \u001d  But given the relative infrequency with which speculators are successful doing that, \"I like my odds a lot better if I'm writing the puts,\" Lefkowitz said. \u001d  By Mohammed Hadi, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4049; mohammed.hadi@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 13:23 ET (17:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a128fd5e98c0e80c793a124531b0b7d8","symR":["SNIC"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Sonic Solutions Sees Extra Noncash Chgs For Stk-Based Comp","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SNIC"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 16:35 ET (20:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a190443a7bf1e966e691eb3680dab8bc","symR":["KAR"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"ADESA, Inc.

We do not intend to comment on the letter overall but do want to point out that a number of statements in the letter are either factually incorrect or gross mischaracterizations, specifically the comment that the Company is preparing information for interested parties to review. \b \u001d  We can assure you that your Board is, and has been, devoted to optimizing shareholder value.  Since completing our two-year restructuring and returning to profitability and growth, we have conducted numerous third-party investment bank reviews of our operations, capital structure, and ownership status to ensure that we are acting in the best long-term interest of all shareholders. The most recent independent review was just completed in January of this year. Nevertheless, in direct response to the questions raised by the shareholder in his letter and 13-D filing dated April 4, 2007, we engaged a different, nationally known and respected investment bank to perform a full, independent review not only of the January findings, but to undertake a full capital markets analysis to ensure that we are considering the broadest range of options and potential opportunities for optimizing shareholder value for the benefit of all shareholders. \b \u001d  Notwithstanding the recent comments made by the shareholder, we intend to proceed in a deliberate manner that takes into account the financial interests of all shareholders.  It would be a breach of our fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders for the Board to proceed in any one manner without a thoughtful evaluation of the business, its potential, the state of the marketplace and the Company's options.  Over the coming months, we will study the investment banker's analysis when it is completed, and before formulating a plan for how to best optimize shareholder interests, which may include the possibility of continuing on the Company's current course, we will consider a variety of other factors that our Board determines appropriate in assessing the interests of all of our shareholders. \b \u001d  In the meantime, and with solid business fundamentals supporting us, we on the Board remain committed to our search for an incoming CEO to lead the Company in its next stage of growth while ensuring that Flow continues in its role as world leader in industrial waterjet machines. \b \b \b    Most sincerely, \b \b    Kathy L. Munro \b    Chairman of the Board of Directors \b    Flow International \b \b    About Flow International \b \u001d  Flow International Corporation is the world's leading developer and manufacturer of ultrahigh-pressure waterjet cutting technology to industries including automotive, aerospace, job shop, surface preparation, and more.

A late edition of today's Wall Street Journal contains an article asserting that private equity firms are eyeing Kroger, with the expectation that Kroger will soon begin exploring a leveraged buyout.  It is our policy not to comment on acquisition rumors. \b \u001d  With the ready availability of significant capital in private equity funds and Kroger's attractiveness as a franchise, rumors and speculation are not surprising.  Unfortunately, the kind of speculation contained in the article can be disruptive to our associates and to the conduct of our business.  I want you to know neither management nor our Board of Directors has any interest in pursuing a leveraged buyout transaction. \b \u001d  Our focus is on the execution of our business strategy, which is to serve our customers, and in that way to continue to grow Kroger as an independent public company and create value for our shareholders.  Putting our customers first has generated substantial returns for our shareholders, and we expect to continue to grow as we face the challenges of this intensely competitive industry.\" \b \u001d  Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, Kroger is one of the nation's largest retail grocery chains.  The Company focuses its charitable efforts on hunger relief, K-12 education, women's health initiatives and local organizations in the communities it serves.

(VG) will not be able to seek new customers, calling into question its ability to survive in the long run. \u001d  It's a damaging result for Vonage. U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton imposed an immediate stay against Vonage, effectively preventing it from signing up new customers to its Internet-based telephone service. The company, however, will be able to provide service to its existing base of 2.2 million customers. \u001d  Hilton said he had weighed a number of factors in reaching his decision. These, he said, included whether a stay could in fact lead to Vonage's bankruptcy. He also said he had to evaluate how the public's interest would be affected and concluded that given the competitiveness of the telecommunications industry, there would be no impact either way. \u001d  According to Rebecca Arboghast, a telecommunications analyst with Stifel Nicolaus who was at the hearing, said if the ruling is upheld, it will be difficult for Vonage to \"continue in a viable way.\" \u001d  Spokesmen for Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Vonage weren't immediately available for comment. \u001d  Vonage's request for a stay of the injunction represented a near-last resort for the company, since a negative ruling would effectively shut down its Internet telephone business. The company is working on a way to get around the Verizon patents, but it's unclear how much progress it has made in that avenue. \u001d  The Holmdel, N.J., Web phone service provider will appeal the original ruling that it had infringed on Verizon's patents, but the process could take more than a year. \u001d  Verizon filed a brief Thursday pushing for the judge to deny Vonage's request. \"A stay of injunction would violate the fundamental purpose of a stay pending appeal: preservation of the status quo.\" \u001d  Hilton concluded Friday's proceedings by saying he would enter the injunction order this coming Thursday, which in effect means that the injunction would begin at that date. \u001d  Vonage was dealt a serious blow March 23 when Hilton said he would issue a permanent injunction against Vonage. Shares plunged 26% that day. The only saving grace at the time was the judge's decision to wait two weeks before entering the injunction, allowing for more time to decide on the stay request. \u001d  The decision came after a jury found Vonage had infringed on three patents controlled by Verizon. The patents relate to connecting Internet phone calls with the traditional phone network, call forwarding and the use of wireless fidelity, or wi-fi, technology. Verizon claimed it lost hundreds of thousands of customers to Vonage while it used Verizon's patents. \u001d  Vonage stumbled out of the gates with its initial public offering in May. The company made a name for itself as the largest independent provider of Internet phone service, positioning itself as a low-cost alternative to the traditional phone companies. The company, however, faces increasing competition from the cable providers, who have bundled their television service with a similar Web-based phone offering. The concern was partially the reason Vonage had to delay its IPO. \u001d  Since going public, it's had one problem after another. The company has been plagued by shareholder lawsuits after the botched offering, in which many of its customers balked at paying for stock they had agreed to buy. \u001d  After pricing at $17, the stock has continually hit all-time lows amid a barrage of negative news. Shares closed at $3.37 on Thursday. \u001d  In its most recently reported quarter, Vonage posted the weakest subscriber growth figure in two years. The company has eaten into some of the phone companies' subscriber base, but its impact is still minor. In 2006, Verizon lost 3.1 million residential phone customers, ending the year with a base of 27.8 million subscribers. \u001d  As a result of the anticipation over the decision, Vonage delayed filing its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission due to the uncertainty of the outcome at the time. \u001d  It also disclosed on Thursday that one of its directors, Betsy Atkins, resigned from the board last week. The company said her departure last Friday didn't stem from a disagreement with the company. \u001d  - By Roger Cheng, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2020; roger.cheng@dowjones.com \u001d  - By Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6637; corey.boles@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:09 ET (16:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a9a1a544c087ab9ad8d5f86ba75f029d","symR":["A","STGN"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Stratagene Signs Definitive Pact To Be Acquired By Agilent Technologies","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["A","STGN"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","ITC","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:00 ET (15:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a9acdccf0b155b9ce748a836bed702ce","symR":["BOT","CME","DJDAY","GOOG","ICE"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"TECHNICALLY SPEAKING: CME Holdings, Google Hold Their Own","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T17:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BOT","CME","DJDAY","GOOG","ICE"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","SCR","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \b   By Stephen Cox, CMT \b   A Dow Jones Newswires Column \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The U.S. stock market has been edging higher since mid-March, after being hit with a nearly month-long correction. \u001d  Two notably rich shares in that market, those of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME) and Google Inc. (GOOG), suggest that the market is still good to go on the upside, and the corrections on the way may be relatively shallow, even if upside progress may be slow once trading resumes next week. \b \b   CME Holdings On Hold \b \u001d  CME said on Tuesday that it is postponing a shareholder vote on the company's merger with CBOT Holdings Inc. (BOT). During the postponement, CBOT Holdings will review a competing bid from IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE). \u001d  I imagine that CBOT Holdings, which evidently wants a change, may be anxious to ink a deal with a company that doesn't have that obnoxious echolalic \"holdings\" in its title. \u001d  In any case, it may be notable that CME shares, notwithstanding their over-$20 run-up this week, are likewise on hold. \u001d  It's true that the shares have been trending higher since December 2002 when they put in a major bottom at $38.90. The uptrend high is the lofty $596.30 resistance level recorded in January. But it's also that the uptrend since the April 2005 low of $163.80 was interrupted early last month when shares fell below $554.76. \u001d  As of this writing, the shares are trading at $553.50. The technical point is that an uptrend would be restored on the weekly chart next week only if shares rallied decisively above $573.56. \u001d  In other words, absent such a rally, CME shares would be vulnerable to a dip to $521.85. An extended lower move would be targeting $493.64-$475.62 support. \u001d  Shares of IntercontinentalExchange, by the way, now at $128.88, are technically strong above $126.73. A move above $127.83 would point them up to $137.07-$139.14 resistance, including a potential top at $138.08. Traders could look for a pullback from $132.93 resistance on the way up. \b \b   Google Searches For An Uptrend \b \u001d  Google shares ended a nearly two-month corrective downtrend when they completed a breakout above $442.79 on March 20. The uptrend that followed brought shares up to $474.25 on Tuesday. Current trading near $471.51 shows that shares, technically, are holding the gains. An uptrend would be intact on the daily chart as long as shares trade above $468.12-$465.82 support. \u001d  Decisive trading above $473.89 would be the signal for an initial move up to $499.18 resistance, which charts suggest may be an important short-term top. But a move beyond $499.18 would give the stock a shot at its long-term uptrend high of $513.00. \u001d  The risk for buyers now is a dip below $468.12-$465.82 support and a selloff to $453.89-$452.12 support. \b \u001d  (Stephen Cox, a chartered market technician, is chief technician for Dow Jones Newswires.) \u001d  -By Stephen Cox, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2064; stephen.cox@dowjones.com \u001d  Data by CQG, CSI, Commodity Research Bureau, TradeStation Securities \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 13:00 ET (17:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"aa813e80cc44804996bc8a1823369a56","symR":["ARCI"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder MEDALLION CAP Sells 31,000 Of APPLIANCE RECYCLING CENTERS OF AMER >ARCI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T13:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ARCI"],"IndustryCodes":["POL","SVC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: APPLIANCE RECYCLING CENTERS OF AMERICA INC \bSYMBOL: ARCI \b \bFILER: MEDALLION CAPITAL INC \bTITLE: Beneficial Owner \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b3/27/06-4/12/06    Sale                     31,000       $6.16        $191,000 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 516,000 (Direct) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

At that time the two companies disclosed a new business relationship under which Google will pay AP for news and photos, but financial details of that arrangement weren't disclosed. \u001d  Eric Scherer, AFP's director for strategic planning and partnerships, said the wire service is pleased because \"the work of our journalists and photographers will be recognized in a normal way,\" he said. \u001d  \"With the other major Internet players like AOL, Yahoo or MSN, we have been licensing our content to them for years and years,\" he said. \"And now Google has agreed to do the same thing, so we are very happy.\" \u001d  Scherer said he could not provide further details. \u001d  Representatives for Google did not immediately reply to an e-mail request for further comment on the deal. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:38 ET (16:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b175e964d32d53935570d2f024edaf9e","symR":["LGOV"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Largo Vista Group Gets Wells Notice >LGOV","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T19:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LGOV"],"IndustryCodes":["PIP"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:19 ET (19:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b19fb1c730682010e360137e66522170","symR":["SNTO"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Sento Gets Nasdaq Notice Regarding Delay In Holding Annual Hldrs Meeting","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SNTO"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 16:08 ET (20:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b1c3ef1f985a2d2b9e2c824ce4433e2b","symR":["CBM"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Cambrex Special Cash Dividend To Total $400M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBM"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:18 ET (15:18 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b1e3f3fadb7997322d35d768025b60dc","symR":["TY"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Tri-Continental Enters Pact With Hldr Grp To Avoid Proxy Contest","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TY"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 14:28 ET (18:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b2086ff939b8e7bae150595389cdaa8e","symR":["LH","US50540R4092"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Chmn MACMAHON Sells 28,300 Of LABORATORY CORP OF AMERICA HOLDINGS >LH-Amended","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LH","US50540R4092"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 (Amended Filing) \b \bISSUER: LABORATORY CORP OF AMERICA HOLDINGS \bSYMBOL: LH \b \bFILER: MACMAHON THOMAS P \bTITLE: Chairman of the Board \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/2/07             Sale                     28,300      $72.09      $2,040,144 \b(10b5-1 Plan Indicated)* \b \bOWNERSHIP: 139,516 (Direct) \b \b  * - A 10b5-1 plan enables an insider to establish a program to make trans- \b      actions according to an advance plan.

SpA (PC.MI) moved to oust Rossi because of a conflict over strategy. \u001d  Telecom Italia Deputy Chairman Carlo Buora will take on Rossi's position as chairman until a new one can be named, a person familiar with the matter told Dow Jones Newswires Friday. \u001d  Rossi Wednesday had said he wouldn't resign even if Pirelli chose to oust him, but by Thursday, newspaper La Repubblica reported that Rossi was considering resigning. \u001d  The news follows a period of stormy relations between Pirelli Chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera and Rossi over strategy and over Tronchetti Provera's several attempts to sell his controlling stake to foreign telecoms operators. \u001d  Tronchetti Provera's aim to exit Telecom has brought him into open conflict with Prime Minister Romano Prodi since Prodi is keen to see the company remain in Italian hands. That conflict resulted in Tronchetti Provera's resignation as Telecom Italia chairman late last year. \u001d  Rossi was brought in as chairman to make peace with the government. \u001d  After months of inconclusive talks with potential buyers, Tronchetti Provera stunned the business community last week when he announced a possible deal with America's AT&T (T) and Mexico's America Movil (AMOV). \u001d  Cabinet ministers, reacting to the announcement, have called for another solution that would protect the company from possible foreign control. \u001d  Tronchetti Provera's moves have also angered other Telecom Italia shareholders. \u001d  Two of Telecom Italia's largest shareholders, Mediobanca SpA (MB.MI) and Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G.MI), said late Wednesday they hadn't been consulted by Pirelli on management changes. Mediobanca was not consulted on the AT&T talks either, another person familiar with the matter said. \u001d  Olimpia, an unlisted holding, shares control of Telecom Italia under a shareholders' pact with investment bank Mediobanca and insurer Generali, which together own 5.2%. \u001d  France Telecom (FTE) and Telefonica SA (TEF) are considering individual counteroffers to tentative bids by AT&T Inc. and America Movil SA de CV for a combined 66.6% stake in Olimpia. \u001d  In addition to those potential buyers, Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISNPY) said it is ready to team up with other financial institutions to end the battle for control of Telecom Italia and keep the company in Italian hands, without ruling out a partnership with AT&T and America Movil. \u001d  Mediobanca is being pressured by the government and other members of Italy's business establishment to find a \"national solution,\" a person familiar with the matter told Dow Jones Newswires earlier this week. \u001d  Tronchetti Provera's proposed replacement for Rossi is Pasquale Pistorio, a Telecom Italia director and former chairman of semiconductor firm STMicroelectronics NV (STM), according to people familiar with the matter. \b \u001d  -By Jennifer Clark, Dow Jones Newswires; 39 335 833 5761; jennifer.clark@dowjones.com \u001d  (Jonathan Vuocolo, Jason Singer, Gabriel Kahn, Giada Zampano and Sabrina Cohen contributed to this story) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:01 ET (16:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b34a9636086523403789766d3e66c5f3","symR":["AA","GE","US0138171014","US3696041033"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"US STOCKS VIEW: Jobs Report May Hurt US Shares Next Week","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AA","GE","US0138171014","US3696041033"],"IndustryCodes":["ALU","IDD","SCR","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Ciara Linnane \b   A Dow Jones Column \b \u001d  A stronger-than-expected March jobs report will probably hurt U.S. stocks when investors have their first chance to react to the numbers on Monday. \u001d  Traders will likely drive shares lower when they return from the Easter holiday, suspecting the Federal Reserve's next move would be to hike rates and not to cut them, strategists said Friday. \u001d  Market optimists have been pinning their hopes on the Fed swooping in to rescue the weak U.S. economy with a rate cut. Lower rates would also help the housing sector, the market's main focus of concern as the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market continues with defaults on home payments and foreclosures surging. \u001d  \"Right now, bad news is good news for equities. We're really looking for the Fed to cut rates sooner rather than later,\" said Stephen Sachs, head of trading at Rydex Investments. \"Anything that upsets those hopes is bad for the stock market.\" \u001d  The Labor Department said Friday that the economy added 180,000 jobs in March, above the 168,000 jobs expected from a MarketWatch poll of economists. The jobless rate fell to 4.4% from 4.5% in February, against expectations it would remain unchanged. \u001d  Average hourly earnings rose an expected 0.3%, putting the annual rate at 4%. That's down from the 4.3% pace seen in December but still well above the Fed's comfort zone. Wage growth is a chief concern of Fed policymakers, who fear that wage pressures could nurture an inflationary psychology in the economy. \u001d  The shift in interest rate expectations was reflected in Federal funds futures, which fell after the report. The slim odds the market had priced in for near-term rate cuts have been almost erased. The May contract is indicating the rate will remain at 5.25% in May, while the July contract is pricing in a 12% chance for a rate cut to 5% at the June meeting, down from 20% odds Thursday. Treasurys tumbled Friday in a shortened trading session in New York. \u001d  \"We still look for the Fed to remain sidelined through the summer, but see better risk that the next Fed move will be a boost in rates, rather than a cut before year end,\" said analysts at research firm Action Economics. \u001d  The jobs report will set the tone for next week's trade but it's not the only important piece of data, according to Charles Campbell, head of sales at Miller Tabak. \u001d  The minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting will be released on Wednesday and could revive worry that the Fed is focused on fighting inflation to the detriment of the economy, he said. \u001d  The producer price index due on Friday \"could be a problem, too, if inflation is too strong,\" he said. \u001d  Next week also sees the launch of the first-quarter earnings season with aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. scheduled to report results after the bell Tuesday. \u001d  And then there's the broader political picture to consider, Campbell said. \u001d  \"You still have Iran as an issue and you still have Syria,\" he said. \"These problems are not going away.\" \u001d  U.S. stocks closed the shortened week higher on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 1.7% on the week. The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 1.6% and the Nasdaq composite (RIXF) enjoyed a 2.1% gain. \b \b   Earnings Back in Focus \b \u001d  Alcoa (AA) is expected to report earnings of 75 cents a share when it publishes results for the first three months of the year on Tuesday afternoon, according to estimates from Thomson Financial. \u001d  Earnings are expected to slow from the fourth quarter when they climbed 58% -- or 111% excluding one-time items. \u001d  On the plus side, resurgent aluminum prices are again likely to underpin profits at Alcoa, which is now vying with Russia's UC Rusal for the title of the world's largest aluminum producer. \u001d  But Alcoa encountered some rough ground over the quarter, including a general strike in Guinea where it has a joint venture producing bauxite, or aluminum ore. \u001d  Credit Suisse analyst David Gagliano cited the strike and increased start-up costs at a smelter in Iceland when he cut his first-quarter profit forecast by five cents to 76 cents a share in a note published Thursday. \u001d  The other heavyweight earnings report due next week is from General Electric Co. (GE), which will release its results on Friday before the market opens. \u001d  Given GE's strong role as a financial services provider, and as the fifth-biggest subprime lender in the U.S., traders will be looking for clues on just how far the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market stretches into the lending industry. \u001d  GE likely isn't in danger of missing its consensus, as its net exposure to the riskier lending section of the mortgage market is relatively low, but the quarter's \"puts and takes,\" including restructuring costs, will be evaluated closely. \u001d  Analysts polled by Thomson Financial forecast earnings, on average, of 44 cents a share, the middle of GE's own estimate of 43 cents to 45 cents a share. \u001d  Analyst forecast sales at the Fairfield, Conn., maker of industrial and consumer products at $39.8 billion, which would be an increase of more than 5% over the prior year's first quarter. \u001d  Overall corporate earnings expectations for this quarter are gloomy with most analysts forecasting an end to the record 14 consecutive quarters of company earnings rising more than 10% on average. \u001d  Thomson Financial is expecting S&P 500 companies to achieve average earnings growth of about 4%. At Zacks Research, the forecast is for 8.3% growth. \u001d  Also dampening earnings strength in the first quarter are comparisons with the year-ago period, when some big companies benefited from a post-Hurricane Katrina construction boom, said Zacks senior market analyst Charles Rotblut. \u001d  \"In general the economy was a little bit stronger last year than it was this year,\" he said. \b \b   Economic Spotlight \b \u001d  The economic calendar is light next week although some key reports are slated for release, starting Wednesday with the latest Fed meeting minutes. \u001d  Economists polled by MarketWatch are expecting the March import price index due Thursday to rise 0.8% after 0.2% in February. \u001d  On Friday, the February trade gap is expected to widen to $60.2 billion from $59.1 billion in January. \u001d  The producer price index is expected to climb 1% in March after rising 1.3% in February. Core producer prices - excluding food and energy prices - are expected to climb 0.2% after a 0.4% rise in February. \b \u001d  (Ciara Linnane is markets editor for MarketWatch in New York.) \b \u001d  -By Ciara Linnane, 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 14:27 ET (18:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b34c88ec7f385c9e830b119d5508d9f8","symR":["NFLX"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Chmn HASTINGS Sells 10,000 Of NETFLIX INC >NFLX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T20:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NFLX"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: NETFLIX INC \bSYMBOL: NFLX \b \bFILER: HASTINGS REED \bTITLE: Chairman of the Board \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/5/07             Exercise*                 2,500       $1.50          $3,750 \b4/5/07             Sale                     10,000      $24.44        $244,400 \b(10b5-1 Plan Indicated)** \b \bOWNERSHIP: 0 (Direct)  2,973,848 (Indirect) \b \b  * - Exercised 5 years, 8 months after vesting and 4 years, 3 months before \b      expiration. \b ** - A 10b5-1 plan enables an insider to establish a program to make trans- \b      actions according to an advance plan.

Niaspan is the leading medication for boosting HDL cholesterol -- the \"good\" cholesterol. \b \u001d  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States, and studies have shown that every 1 percent increase in HDL cholesterol is associated with a 2 percent decrease in heart disease risk. \b \u001d  \"Niaspan has the proven ability to elevate good cholesterol, a known risk factor in cardiovascular disease,\" said Eugene Sun, M.D., vice president of Global Pharmaceutical Clinical Development, Abbott.  \"With the FDA approval of a new Niaspan coated tablet, our next step is to expand upon two published studies to determine the effect on flushing intensity.  We'll do that by initiating larger clinical studies.\" \b \u001d  Niaspan is the only FDA-approved, once-daily extended-release prescription niacin formulation for the treatment of lipid disorders with an ability to significantly raise HDL cholesterol.  Collective results from three major clinical studies show an average 22 percent increase of HDL for patients receiving 2000 mg of Niaspan at bedtime.  Niacin is also indicated for the secondary prevention of heart attacks, and in combination with a bile acid binding resin, niacin is indicated to promote regression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with history of coronary artery disease. \b \u001d  \"More and more, physicians and their patients understand that good cholesterol management means trying to bring all lipid parameters to optimal levels,\" said Richard Karas, M.D., Ph.D., professor of medicine, Tufts-New England Medical Center, Boston, MA.  \"Introducing a new coated tablet that may enhance patient convenience is an important factor in improving our ability to provide good cholesterol management for our patients,\" he added. \b \b    About Niaspan \b \u001d  Available since 1997, Niaspan is the only FDA-approved, once-daily extended-release prescription formulation of niacin for treating abnormal cholesterol levels. \b \b    Indications \b \u001d  Niaspan is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate, to reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL- C, Apo B, and triglyceride levels, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia.  In patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hypercholesterolemia, niacin is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent non-fatal myocardial infarction or in patients with coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia, niacin, in combination with a bile acid binding resin, is indicated to slow progression or promote regression of atherosclerotic disease. \b \b    Important Safety Information \b \u001d  Niaspan is contraindicated in patients with allergies to any of its ingredients, active peptic ulcer disease, significant or unexplained persistent liver dysfunction, or arterial bleeding.  Niaspan should not be substituted for equivalent doses of immediate-release niacin.  Niaspan should be prescribed with caution in patients who consume substantial amounts of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease.  Liver function tests should be performed on all patients during therapy with Niaspan.  Use of Niaspan with other lipid-altering medications called statins may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis, a rare condition that causes muscles to breakdown. The most common side effect with Niaspan is flushing of the skin.  Patients with diabetes should carefully monitor their blood sugar and report changes to their doctor.  Other commonly reported side effects include indigestion, headache, pain, abdominal pain, nausea, itching, diarrhea, runny nose, vomiting and rash. \b \u001d  More information about Niaspan, including full prescribing information, is available on the Web site www.rxabbott.com/pdf/niaspan.pdf or by calling Abbott Medical Information at 1-800-633-9110. \b \b    About Abbott \b \u001d  Abbott (NYSE: ABT) is a global, broad-based health care company devoted to the discovery, development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals and medical products, including nutritionals, devices and diagnostics.

But she finds herself increasingly adjusting her holdings to rein in risk, bracing for what many see as an inevitable, and possibly imminent, downturn. \u001d  A managing director at Babson Capital Management, where she has worked since 1997, Fields typically divides the high-yield market into three tiers of risk and allocates her investments based on value. Over the past three years, she has been overweight in the riskiest tier of junk bonds, which have rewarded investors with robust yields and outsized returns. Now, with an anticipated increase in default rates looming larger, Fields has shifted some of her portfolio out of the most highly speculative debt and into the middle range of the junk bond market. \u001d  At Babson, Fields manages the Mass Mutual Premier High Yield Mutual Fund, a five-star Morningstar-rated fund with $176 million in assets. Mass Mutual Financial Group is the parent company of Babson Capital. Including composite accounts and several separate ones, Fields manages about $550 million in total assets. \u001d  Fields' strategy begins with an analysis of an individual company's credit, then she overlays data about that credit's sector along with macroeconomic information. \"I'm very much a fundamental value credit investor,\" she said. \u001d  Her forays into riskier territory are guided by a belief in the health of a particular company or, on occasion, its industry. Fields believes that many of the lowest-grade, CCC-rated credits are companies that have stumbled but are capable of rebounding. She notes that investors are often scared off by a CCC rating. \u001d  During 2006, one of her fund's top performers was Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR), a CCC-rated cable company but one in which she saw good credit metrics, including a growing subscriber base and improving cash flow. \u001d  \"We like the outlook for the cable sector in general, so we were willing to go down the credit ladder a bit,\" she said. One of the biggest positions she took was in Charter and it paid off, returning 51.6% for her fund during 2006, Fields said. She has since sold off some of her holdings in Charter but still maintains a position in the credit and considers it an attractive longer-term investment. \u001d  Despite the windfall from Charter, Fields' fund recorded a 12.16% gross increase during 2006 (an 11.3% return after expenses, as measured by Morningstar). That's a solid performance by nearly any measure, but only slightly ahead of the 11.85% performance in the overall junk bond market, according to Lehman Brothers. Fields said she largely avoided what turned out to be the year's most lucrative sectors: airlines, which Fields prefers to avoid based on the industry's troubled history, and auto makers, which entered 2006 on extremely shaky ground. \u001d  \"The challenge last year was that Ford and GM did very well, and they're such a large part of the (high-yield) index,\" she said. \"As a manager, if you weren't willing to make those big bets, it was tough to outperform the index.\" \u001d  At a time when high-yield bonds' risk premiums - or spreads over Treasury rates - are near record lows, companies are able to cheaply offer increasingly speculative debt to yield-starved investors. Many new deals provide minimal covenant protection to bondholders in case of such events as leveraged buyouts, which can saddle companies with new debt and push existing bondholders lower in the repayment pecking order. Many offerings also are designed to raise money to buy back stock, benefitting shareholders but ratcheting up a company's leverage. With these trends coinciding with a boom in leveraged loans, which are senior to bonds, Fields says she has become particularly circumspect when it comes to new bond issues. \u001d  \"A lot of new deals we're not participating in,\" she said. \"We have to be comfortable with capital structures. If something's coming with a risky capital structure and not-so-great covenants, we think we can find better value in the secondary market.\" \u001d  Conversely, Fields said, one can find good value in new issues during bear markets, such as the one in 2002, when she shifted more of her allocation to new bonds as companies were forced to pay higher interest rates to come to market. \u001d  After months of default rates hovering near historic lows, credit markets have been watching nervously for signs of an economic downturn while trying not to bail out of the highest-yielding bonds too soon. Over the past three months, Fields said, she has become particularly wary of sectors that depend heavily on consumer confidence, moving some of her holdings out of such areas as retail and housing. \u001d  Asked how she expects to weather a turn in the credit cycle, Fields points to her fund's performance during the last shakeout. Although defaults skyrocketed from 2002 to 2003, Fields said, her fund's default rate since 2000 is a mere 1.5%, while the default rate for the high-yield index is 8%. \u001d  If high yield sees a reversal, she said, she feels confident sticking to her guns. \u001d  \"It all comes from a bottom-up credit examination,\" she said. \"We want companies that have adequate cash flow and enough hard assets or enterprise value to cover their debts.\" \u001d  (Michael Aneiro covers the high-yield and convertible bond markets for Dow Jones Newswires.) \u001d  -By Michael Aneiro, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189; michael.aneiro@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 07:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b7814219b1405ddda93a3bcd4d18f5ab","symR":["PRZ"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"PainCare Continues To Believe It'll Divest Ambulatory Surgery Ctrs By 2Q","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T12:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PRZ"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 08:32 ET (12:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b7af2acc31685297843d5687813c4aa5","symR":["CBM"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Cambrex Declares $14/Shr Special Cash Dividend","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBM"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:18 ET (15:18 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b7feb54bdb397362cd9d6847e010e4ab","symR":["TJX"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Chmn CAMMARATA Surrenders 19,642 Of TJX COMPANIES INC >TJX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T21:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TJX"],"IndustryCodes":["RTS","SAP","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: TJX COMPANIES INC \bSYMBOL: TJX \b \bFILER: CAMMARATA BERNARD \bTITLE: Chairman of the Board \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/5/07             Surrender*               19,642      $27.89        $547,815 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 1,003,733 (Direct) \b \b  * - Insiders can surrender shares back to the company to pay taxes or cover \b      the cost of an option exercise. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

(H) to pay higher financing costs Thursday on its $3.15 billion junk-bond offering. \u001d  Deteriorating home sales amid a tightening of lending standards made investors more cautious about the already heavily-indebted Realogy, especially when the funds raised will finance the company's $6.6 billion leveraged buyout by private equity firm Apollo Management. \u001d  The deal, which was originally expected to price Thursday morning, officially sold late in the day after tough negotiations between the borrower and investors. \u001d  \"Sometimes deals get so bad and you get the call from the issuer 'You tell us, what rate do you want,'\" said a market participant, who did not want to be named for this article. \"This isn't that bad, but it's sort of the next rung up.\" \u001d  Realogy paid double-digit rates on its debt, an usually high cost of financing in the current borrowers' market where investors have devoured debt from even the riskiest companies. The largest portion of the three-part deal, the $1.7 billion fixed-rate notes, commanded a 10.75% yield, a full percentage point higher than initial estimates. \u001d  The value of the bonds, however, rose modestly when they were free to trade in the secondary market soon after the sale. \b \b   The Apollo Clause \b \u001d  Investors also demanded special provisions to preempt any move by Realogy to take on additional debt to pay Apollo a dividend in the near future. Apollo Management is known for taking speedy, debt-funded dividends from the companies it acquires. \u001d  \"All the covenants are being tightened up,\" said Justin Monteith, a market analyst at KDP Advisors. \"They're kind of anti-Apollo covenants because basically the market's already uncomfortable with the housing sector so that's a sufficient risk factor. Then people are uncomfortable with (leveraged buyouts) in general, and this is a pretty highly levered one, and then to put the Apollo risk on top of that - their tradition of being bondholder unfriendly - it seems like a risk that people don't want to take.\" \u001d  Realogy declined to comment on the bond offering while Apollo did not return calls seeking comment. \u001d  Realogy is a real estate franchiser with brands including Century 21 and Coldwell Banker and also provides relocation services. While not largely exposed to the troubled subprime housing market, worries about a general slowdown in home sales kept investors at bay. \u001d  A fund manager who decided against buying the bonds said Realogy's sensitivity to the housing market was the sticking point. \u001d  As for the new provisions on the debt, a market participant said investors negotiated a \"restricted payments\" covenant, which would limit the company from being able to pay a dividend to the owners until the company cuts its debt load. \u001d  Dividends, especially debt-funded ones, aren't good for bondholders because it means a company's cash on hand isn't being used to pay down debt or finance operational improvements. \u001d  Including the new debt, Realogy's pro forma debt will be 10 times its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, according to Standard & Poors. \u001d  The added protective provision requires Realogy to cut its debt to six times cash flow projections, including dividend-related debt, before paying out its private equity sponsor, according to market participants familiar with the terms of the offering. \b \b   Past Is Present \b \u001d  Realogy as a bond issuer isn't unfamiliar with covenant negotiations. \u001d  When the company still carried investment-grade ratings, investors won a provision that entitled them to a quarter-point increase in the coupon for every downgrade of the credit into junk. That covenant was included on a $1.2 billion offer in October. \u001d  Realogy is now rated well below investment-grade, with S&P putting it at B+ and Moody's Investors Service, at B3. \u001d  Investors also negotiated for a change of control covenant in the October offering, which means bondholders could sell their bonds back to Realogy at 100% of their principal amount - plus accrued and unpaid interest - as a result of changing ownership. \u001d  In its foray in the junk the market this week, Realogy also faced pushback on the $1.95 billion loan portion of the financing package. It was initially expected to sell at a rate of 225 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate, yet that guidance rose to 300 basis points over the course of negotiations, a market source said. \b \b   -By Cynthia Koons and Michael Aneiro, Dow Jones Newswires;

(TXU) urged the company Friday to negotiate with Texas regulators and not carry out a threat to shut down power plants. \u001d  In response to charges by staff of the Public Utility Commission of Texas that TXU manipulated the Texas wholesale power market in 2005, the company warned Thursday that it it could be forced to shut down some power plants if it couldn't settle the charges. \u001d  Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co. and TGP, which are leading a $32 billion buyout of TXU, said Friday they were not aware TXU was considering shutting down power plants and were opposed to such a course of action. \u001d  \"TXU is not permitted to unilaterally shut down power plants,\" the firms said in a statement. \"Such a step can only be done after a review by the(Electricity Reliability Council of Texas). There is no intention among the investor group to shut down plants, especially those needed to ensure reliability.\" \u001d  The firms said they would send a a letter to the commission \"confirming these commitments.\" \u001d  TXU, the state's largest power generator, didn't say how many of its older, natural gas-fired plants it might close or turn over to other operators. But it warned that the state's wholesale electric market might be disrupted as a result. \u001d  Last week, the Public Utility Commission staff proposed a $210 million penalty against TXU over charges that during the summer of 2005 it sold power at inflated prices. \u001d  TXU has contested the charges, which come as the utility is trying to sell itself to KKR, TGP and a group of banks in what would be the largest leveraged buyout ever. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:17 ET (19:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c2b298837c5320c511d91730f113c12c","symR":["SCS"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Dir PEW III Sells 164,092 Of STEELCASE INC >SCS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T17:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SCS"],"IndustryCodes":["FTR","HPR","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: STEELCASE INC \bSYMBOL: SCS \b \bFILER: PEW ROBERT C III \bTITLE: Director \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/4/07-4/5/07      Sale                    164,092      $19.98      $3,277,984 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 11,856 (Direct)  2,000 (Indirect) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

Secured creditors will be paid in full, but current shareholders will see their shares canceled and will recover nothing under the plan. \u001d  The proposed plan also incorporates a new labor deal Yucaipa reached with the Teamsters union, which represents most of Allied's 5,500 workers. The deal includes a 15% across-the-board pay cut over three years. \u001d  The proposed reorganization also includes the possible sale, subject to Yucaipa's approval, of Allied's Canadian operations. \u001d  Yucaipa's Performance Transportation Services Inc., an industry rival, would likely serve as the lead bidder for the Canadian operations if Allied chooses to sell. \u001d  Separately, the bankruptcy court on Thursday gave Allied interim approval to enter into a $15 million financing arrangement with a Yucaipa affiliate in order to revamp its aging fleet of tractor-trailers. \u001d  The company, which has been hit with higher-than-anticipated costs of repairing and maintaining its existing fleet, wants to buy a total of 150 tractor-trailers that another vehicle transporter is auctioning off. \u001d  According to Allied, it doesn't have the money to buy the tractor-trailers.

(PC.MI) and the Benetton family to control Telecom Italia, omitted Rossi's name from a list of proposed new board members released this week ahead of a shareholders' vote April 16 - making it difficult, if not impossible, for Rossi to maintain control of the company. \u001d  A Telecom Italia statement said the resignation was effective immediately. \u001d  The move comes as Olimpia is negotiating to sell two-thirds of its 18% stake to U.S. telecoms giant AT&T (T) and its Mexican affiliate. \u001d  Rossi initially signaled he would counter the move to oust him, but he appeared resigned to his fate in an interview with the Rome daily La Repubblica published Friday, saying he didn't plan to show up at the shareholders meeting. \u001d  Rossi, a widely respected figure who once ran the stock market regulator and was appointed soccer commissioner to steer the game through last year's scandals, became chairman of Telecom Italia in September after Marco Tronchetti Provera resigned in an open spat with the government over the company's future. \u001d  Rossi told La Repubblica that the two came to loggerheads over Rossi's attempts to clear up conflicts of interest in the company. \u001d  \"We started on a collision course when I tried - for the wellbeing of the company, the market and the country - to address conflicts of interest between Tronchetti and Telecom.

Pistorio's name also was on the list. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 09:29 ET (13:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d073a7df5465ed54091a8aacf7fdec00","symR":["TXU","US8731681081"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"KKR: No Intention Among Investor Grp To Shut Down TXU Plants","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TXU","US8731681081"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 14:44 ET (18:44 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d07cbac7d6710b63025d20a99120ade8","symR":["WAG"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Walgreen Co.

(NYSE: AHM) announced today that it expects lower income in the first quarter and full year 2007 than previously forecasted due to conditions in the secondary mortgage and mortgage-backed securities markets. \b \u001d  Michael Strauss, American Home's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"During March, conditions in the secondary mortgage and mortgage securities markets changed sharply. In particular, these markets were characterized by far few buyers offering materially lower prices, both for loan pools and for \"AA\", \"A\", \"BBB\" and residual mortgage securities. These changes had a significant, adverse impact on our Company's first quarter results, reducing our gain on sale revenue and causing mark-to- market losses in our portfolio. While the market may recover, and while we will attempt to restore our gain on sale margins by raising interest rates charged to consumers, our working assumption must be that current market conditions will persist and that our gain on sale margins will not recover through the balance of the year. Consequently, I am disappointed to report that our Company is lowering its full year earnings guidance and its dividend policy.\" \b \b   First Quarter Results \b \u001d  The Company's first quarter results will be adversely affected by lower gain on sale margins. As March progressed, loan pools offered for sale by the Company received relatively few bids at lower than expected prices. As a result, those loans originated by the Company in late February and during March earned lower gain on sale revenues than were anticipated. \b \u001d  The Company's first quarter results will also be adversely affected by write-downs of its portfolio of low investment grade and residual securities. In particular, the Company's approximately $484 million of securities rated \"AA\", \"A\" or \"BBB\" will be written down to account for an unusually large widening in the first quarter of the spread over LIBOR at which these securities trade. \b \u001d  Additionally, the Company's first quarter results will be adversely affected by ongoing high delinquency related charges due to the Company establishing additional reserves for increases in non-performing loans. While high delinquency charges were expected, their impact on quarterly results continues to be significant. A disproportionate share of the Company's non-performing loans are repurchased Alternate \"A\" loans. The Company has ceased offering those types of Alternate \"A\" loans that have resulted in a high proportion of its repurchases, and consequently believes the portion of delinquency related charge resulting from repurchases will diminish toward year-end. While non-performing loans increased during the quarter, the Company did experience a decline in early stage delinquencies, with loans in early stage delinquencies lower at the end of the first quarter than at year-end 2006. \b \u001d  During the first quarter, the Company's loan production was approximately $16.7 billion. Also during the quarter, the Company's net interest income and mortgage servicing income were near forecast levels. \b \b   First Quarter Earnings Guidance \b \u001d  Investors are strongly cautioned that the Company has not yet closed its first quarter, and its actual financial results for the first quarter are unknown and difficult to forecast. Given information currently available, the Company believes its first quarter diluted earnings per share will approximate $0.40 to $0.60. \b \b   Full Year 2007 Earnings Guidance \b \u001d  Due to the Company's first quarter earnings shortfall, and based on the possibility that current market conditions will continue to prevail for an extended period, the Company is lowering its full year 2007 earnings guidance to $3.75 to $4.25 per diluted share. Assumptions underlying the revised guidance include slightly lower gain on sale margins in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and gain on sale margins in the third and fourth quarters similar to the first quarter. Also underlying the revised guidance are the absence of further write-downs of low investment grade and residual securities, and delinquency related charges similar to the first quarter through the balance of the year, except that repurchase related charges are projected to diminish slightly in the fourth quarter. \b \b   Dividend Policy \b \u001d  Due to the Company's first quarter earnings shortfall and the Company's revised outlook for the balance of 2007, the Company is lowering its common stock dividend policy to $0.70 per share per quarter or $2.80 per share on an annualized basis. The new dividend policy applies to the second quarter 2007 dividend payable in July 2007. Please note, however, that the Company's dividend policy does not represent an obligation to pay dividends, and that dividends are only due and payable upon their declaration by the Company's Board of Directors. \b \b   Earnings Release and Conference Call \b \u001d  American Home will announce its first quarter results in a press release that will be issued before the market opens on Monday, April 30, 2007. The Company will hold a conference call that same day at 10:30 AM EST to discuss earnings. \b \u001d  Interested parties may listen to the live conference call by visiting the investor relations section of American Home's corporate website, www.americanhm.com.

(S), the only losing bidder among four companies vying for a government telecommunications contract worth up to $48 billion, said Friday it has decided not to protest last week's decision. \u001d  The company met with the General Service Administration on Wednesday for a \"debriefing\" on why they weren't chosen for the 10-year \"Networx Universal\" contract. \u001d  Sprint Nextel informed the agency Thursday that it would not protest the decision, said company spokeswoman Sukhi Sahni, who did not offer any more details. \u001d  \"After a thorough discussion, Sprint has decided to move forward and focus on the future and continue to aggressively pursue the forthcoming Networx Enterprise contract,\" according to an official statement by the company. \u001d  Enterprise is a second government contract worth up to $20 billion, expected to be awarded in May. It has fewer requirements than the Universal contract and covers a smaller geographic area. \u001d  The Universal contract covers voice, video and data services and technologies domestically and internationally for at least six federal agencies, but is available to as many as 135 agencies operating in more than 190 countries. \u001d  Several analysts had said that Sprint Nextel would have a difficult time proving the GSA did something wrong in rejecting the company's proposal. \u001d  Sprint, which has been supplying telecom services to the government for the last 18 years, lost out to Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), AT&T Inc. (T) and Qwest Communications International Inc. (Q) for the Universal contract.

The target was destroyed in the test, which was conducted by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and Lockheed Martin. \b \u001d  Lockheed Martin is the THAAD prime contractor and systems integrator. \b \u001d  The BAE Systems seeker transmits infrared imagery about the targeted warhead to the missile's computer to guide the interceptor to its target.

The anti-piracy complaints will mark the culmination of several years of work within the administration to build a case against China over alleged intellectual-property abuses, which hit U.S. exports ranging from auto parts to scientific journals. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal's Web site, WSJ.com) \u001d  While supported by the U.S. movie and music business, the impending complaints have stirred unease among executives of other U.S. industries, including drug companies and high-tech manufacturers. Many fear that a clash with China over piracy could undermine increasing cooperation they have won over the last year with local Chinese officials on combating the problem. \u001d  Industry groups that are not expected to support the case include the Business Software Alliance, whose members include Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Apple Inc. (AAPL), and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry's main trade group. Both sectors have made their own market-access and anti-piracy advances and don't want to see that work disturbed, administration and industry officials said. \u001d  The cases will add to a growing list of U.S. trade actions against China in recent months. The administration in February filed a WTO case alleging that Beijing doled out unfair subsidies to a range of Chinese industries, while last month the Commerce Department broke decades of precedent by opening the way for U.S. companies to seek higher tariffs on some Chinese paper imports found to have benefitted from government subsidies. \u001d  The first case being filed next week will make a number of specific complaints against China's enforcement of its own piracy laws. Current Chinese law says that in the case of counterfeit CDs, for instance, one must be caught with at least 500 to be charged with a crime. The U.S. will argue that there should be no such threshold. \u001d  The case will also argue that it should be illegal to either distribute or produce counterfeit goods. Chinese law requires one to be caught doing both before being charged. \u001d  \"This case if going to be very technical, very targeted and very specific,\" said one industry official with knowledge of the administration's case. \u001d  The other complaint will target what the U.S. alleges to be overly restrictive rules on the distribution of foreign CDs, DVDs, books and other media products. The case will not seek to overturn the limit placed by Beijing on foreign films that are allowed to show in Chinese theaters, which is now set at 20 films a year. \u001d  The cases come as China has taken a number of moves recently to crack down on piracy, increasing penalties and lowering the thresholds for what constitutes a criminal act. Chinese provincial authorities have worked alongside U.S. industries to carry out a series of raids against factories and warehouses trafficking in counterfeit goods. \b \u001d  -By Neil King Jr, The Wall Street Journal \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 16:57 ET (20:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d51d198a5cedea4e6343610d28a6c91d","symR":["WAG"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Walgreen Co.

One of the injured workers was taken to a hospital for treatment, but the injuries were not believed to be serious, officials said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 13:03 ET (17:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d72225f2c429dac68a8d9686aaf05717","symR":["OPBL"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Dir HELMIG Acquires 50,000 Of OPTIONABLE INC >OPBL","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OPBL"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: OPTIONABLE INC \bSYMBOL: OPBL \b \bFILER: HELMIG ALBERT \bTITLE: Director \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/4/07             Exercise                 50,000       $0.20         $10,000 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 50,000 (Direct) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

John McCain, R-Ariz. and a longtime Pentagon watchdog, has new questions about the Air Force's choice of a rescue helicopter, according to documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  McCain wrote Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne to request a slew of documents on the so-called CSAR-X program, in a letter dated April 4. He asks whether the Air Force improperly picked a \"heavy-lift\" aircraft for a medium-lift requirement, adding to already intense scrutiny of the rescue program. He also asks whether requirements were improperly increased during the contest. \u001d  The Air Force picked Boeing Co. (BA) late last year, but the choice drew quick challenges from the losing bidders. This year, the Government Accountability Office upheld protests from Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) and United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX) Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. unit. \u001d  GAO said the Air Force improperly evaluated costs and urged new talks with bidders. But GAO rejected all the other claims made by the protesters. Details of those claims haven't been made public, but they are said to regard maintenance and helicopter performance. \u001d  McCain's letter revolves around how to classify Boeing's HH-47, a variant of the U.S. Army's workhorse Chinook. It is variously classified as either heavy-lift or medium-lift, but analysts say it's not a true heavy-lift helicopter like the Sikorsky-made CH-53. \u001d  Boeing declined to comment on McCain's letter. The Air Force said it would work with McCain to address his concerns. \u001d  \"We are reviewing his request and will respond as appropriate. However, we are confident that the CSAR-X platform we chose met all the Key Performance Parameters as required in the Request For Proposal,\" the Air Force said in a statement. \u001d  Sikorsky said McCain's letter shows the need for the Air Force to correct \"all identified shortfalls\" in the CSAR-X contest. Lockheed Martin declined to comment on McCain's letter. Sikorsky offered its S-92 and Lockheed Martin offered the US-101; both helicopters are considered medium-lift aircraft. \u001d  - By Rebecca Christie; Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; rebecca.christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d831a9edd1624faef4441c85affd2f00","symR":["DCX","DCX.XE","F","GM","MG.A.T","MG.B.T","MGA","TRA.XX","CA5592224011","CA5592225000","DE0007100000","US3704421052"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UAW Chief: Other Chrysler Bidders Offered Equity To Union","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T19:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DCX","DCX.XE","F","GM","MG.A.T","MG.B.T","MGA","TRA.XX","CA5592224011","CA5592225000","DE0007100000","US3704421052"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","FIS","OTA","XDAX","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \b   By Terry Kosdrosky \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger said Friday that parties other than Tracinda Corp. that are interested in buying Chrysler Group have also offered the union equity stakes. \u001d  UAW President Ron Gettelfinger, speaking during an interview on WJR radio in Detroit, also said that he hasn't had discussions \"with anyone from Tracinda\" and that he doesn't recall anybody else in the union having contacts. \u001d  On Thursday, Tracinda, the investment vehicle of billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, announced a $4.5 billion bid for Chrysler, which is being shopped by German parent DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX). \u001d  Tracinda said its bid is contingent on reaching a \"satisfactory\" labor agreement with the UAW, but the firm also said it would offer the union \"a substantial portion\" of Chrysler's equity as part of a deal. \u001d  Gettelfinger, when asked about that proposition by WJR host Paul W. Smith, said Tracinda isn't the only Chrysler bidder making that offer. \u001d  \"Well, we've heard that from other interested parties that we have had conversation with,\" Gettelfinger said. \u001d  The UAW represents 65,500 of Chryslers 82,400 employees. \u001d  Though Tracinda is the only firm to make a Chrysler offer public, a host of other players are in the mix. Cerberus Capital Management LP, a partnership between Blackstone Group and Centerbridge Partners and a partnership between auto parts supplier Magna International Inc. (MGA) and Ripplewood Holdings reportedly are bidding on the auto maker. \u001d  Any buyer likely will want some concessions from the union. Chrysler, like other auto makers, faces a staggering bill for un-funded pension liabilities and retiree health-care costs. The U.S. auto makers also have struggled with declining market share, fierce foreign-based competition, and a consumer shift away from the big trucks and SUVs that make up a big portion of their profits. \u001d  Gettelfinger, who has said he's opposed to breaking the Chrysler Group off from DaimlerChrysler, indicated that he may have to deal with the fact that something will happen. \u001d  The union president, who is a member of DaimlerChrysler's supervisory board, attended the shareholder meeting in Berlin earlier this week where numerous stock owners called for separating the Chrysler Group. \u001d  \"Initially, our position was that we would prefer that the Chrysler Group stay as part of Daimler-Benz,\" Gettelfinger said. \"Obviously, after attending the shareholders' meeting, and you can see what the impact on the stock was by the announcement on Feb. 14, it appears that something is definitely going to happen.\" \u001d  DaimlerChrysler shares are trading at their highest levels since mid-1999 and have gained more than 30% since DaimlerChrysler announced in mid-February that it would consider all strategic options for its U.S. unit. \u001d  But Gettelfinger said any type of transaction is going to be complex and people, in general, are taking a simplistic view. \u001d  \"There are so many potential ways that this could come out that nobody has any idea,\" he said. \"And again, some folks seem to simplify this and I just don't see this as a simple deal. This is major, Paul W. It's going to take a lot of work and a lot of effort and a lot of actual internal analysis of exactly how to handle this thing.\" \u001d  He said the people who are interested in Chrysler all seem to realize \"that this is a huge undertaking.\" \u001d  Gettelfinger said the union isn't \"in the loop\" yet on the bidding process because it's being handled by the company's management board. But he said they'll have an idea \"at some point in time\" since he sits on the supervisory board and a UAW vice president sits on the labor advisory committee. \u001d  Gettelfinger said Kerkorian's interest wasn't \"a real big surprise\" but the timing of the public bid was a surprise. \u001d  Kerkorian made an unsuccessful hostile bid for Chrysler in the mid-1990s and pushed management to improve shareholder returns, moves that ultimately led to the 1998 merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz AG. \b \u001d  - By Terry Kosdrosky, Dow Jones Newswires; 248-204-5532; terry.kosdrosky@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:01 ET (19:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d83356eec83f67a3eb04b21416a5741b","symR":["CE"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Celanese Corp Announces Final Results Of Its Modified \"Dutch Auction\" Tender Offer","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T19:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CE"],"IndustryCodes":["CHC","CHM","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 15:30 ET (19:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d89f69af8d03fd3917e062777d25c574","symR":["DHOM"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Dominion Homes 1Q Home Deliveries 165 Vs 315 >DHOM","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DHOM"],"IndustryCodes":["HOM","HPR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 14:46 ET (18:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d8bfaed8e3a8fe6bb6d5b47a9b1a952e","symR":["A","STGN"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Stratagene Chmn/CEO Sorge Forms New Molecular Diagnostic Co.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["A","STGN"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","ITC","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:04 ET (15:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d8dcdddac1418b15aefda85e315328f4","symR":["KR","US5010441013"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ(4/6) Private-Equity Shops Eyeing Kroger Co.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T06:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KR","US5010441013"],"IndustryCodes":["FDR","RTB","RTS","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From The Wall Street Journal) \b \b   By DENNIS K. BERMAN \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Private-equity firms have in recent days been training their guns on a big target: Cincinnati-based grocery giant Kroger Co. (KR). \u001d  People familiar with the matter say a number of firms across the Street have been eyeing Kroger, which carries a market capitalization of more than $20 billion, on the expectation that the company will soon begin exploring a leveraged buyout with the help of investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. It remains unclear whether such expectations will pan out. \u001d  The market for leveraged takeovers has been whipped into a frenzy in the past few years, as many public companies have been subject to buyout rumors. But the specificity of discussions around Wall Street suggests there is a lot of behind-the-scenes movement around the grocer, which runs nearly 2,500 stores across 31 states under such brands as Kroger, Ralph's and Fred Meyer. \u001d  Such a deal would represent a kind of bookend for today's leveraged-buyout craze and the LBO period of some 20 years ago. Back in 1988, buyout shop Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. placed a $4.6 billion bid for the grocer, but was rebuffed after the company decided to take on debt of its own through a leveraged recapitalization. KKR had previously bought supermarket chain Safeway Stores Inc., in 1986. \u001d  The conditions of the current buyout market aren't that dissimilar to the 1980s. Big buyout shops such as KKR, Blackstone Group and TPG, formerly Texas Pacific Group, have amassed huge war chests and have to put that money to work. A company like Kroger would allow them to spend a big chunk of money in one place. \u001d  These buyout shops have also been attracted to retail businesses, where the underlying value of the firms' real estate may help undergird the prices they are willing to pay. \u001d  It is still a tough time to be in the supermarket business. Traditional grocers like Kroger are getting squeezed on the high end by Whole Foods Markets Inc., which in February agreed to acquire rival Wild Oats Markets Inc., and on the low end by discount retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which in 2001 displaced Kroger as the nation's largest food seller. \u001d  In the past 12 months through February, Kroger notched $66 billion in revenue and net income of $1.1 billion, according to figures compiled by data service Capital IQ. The firm also has about $7 billion in outstanding debt, a figure that a company official recently acknowledged was \"at a very reasonable level.\" Kroger shares have moved up more than 40% in the past year and in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday were at $29.11, just cents off the 52-week-high. \u001d  Such strong price movements tend to discourage LBO buyers, as they make the returns of such deals less attractive. Any move would certainly up the ante in the grocery-store wars. \u001d  Supervalu Inc., parent company of Save-A-Lot stores, last June bought most of Albertson's Inc.'s grocery stores in a $9.7 billion deal, making Supervalu the nation's No. 2 grocery chain by revenue, behind Kroger Co. \u001d  In that deal, Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Supervalu got more than 1,100 stores that operate under different names, including Albertson's, across the country, while CVS Corp., as a part of a consortium of investors, got about 700 free-standing drugstores that operate under the Sav-On and Osco names. \u001d  Calls to Kroger weren't returned last evening. \u001d  (Julie Jargon contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d91d0b07f8ae3c3ae547cfb2ec028358","symR":["LMT","US5398301094"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Lockheed Martin Delivers U.S. Navy's First Remote Minehunting Vehicle","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LMT","US5398301094"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 11:00 ET (15:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d97b558602ef0c445e59b3e01e6c93b6","symR":["AT"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Dr. Maya Angelou and Alltel Wireless announce winners of second annual \"Words of Wisdom: Lessons in Courage\" essay contest","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T17:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AT"],"IndustryCodes":["CTS","TLS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b      Nine students win $5,000 scholarships to Historically Black \u001d                      Colleges and Universities \bLITTLE ROCK, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 06, 2007-- \u001d  Alltel Wireless (NYSE: AT), America's largest network, and world-renowned poet Dr. Maya Angelou today announced the nine winners of the second annual \"Words of Wisdom: Lessons in Courage\" essay contest during a reception at the William J.

Flash prices, which had been plunging for over six months, have started to stabilize and are even trending higher. And flash is finding its way into an increasing number of devices, including Apple's (AAPL) much-anticipated iPhone. \u001d  So should investors uncork the Champagne? It depends on the level of risk you're willing to take on. Those who want to invest long-term in SanDisk's growth prospects should know that the company deals in a highly commoditized market where prices are expected to go down more than they'll go up. That said, there's more to SanDisk than just how much manufacturers are paying for four gigabytes of NAND flash. Instead of chasing every price fluctuation, investors should look at the way SanDisk runs its business. Through strategic licensing deals, containing costs and constant innovation, SanDisk is staying ahead of the market and buffering itself against sharp declines in pricing. \u001d  SanDisk corners the market on flash memory cards used in such devices as MP3 players, digital cameras and USB drives. The predominant type of flash memory in use today, NAND is nonvolatile memory, which means that it can hang on to data even when the external power source is shut off. Flash helps reduce battery drain and is also pretty klutz-proof, making it ideal for all of those portable devices that we just throw in our bags. \u001d  However, SanDisk's exposure to NAND flash's fickle pricing, which nosedived 70% last year, could turn investors' stomachs. Keep in mind that unlike the nonvolatile memory that SanDisk sells, its stock has been plenty volatile. SanDisk's shares have fallen 33% since they hit a 52-week high of $66.20 last May. Now that flash prices have started to stabilize, SanDisk's shares are gaining ground and several analysts are expressing cautious optimism. \u001d  Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a report Monday that he expects pricing to remain stable and demand to improve during the second half of the year. Rakesh, whose firm makes a market in SanDisk's shares, has a Buy rating and a $53 price target. Independent research firm iSuppli, which closely tracks the semiconductor industry, says it's more skeptical. The firm recently lifted its rating on NAND flash market conditions to Neutral from Negative, noting that it remains cautious about the market and will wait to see if second-quarter pricing continues to strengthen before putting a more positive rating on the sector. \"While the brutal conditions are persisting, the turning point is near,\" wrote iSuppli analyst Nam Hyung Kim on March 26. \u001d  One of the best hedges that SanDisk has been building up against those \"brutal conditions\" are its licensing deals, which provide a recurring source of revenue no matter what price flash is going for. According to Morningstar analyst Larry Cao, SanDisk is responsible for creating - or helping to create - three of the top-selling types of flash memory cards, forcing its rivals to pay it royalties so they can use the technologies. Korea's Samsung pays SanDisk a royalty to use its ground-breaking multilevel cell technology that greatly increases a flash memory chip's capacity to hold data. SanDisk's licensing and royalty revenue was $331 million last year, up 38% from $239.5 million in 2005. The company's total revenue was up 41% in 2006 to $3.26 billion. \u001d  SanDisk continues to ink similar deals. In March, SanDisk announced a joint venture and licensing agreement with Korea's Hynix Semiconductor. The companies agreed to cross-license patents for flash memory components. In addition, they'll be working together to make flash memory chips using x4 technology that puts four bits of data onto one memory cell, thereby further increasing the memory capacity of each chip. Deutsche Bank analyst Pranay Laharia issued a report on March 21 saying the deal adds about $4 a share to SanDisk's value. \u001d  While SanDisk continues to invest billions of dollars in its state-of-the-art factories and churn out some of the most innovative products in the flash market, it's also skillfully working to keep its costs down. In this fiercely competitive and capital-intensive market that can be a tall order. As Morningstar's Cao points out SanDisk makes small chips out of large wafers. That way, it produces more chips at less cost. Having direct contact with retailers, by selling such products as its Sansa MP3 players and USB thumb drives, also helps SanDisk keep an eye on consumer demand, allowing it to adjust production capacity at its factories accordingly. \u001d  Of course, none of these things makes SanDisk completely immune to the moods of the flash memory market. Even though investors are cheering improving prices in the industry, that rising price tag could prove to be a mixed blessing. Flash makers need to endure price deterioration before it's possible for flash to be incorporated into more products. \u001d  Right now, flash is still too pricey to use in devices like laptops, which analysts see as the next \"killer app\" for flash. Companies like Samsung, Japan's Toshiba and Seagate Technology (STX) have been working on hybrid hard disk drives that incorporate NAND flash for laptop computers, yet the technology is too expensive and probably won't gain steam until prices become much more reasonable. \u001d  Until that happens though, betting on SanDisk's ability to not only tap into but stay ahead of these growing markets is a good way to get some memorable returns. \u001d  For more information and analysis of companies and mutual funds, visit SmartMoney.com at http://www.smartmoney.com/ \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"db546c0474bb1048d1b2250475df0379","symR":["INPC"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"InPhonic Gets NASDAQ Notice For 10K Delay","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T21:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["INPC"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 17:00 ET (21:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"db8a2eb376415cad860548cd3d13edf1","symR":["SCI"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Service Corp.

Tokyo eased the restrictions again in July last year, but allows only meat from cows aged 20 months or younger. \u001d  Beef is growing into a bilateral trade issue. U.S. President George W. Bush recently urged Japan to reopen its markets fully to U.S. beef, removing the 20-month-old or younger requirement. \u001d  Last month, Japan suspended beef imports from California meatpacker Jobbers Meat Packing Co. after finding packages of beef sausage in a shipment in violation of a regulation imposed over mad cow concerns, the government said Friday. \u001d  Japan bans the import of U.S. products such as sausage that contain processed beef under restrictions because of what Japan says are risks of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy. \u001d  Eating meat contaminated with mad cow disease is linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, a rare but deadly nerve disorder. \u001d  In February, Japan stopped beef imports from a Nebraska processing plant operated by Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) after finding boxes of beef, which had not been verified as from cattle 20 months old or younger, as required by Japan. \u001d  Japan limits imports to beef that has been through stringent checks at selected U.S. meat processing plants, but still imports American beef from about 30 processing plants that haven't had any problems. \u001d  Last week, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s (WMT) Japan unit, the Seiyu supermarket chain, became the first major Japanese retailer to start selling American beef, although even Seiyu has begun a cautious rollout, selling U.S. beef at 20 of its 400 nationwide stores. \u001d  Other major retail chains are staying away from U.S. beef because Japanese consumers are worried about the risks of eating American beef. \u001d  Less finicky Japanese have welcomed the return of American beef, and the beef bowl at a Japanese fast-food chain- slivers of grilled U.S. beef served over hot rice - is a big hit. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 00:00 ET (04:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e055cda7444f458b6f9d087a1075eebb","symR":["ERIE"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Sentinel Wants Erie To Consider Increasing Size Of Its Board","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T10:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ERIE"],"IndustryCodes":["INP","INS","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 06:12 ET (10:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e0830378142ad9e793f339f322d1569b","symR":["NEWC"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": New Century Receives Court Approval of DIP Financing","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T13:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NEWC"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XRUS"],"Story":"* Court Also Authorizes Continuation of Customer Programs, Employee Benefits and Insurance Policies \b \b \u001d  IRVINE, Calif., April 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- New Century Financial Corporation (OTC: NEWC) announced today that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware has approved a motion permitting the Company, on an interim basis, to access up to $50 million of the $150 million debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing arranged for the Company by The CIT Group and Greenwich Capital Financial Products, Inc. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20061012/LATH070LOGO) \b \u001d  The Court also approved New Century's other \"first day\" motions that will facilitate the Company's operations as it pursues the sale of its assets and operations through the chapter 11 process.

Asarco's corporate parent, Grupo Mexico SA (GMEXICO.MX), has said Harbinger is angling to buy Asarco. \u001d  Glencore and Washington want a bankruptcy judge to grant them and \"other potential suitors\" the same opportunity to execute confidentiality agreements and perform due diligence in order to make a bid for Asarco. \u001d  Glencore bought U.S.-based Asarco's Tennessee zinc mines last year for $65 million. Montana Resources is a copper mining firm located in Butte, Mont., controlled by Washington's Washington Cos. \u001d  In December, the pair formed ACRE Acquisition Co. to make an offer for Asarco's copper assets. The company said it would take responsibility for some of the cleanup costs resulting from Asarco's mining activities. Asarco faces about $6.5 billion in environmental claims filed by the federal government and more than a dozen states. \u001d  \"ACRE is ready, willing and able\" to sign confidentiality agreements in order to start conducting due diligence, according to court papers, but Asarco's managers \"have rejected ACRE's expression of interest in this regard.\" \u001d  Asarco wants an eight-month extension of its exclusive control of its Chapter 11 reorganization case. \u001d  ACRE says that's too long and wants Bankruptcy Judge Richard S. Schmidt to limit the extension to three months and link the extension to open up the due diligence process. \u001d  Asarco filed for bankruptcy in August 2005, two months before changes in federal law took effect that limit - to 18 months - the time a company can stay in Chapter 11 bankruptcy without filing a plan. \u001d  But since Asarco's Chapter 11 filing preceded the changes, the company isn't subject to the new restrictions on exclusivity. \u001d  Tucson, Ariz.-based Asarco wants until Nov. 10 to submit a turnaround plan and up to Jan. 29, 2008, to solicit votes on the proposal. Exclusive periods prevent other parties from presenting their own reorganization plans and interrupting the debtor company's restructuring efforts. \u001d  Mexico City-based Grupo Mexico has also chafed  at its estranged subsidiary's continued control of the bankruptcy case, saying exclusivity for the U.S. company should be linked to the availability of its financial records. \u001d  Asarco is run by a three-member board, with only one director named by lone shareholder Grupo Mexico. While Asarco is still wholly owned by a Grupo Mexico subsidiary, under U.S. bankruptcy law the company is now responsible to its creditors rather than to its owner. \u001d  Those creditors had pushed for an independent board to run the mining company in the early stages of the bankruptcy case, alleging that Grupo Mexico had mismanaged Asarco. \u001d  But a rise in copper prices buoyed Asarco's fortunes and has led to renewed interest in the company's future. \u001d  Judge Schmidt has scheduled a hearing on Asarco's continued control of its Chapter 11 case for Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Corpus Christi, Texas. \b \u001d  -Patrick Fitzgerald, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-3544; patrick.fitzgerald@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 14:33 ET (18:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e40a90315bb14e62350e0f75e2d692c2","symR":["SGAT"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Dir MUDD Buys 3,000 Of SHENGDATECH INC >SGAT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T21:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SGAT"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: SHENGDATECH INC \bSYMBOL: SGAT \b \bFILER: MUDD CARL \bTITLE: Director \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION              SHARES       PRICE           VALUE \b4/2/07             Purchase                  3,000       $4.00         $12,000 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 3,000 (Direct) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

(Amex: CVP) (TSX: CVP.un) and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays spent the off-season redesigning Tropicana Field to provide an enhanced experience for Devil Rays fans this season.  Using the same approach it used with its well-received renovation of the Club Level at INVESCO Field at Mile High, home of the Denver Broncos, and the redesign of the team store at Qualcomm Stadium, home of the San Diego Chargers, Centerplate worked with a premier design firm to renovate the stadium at Tropicana Field and created an atmosphere that reflects the history of the Devil Rays, the beauty of the Florida landscape and flavors of local cuisine.  Updated seating and concession areas, new menu items and a brand new merchandise store represent Centerplate's novel approach to stadium hospitality and design and are consistent with Centerplate's strategic vision to deliver creative, value-added solutions geared to making each of its venues a special entertainment destination for its customers. \b \b    TEAM STORES \b \u001d  Centerplate worked with the Devil Rays and redesigned their main team store, creating another touch point where customers can have a special experience at the stadium. Large vertical banners depicting Devil Rays players and a custom-illuminated logo, suspended from the second story ceiling, beckon fans into an exciting venue to browse the offerings.  The interior space has been completely transformed with oversized images of favorite Devil Rays players on the walls, and large plasma screens with baseball-related videos creating a unique destination worthy of repeat visits.  The store boasts the most comprehensive selection of Devil Rays memorabilia available anywhere, with greater selections of merchandise for women and children. \b \b    THE SAND BAR BULLPEN BEACH AREA \b \u001d  Working with floridasbeach.com, the local Convention and Visitors Bureau, Centerplate created an innovative Sand Bar Bullpen Beach located on the ground in left field designed with the goal of having it become one of the greatest places in all of Major League Baseball to watch a game.  This redesigned party area, behind the visitor's bullpen, allows fans to chat with visiting pitchers while enjoying the look and feel of an upscale beach resort with wood-toned decking, gracious Bahamian-style teak furniture and murals of local beaches. Specialty cocktails such as Margaritas and Mojitos will lend a sophisticated touch and enhance the beach resort appeal. \b \b    RIGHT FIELD STREET \b \u001d  As part of Tampa Bay's goal to create a special, memorable experience for fans, Centerplate worked with baseball archivists to recreate an area inside the stadium called Right Field Street.  This concession area and gallery brings 100 years of baseball history to life -- both nationally and from a local perspective.  Inspired by the graphic design of comic books and baseball cards, each concession area tells the story of different eras of key players, teams, and local lore that cannot be seen at any other stadium.  There are interactive stations where fans can have their picture inserted in the front page of a newspaper or experience the Science of Baseball in connection with the local Children's Museum. \b \b    FIRST BASE AND THIRD BASE CONCESSIONS \b \u001d  The concessions on the main concourse were also redesigned.  One of the more unique makeovers includes Beers of the World, which has been transformed into an old-world style pub complete with wood paneling.  Centerplate's comprehensive approach to hospitality extends to menu items as well.  Drawing on the collective talent and creativity of the company's culinary staff and executive chefs, this season Centerplate is introducing new menu items to provide fans with a taste of local cuisine in an exciting atmosphere.  Some of the new selections include a filet of grouper sandwich with citrus mayonnaise, whole turkey legs, steak and asiago panini sandwiches, turkey and pesto panini sandwiches and the new \"Sting 'em Dog\" with spicy chili and shredded cheddar cheese. \b \u001d  Centerplate, Inc., with its principal executive office in Stamford, CT, is a leading provider of food and related services including concessions, catering, and merchandise services in more than 125 sports facilities, convention centers and other entertainment venues throughout the United States and Canada.  Centerplate has provided its services to many high profile events including 24 World Series games, 9 U.S. Presidential Inaugural Balls, 10 Super Bowls, 9 NCAA Final Four Men's Basketball Tournaments and 14 World Cup Soccer games.

(WMT) named two senior executives to new positions in its U.S. stores operation, a reshuffling that reflects the pressure on management to improve the lagging performance of its domestic unit. \u001d  It named a new operations chief for the Wal-Mart Stores division, which accounts for two-thirds of its $345 billion in annual revenue. William S. Simon, 48 years old, who oversaw the company's pharmacy, vision and mini-clinic businesses, was named chief operating officer of U.S. stores. \u001d  Patricia A. Curran, 43 years old, who had been executive vice president of U.S. store operations, becomes the division's executive vice president of people, a human resources post. Last year, Curran kicked off big changes in staffing and store design to improve service and sales at its 3,400 locations. \u001d  In the third-year of a three-year turnaround effort, results haven't showed expected improvements and economic crosswinds have increased. The latest changes come a week after the head of U.S. stores, Eduardo Castro-Wright, became a direct report of Wal-Mart Chief Executive H. Lee Scott Jr. He previously had reported to a vice-chairman. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  U.S. comparable store sales, a key measure of revenue gains, rose just 0.9% in February compared with 3.5% in the year-earlier month. Wal-Mart's domestic sales have been struggling for the past year with higher energy prices and rising consumer interest rates. \u001d  Wal-Mart typically makes major executive changes at the end of its January fiscal year end. But a company spokesman said the job reshuffling isn't a reflection of impatience with the division or recent results. \u001d  Simon, who oversaw the company's launch of $4 generic drugs, is a former executive with restaurant chain Brinker International (EAT). \"Bill has proven he can drive innovation, growth and profitability,\" Castro-Wright said in a statement. \u001d  Curran, who began at Wal-Mart as an hourly worker, will oversee the division's efforts to boost employee involvement. \"We greatly expanded our human resources support in the field last year and now want to bring that even closer to the business,\" Castro-Wright said of her duties. \u001d  By Gary McWilliams, The Wall Street Journal; 713-547-9206 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:55 ET (16:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e6c76fc8a02e42f52ec9b75da90061d6","symR":["ALK"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Alaska Air Expects To Report Net Loss For 1Q >ALK","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T10:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ALK"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Adds details throughout.) \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Alaska Air Group Inc.

As a result, the service and industry are looking for ways to adopt commercial practices where possible, without hurting military capability. \u001d  Allison Stiller, the Navy's deputy assistant secretary for shipbuilding, said the Navy needs to standardize ship components wherever it can. It also needs to resist the temptation to pile on requirements for new vessels. She acknowledged this is easier said than done, but said the changes are nonetheless needed. \u001d  \"If the Navy, shipbuilding industry and ship-repair industry do not change our behaviors, the country will be unable to afford the needed re-capitalization of our fleet,\" Stiller said in remarks to the Navy League's annual trade show. \u001d  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) executive Philip Teel said military ships don't have much in common with commercial ships because the Navy buys fewer ships and makes far more design changes during construction. He said some cost savings were possible, particularly as shipyards modernize, but he cautioned that the Navy must have reasonable expectations. \u001d  \"We don't presume we can close the entire cost gap,\" said Teel, head of the Northrop Grumman Ship Systems unit, in Navy League remarks. \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; Rebecca.Christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 12:34 ET (16:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e74102166bffde0d872982f634a1ca8d","symR":["RE"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Everest Re Group Announces Extension of CEO Employment Agreement","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T13:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RE"],"IndustryCodes":["INS","INU","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\bHAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 06, 2007-- \u001d  Everest Re Group, Ltd.

By continuing to consolidate into fewer, larger operations centers, Fieldstone expects to reduce its operation costs and improve its efficiencies in 2007.  Fieldstone will continue to maintain a local sales force to serve brokers in the markets in which its wholesale operations centers are closing.  In addition, Fieldstone intends to make proportional adjustments in its corporate home office staff.  In all, Fieldstone expects the operations consolidation and retail branch closings to reduce its workforce by approximately 125 persons, or 14 percent of its workforce and is currently evaluating the size of the home office staff reductions. \b \u001d  Subject to completion of any necessary legal notices and requirements, implementation of the consolidation of operations will begin immediately. Fieldstone expects to conclude the consolidations and workforce reductions during the second quarter of 2007. Fieldstone expects to take a pre-tax charge of approximately $550,000 in the first quarter of 2007 related to these consolidations and is evaluating the timing and amount of the pre-tax charge with respect to the home office workforce reductions. \b \b    About Fieldstone Investment Corporation \b \u001d  Fieldstone Investment Corporation owns and manages a portfolio of non- conforming mortgage loans originated primarily by its mortgage origination subsidiary, Fieldstone Mortgage Company, and has elected to be a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes.

These statements are being made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results and the timing of certain events may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Fieldstone's ability to control or predict, including but not limited to (i) Fieldstone's ability to successfully consolidate its operations centers and realize cost savings;(ii) Fieldstone's ability to implement or change aspects of its portfolio strategy; (iii) interest rate volatility and the level of interest rates generally; (iv) the sustainability of loan origination volumes and levels of origination costs; (v) compliance with the covenants in Fieldstone's credit and repurchase facilities and continued availability of credit facilities for the liquidity it needs to support its origination of mortgage loans; (vi) the ability to sell or securitize mortgage loans on favorable economic terms; (vii) deterioration in the credit quality of Fieldstone's loan portfolio; (viii) the nature and amount of competition; (ix) deterioration in the performance of Fieldstone's loans sold and the related repurchase activity; (x) the impact of changes to the fair value of Fieldstone's interest rate swaps on its net income, which will vary based upon changes in interest rates and could cause net income to vary significantly from quarter to quarter; and (xi) other risks and uncertainties outlined in Fieldstone's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Cangene, based in Winnipeg, Canada, first received FDA approval for HepaGam B in January 2006 to treat people exposed to the hepatitis B virus. \u001d  Hepatitis B is caused by a virus that attacks the liver and can cause liver cancer, liver failure and death. Liver-transplant patients who have already been exposed to the hepatitis B virus are at an increased risk of reinfection because they have weakened immune systems. \u001d  HepaGam B is the first product of its kind approved to treat certain liver-transplant patients, the FDA said. It's considered an immune globulin product and is manufactured from human plasma collected at U.S.-licensed plasma centers from healthy donors. The product is designed to help the body provide an immediate immune response to the hepatitis B virus in order to fight reinfection. \u001d  Patients must receive injections of HepaGam B at the time of their liver transplant and throughout their lives, the FDA said. \u001d  The agency said it based HepaGam B's approval on clinical data involving liver-transplant patients who showed the product cut the hepatitis B virus recurrence rate from 86% to about 13%. Side effects of the treatment included headache and high-blood pressure and were similar to side effects seen with other immune globulin products. \u001d  - By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9294; Jennifer.Corbett@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 13:12 ET (17:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f05271cf4fb74969c331852849ca6cd4","symR":["WYE"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Wyeth Provides Update On FDA Review Of The Torisel New Drug Application","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T18:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WYE"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 14:10 ET (18:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f058a685460517801c36f6f1a8594ae8","symR":["TSG"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Moody's Cuts Sabre's Notes","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T15:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TSG"],"IndustryCodes":["TAT","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Moody's Investors Service: \b \bMoody's Downgrades Sabre's Notes; Assigns B1 Rating To Credit Facilities \bApproximately $4.3 billion debt rated \b \u001d  New York, April 06, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service downgraded the rating for Sabre Holdings' existing $800 million senior unsecured notes to Caa1 from Baa3 and assigned a B1 first time rating to Sabre Inc.'s first lien senior secured credit facilities ($3.0 billion term loan and $500 million revolver). Concurrently, Moody's assigned to Sabre a first time corporate family rating of B2 and a stable rating outlook. The downgrade of the existing notes and assignment of the new ratings reflect the company's significant increase in financial leverage following the March 30, 2006 closing of the company's acquisition by Silver Lake Partners and Texas Pacific Group. The downgrade concludes a review for possible downgrade initiated in December 2006 on the company's take private announcement. The acquisition is valued at approximately $5.4 billion, including the assumption of approximately $800 million senior unsecured notes. \u001d  The B2 corporate family rating reflects the significant increase in financial leverage, with $2.8 billion of additional debt from the take private transaction. The rating also reflects the company's leading position in the global distribution system (GDS) and online travel processing markets. The company's size, as measured by its pretax income, and returns, as measured by its returns on assets, are similar to business services peers rated B2, supportive of the overall B2 corporate family rating. The company's financial leverage, as measured by the ratios of debt to EBITDA and free cash flow to debt, and interest coverage, as measured by EBIT to interest expense, are similar to business services peers rated B2, supportive of the overall B2 corporate family rating. The company's business profile, as measured by its client, product, and geographic concentrations are similar to business services peers rated B3, unsupportive of the overall B2 corporate family rating. For further information, please refer to Moody's credit opinion for Sabre. \u001d  The stable rating outlook reflects Moody's expectation that the company will continue to generate strong GDS business operating cash flow, will adhere to debt reduction, and will generate cost savings such that the company's ratio of debt to EBITDA subsides to below 6.0x subsequent to March 2008. The stable rating outlook also reflects Moody's expectation that the financial performance of Travelocity (Sabre's online consumer travel processing business) will continue to improve. \u001d  What Could Change the Rating -- Up \u001d  Sabre's B2 rating could experience upward rating pressure if the company were to continue to demonstrate further organic revenue and earnings growth and lower financial leverage, such that its financial leverage, as measured by the ratio of debt to EBITDA adjusted for leases, were to be contained to less than 5.5 times. \u001d  What Could Change the Rating -- Down \u001d  Sabre's rating could experience downward rating pressure if air travel bookings by GDS means were to decline faster than current levels (approximate low single digit or less annual percentage declines), or the company were to be unable to achieve sufficient cost savings such that, subsequent to March 2008, the company's ratio of debt to EBITDA (adjusted for leases) were to approach or exceed 6.6 times. \u001d  Ratings assigned: \u001d  B2 Corporate Family Rating \u001d  $3.015 billion Sabre Inc.

Haroian immediately resign from the Board due to Chapman Capital's view that Mr. Haroian's ineptitude was an impediment to the maximization of Embarcadero's shareholder value.  This followed Chapman Capital's March 12, 2007 announcement that it had determined to seek nominees to replace Class I directors Timothy C.K. Chou and Frank M.

The sale is expected to close in the June 2007 quarter. Gaylord is expected to use the Bass Pro sale proceeds to fund its hotel expansion plans. The CreditWatch listing reflects Standard & Poor's expectation that borrowings to fund Gaylord's capital spending will be lower than previously expected, and that credit measures could improve over the next few years and be sustained at levels consistent with higher ratings. \u001d  As of December 2006, Gaylord has spent $262 million of a projected total of $870 million, which incorporates cost overruns, to build Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center near Washington D.C. Gaylord is expected to use its new $1 billion credit facility to fund expansions, including remaining spending to develop Gaylord National, although a lower amount of borrowings would be needed following the sale of Bass Pro. In addition, Standard & Poor's currently expects that Gaylord National would have a strong opening, which is currently estimated to be in April 2008. Total lease-adjusted debt to EBITDA was just more than 6x at December 2006. Leverage is expected to spike in 2007 and decline after the Gaylord National opening. \u001d  \"We will resolve the CreditWatch listing after our review of Gaylord's expected financial profile following the Bass Pro sale,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Emile Courtney. \"We will incorporate a review of future expansion plans at the company's existing Gaylord Opryland hotel and a potential new development in Chula Vista, Calif.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  April 06, 2007 10:42 ET (14:42 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f6eeebdfe44c4ae6d80906a61ff109df","symR":["AN.UN.T","HII.A.T","HII.B.T","CA0153801083","CA4368712069","CA4368713059"],"date":"2007-04-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Homburg Succeeds in Offer for Outstanding Units of Alexis Nihon Real Estate Investment Trust","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-04-06T14:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AN.UN.T","HII.A.T","HII.B.T","CA0153801083","CA4368712069","CA4368713059"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","RED","REI","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA AND MONTREAL, QUEBEC -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 04/06/07 -- \u001d   Homburg Invest Inc.

(\"HAI\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Homburg. Unitholders of Alexis Nihon who have tendered units to the offer will receive $18.60 in cash per unit. All conditions of the offer, which expired at midnight on April 5, 2007, were satisfied or waived. Together with the units owned by Homburg prior to the offer, Homburg and its affiliates now hold 25,938,238 units of Alexis Nihon, representing approximately 87% of the issued and outstanding units. \b \u001d  \"We are happy with the support that our offer has received and very excited by this transaction which allows us to expand and diversify our presence in North America,\" said Richard Homburg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Homburg. \"Continued diversification both geographically and by real estate asset class are cornerstones of Homburg's growth strategy. This transaction allows us to rapidly increase our presence in eastern Canada: mainly in the key retail sector, but also in multi-residential properties, and the commercial office sector through the addition of the 1.4 million square foot Place Alexis Nihon property located in downtown Montreal. Coupled with our already important presence in Atlantic Canada and our strong commercial and residential pipeline in the booming Alberta market, the Alexis Nihon transaction significantly enhances Homburg's leading role in Canadian real estate,\" he added. \b \u001d  HAI has taken up the units tendered to the offer and will pay the depositary for the units within the time prescribed by law.

Subsequently, Homburg intends to have the Alexis Nihon units de-listed from the Toronto Stock Exchange and to cause Alexis Nihon to cease to be a reporting issuer in Canada. \b \u001d  Alexis Nihon will suspend regular monthly distributions and will not declare or pay monthly distributions in the future unless agreed to by Homburg. \b \u001d  Homburg's financial advisor is BMO Capital Markets and its legal advisor is Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP.

The tender offer and consent solicitation is being conducted in connection with the previously announced merger pursuant to which affiliates of Kelso & Company, GS Capital Partners, ValueAct Capital and Parthenon Capital will acquire all of the Company's outstanding common stock for $27.85 per share in cash and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of KAR Holdings, Inc.
