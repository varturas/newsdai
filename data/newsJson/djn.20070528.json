Tesla, unlike any other probing system, solves the on-wafer probing challenges for engineers and test technicians who need to characterize their power devices. The power semiconductor market is projected to grow from $25.8B in 2007 to $34.2B in 2009(1) fueled by the use of power devices in everything from industrial products to consumer electronics. The broad use of power semiconductors has created a pressing need to characterize devices quickly and efficiently. Design engineers and test technicians are under pressure to speed up the time-to-market for new power devices. To drive dramatic gains in productivity, Cascade Microtech designed Tesla, the industry's first power device measurement system providing a complete on-wafer solution for over- temperature, low contact resistance measurements of power semiconductors up to 60A and 3000V. \b \b    Until now -- power device characterization has been a major hassle \b \u001d  For years, power semiconductor device manufacturers have been forced to package their devices prior to characterization and model extraction. Wafer-level measurements on power devices have historically been fraught with unreliable or inaccurate data, extra costs, and uncertain delays in development schedules. Cascade Microtech's Tesla system finally solves this problem. \b \u001d  \"The Tesla power device measurement system will reduce costs by eliminating the hassles of packaging devices before we characterize them,\" said Edouard de Fresart, power device section manager, SMARTMOS Technology Center, Freescale Semiconductor.  \"It will have a huge effect on our productivity by reducing the wasted time and steps we incur in packaging while still providing accurate test data.\" \b \u001d  Power semiconductors in demand worldwide according to Yole Developpement PowerD-06 report \b \u001d  \"Worldwide demand for power semiconductors is growing due to the double-digit demand for more efficient power utilization,\" said Philippe Roussel, project manager, Power Electronics, Yole Developpement, Lyon, France. \b \u001d  Power devices such as MOSFETs, (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor) bipolar junction transistors (BJT), rectifiers, thyristors and insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) are widely used in cell phone infrastructures, laptop computers, alternative energy vehicles, home appliances, electric trains and more. Power devices are characterized by their ability to accommodate higher current density, higher power dissipation and/or higher reverse breakdown voltage. \b \b    Technology innovations allow new on-wafer power device testing \b \u001d  Cascade Microtech's Tesla system features two new wafer probes, including a high current probe that reduces the potential for probe and device destruction during testing.  The probe can support an unprecedented 10A of current in continuous mode and up to 60A of current in pulsed mode. To reduce device heating, the probe tip is designed to minimize contact resistance at the wafer-to-probe interface. \b \u001d  The Tesla system also features a high voltage probe that ensures a high performance electrical measurement path at high voltages.  The high voltage probe provides the capability to make coaxial measurements up to 3000V and triaxial measurements up to 1100V.  In addition, both the high current and the high voltage probes feature a replaceable tip that is easily changed. The Tesla system's wafer chuck provides state-of-the-art handling for thin wafers.  An exclusive chuck top technology provides the right amount of vacuum in a delicate method that protects against wafer breakage and probe damage, all while ensuring a minimal contact resistance. \b \u001d  Other safety features of the Tesla system include the highly insulated and electrically shielded cable assemblies that provide both triaxial performance and high current/high voltage handling capabilities.  To ensure operator safety, ease of set-up and configuration, Tesla offers a safety interlock system and remote system operation.  The measurement environment and every component in the measurement path is designed and tested by Cascade Microtech to comply with voltages up to 3000V. \b \b    Price and availability for the complete Tesla system \b \u001d  Tesla is a turnkey, scaleable system. It is optimized for ease of purchase and configuration to create a safe testing environment for power semiconductor devices.

It also plans to double the number of staff there to 4,000 this year. \u001d  He said Standard Chartered's strategy in China is still focused on organic growth. \u001d  \"I don't think in China we have reached a roadblock where we can only grow our business through acquisitions,\" Nargolwala said. \u001d  He said the bank has no plans to take stakes in either institutional or retail securities brokerage firms in China at the moment. \u001d  Standard Chartered is, however, in talks to take a stake in India's UTI Securities Ltd. Nargolwala declined to say how much the stake would be, adding only that a purchase would be in line with the lender's strategy of developing its retail securities business. \u001d  A person close to the matter told Dow Jones Newswires earlier this month that Standard Chartered is in exclusive talks to buy 49% of UTI for INR1.35 billion (US$33.3 million). \u001d  Standard Chartered currently has no securities brokerage business in India, whose stock markets have been soaring. \u001d  Unlike HSBC Holdings PLC, which has repeatedly said it is aiming to list on China's yuan-denominated A-share market, Standard Chartered said it isn't seeking to list units on local bourses where they operate. \u001d  \"We are happy with our listings in London and Hong Kong,\" Nargolwala said. \b \u001d  -By Amy Or, Dow Jones Newswires; 852-2832 2335; amy.or@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 06:55 ET (10:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0c32e59c07b2b311b517bd98a0345bc2","symR":["CADAY"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Canada News Highlights: Cdn Pacific Plans New Rail Lines","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T16:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CADAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b \b                      Latest News \bCdn Pacific Plans Rail Lines To Svc Bitumen Upgraders >CP \bADF Group Gets 2 Contracts In U.S. Totaling C$15M >DRX.T \b \b                    Top of the Day \bLiquor Stores, Liquor Barn Agree On Enhanced Offer >LIQ.UN.T \bArriscraft To Be Acquired By General Shale Brick >AIN.UN.T \bStylus Energy Inc.

Italy's biggest gas transmission company by pipelines expects the investigation will \"confirm\" it acted correctly. \u001d  Snam Rete Gas said its CEO Carlo Malacarne is one of those being investigated. \u001d  The company also said the technical reliability of the measuring instruments is constantly monitored by experts from leading research bodies. \u001d  Eni said the probe was part of an investigation started by Milan magistrates last year. \u001d  The company said these meters aren't used for calculating the gas utility bills of consumers. \u001d  The companies in the sector are being investigated for possible fraud, excise duty violations and the manipulation of measuring instruments, reported local newswire Ansa, without citing sources. \u001d  Under Italian law, magistrates are not allowed to publicly comment on ongoing investigations. \u001d  AEM SpA (AEM.MI), Italy's biggest municipal utility, also said Monday it is part of an investigation by Milan magistrates into the country's natural gas market, adding it is \"confident\" of the probe's outcome. \u001d  CEO Giuliano Zuccoli is being investigated, as well as some of the managers of AEM, said a spokesman. \u001d  AEM also said the probe doesn't involve retail utility bills. \u001d  At 1504 GMT, Eni shares fell EUR0.05, or 0.2%, at EUR26.25, while those of Snam Rete Gas were unchanged at EUR4.58 in an overall slightly higher market. \b \u001d  -Liam Moloney, Dow Jones Newswires; +39 06 678 2543; liam.moloney@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 11:07 ET (15:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0e4867ea8b2290c15815607a7d53913e","symR":["PTM.YY","PTM.YY"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Indonesia Pertamina Hydrocracker Shutdown At Least 10 Days","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T09:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PTM.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 05:23 ET (09:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0eb01cf5f69dac036d851811f6e65b88","symR":["530965.BY","INE242A01010"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Indian Oil FY07 Net Pft INR74.99 Bln","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T07:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["530965.BY","INE242A01010"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 03:20 ET (07:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0f86d04ec91408e06491eda31afe05b6","symR":["OMX.SK","SE0000110165"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": OMX: The Nordic Exchange welcomes CellaVision to First North","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T07:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OMX.SK","SE0000110165"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XHEX","XSXA"],"Story":"\b   Trading in CellaVision shares will commence today on First North in Sweden.

If approved, the consolidation is scheduled to take place on Sunday, July 8, 2007 and the deconsolidation will follow on Monday, July 9, 2007 at 12:01 a.m. As a result, unitholders holding less than 100 pre-consolidation units will receive a cash payment in exchange for their units equal to the weighted average trading price per unit on the Toronto Stock Exchange for the five trading days prior to July 8, 2007. Unitholders holding 100 or more pre-consolidation units will not be affected by the consolidation/deconsolidation other than to be asked to tender their old unit certificates for a unit certificate bearing the new CUSIP number. \b \bThe REIT decided to undertake this program to reduce the large number of unitholders who hold less than 100 units, representing approximately 74% of the total registered and beneficial holders, but only 0.13% of the total outstanding units, which mainly resulted from previous consolidations and business combinations of the corporate predecessors of the REIT. The effect of this proposal is to provide these unitholders with cash representing the value of their holdings without cost or commission, and to eliminate the high costs being incurred by the REIT to issue mailings and distribution cheques to such holders. The REIT estimates that such measures will result in significant savings in administrative costs. \b \bInterRent is also pleased to announce that Maurice Kagan has been nominated to stand for election as a trustee of InterRent at the upcoming meeting of unitholders. Mr. Kagan is currently Chief Executive Officer of Sparkle Solutions Income Fund, a route operator servicing the multi-residential housing industry in Ontario and President of Amadeo Developments Ltd, a developer/builder of affordable housing. Previously he was Vice-President, Corporate with Canadian Apartment Properties Real Estate Investment Trust and prior to that Chief Financial Officer of Residential Equities Real Estate Investment Trust. Mr. Kagan is also a trustee of Carfinco Income Fund and the Chairman of Carfinco's Audit Committee. \b \bInterRent also plans to request unitholder approval for a deferred unit plan and a long term incentive plan and plans to implement a dividend reinvestment plan in the month of June. The meeting of unitholders is scheduled to take place on Friday, June 29, 2007 at 3:30 pm and will be held at the Albany Club, 91 King Street East, Toronto, Ontario. Unitholders will receive information by mail in the coming weeks outlining the details of the consolidation/deconsolidation and any necessary steps that they may be required to take. \b \bAbout InterRent \b \bInterRent is a rapidly expanding, growth-oriented real estate investment trust engaged in building unitholder value through the accretive acquisition, ownership and operation of strategically located income producing multi-residential real estate, with 3,189 apartment suites under ownership and 384 suites under contract, for a total of 3,563 apartment suites. \b \bThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities legislation concerning the business, operations, financial performance and condition of InterRent.

The government is discussing those percentages with them. We will decide (a percentage) there at the negotiating table,\" Mining Minister Jose Khan told Dow Jones Newswires in a telephone interview. \u001d  Sidor is expected to furnish the government with a detailed financial report Monday and talks will continue, Khan said, but he could not say when they will reach an agreement. The talks also include the terms of a deal to determine a new price for the iron ore the state sells to Sidor. Officials at Sidor could not be contacted for comment. \u001d  President Hugo Chavez has threatened to seize the company if it fails to offer low-cost steel to local producers and doesn't begin paying a higher price for state-supplied iron ore. The future of the company and a possible nationalization, the government has said, is now in the hands of Sidor executives. \u001d  Sidor is owned by Argentine-Italian conglomerate Techint through its subsidiary company Ternium (TX). Many observers in Venezuela and Argentina believe the company may manage to avoid being nationalized due to the political alliance between Chavez and Argentine President Nestor Kirchner. \u001d  \"I really don't want to be forced to nationalize Sidor,\" Chavez said recently but he has threatened the company with nationalization once before. In 2005 he warned the company it would have to pay more money for the iron ore supplied by state-owned Ferrominera del Orinoco or face a takeover. Sidor managed to work out new sale terms with the state shortly after. \u001d  But a standing agreement between Sidor and the Venezuelan government in effect allows the steel company to pay 27% less than the international price for iron ore. \u001d  \"That accord number 3895 expires in July. We will review that agreement and determine a new one early,\" Khan said. \u001d  As the deal stands, the minister said Sidor receives a 5% discount based on the quality of some material, then another 15% for having struck an agreement with the state.

It proposed two Pentax officials as new board members, one of which would become the new president.  It also said that it will receive two directors from Hoya, in addition to two outside directors. \u001d  Sparx invests in Pentax through an overseas fund, and it is expected to drop its shareholder proposal once the fund reaches a decision on the matter.

Some of the hamburgers you eat will come from cattle roaming what was Amazon jungle a few decades ago,\" said Marcelo Lessa, senior investment officer for agribusiness lending at the International Finance Corporation, the private equity arm of the World Bank. \u001d  That doesn't mean ranchers and Brazil's top meat corporations will be cutting down virgin rainforest to grow cattle instead. Most of the big Brazilian beef players already have meat-packing units in the Amazon biome, whether it's in the small western states of Acre and Rondonia or the southeastern half of Para state, a massive state in the heart of the Amazon. Many of the areas where cattle now roam are in the south and southeast of the Amazon, and have been deforested for years. But growing pressure from cattle could increase deforestation without proper land management, livestock analysts like Alcides Torres of Scot Consultoria have said. \u001d  This year, the IFC lent $90 million to Grupo Bertin, the second-largest beef exporter in Brazil, to upgrade its facilities in Maraba, Para, a small city on the Tocantins River which hasn't been jungle for decades. \u001d  \"Since that loan became public, we've received requests by big beef companies here for similar proposals,\" Lessa said. Brazil is the world's leading beef exporter. \u001d  The IFC's loan requires Bertin to certify its cattle purchases and guarantee buyers that the beef did not come from recently deforested lands. \u001d  IFC gave Bertin $1 million in grant cash to help small and mid-sized ranchers practice sustainable ranching and increase their per-acre head count, meaning they can increase the herd without clearing new land. The IFC and Bertin count on Amazon watchdog groups like Greenpeace Amazon and Conservation International for advice on how to assure Bertin, and its suppliers, are being good stewards of the environment and obeying local labor laws. The IFC has roughly eight employees dedicated to the Bertin project. \u001d  \"We are small financiers in the Amazon. Most of the investments are all mid-scale and private, so the ultimate question on the Amazon becomes what those private investors are going to do with their investments,\" Lessa said.   \"We'd prefer to bring more companies in the region into the IFC loop, so we can require they follow some best practices for labor and the environment,\" he said. \u001d  Other than individual investors ramping up Amazon operations in various sectors of the economy, Amazon beef's future rests on European, Russian and Middle Eastern consumers demanding that their steaks came from certified companies committed to keeping more trees in the rainforest than cattle. \u001d  \"Amazon beef is here to stay now. That's where (organizations) like Greenpeace come in to raise awareness. We'd prefer that Amazon beef is eventually treated like dolphin-free Tuna,\" Lessa said. Dolphins are often killed by commercial tuna boats because it is easier for them to find schools of tuna in areas where dolphins are feeding, trapping them in nets. Dolphins are mammals and will drown if unable to surface for air. The U.S. and Europe have embargoed tuna companies from selling tuna that is not \"dolphin-safe.\" \u001d   This month, southern Para state was labeled free of foot-and-mouth disease by the World Organization for Animal Health in Paris. All bets are on that Para will become one of Brazil's top beef exporters in the coming years thanks to cheap land and growing cattle herds. Para is becoming more attractive for both international-minded Brazil beef companies like Grupo Friboi (JBSS3.BR) and Bertin. \u001d  Lessa said more Amazon beef proposals are on the table, but in early stages of analysis at this time. \b \u001d  -By Kenneth Rapoza; Dow Jones Newswires; 55-11-3145-1488; ken.rapoza@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 14:29 ET (18:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"203fa0af8524889424abbb49de2de0a1","symR":["URS","WNG"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": URS to Acquire Washington Group -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T21:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["URS","WNG"],"IndustryCodes":["CON","ENR","ICS","REA","SVC","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Washington Group International provides the talent, innovation, and proven performance to deliver integrated engineering, construction, and management solutions for businesses and governments worldwide.

(AP)--Breaking with long-held medical tradition, a Southern California physicians group has become one of the first and largest health organizations in the nation to make prices for procedures easily available to the public. \u001d  HealthCare Partners put an itemized price list on its Web site last week, with little fanfare. \u001d  \"It feels like the right thing to do,\" said Robert Margolis, a founding physician and chief executive of the medical group. \u001d  The Torrance-based company serves more than 500,000 patients, who can now learn without asking that a flu vaccine runs $15, a chest X-ray goes for $61, and a colonoscopy costs $424. \u001d  The page can be accessed easily by clicking on \"fees for basic services.\" \u001d  The move was spurred in part by the growth of walk-in clinics at malls and Wal Marts that provide simple medical services like vaccines and ultrasounds and make no secret of their prices. \u001d  Doctors have at times thought the practice of publicizing prices was undignified and crassly commercial, and patients with insurance often haven't cared about particular prices beyond their co-payments and premiums. \u001d  But with employers increasingly shifting more costs to workers, the numbers have begun to matter more. \u001d  \"Before, if you had a $10 or $5 co-pay, it didn't hit your pocketbook,\" said Chris Ohman, chief executive of the California Association of Health Plans, a trade group that represents insurers. \"But if now you have to pay the first $2,000, the cost of an office visit matters to you a lot more.\" \u001d  Some insurance companies, including Aetna Inc. (AET), have posted prices online for some regions. \u001d  HealthCare Partners hopes potential customers will appreciate their tranparency and recognize the value of a physicians group over a walk-in clinic. \u001d  \"It shows them, 'This is why I'm paying more,' \"said health care consultant Mary Kay Scott. \"They are giving me more.\" \b \u001d  Web site: http://www.healthcarepartners.com/ \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 07:54 ET (11:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"251617b437d70517858b1aea6a172adc","symR":["SAAB-B.SK","SE0000112385"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Saab: Pakistan Order Cut By SEK1.35B","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T06:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SAAB-B.SK","SE0000112385"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 02:37 ET (06:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"255f5aaee47b8118e8164229faf01bc9","symR":["BPE.MI","PMI.MI","IT0000064482","IT0000066123"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Pop Milano, Pop Emilia Romagna Boards Approve Merger","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T16:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BPE.MI","PMI.MI","IT0000064482","IT0000066123"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XMIB"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 12:40 ET (16:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"259008e8f8a4527afdd96dfb21a7ff39","symR":["UC.MI","IT0000064854"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UniCredit May Seek Acquisitions In Germany - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T14:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UC.MI","IT0000064854"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XES","XMIB","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Italian bank UniCredit Spa (UC.MI) wants to get its house in order in Germany, management board member Dieter Rampl told Sueddeutsche Zeitung's Tuesday edition. \u001d  \"Germany has the highest priority for the group,\" he said, adding, \"At the moment we're growing mostly organically, but we will also be looking around Germany for acquisitions.\" Sueddeutsche quoted Rampl as saying UniCredit's share of private-client business in Germany is too small. \u001d  Rampl said he could also imagine other European acquisitions, although the bank was now focused on its takeover of Capitalia. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.sueddeutsche.de \b \u001d  -Frankfurt Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; 49-69-29725-500. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 10:22 ET (14:22 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"25abe0b029318e659ae4aca8819b0dce","symR":["GS.T","NHC.T","CA37989N1069","CA66705B1040"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gluskin Sheff Owns 11.6% Of Northstar Healthcare","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T19:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GS.T","NHC.T","CA37989N1069","CA66705B1040"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","SCR"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 15:37 ET (19:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"25c2ab2356d31b1b7ef8d3b4d5663132","symR":["MSFT","VIMC","US5949181045"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Vimicro And Microsoft Strengthen Working Alliance In China To Develop Digital Multimedia Market>VIMC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T12:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MSFT","VIMC","US5949181045"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","SOF","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\u001d  BEIJING, May 28 /Xinhua-PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Vimicro Corporation (Nasdaq: VIMC), a leading fabless semiconductor company designing advanced mixed-signal multimedia products and solutions, and Microsoft China, reaffirmed their strategic partnership during a ceremony in Beijing on May 24.

Negotiations between the Chamber of Mines and several leading gold and coal producers are expected begin in mid June. \u001d   It is expected that company and union negotiators will pay close attention to the wage dispute between the government and public servants which may lead to nationwide strike action if agreement is not reached by Friday, June 1. \u001d   The government's offer of a 6% pay rise has been unanimously rejected by unions who are looking for a 12% hike. \u001d  I-Net Bridge, Tel: +27-11-280-0730, newsdesk@inet.co.za \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 05:18 ET (09:18 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2e85116e0b04a05ffe64cacac68d5acb","symR":["AIN.UN.T","CA04270D1069"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Arriscraft To Be Acquired By General Shale Brick For C$107M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T12:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AIN.UN.T","CA04270D1069"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Arriscraft International Income Fund (AIN.UN.T) has agreed to sell its Arriscraft International manufactured stone, brick and natural stone masonry products business to General Shale Brick Inc. for C$107 million (US$99.1 million). \u001d  The fund said it will be responsible to pay transaction and wind-up related expenses out of the sale proceeds received from General Shale. \u001d  General Shale, Johnson City, Tenn., is an affiliate of Austrian brick company Wienerberger AG (WIE.VI). \u001d  The fund said most of the proceeds from the sale will be paid to unitholders through the redemption of all outstanding fund units at about C$7.50 a unit, which represents a premium of about 26.7% over the 20-day average price for the period ended May 4. \u001d  The redemption is expected to occur by the end of July. \u001d  The fund's board has approved the transaction and will recommend that the fund's unitholders approve the transaction.

(TSX:LMA) (hereinafter \"La Mancha\" or the \"Company\") reports that an agreement was reached last Friday between the Company, SODEMI, its current co-owner of the Ity mine, and the Ivorian authorities regarding the terms and conditions of the Ity mine's permit renewal. \b \bAccording to this agreement, the mining permit of the Ity mine will be re-conducted until November 2013 with the following changes for La Mancha: \b \b- In accordance with the Ivorian mining law of 1995 that governs the grant of mining permits, the co-owners of the Ity mine have agreed to transfer to the government 10% of their respective interest in the mine as of Friday. Consequently, La Mancha's ownership in the Ity mine is now reduced to 45.9%, SODEMI's ownership is reduced to 44.1% while the Ivorian government, gains a 10% ownership in the mine. \b \b- Following the reduction of La Mancha's participation in the mine, the Company's influential status will change from controlling company to joint control of the Ity mine with its partners. Therefore, the Ity mine financial results will be presented following a proportionate consolidation method starting at the signing date of the shareholder's agreement, in accordance with the Canadian GAAP. The previously released financial information should not be affected by this change in ownership. \b \b- La Mancha's attributable gold production target for the Ity mine in 2007 has been revised from 21,400 ounces to 19,800 ounces of gold and consequently, La Mancha's total attributable production target for 2007 is revised to 75,300 ounces of gold. \b \bIn order to minimize the impacts of this ownership re-organization on the performance of the mine, the three co-owners of the mine have entered into a management agreement detailing their respective roles and obligations. The key provisions of this management agreement are as follows: \b \b- For the first year, the General Manager of the mine will be appointed by the co-owners upon a proposal of La Mancha. After that period, the General Manager will be appointed upon a proposal of the Ivorian parties while the appointment of the Deputy General Manager will be based on La Mancha's proposal. \b \b- The main decisions will be taken by the Board of the mine by a qualified majority involving at least one representative of each side (La Mancha and Ivorian representative). \b \b- La Mancha will also appoint the Technical Director as well as the Controller. \b \bMr Michel Cuilhe, President and CEO of La Mancha noted: \"This renewed long term stability at the Ity mine allows La Mancha to envisage new ways of unlocking the value of this high potential asset. We are looking forward to work with our two partners at increasing reserves and resources and at improving the performance of the mine.\" \b \bABOUT LA MANCHA RESOURCES Inc.: \b \bLa Mancha Resources Inc. is an international gold producer based in Canada with operations, development projects and exploration activities in Africa, Australia and in Argentina.The ITY mine, located in Cote d'Ivoire, was inaugurated in 1991 and has produced more than 650,000 ounces of gold to date.

Due to rainy season conditions, the test mining project was deferred and a 270 metre long, by 10 metre wide, 6 metre deep trench was dug to test mineralization continuity and a hand held XRF unit was used to test grade control procedure. \u001d  Current activities on site consist of water table level surveying, land owner negotiations and settlements, and environmental studies. \u001d  At Santa Fe the Phase 2 diamond drill program is now complete and final assays can be expected within a month. Recent results of the in-fill program continue to improve the definition of mineralization in the north, central and southern extension to the Southeast area.

(GE), is negotiating with \"The Office\" producer Ben Silverman to succeed Reilly as the NBC network's entertainment chief, say people close to the matter. Unlike Reilly, it is likely that Silverman will have control over both NBC and its in-house TV production studio, say people familiar with the matter. Having one person oversee the network's schedule and the studio would potentially speed the progress of scripts to screen, eliminate infighting between the creative staffs of the two units and cut costs. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  Once negotiations are completed, Reilly will immediately exit the network, according to people close to the matter. NBC is parting ways with Reilly, 44 years old, just three months after renewing his contract for three years. The reorganization is progressing with more speed than anticipated, in part because Reilly discovered late last week that NBC Universal CEO Jeff Zucker was privately weighing his replacement. \u001d  The future of other senior executives, including Angela Bromstad, head of NBC's in-house studio, is uncertain. An NBC Universal spokesman declined to comment, as did Reilly and Bromstad. Silverman couldn't be reached. News that NBC Universal was considering replacing Reilly was first reported on the Web log Deadline Hollywood Daily. \u001d  The planned shakeup reflects intensifying pressure on NBC Universal and its recently appointed CEO, Jeff Zucker, to lift the network out of the ratings doldrums. Between Sept. 18 and April 29, NBC attracted an average of 3.8 million viewers age 18 to 49, the demographic it primarily sells to advertisers, a 9% drop from the year-earlier period, according to Nielsen Media Research. NBC ranks a distant fourth among the Big Four broadcast networks. \u001d  The network was no. 1 in the spring of 2005, when Reilly took over, with its performance diving the following fall. But in many ways, Reilly inherited a sinking ship. Warhorse programs such as \"Law & Order\" were fading and the network had failed to come up with a new comedy engine to replace \"Friends.\" Reilly, well-respected in Hollywood's creative community, was charged with finding a new wave of hits. \u001d  Although \"Heroes\" has been a blockbuster, Reilly largely leaves behind shows such as \"Friday Night Lights\" that - while reflecting NBC's upscale approach to programming - haven't been commercially successful. \u001d  Just two weeks ago Reilly unveiled the network's new fall season to advertisers and media buyers at the annual \"upfront\" presentation, which kicks off negotiations for ad commitments for the coming season. Last year NBC secured about $1.9 billion in ad commitments. That haul, achieved by selling more inventory at cheaper prices, was flat from the year before, when the network's ad take plunged more than $800 million. \u001d  NBC Universal's timing telegraphs to Madison Avenue that it doesn't have much faith that Reilly's new slate contains the type of hit that could lift the network out of the ratings basement. New fall programs include a remake of the 1976 drama \"The Bionic Woman\" and \"Journeymen,\" a romantic mystery about a man who can travel through time. The drama \"Chuck\" is a comedic thriller about a computer geek who accidentally embeds government spy secrets into his brain. \u001d  Reilly's successor will need to move quickly to put his stamp on the shows that are in the pipeline for fall, build morale at the network and learn the unique corporate culture of GE. NBC sees Silverman as highly qualified. The energetic producer has delivered a string of hits to various networks, including \"Ugly Betty\" on ABC, \"The Office\" and \"The Biggest Loser\" on NBC, \"The Tudors\" on Showtime, and \"Nashville Star\" for USA. \u001d  The Hollywood rumor mill has been buzzing with talk of  Reilly's ouster for months. Even he regularly commented on the speculation. At one presentation to advertisers, he presented a filmed skit where he was shown sitting in his office, bedraggled and drinking bourbon from an NBC coffee mug, as ratings plunged further and further. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 16:34 ET (20:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3373cce88d84a76457b46f3f2faebcb9","symR":["ASG.V","BEC.V","BQE.V","CA04518W1068","CA08410Q1090","CA09068W1095"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Standard & Poor's Announces Changes In The S&P/TSX Venture Composite Index>BQE.V","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T21:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ASG.V","BEC.V","BQE.V","CA04518W1068","CA08410Q1090","CA09068W1095"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","OIS","POL","SVC"],"Story":"\bTORONTO, May 28 /CNW/ - Standard & Poor's will make the following changes in the S&P/TSX Venture Composite Index after the close of trading on Monday, May 28, 2007: \b \b \b    << \b    -   BioteQ Environmental Technologies Inc.

The yield on the 2020 TES bond closed at 9.885% Friday. \u001d  Bond yields move inversely to the prices. \u001d  The yield on the TES rose as investors became warier toward emerging markets and after the central bank raised its key interest rate to 8.75% from 6% in April last year, said Manuel Rey, head of research at the local unit Asesores en Valores.   In addition, local and foreign banks may keep reporting lower profits in the coming months following the central bank's decision to raise commercial banks' reserves in order to tame rising inflation.   Starting on May 7, commercial banks began sending the Central bank 27% of the value of new checking accounts, 12.5% of savings accounts and 5% of certificates of deposits with maturities shorter than 18 months, up from 13%, 6% and 2.5%, respectively, on the accounts. \u001d  By raising commercial banks' reserves on deposits, the central bank sought to restrict credits in order to control inflation. \u001d  The commercial banks' total consumer loan portfolio rose 32% in January-April 2007 period from the same period a year earlier to COP96.82 trillion as Colombia's solid economic growth in the past year encouraged ordinary Colombians to obtain financing to buy consumer goods. \u001d  \"The measure directly hits the bank's profitable business of credit as it discourages costumers from seeking loans because banks will certainly begin increasing their (loan) rates,\" Rey said. \u001d  Brokerage Alianza Valores said in a recent report commercial banks will take one to two months to begin increasing their loan rates. \u001d  Net profit at Bancolombia (CIB), the country's largest bank, dropped 3.1% to COP271.4 billion in the first four months of the year from the same period in 2006. \u001d  Banco de Bogota (BOGOTA.BO), the country's second-largest bank, posted a net profit of COP159.9 billion in the January to April period, down 9.5% from the same period last year.

Liquor Barn Unitholders in the U.S. may not be able to sue a foreign trust or its officers (if any) or trustees, or the officers or directors of Liquor Stores GP Inc., in a foreign court for violations of U.S. securities laws.

(\"RCI\") (TSX: RCI; NYSE: RG) announced today that its Board of Directors has approved an increase in its annual dividend from C$0.16 to C$0.50 per share effective immediately. \b \u001d  \"This very significant increase in our annual dividend reflects our Board of Directors' continued confidence in the strategies that we have employed to position Rogers as a rapidly growing and increasingly profitable communications company,\" said Edward \"Ted\" Rogers, President and CEO of Rogers Communications Inc. \"These actions also recognize the importance of returning meaningful portions of the growing cash flows being generated by our business to our shareholders.\" \b \u001d  Rogers also announced that its Board of Directors has approved the introduction of a cash settlement feature for employee stock options which is a tax efficient use of cash that will mitigate dilution that would otherwise occur upon exercise of the options. \b \u001d  \"The significantly increased dividends, our implementation of cash settlement for stock options and continued debt reductions combine to provide for a balanced, tax efficient and shareholder friendly allocation of a large portion of the free cash flows we expect to generate this year,\" said Bill Linton, Chief Financial Officer of Rogers Communications Inc. \"These initiatives, together with the recently announced simplification of our legal entity structure, result in a meaningfully delevered balance sheet, the return of increasing amounts of free cash flow to shareholders, a streamlined corporate structure and the flexibility to support our continued rapid growth.\" \b \b    Dividend Increase: \b \u001d  Rogers' Board of Directors has approved an increase in the annual dividend from C$0.16 to C$0.50 per Class A Voting and Class B Non-Voting share effective immediately. The new quarterly dividend will be C$0.125 per each outstanding Class B Non-Voting share and Class A Voting share. Such quarterly dividends are only payable as and when declared by Rogers' Board and there is no entitlement to any dividend prior thereto. \b \u001d  The Board today declared the first quarterly dividend at the increased rate of C$0.125 per share (up from the previous quarterly rate of C$0.04 per share) for each of the outstanding Class B Non-Voting shares and Class A Voting shares. This quarterly dividend will be paid on July 3, 2007 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2007. \b \b    Cash Settlement Feature for Options: \b \u001d  Rogers' Board of Directors has approved an amendment to RCI's stock option plans introducing a cash settlement feature for the exercise of employee stock options. \b \u001d  Permitting option holders to elect the settlement of the in-the-money value of stock options for cash reduces the need to issue shares from treasury. At the same time, the amount of the cash payments made by Rogers are deductible for income tax purposes and are expected to result in significant future income tax savings for the company. \b \u001d  The cash settlement feature provides Rogers with the opportunity to utilize a portion of its free cash flow to essentially repurchase stock that otherwise would be issued and tax efficiently mitigate shareholder dilution that would otherwise occur upon exercise of these options. \b \u001d  Based upon the closing price of the Class B Non-voting shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange on May 24, 2007 and the then outstanding options, the introduction of the cash settlement feature for the exercise of employee stock options is expected to result in a one-time non-cash expense for accounting purposes of approximately $380 million. This charge, which could vary depending on both the trading price of the Class B Non-voting shares and the number of options outstanding on the May 28, 2007 effective date of the adoption of the cash settlement feature, is expected to be recorded in the second quarter of 2007. A future income tax benefit of approximately $140 million related to the one-time non-cash expense is also expected to be recorded in the second quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  As at May 25, 2007, Rogers had approximately 17.9 million options outstanding, of which approximately 12.5 million were vested. \b \b    About Rogers: \b \u001d  Rogers Communications Inc. (TSX: RCI; NYSE: RG) is a diversified Canadian communications and media company engaged in three primary lines of business. Rogers Wireless is Canada's largest wireless voice and data communications services provider and the country's only carrier operating on the world standard GSM technology platform.

So we're setting up in order to be able to accommodate that,\" he said. \u001d  Wideband CDMA and CDMA2000, both developed abroad, are the other two 3G technologies. \u001d  Analysts attributed a delay in 3G licensing in China to the government's desire to make TD-SCDMA more competitive with W-CDMA and CDMA2000, which are already used worldwide.    Analysts have said a key problem hindering growth of China's local 3G technology is the slow development of handsets. Nokia's involvement in developing TD-SCDMA phones could help raise the technology's competitiveness. \b \u001d  -By Terence Poon; Dow Jones Newswires; 8610 6588 5848; terence.poon@dowjones.com \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 06:53 ET (10:53 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4dc697e816cc4f9024cd14d655e9c76a","symR":["RCI.A.T","RCI.B.T","RG","CA7751091017","CA7751092007"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Rogers Substantially Increases Dividend And Introduces Cash Settlement Of Stock Options>RCI.A.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T17:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RCI.A.T","RCI.B.T","RG","CA7751091017","CA7751092007"],"IndustryCodes":["CTS","TLS","XDJGI","XNYA","XSTT","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 13:17 ET (17:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4e89ab6f7d73ff09338d71049b3ee6d6","symR":["EBR.T","CA29081X1087"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Ember Resources Inc.

Holes 607 and 608 are on a 50 metre sectional step-out from the Holes 596 and 599 that were announced previously (News Releases dated March 15, 2007 and April 3, 2007). Hole 615 is a further 50 metre step-out from holes 607 and 608. The massive sulphide horizon intersected in Holes 607, 608 and 615 is the same as that intersected in Holes 596 and 599. Assays results from another intersection of this horizon are also pending. This new massive sulphide horizon is related to a package of felsic volcanic rocks that are stratigraphically below the El Largo, Naranjo and El Rey deposits north of the fault. As a result, it opens up the potential for further discoveries of G-9 type mineralization north of the San Raphael fault. \b \bDick Whittington said: \"These results are evidence of the potential for further discoveries of G-9 type deposits on the Campo Morado property. We will continue to explore this new zone and to look for additional G-9 deposits north of the San Raphael fault. At the same time, we are now going to start infill drilling of the southeast zone to upgrade the resource category in preparation for detailed mine planning, which is anticipated to start in the fall. This will enable the Company to continue to advance its activities towards the target date for production to commence at a mine at G-9 by July 2008.\" \b \bThe in-house qualified person for the drilling program and selection of samples for metallurgical testwork at Campo Morado is Daniel Kilby, P.Eng. ALS Chemex is the analytical laboratory for the project; sample preparation is done in Guadalajara, Mexico and analysis is done in Vancouver, BC. All samples are assayed for gold by fire assay fusion with a gravimetric or Atomic Absorption (AA) finish. Silver, copper, lead, zinc and 27 to 30 additional elements are determined for all samples by acid digestion, followed by an AA or ICP finish. \b \bDuplicates are analyzed by Acme Analytical Laboratories in Vancouver. \b \bFor further details on Farallon Resources Ltd. and its Campo Morado property and photographs of the decline development work, please visit the Company's website at www.farallonresources.com or contact Investor Services at (604) 684-6365 or within North America at 1-800-667-2114. \b \bON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS \b \bJ.R.H. (Dick) Whittington, President & CEO \b \bForward-Looking Information \b \bThis release includes certain statements that may be deemed \"forward-looking statements\". All statements in this release, other than statements of historical facts, that address future production, reserve potential, continuity of mineralization, exploration drilling, exploitation activities and events or developments that the Company expects are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. The likelihood of future mining at Campo Morado is subject to a large number of risks and may require achievement of a number of technical, economic and legal objectives, including obtaining lower than expected grades and quantities of mineralization and resources, recovery rates and mining rates, changes in and the effect of government policies with respect to mineral exploration and exploitation, the possibility of adverse developments in the financial markets generally, delays in exploration, development and construction projects, fluctuations in the prices of zinc, gold, silver, copper, lead and other commodities, obtaining additional mining and construction permits, completion of pre-feasibility and final feasibility studies, preparation of all necessary engineering for underground and processing facilities as well as receipt of additional financing to fund mine construction. Such funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or on any terms at all. There is no known ore at Campo Morado and there is no assurance that the mineralization at Campo Morado will ever be classified as ore.

(AA) launched a US$27 billion hostile takeover for Montreal-based Alcan Inc. (AL). Alcan's board on May 22 urged shareholders to reject the offer on the grounds it was too low and that its completion was too uncertain due to regulatory hurdles. \u001d  \"We suggest that the government first appoint a blue ribbon panel of experts to review the issues and make recommendations on changes to the Investment Canada Act within three months,\" Liberal leader Stephane Dion said at a news conference. \u001d  \"The government should hold back decisions on major foreign acquisitions and any changes to foreign ownership rules until after this process has been completed.\" \u001d  At the same time, the Liberals also want a special sub-committee of the Finance and Industry Committees to hold hearings on the issue through the summer. \u001d  Dion said he wasn't being protectionist, but wants Canadian companies to be \"champions\" in the global market. \"For that, we need to understand more of the rules of our competitors and to see which part of these rules would make sense in Canada,\" he said. \u001d  He said the Liberals would prefer to work with the minority Conservative government on the issue and will only \"figure out something else\" if the government disagrees with the proposals. The three opposition parties together have the majority of seats on the Finance and Industry committees. \u001d  A new Ipsos-Reid survey for CanWest Global found that 56% of Canadians believe foreign ownership is a problem in Canada and only 40% think it benefits the economy. Some 48% say the government isn't strict enough in regulating foreign investment and ownership rules. \u001d  In the last two years, the Canadian government approved 64 foreign takeovers of domestic firms with a combined asset value of C$93.6 billion (US$86.7 billion), according to Industry Canada data. \u001d  A foreign company that proposes to take over a Canadian firm with assets of at least C$281 million must file an application for review, seeking approval from the industry minister, a government official told Dow Jones recently. (The threshold is based on a formula linked to gross domestic product growth so the figure varies each year. Last year for example, the threshold was C$265 million. The threshold for a non-World Trade Organization member is C$5 million.) \u001d  The company proposing the takeover must demonstrate that the transaction has a net benefit to Canada. The industry minister makes his determination of net benefit based on six factors laid out in the Investment Canada Act. These include level of activity in Canada, the number of Canadians employees and competition, among other things. \u001d  \"The net benefit is the benefit of the entire transaction.

(EET.TSX) reported today that diamond drilling has commenced on the Kobokotosou gold target in Mali West. The Kobokotosou permit is immediately south of, and contiguous with the Diba permit where Etruscan has made a significant gold discovery (see Company press release April 3, 2007). As was the case for Diba, gold mineralization at Kobokotosou was confirmed in saprolite by single sample auger drilling coincident with a weak soil geochemical anomaly, and has more recently been intersected in bedrock by rotary air blast (\"RAB\") drilling with values up to 5.0 grams per tonne gold, to a vertical depth of 30 meters. The diamond drilling program will initially test three sections of significant RAB results with coincident geophysical anomalies over a strike length of 400 meters. \b \bSome of the better RAB intercepts include: \b \b1.3 g/t over 24 meters (with 4.2 g/t over 3 meters and 4.8 g/t over 1.5 \b \bmeters) \b \b0.6 g/t over 18 meters \b \b2.4 g/t over 4.5 meters (with 5.0 g/t over 1.5 meters) \b \b1.2 g/t over 4.5 meters (hole ended in mineralization) \b \b3.2 g/t over 1.5 meters. \b \bThe Kobokotosou target is situated 5 kilometers south of Diba. The Diba gold discovery is situated just 15 kilometers south of the Sadiola Gold Mine which is operated by AngloGold Ashanti. The geology at Kobokotosou is similar to Diba with a mixture of intrusive and sedimentary rocks. The geophysical results (gradient array induced polarization) have highlighted coincident zones of high chargeability that will be tested by the diamond drilling as well. \b \bIn 2005 Etruscan completed regional geochemical surveys which confirmed the presence of several low level (25-100 ppb gold) but extensive, kilometer-scale gold-in-soil anomalies at Diba, Kobokotosou and Keneibandi. Four of these anomalies have now been confirmed with single sample augering. Until now, only the Diba target has been tested by diamond drilling. Significant gold mineralization from Diba was most recently reported on January 8, 2007 and on April 3, 2007 and highlighted by: \b \b3.9 g/t over 10 meters including 28.5 g/t over 1 meter \b \b2.0 g/t over 33 meters including 26.0 g/t over 1 meter \b \b1.9 g/t over 38 meters including 5.9 g/t over 6 meters \b \b2.1 g/t over 16 meters including 4.6 g/t over 4 meters \b \b46.9 g/t over 5 meters including 228.5 g/t over 1 meter \b \b161.8 g/t over 2 meters \b \b3.6 g/t over 28 meters including 10.2 g/t over 8 meters \b \b3.3 g/t over 17 meters including 15.0 g/t over 1 meter \b \b5.5 g/t over 16 meters including 31.2 g/t over 2 meters \b \b2.8 g/t over 14 meters including 26.1 g/t over 1 meter \b \bDon Burton, Etruscan's Vice President Exploration and Chief Operating Officer stated, \b \b\"This first test of the Kobokotosou target should give us a clear indication of the potential of this area and more importantly can demonstrate if we are looking at a district scale play with our land package in Mali West. Once these initial holes are completed at Kobokotosou we will re-deploy the drill back to Diba to follow up on that program where we have just completed a number of holes covering a variety of geophysical targets for which we are awaiting results.\" \b \bGold analyses of all diamond drill samples were performed by Abilabs Laboratories at Bamako, Mali using standard 50-gram fire assay procedures. All RAB samples were analyzed for gold by Analabs (SGS) at Kayes, Mali also using standard 50-gram fire assay procedures. K. Kirk Woodman P.Geo., Etruscan's Chief Project Geologist, is the Qualified Person overseeing Etruscan's exploration programs in West Africa. \b \bAbout Etruscan Resources Inc. \b \bEtruscan Resources Inc. is a gold focused Canadian junior mining company with dominant land positions in district scale gold belts covering more than 10,000 sq. km in West Africa.

(BBD.B.T) has enjoyed a robust increase in orders for its regional jets and rail equipment this year, but all eyes will be on what profit margins those sales produce when the Montreal company announces its earnings Tuesday. \u001d  \"Key in the quarter will be continued year-over-year progress on the EBIT margin front, in particular for the Aerospace division whose comps fnally went positive in Q4/F07,\" Scotia Capital said in a note. \"It is crucial Bombardier demonstrates continued progress in order to support ours and the Street's forecasts, as well as the current share price.\" \u001d  Bombardier's profit margins have tracked higher in the past year, driving a major change in sentiment. \u001d  In the fourth quarter, the Transportation unit reported a 4.7% EBIT margin, up from 3.2% a year earlier. And Aerospace had an EBIT margin of 4.8%, up from 4.5%. \u001d  Both UBS and Research Capital have upgraded the company in recent weeks, citing their forecasts for better earnings and margins. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's has revised its outlook on the company to stable from negative, noting improved free cash flow generation and the boom in new orders. \u001d  The expectations have also helped propel the company's share price, gaining 21% so far this year and hitting a 52-week high of C$4.92 in early May. \u001d  On Monday, Bombardier B shares closed at C$4.78, up 0.8%on the day. \u001d  While the momentum is expected to have continued in the first quarter, with profit margins in both the Aerospace and Transportation divisions seen sharply higher, many issues remain. \u001d  Analysts note Bombardier's profit margins remain much thinner than its peers at between 15-17%, and continued improvement depends greatly on growing demand for business jets. Regional jet sales - while moving higher - are still lagging and are widely believed to be sold at unprofitable levels. \u001d  Most analysts now expect the Transportation division to easily reach its target of a 6% EBIT margin by fiscal 2009. But the Aerospace division's 8% target still seems a long ways off, even with the small improvement seen. \u001d  The problem isn't the lack of sales. According to Dundee Securities, so far in calendar 2007, Bombardier has announced 119 regional aircraft orders - 65 of them CRJ regional jets and 54 Q-Series turboprops. That compares to 17 CRJS and 20 turboprops in the same period last year.   Meanwhile, business jet sales have been buoyant coming off a record year in fiscal 2007, which ended Jan. 31. Bombardier received a record 274 orders for business jets in that year, 55 more than in 2006. \u001d  According to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, Bombardier delivered 56 business jets in the first three months of calendar 2007, unchanged from last year but with greater emphasis on its larger Global Express. \u001d  And judging by the flurry of sales announced at the European Business Aviation Convention (EBACE) last week, Bombardier continues to enjoy strong orders for its luxury aircraft. \u001d  The Transportation division, meanwhile, secured US$5 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, capping its own record year. And orders have continued to flow in the first quarter, with deals announced out of Germany, China, Italy and France, among others. \u001d  Analysts are expecting Bombardier to report earnings of 3 U.S. cents a share in the first quarter, up from 2 U.S. cents a share a year ago. Earnings were 6 U.S. cents a share in the fourth quarter compared to 5 U.S. cents a share a year earlier. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.bombardier.com \b \u001d  -Monica Gutschi, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2017; monica.gutschi@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 17:04 ET (21:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"66c6ad1803bf86cdfc6568345c72fcfc","symR":["SNOFF","TRE.T","CA82934H1010"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Sino-Forest Corporation - Annual And Special Meeting Webcast Notification - May 28, 2007>TRE.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T13:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SNOFF","TRE.T","CA82934H1010"],"IndustryCodes":["FOR","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\bTORONTO, May 28 /CNW/ - Notification of event: \b \bSino-Forest Corporation (TSX:TRE and TRE.S) \b \bAnnual and Special Meeting of Shareholders \b \bMay 28, 2007 - 4:00 PM ET \b \bTo listen to the webcast, please enter \b \bhttp://www.newswire.ca/en/webcast/viewEvent.cgi?eventID=1885400 in your web browser. \b \bFor a complete listing of upcoming and archived webcasts available through CNW Group, please visit our events calendar at http://www.newswire.ca/webcast.

It issued 11,363,637 common shares at $11.00 a share. In early March, GMP analyst Marko Pencak started coverage of the company with a target of C$17.75, but since then operating assumptions have been reevaluated, according to Monday's research report. Pencak raised his target to C$21 from C$17.75 Monday. \u001d  Pencak said in the report that Universal Energy's entry into the British Columbia and Michigan residential-gas-markets is \"more efficient than we thought.\" \u001d  \"We had assumed that the company would incur costs of up to C$4 million but management stated that the total costs incurred were less than C$1 million,\" Pencak wrote. \u001d  Universal Energy began signing up residential gas customers in Michigan in April, and in B.C. in May, the report said. The Toronto-based company also sells electricity and natural gas in Ontario. \u001d  The company is exploring acquisition opportunities in markets such as California, New York and Texas, Pencak said. He added that the acquisition of an established player with a solid platform in the energy-retailing division would provide a \"tremendous opportunity\" for the company to leverage its relationship with Sempra Energy (SRE), a U.S. firm with which it has engaged in an electricity-swap agreement since 2005. \u001d  Pencak also raised his fiscal 2007 share-earnings estimate to 29 Canadian cents from 22 Canadian cents. \u001d  Universal Energy Group is down 5 Canadian cents to C$18 in Toronto Monday. \u001d  GMP has provided investment-banking services to Universal Energy Group within the past 12 months.

But many believe the bank could alter the tone of the accompanying statement to reflect a more hawkish tone on interest rates in light of recent robust activity and inflation data. \u001d  \"I think they will continue to tweak the language of the statement, and to the extent they tweak the language it will be toward a more subtly hawkish stance than anything else,\" the trader said. \"The question will be the degree to which they change the statement at this point.\" \u001d  The trader said that Friday's low of C$1.0776 on the downside is key support for the U.S. dollar. \u001d  On the topside, C$1.0840 is the site of a short-term resistance line for the currency, he said. \u001d  \"I'd be surprised if we get as wide as those two extremes,\" the trader said. \u001d  An email report from Scotia Capital said commitments of traders data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed traders paring their net long position in the Canadian dollar by C$413 million. \u001d  That is just one of the several signs that indicate a more moderate move in USD/CAD going forward, the report said. \u001d  These are the exchange rates at 9:52 a.m. EDT (1352 GMT), 8:00 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), and late Friday. \u001d  USD/CAD 1.0805 1.0812 1.0792 \u001d  EUR/CAD 1.4583 1.4551 1.4516 \u001d  CAD/JPY 112.72 112.59 112.85 \u001d  -By Don Curren; Dow Jones Newswires;416-306-2020; don.curren@dowjones.com \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 09:56 ET (13:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7211fc0512de57fb4810c0d2e139b2d8","symR":["NOK","NOK1V.HE","FI0009000681"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"=WSJA: Nokia Launches English Lesson Downloads In China","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T06:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NOK","NOK1V.HE","FI0009000681"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XHEX","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSTX","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \b   By Jason Leow \b   OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA \b \u001d  BEIJING (Dow Jones)--Nokia Corp. (NOK) on Monday launched a new service that enables Chinese to download English lessons using their mobile phones, an effort by the cellphone giant to tap into China's growing fascination with technology and the English language. \u001d  Nokia plans to charge users for the new, made-for-China service, called Mobiledu, which includes both audio and text-based lessons. The service aims to capitalize on China's enormous language-learning market, which has been growing quickly as Chinese embrace global business and prepare for an influx of foreign visitors during next year's Olympic games in Beijing. \u001d  Mobiledu \"is a Chinese service at the moment, but there is no limitation\" on where the service will be offered in the future, Marko Vanska, director of Nokia's emerging business unit in China, said in an interview. \u001d  \"We start here because we see education as very important to Chinese culture. Together with the trend of mobility, we think this is a good time\" to launch the service, he said. \u001d  China's language-learning market is expected to be worth $3.9 billion by 2010, according to a February report by Lehman Brothers. The investment bank said the sector is dominated by English-language providers mostly vying for students. \u001d  Mobiledu will shift the focus away from those in school to working adults, by adopting an \"anytime, anywhere\" learning mode. Vanska said the service, which also offers career tips and other how-to advice, will charge users about 0.26 cents per download. China has about 480 million cell phone users but it's unclear at this point how many of them will sign on to the service. \u001d  One company providing content for Mobiledu is New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc., which runs China's biggest chain of English learning and test-preparation schools. Michael Yu, New Oriental's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview that the lessons his company has supplied to Mobiledu fit easily into cell phone learning. They include audio clips to improve oral English and text-based lessons on grammar and sentence structure, rather than graphics-heavy materials that often are required for test-preparations. \u001d  Joseph Kauffman, New Oriental's assistant vice president for business development, said Mobiledu won't boost New Oriental's revenue much in the next three years, but that joining the service was a strategic decision. \"We're looking into the future. One day, people will be using phones as a learning tool, rather than a mobile phone,\" he said. \b   -By Jason Leow, Wall Street Journal Asia, (8610) 6588 5848 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 02:34 ET (06:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"721de372983689bf38cd859ffc9150f0","symR":["NNP.YY"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Nigeria Hands Over Three Privatized Refineries To Investors","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T17:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NNP.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LAGOS (Dow Jones)--The Nigerian government Monday handed over three of the country's refineries to the new investors who recently acquired controlling interest in them, the agency responsible for privatization said. \u001d  The Bureau of Public Enterprises, the agency responsible for privatization of state enterprises, said it had handed the Port Harcourt Refining Co. - which comprises the Old and New Port Harcourt Refineries- and the Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Co. to Bluestar Oil Services Consortium, led by indigenous entrepreneurs. \u001d  The government also handed over the Onigbolo Cement Co. in neighboring Benin Republic to Dangote Industries Ltd., owned by one Nigeria's leading industrialists, according to a statement by the BPE. \u001d  \"This is one handover of the federal government's equity stakes in enterprises to private investors that celebrates the Nigerian entrepreneur,\" Irene Chigbue, director-general of BPE, said at the handover ceremony. Chigbue said the sale \"demonstrates the faith Nigerian investors have in the nation's economic potential.\" \u001d  Bluestar acquired the government's 51% equity stakes  in each of the refineries, while Dangote Industries acquired the Nigerian government's 43% equity in Onigbolo Cement, jointly owned with the government of Benin Republic. \u001d  Bluestar offered $160 million for the acquisition of Kaduna refinery, higher than $102 million offered by the Chinese National Petroleum Corp., which had a right of first refusal on the plant. BPE said the amount offered by CNPC fell below the reserve for the refinery. \u001d  Bluestar also offered $561 million for Port Harcourt Refinery, while Dangote industries offered 1.78 billion naira ($13.9 million) for Onigbolo Cement, according to BPE. \u001d  The sale of these assets formed part of the government's economic reforms, which aimed to improve performance of state-run enterprises. \u001d  Nigeria has four refineries - the other one being located in Warri - with a combined capacity to refine 445,000 barrels per day of crude oil. However, the performance of the plants has been marred by equipment obsolesce and mismanagement. \u001d  Nigeria currently depends 100% on imports to meet domestic requirements of gasoline, which state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., puts at 30 million liters per day. \u001d  Nigerian oil workers initially protested against the sale of the refineries, arguing it would throw their members into the unemployment market. Staff of NNPC last week embarked on a strike action to press for demand for the cancellation of the sale, but called off the action after talks with the government and a 15% pay increase. \b \u001d  -By Vincent Nwanma, Dow Jones Newswires; +234-802-358-4996; vinwanma@beta.linkserve.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 13:12 ET (17:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"74371ee2710c8652375cb4cc9b4435cb","symR":["DT","DTE.XE","INTC","DE0005557508","US4581401001"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Deutsche Telekom To Take Small Stake In Jajah - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T13:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DT","DTE.XE","INTC","DE0005557508","US4581401001"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","SEM","TLS","XDAX","XDJGI","XDJI","XES","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5","XSTT","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) plans to take a strategic stake in Internet telephony start-up company Jajah, Financial Times Deutschland reports. \u001d  The paper said Telekom is investing a few million euros in Jajah, giving it a single-digit shareholding in the company. \"The goal is to develop new services for Telekom's fixed-line business using Jajah technologies,\" a person familiar with the partnership told the paper. \u001d  Deutsche Telekom couldn't be reached for comment. \u001d  In early May, Intel Corp.

The euro opens steady, while gold is flat and oil a bit lower. \u001d  STOCKS: European markets may open slightly higher in attempting to carry on last week's momentum driven by deal-marking. \u001d  Rio Tinto PLC (RTP), the world's third-largest miner by sales, has hired Deutsche Bank AG (DB) to advise it on a possible bid for Canadian aluminum maker Alcan Inc. (AL), The Age newspaper reported Monday without citing sources. But analysts Monday played down the benefits of a linkup between the two global resource majors. \u001d  After the holiday Monday, the U.S. week is heavy on data that spans employment, housing, manufacturing, consumer sentiment and inflation. \u001d  The upcoming flood of reports will help decide whether inflation and the economy are rising at paces that investors are comfortable with, and if not, whether the ongoing surge in corporate takeover deals will be enough to keep lifting stocks to new records. \u001d  If either inflation or growth is clocking in too fast, the Federal Reserve may refrain from lowering interest rates this year - or even hike them further - which would dampen spending and potentially hurt the stock market. On the other hand, data showing an abrupt halt in growth could also give investors pause. \u001d  Wall Street will be taking a particularly careful look at the Commerce Department's personal income and spending report for April, which includes the core Personal Consumption Expenditures inflator, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. Market forecasts project the year-over-year PCE figure, to be released Friday, will hold steady at 2.1%. \u001d  On Tuesday, the Conference Board releases its May index of consumer confidence. The index is expected to come in at 105.0, up from last month's reading of 104.0. \u001d  Also Tuesday, the Dallas and Chicago Feds release their indexes of regional manufacturing, and Standard & Poor's releases its home price index. \u001d  On Wednesday, the Fed's Open Market Committee releases minutes from its May 9 meeting, when the central bank repeated its assessment that growth has been slowing and inflation remains \"somewhat elevated.\" Investors will be interested in reading the reasoning behind the statement, and whether it offers any clues about future rate decisions. \u001d  The next day, the Commerce Department will estimate first-quarter gross domestic product. Economists anticipate growth of 0.7%, down from the 1.3% projected in April. The Commerce Department will also report on construction spending, which is expected to have slipped 0.2% in April after rising 0.2% in March. \u001d  In Asia, Japan's market rose on an encouraging 1.9% gain in Shanghai's market after recent concern that it was overpriced. The weaker yen also boosted buying in exporter shares. \u001d  Short-covering in resources pushed the Australian share market sharply higher before the rise ran out of steam later. A lack of buying interest ahead of U.S. and U.K. holidays Monday kept the broader market in check. However, BHP and Rio Tinto retained their gains. \u001d  FOREX: \u001d  The euro is holding steady against the dollar and yen as the European currency consolidates last week's gains. A near-term technical band is put between $1.3410 and $1.3461. Investors are still counting on the European Central Bank to raise rates in June, with this week's inflation reports expected to reinforce those expectations. \u001d  By contrast, the yen's weakness last week stemmed from soft core inflation data, which reduced the chances of interest-rate hikes by the Bank of Japan and kept carry-trade bets going strong. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 01:00 ET (05:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"75c11c2f2f5516af19f77d6cfa59cd4b","symR":["6764.TO","SANYY","JP3340600000"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Sanyo Electric Expects This FY Group Net Profit Y20B","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T05:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6764.TO","SANYY","JP3340600000"],"IndustryCodes":["CSE","ENT","X225","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 01:57 ET (05:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"768b8814cb1c8b0f2cbe106fd387d70c","symR":["6501.TO","HIT","JP3788600009","6501.TO","GE","HIT","JP3788600009","US3696041033"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Hitachi Pres: HDD Business Will Post Oper Profit This FY","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T07:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6501.TO","HIT","JP3788600009"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 03:56 ET (07:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"76dab8511343d60adac60c20b99dfbed","symR":["6501.TO","HIT","JP3788600009"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Hitachi Pres: HDD Business Conditions Very Severe In 2Q","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T07:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6501.TO","HIT","JP3788600009"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 03:57 ET (07:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"77b4f5f8c3a592cbcc1d4807864ac328","symR":["SRFDF","SRU.T","CA85528N1033"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Starfield Reports Results Of Ferguson Lake Geological Mapping - Petrological Study>SRU.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T12:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SRFDF","SRU.T","CA85528N1033"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG"],"Story":"\bTORONTO, May 28, 2007 /CNW/ - Starfield Resources Inc. (TSX: SRU/OTCBB: SRFDF) has received a 2007 report from Dr. Allan Miller about the Company's Ferguson Lake property in Nunavut, Canada. The report integrates his 2005-2006 observations from mapping-petrography-ore microscopy-geochemistry and petrology studies on the property. \b \bDr. Miller is a professional geologist with Kishar Research Inc. of Ottawa. His report clarifies that the Ferguson Lake Intrusive Complex (FLIC) is a deformed lopolith comprised of layered mafic-ultramafic rocks and related plutons that formed through fractional crystallization and differentiation processes. The layered series and related discordant layered plutons are interpreted as cogenetic and consa. \b \bThe report defines important implications for current resource evaluation and ongoing exploration. The FLIC has an iron-enrichment tholeiitic differentiation trend similar to famous Duluth and Skaergaard complexes. Geochemistry-petrogenesis evaluation suggests there are different sub-units that may represent different pulses or mega-cycles within the FLIC. \"These subsets may represent distinct magmatic events or cycles within the FLIC and have critically important implications for ongoing exploration, delineation of mineralized zones and evaluation of the FLIC resource,\" the document says. \b \bThe report further states \"the FLIC is Archean and is the only layered mafic-ultramafic complex in the Western Churchill Province, Canada. It outcrops for a distance of approximately 17.0 km along strike (east to southwest strike) and is exposed across 6.0 km in the northeast and 1.5 km in the southwest.\" \b \bThe northern and southern margins of the FLIC are defined by sub parallel layered intrusions. Massive and disseminated sulphide accumulations have been recrystallized and remobilized and best developed in basal hornblendite and adjacent gabbros while low sulphide, PGE-bearing gabbro occur within the layered sequence. Magmatic layering in mafic to ultramafic rocks is well preserved in layered intrusions, while discordant mafic layered plutons in the northeastern part of the complex area vary in composition from medium- to coarse-grained anorthositic gabbro to plagioclase porphyritic gabbro. \b \bOf particular note are the following: \b \bA) On the west side of Ferguson Lake, Dr. Miller has mapped the South Discovery - West Zone South (SDWZS) Intrusion as a narrow, maximum 50 metres, layered mafic-ultramafic intrusion that extends northeastward to easterly for a distance of approximately 6 km. This is an important addition to the Complex, as it is associated with a nearly continuous VTEM airborne geophysical survey anomalous conductivity trend over the same distance. As compared to the FLIC West Zone, which hosts inferred and indicated resources and which outcrops 500 meters to the north of this intrusion, the SDWZS Intrusion has only 6 shallow drill holes exploring its entire strike length. The SDWZS intrusion is comprised of three lithologies: 1) gabbroic rocks, 2) ultramafic rocks that include hornblendite and feldspathic hornblendite and 3) gossan which include sulphide-bearing hornblendite, less commonly gabbro and tectonized equivalents. \b \bB) On the east side of the Ferguson Lake, mapping by Dr. Miller identified an anorthositic gabbro pluton which is intrusive into and east of the layered mafic-ultramafic rocks that host the East Zone magmatic Cu-Ni-PGE sulphide mineralization. Near the northwestern side of this pluton, subtle spotty or patchy sulphide-bearing zones are linear and parallel to the magmatic layering of the anorthositic gabbro body. Anomalous PGE concentrations, 144ppb-364 ppb Pd, 93 ppb Pt with anomalous Cu, 1615ppm -  2472 ppm, were obtained from disseminated sulphide-bearing cumulate textured grab samples. The intercumulus sulphide assemblage includes pyrrhotite with exsolved flame pentlandite+chalcopyrite+pyrite, the latter inferred to be metamorphic. The mafic plutons east of the East Zone Cu-Ni-PGE sulphide mineralization are part of the FLIC based upon magmatic layering that formed mafic-ultramafic rocks similar to the layered rocks, anomalous PGE abundances in sulphide-bearing anorthositic gabbro and rare earth distribution patterns that are identical to the layered mafic-ultramafic rocks. \b \bC) Electron microprobe mineral analyses of hornblende from the layered series and discordant layered plutons returned trace amounts of fluorine  (0.1-0.2 wt %) and rare chlorine (0.11-0.13 wt %). This may be a petrochemical link to primary PGE concentrations found within massive sulphide mineralization and remobilization of PGE contents in low-sulphide gabbro-hosted mineralization within the FLIC. \b \bD) In 2005, Miller mapped the NUB 42-49 gossan discovery. This gossan is approximately 8 km south of the South Discovery Zone and is located within a prominent linear east-west trending magnetic low and a coincident string of VTEM conductive anomalies. In 2005, limited soil and till sampling in the area resulted in a palladium (Pd) in soil anomaly. Miller re-examined this paragneiss belt and recognized an exposure of anorthositic gabbro which upon petrographic and geochemical study is equivalent to the more aerially extensive and texturally similar anorthositic gabbro pluton which he described on the east side of Ferguson Lake. The recognition of this pluton, 8 km south of the FLIC, implies that the FLIC magmatic event has a larger aerial distribution than previously understood. The Pd soil anomaly may be related to the NUB anorthositic gabbro which is similar to the pluton that hosts disseminated PGE -bearing sulphides east of the East Zone. \b \b\"Starfield plans to further drill test the unique low sulphide PGE bearing gabbro of the West Zone during phase one of the 2007 field season,\" said Andr&#233; J. Douchane, President and CEO of Starfield Resources. \"Simultaneously, we will be systematically collecting samples across the magmatic layering of the South Discovery - West Zone South Intrusion and across the layered and gossanous mafic plutons on the east side of Ferguson Lake. We believe that as a result of the Miller study, the potential for discovery of disseminated PGE mineralization at surface along the extensive strike length of the FLIC needs evaluation.\" \b \bAbout Starfield \b \bStarfield Resources Inc. is an advanced exploration and emerging early stage development company focused on its Ferguson Lake Palladium-Platinum-Nickel-Cobalt-Copper property located in Nunavut, Canada. The property covers more than 1.3 million acres and is 100% owned by the Company. Since 1999, Starfield has completed 132,000 metres of diamond drilling in 359 holes. A National Instrument 43-101 technical report dated May 15, 2006 prepared by N.C. Carter PhD., P.Eng. was filed on SEDAR and on Starfield's website on May 25, 2006. A developing feature of this mineral district is the significant discovery of high-grade platinum and palladium mineralization found in the footwall to the massive sulphide deposit. Starfield's Ferguson Lake Project is emerging as Nunavut's largest ongoing base and precious metal project. \b \bStarfield has developed a novel, environmentally friendly and energy-efficient hydrometallurgical flowsheet to recover platinum, palladium, cobalt, nickel and copper from Ferguson Lake massive sulphides, under the direction of its metallurgical consultant, Dr. Bryn Harris. Additional work is being funded by McGill University under the direction of Professor George Demopoulos (McGill) and Dr. Harris (Starfield). The research is focused on the critical process step of iron precipitation and regeneration of the hydrochloric acid needed for the leaching step. \b \bThis news release has been prepared under the supervision of Dr. Allan Miller, P.Geo., and a Qualified Person as defined by National instrument  43-101. \b \bThis news release may contain forward-looking statements, including those describing Starfield's future plans and the expectations of management that a stated result or condition will occur.

The rating outlook is positive. \u001d  According to Moody's, the rating reflects the good and sustainable franchise evident in MC's core business lines, improving financial fundamentals - including sharp increases in earnings and de-leveraging - strong funding ability and good management team. However, in Moody's view, its faster-than-projected accumulation of earnings, mainly a result of favorable external environments, presents unforeseen challenges to its formulation of a long-term capital strategy with an adequate leverage level. \u001d  The positive rating outlook is based upon Moody's expectation that MC will continue to enhance its capital cushion - relative to its diversifying business investment portfolio - and maintain self-disciplined investment strategies against the backdrop of its business expansion activities. \u001d  In Moody's understanding, this term loan will be syndicated to a number of domestic Japanese regional financial institutions. The term loan will be fully drawn down at the disbursement date on June 22, 2007, and will have a maturity of 5 years. The status of this syndicated loan is pari passu with other unsecured obligations, including bilateral bank loans and publicly issued bonds. \u001d  Mitsubishi Corporation, headquartered in Tokyo, is one of the largest Japanese trading companies. \b \u001d  Copyright 2007, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and/or its licensors and affiliates including Moody's Assurance Company, Inc.

(NYSE: WNG) today announced that they have signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition of Washington Group by URS in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $2.6 billion. The transaction will combine two world-class engineering and construction companies, expand the capabilities of both firms and capitalize on their positions in important high growth sectors, including power, infrastructure and environmental management. \b \u001d  The companies' combined 2006 revenues would have been $7.6 billion, the fourth highest among U.S. publicly-traded engineering and construction companies. Based on previously issued guidance, the companies would have combined 2007 revenues of approximately $8.6 billion. In addition, the companies would have had combined 2006 EBITDA of $425 million(1) and total backlog exceeding $11 billion, as of March 31, 2007. The combined company would have projects in over 50 countries and more than 54,000 employees. \b \u001d  The combined company will offer a full range of engineering, construction, operations and maintenance services for both fossil fuel and nuclear power plants globally. The combined company also will have one of the largest teams of nuclear scientists and engineers in the industry, as well as a leading nuclear decommissioning and remediation business, enabling it to meet the anticipated resurgence in the nuclear energy market. In the infrastructure market, the combined entity will be positioned to meet growing demand for comprehensive services on large, complex transportation and water/wastewater projects around the world. In addition, the combined company is expected to be a major contractor to the federal government, including a top five provider of technical services to the U.S. Department of Defense and a top provider of engineering, management and environmental services to the U.S. Department of Energy. \b \u001d  Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, Washington Group stockholders will receive $43.80 in cash and 0.772 shares of URS common stock for each Washington Group share. Based on the closing price of URS' stock on May 25, 2007, the last trading day prior to the announcement, the consideration is valued at $80.00 per Washington Group share, with an implied consideration mix of 55% in cash and 45% in stock. The current value of the consideration represents a premium of approximately 14% to the May 25, 2007 closing price of Washington Group shares. The transaction is intended to allow the portion of consideration received in URS stock to be tax-free to Washington Group stockholders. URS stockholders will retain their shares following the consummation of the transaction. Upon completion of the transaction, Washington Group stockholders would own approximately 31% of the combined company. The combined company will be called URS Corporation. \b \u001d  Martin M. Koffel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of URS, said, \"URS has a history of anticipating change in the industry, and this transaction is the next logical step in building for future growth. Through this combination, both companies will be better positioned to capture growth from favorable trends across the engineering and construction sectors, including the increased investment in infrastructure projects, the focus on emissions reduction and energy independence in the power market, and the increased use of outsourcing by federal agencies, such as the U.S. Departments of Defense and Energy. Together, we will have the resources to meet increasing client demand for a single firm that can provide the full range of engineering and construction services required for large, complex projects in these high growth markets, both in the United States and abroad. In addition, our clients will benefit from the combined firm's expanded capabilities in the oil and gas, industrial process, facilities design and management, mining and homeland security sectors.\" \b \u001d  Mr. Koffel continued, \"The transaction is an exceptional opportunity that offers significant benefits for both URS and Washington Group stockholders. The combination is expected to enhance URS' financial performance, including our revenue growth, long-term profitability and cash flow. In addition, the combined company's diversified revenue and client base - together with a backlog in excess of $11 billion - is expected to provide the stability and consistency of earnings that is a hallmark of URS.\" \b \u001d  Stephen G. Hanks, Chief Executive Officer of Washington Group, said, \"This transaction will create a new leader in the engineering and construction industry that will deliver superior value to our stockholders, customers and employees over the long term. The increased scale and resources of the combined company, including URS' significant design resources, will further support our ability to compete for new opportunities in high growth markets. The combined company also will have a significant presence in the anticipated resurgence of the nuclear industry, including fuel sourcing, enrichment, power generation and spent fuel reprocessing and disposition.\" \b \u001d  Mr. Hanks continued, \"We have great respect for the URS team, our businesses complement each other, and we have highly compatible cultures. The employees of both companies will enjoy the benefits of being part of a robust global organization, with a diverse portfolio of businesses and services and broad career opportunities. I look forward to working with Martin and his team to deliver on the tremendous potential of the combined company.\" \b \u001d  Dennis Washington, Chairman of the Washington Group Board of Directors, stated, \"I strongly support the transaction with URS, which I believe will be beneficial to our stockholders, customers, employees and other constituencies.\" Mr. Washington beneficially owns stock options currently exercisable for approximately 3.2 million shares of Washington Group common stock. \b \u001d  URS expects to achieve annual pre-tax cost synergies of $50 million to $55 million in 2008. URS also expects the transaction to be accretive to cash EPS in 2008 and beyond, neutral to accretive to GAAP EPS in 2008, and accretive to GAAP EPS in 2009 and beyond, not including revenue synergies expected through the combination. In addition, the combined company should be able to benefit from Washington Group's significant favorable tax attributes. \b \u001d  URS has received a firm commitment from Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley to provide debt financing for the cash portion of the transaction, subject to customary conditions. The transaction is not conditioned on financing and is expected to close in the second half of 2007. Following the close of the transaction, URS is expected to have approximately $1.5 billion in debt and a debt-to-total capital ratio of approximately 37%. \b \u001d  Said Mr. Koffel, \"We have a proven track record of successfully integrating large acquisitions and managing our strong cash flows to pay down debt aggressively. We are committed to deleveraging and maintaining balance sheet flexibility.\" \b \u001d  The transaction is subject to the approval of the merger agreement by Washington Group stockholders, the approval of URS' issuance of shares in the transaction by URS stockholders, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Martin M. Koffel will remain CEO of the combined company. Upon completion of the transaction, one current member of the Washington Group Board of Directors will join an expanded URS Board of Directors. \b \u001d  Morgan Stanley acted as lead financial advisor to URS and Latham & Watkins and Cooley Godward Kronish LLP served as URS' legal counsel. UBS also advised URS on the transaction. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Washington Group and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Jones Day served as Washington Group's legal counsel. \b \u001d  Additional information about this transaction is available online at www.urs-wng.com. \b \u001d  URS and Washington Group will host a joint conference call Tuesday, May 29, 2007, at 8:30 a.m. EDT to discuss the transaction.

(TOL.AU) shareholders Monday voted to spin off the rail and ports assets of Australia's largest transport company into a separate company - Asciano Ltd. (AXX.AU). \u001d  Under the plan, the company's investors will keep their existing shares and receive a stapled security made up of one new share and one new unit in Asciano for each share they own in Toll. \u001d  Toll chief executive Paul Little said the arrangement would give the Melbourne-based company access to key infrastructure without the need to own it, thereby satisfying competition regulations, and allow it to raise as much as an additional A$1 billion in debt for acquisitions. \u001d  \"This gives us a lot of capacity on our balance sheet,\" Little said. \"This restructure will allow both the Asciano business and our business to grow more aggressively.\" \u001d  Chairman John Moule told the meeting in Melbourne that Toll received sufficient proxy votes from investors to support the spin-off plan, with 384.9 million shares in favor and 717,920 against. \u001d  The decision, which will be announced later Monday, needs approval from 75% of shareholders present at the meeting to succeed. \u001d  Toll acquired the ports business, a 62% stake in Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd. (VBA.AU), Australia's second-largest airline, and full control of the Pacific National rail business, in which Toll previously had a half stake, from its A$6 billion acquisition of Patrick Corp. last year. \u001d  Toll needed to spin off Asciano because the need to invest capital in the rail and ports assets restricted the company's acquisition plans and raised antitrust concerns, Little told reporters. \u001d  \"Toll previously had achieved a 20% pretax return on capital,\" he said. \u001d  \"To be going down to a sub-10% return was something we felt our shareholders weren't overly excited about, and we needed to address that problem and this was the best outcome,\" Little said. \u001d  He told the meeting that after the spin-off Toll would remain one of Asia's leading providers of integrated logistics services. \u001d  \"With Asian logistics markets expected to grow at rates of up to 25% per year, expansion of Toll Asia is a key platform for the development of the Toll business,\" Little said. \u001d  Toll will announce later this week it has bought an equity stake in Hong Kong-based Cargo Services, Little told reporters after the meeting. \u001d  The acquisition of the stake in the privately held freight forwarding company will help Toll expand its logistics business in and out of China, he said. \u001d  Cargo Services' largest Australian customer is Woolworths Ltd. (WOW.AU), Little said. \u001d  He declined to say how large the equity stake was. \u001d  Toll will also announce in a few weeks a joint venture with Virgin Blue, in which the company will have exclusive use of \"belly space\" in Virgin's aircraft to help Toll expand its international logistics business, Little said. \u001d  \"And over and above that, Toll has recently commissioned three of its own purpose-designed 737 air freighters and we are now running them around Australia,\" he said. \u001d  \"The specialized Toll freighters plus the Virgin Blue 'belly space' collectively will give us a wonderful platform for our air freight business,\" Little said. \u001d  Asciano is seeking to acquire bulk rail assets in Queensland and Western Australia states and to participate in ports expansion, chief executive Mark Rowsthorn told reporters after the meeting. \u001d  The company wants to gain customers in Queensland to carry coal and agricultural commodities in Western Australia, he said. \u001d  Rowsthorn is comfortable with Asciano's A$6 billion net debt, which is \"comparable with our peers in infrastructure and arguably we could push the gearing harder if we chose to do that.\" \u001d  The company had a gearing of about 60%, which will rise to 67% in the company's first three years as it invests in expanding its Brisbane ports assets and its national rail network, he said. \u001d  Asciano also has joined a consortium that is bidding to build and operate a 2,600-kilometer railroad in Saudi Arabia to carry freight, he said. \u001d  If court approval is gained, shares in Asciano will trading on June 6. \u001d  At 0440 GMT, shares in Toll were down 1.3% at A$22.07, compared with the broader market's 0.2% decline. \b \u001d  -By Andrew Harrison, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9671-4323; andrew.harrison@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Paul Godby \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 00:53 ET (04:53 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7b49812e275bdd7ad750b13f5573c4f3","symR":["GRZ","GRZ.T","HL","KRY","KRY.T","CA22942F1018","CA38068N1087"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Venezuela's Mining Law Ready For Chavez In 2 Weeks - Minister","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T19:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GRZ","GRZ.T","HL","KRY","KRY.T","CA22942F1018","CA38068N1087"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","MNG","PCS","PPM","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  CARACAS (Dow Jones)--Venezuela's mining ministry plans to turn over a new mining law to President Hugo Chavez for approval in two weeks, a minister said Monday. \u001d  \"In two weeks we will turn (the mining law) over to the president. We're putting the final touches on it based on three proposals we have on hand,\" Mining Minister Jose Khan told Dow Jones Newswires in a telephone interview. \u001d  A fully pro-Chavez congress unanimously gave the president special presidential powers early in the year so he can create laws for a year and a half without consulting congress. \u001d  Under the new mining law, Khan said the figure of the mining concession will end because it has a history of giving holders \"a sense that they own the resources.\" \u001d  Khan acknowledged that the new law could follow in the footsteps of state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, PdVSA, which converted oil deals into a mixed company framework. \u001d  \"There is a proposal which PdVSA has used to transform oil deals into mixed companies,\" with the state in control, Khan said. But the minister could not say if this will apply to active mine concessions and contracts as well as those deemed unproductive. \u001d  Khan said the public \"will have to wait for the law to come out\" to see any specifics. \u001d  On the issue of the Las Cristinas gold mine, controlled by Canadian company Crystallex International Corp. (KRY), he said no decision has been made yet on how the law will apply in that case. Unlike other mines in the country, Crystallex holds an operating contract but has yet to receive a needed environmental permit to begin operations. \u001d  Khan indicated that even though the environmental permit is still pending, some additional permits are on the way. \"I understand that (the environment ministry is) giving a permit but it's for expanding roads and to build walkways and those types of works\" at the mine, he said. \u001d  The Chavez government has lately launched a two-phase review of all mining company operations in Venezuela and is paying particular attention to those projects related to gold and diamonds. All companies are expected to present details of their operations to the government for close inspection. Foreign companies operating in Venezuela include the U.S. Hecla Mining Co. (HL), and Gold Reserve Inc., among others. \u001d  Chavez has vowed to create the equivalent of a PdVSA for gold and diamonds that would oversee deals in those sectors. The president's latest campaign to nationalize strategic assets has led many to believe he could force a stronger state role on the mining industry. \b \u001d  -By Raul Gallegos; Dow Jones Newswires; +58-212-564-1339; raul.gallegos@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 15:52 ET (19:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7bb835e28076cd0c2b6da06d1a4634d8","symR":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Royal Bank Of Canada Was To Sector Outperformer At CIBC >RY","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 08:00 ET (12:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7c08acdb3f15dce703e5473d60566972","symR":["ACX.T","CA0435031012"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Ascendant Copper Announces Drill Results From Chaucha Copper-Moly Project, Ecuador>ACX.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T14:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACX.T","CA0435031012"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF"],"Story":"\b   DENVER, COLORADO--(CCNMatthews - May 28, 2007) - Ascendant Copper Corporation (the \"Company\"), (TSX:ACX)(TSX:ACX.WT)(BERLIN:A0HMLE)(FRANKFURT:A5C)(WKN:A0HMLE), announced today the results from its first core drilling program on its Chaucha copper-molybdenum property, 75 kilometers southeast of Guayaquil, Ecuador. To date, a 10-hole, 3,174 meter program has been completed in the Naranjos mineralized sector of the project area (see Figure 2) that has preliminarily defined a supergene enrichment zone underlying the Naranjos mineralized sector about 40 meters thick. Copper equivalent values in this enrichment zone exceed 0.50%. In addition the drilling has begun to define what appears to be a large copper porphyry system underlying the Naranjos mineralized sector of the Chaucha concession (see Figure 2). \b \bAt the Naranjos mineralized sector three core holes were drilled into a previously inferred copper-molybdenum resource. Hole NA-03 encountered a 112 meters grading 0.54% copper and 0.029% molybdenum. Hole NA-02 reported 104 meters of 0.41% copper and 0.023% molybdenum. Hole NA-01 had 42 meters at the bottom of the hole that averaged 0.40% copper and 0.015% molybdenum. True thickness is estimated to be equal to drilled thickness as the mineralized zone encountered is determined to be flat-lying. \b \bSeven additional core holes (NA-04 through NA-10) were drilled over a horizontal distance of 1,200 meters to the east of the Naranjos mineralized sector. All holes showed copper and molybdenum mineralization. The results are summarized in the table (Figure 1) below. \b \bA nine hole core drilling program has recently been completed on the Gur Gur mineralized sector of the Chaucha property, Assay results have not been received for all the holes completed and results will be made public when all assay results have been received. Drilling will next test soil geochemical anomalies and structural targets west of the main Naranjos mineralized sector in the area called Loma de Tunas. \b \bJohn R. King, the Company's resident exploration and geological expert as well as a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI43-101\"), has reviewed the above statements and assay results. Mr. King confirms that quality controls and correct assay procedures were followed by the Company and these geologic observations of the samples are correct. Assaying of the samples was conducted by ALS Chemex Laboratories, an ISO certified laboratory in Santiago, Chile and Acme Labs, an ISO certified laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. \b \bNine exploration campaigns have been conducted on the Chaucha property since 1970 by entities like Billiton, Armeno, OMRD, Carlos Puig & Associates SA, among others. Including Ascendant's recent drilling, more than 17,000 meters of drilling have been completed and 132 holes analyzed.

(\"Silverwing\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX:SVW) is pleased to announce that it has concluded its previously disclosed value maximization process and has entered into agreements to obtain a 50% partner on its current Tomahawk area farmin project in central Alberta (the \"Tomahawk Farmin\"), to extend its drilling deadlines pursuant to the Tomahawk Farmin and to pursue an equity offering to raise funds to finance its development and exploration program and reduce its working capital deficiency. \b \bTomahawk Partnership \b \bSilverwing has entered into a participation agreement (the \"Participation Agreement\") with Argen Energy Corp. (\"Argen\"), a private oil & gas exploration and development company with offices in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Toronto, Canada for the participation by Argen in the farmin agreement dated May 1, 2006 among Canadian Natural Resources Limited (\"CNRL\") and Imperial Oil Resources (\"IOR\"), as farmors, and Silverwing, as farmee (the \"Farmin Agreement\"). Pursuant to the Participation Agreement, Argen has agreed to pay 50% of the costs arising under the agreement in order to earn 50% of Silverwing's earned interest under the agreement. The Agreement also includes a requirement for Argen to equalize all payments made to date under the Farmin Agreement by Silverwing. \b \bTomahawk Farmin Extension \b \bSilverwing has also entered into a letter agreement with CNRL and IOR whereby CNRL and IOR have agreed to extend the initial drilling commitment under the Tomahawk Farmin to December 31, 2007. The Tomahawk Farmin requires the Corporation to drill 29 wells in the initial phase, with an option to earn additional land with more drilling commitments. On an individual well payout basis, Silverwing must pay 100% of the costs to earn a 60% working interest in the leases after payout with an average earning of two sections per well. The extension is conditional upon (a) Silverwing entering into commitment letter with a 50% joint venture partner for the completion of the initial drilling program under the Tomahawk Farmin, (b) Silverwing providing a signed commitment letter from the Agents (as defined below) for the raising of such capital as is necessary to complete the initial drilling program under the Tomahawk Farmin; (c) the payment by Silverwing to CNRL and IOR of an aggregate $500,000 on or before May 31, 2007 in consideration of the Farmin Agreement extension; and (d) the payment by Silverwing to CNRL and IOR of an aggregate $11,100,000 to an escrow account on or before May 31, 2007 (the \"Escrow Funds\"). The Escrow Funds can be drawn down on a pro-rata basis as Silverwing meets the drilling commitments under the Farmin Agreement. \b \bIn addition to the above, Argen is in process of negotiating the acquisition of: (1) a 50% interest in 2,180 boepd in Argentina at a cost of approximately $20 million USD; (2) a farmin on 2 different exploitation and exploration prospects in the Provinces of Neuquen and Santa Cruz, Argentina totalling $50 million USD of drilling and completion costs. \b \bManagement of Silverwing and Argen anticipate that, following the completion of the drilling program of 29 wells under the Tomahawk Farmin Agreement, Silverwing and Argen will discuss effecting a business combination on a net asset value to net asset value basis. \b \bCredit Facility \b \bIn order to obtain the funds necessary to complete the Escrow Funds condition under the Farmin Agreement extension letter prior to the condition date, Quest Capital Corp. (\"Quest\") has entered into a term sheet with Silverwing to provide a secured credit facility in the principal amount of $12 million (the \"Loan\"), to be placed into an escrow account for the discharge of Silverwing's commitments under the Tomahawk Farmin Agreement, projected for closing on or before May 31, 2007. The Loan will be due and payable on or before November 30, 2007 with no penalty for pre-payment. The interest payable on the Loan is 12% per annum, compounded monthly. In addition, the term sheet calls for Silverwing to issue, subject to Toronto Stock Exchange (the \"TSX\") approval, 3,400,000 Silverwing shares to Quest at a deemed price of $0.30 as a standby fee and non-refundable bonus payment (being 10.1% of the currently issued and outstanding common shares of Silverwing). The Loan contemplates security as a second charge against the Corporation's domestic assets and by general security agreement against all of the Corporation's present and after-acquired personal property. It is intended that the Loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the Equity Offering (as defined below). Following the closing of the Loan, Quest will, by virtue of the standby fee and non-refundable bonus payment, be the holder of 9.1% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Silverwing. \b \bPursuant to the term sheet, the material conditions precedent to completion of the Loan are (i) regulatory and TSX approval, (ii) approval by the board of directors of Quest, (iii) completion of due diligence, (iv) the Farmin Agreement being in good standing, and (v) the Corporation's primary credit facility with National Bank remaining less than $15 million. \b \bProposed Equity Offering \b \bSilverwing has engaged Fraser Mackenzie Limited (\"FML\") and Jacob & Company Securities Inc. (\"JCS\") (collectively, the \"Agents\"), both of Toronto, to act as exclusive agents for the public offering of units on a marketed best-efforts basis to raise gross proceeds of a minimum of $25 million (the \"Equity Offering\"). The minimum offering will be the sale of 83,333,333 units with each unit (a \"Unit\") consisting of one Silverwing common share (a \"Common Share\") and one purchase warrant (a \"Warrant\") at a price of Cdn $0.30 per Unit. Each Warrant will be exercisable into one Common Share at a price of $0.40 per Common Share for a period for 18 months following the closing of the Equity Offering. The Agents also have on option (the \"Over-allotment Option\") to place up to an additional $5 million of Units (16,666,666 Units) for a maximum total offering of $30 million. \b \bFor their services in connection with the Equity Offering, the Agents will receive a cash commission equal to 7% of the aggregate proceeds of the Equity Offering and warrants (the \"Agent's Compensation Warrants\") to purchase a number of Common Shares equal to 3.5% of the number of Units sold in the Equity Offering. Each Agent's Compensation Warrant will entitle the Agents to purchase one Common Share at a price of $0.30 per Common Share for a period of 18 months from the closing of the Equity Offering. \b \bFollowing closing of the Loan, and if the maximum Equity Offering (including the Over-allotment Option) is fully subscribed, a total of 206,900,000 new Common Shares will be issued or issuable through the Loan and the Equity Offering (also taking into account the exercise of the Warrants and the Agent's Compensation Warrants), representing approximately 611% of Silverwing's issued and outstanding common shares. Depending upon the make-up of the placees under the Equity Offering, the closing of the Loan and Equity Offering may materially affect control of Silverwing. There is currently no participation in the Equity Offering currently contemplated by insiders of Silverwing. \b \bThe Equity Offering is targeted for closing during or about the week of June 18, 2007. The Corporation intends to use the proceeds of the Equity Offering, net of the fees and expenses of the Equity Offering, to pursue its development and exploration program in the Tomahawk area of Alberta and to reduce its working capital deficiency. \b \bPursuant to the private placement rules in the TSX Company Manual, the issuance of greater than 25% of the issued and outstanding shares of an issuer at a discount to market, as contemplated pursuant to the Equity Offering, and a potential material affect on the control of an issuer generally requires shareholder approval prior to completion. Silverwing has obtained an exemption from the TSX from the requirement to seek shareholder approval pursuant to Section 604(e) of the TSX Company Manual on the basis of financial hardship. \b \bRecommendation of Silverwing's Special Committee \b \bA special committee of the Board of Directors of Silverwing (the \"Board\") composed of Drew Tumbach, Robert Wagemakers and Geoff Waterman, each of whom is free from any interest in the Equity Offering or the Loan and is unrelated to any of the parties involved in the Equity Offering or the Loan, recommended that the Corporation proceed with the Equity Offering and the Loan and that, as a result of the deadline to deposit the Escrow Funds by May 31, 2007, Silverwing make an application to the TSX for an exemption from the requirement to seek shareholder approval on a determination of financial hardship. Based on this recommendation, the Board has determined that Silverwing is currently in serious financial difficulty, that the offering is designed to improve its financial position and that is reasonable in the circumstances, and has approved the Equity Offering and the Loan. \b \bUpon completion of the Equity Offering and the Loan, the Corporation will no longer be in default under its principal debt facility. \b \bThis news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The securities offered have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 16:58 ET (20:58 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"7ce9dd81d5ca26d6c3aed5304b572879","symR":["VRK.T","CA92824X1087"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Virtek Vision Webcast Annual Meeting, Tuesday, May 29 At 4 P.M.

Production commenced in October, 2006.and has ramped up to an annual rate of 70 million pounds. A total of 942 million pounds of copper is projected to be produced during the 18-year life of the operation. Existing resources and prospective exploration targets adjacent to the main open-pit have the potential to extend the life of the project. \u001d  The Company currently anticipates production of 60 to 63 million pounds of \"LME Grade A\" quality copper cathode during 2007 at a cash cost of approximately $1.19 to $1.27 per pound (including prepaid royalties). Capital expenditures for 2007 are forecast at $30 million. \u001d  Information in this news release that is not current or historical factual information may constitute forward-looking information or statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws. Implicit in this information, particularly in respect of statements as to future operating results and economic performance of the Company, and resources and reserves at the Piedras Verdes operations, are assumptions regarding projected revenue and expense, copper prices and mining costs.

That could include details of a formal bid assuming something comes of the intense recent talks RBS has held with BoA over LaSalle. \u001d  If it does, it's the presence of Fortis in the RBS consortium and its potential merger synergies with ABN that may tip the balance in favor of their offer over Barclays.' \u001d  After all, if there is a model about how European banks should go about adapting to falling intra-European trade barriers, globalization and competing with bigger U.S. rivals, it's based on bulking up at home to be better able to expand abroad. \u001d  Europe's biggest, most prosperous banks have done exactly that - unlike ABN Amro - whether it's RBS and HSBC or Santander, BNP Paribas and Unicredit. \u001d  They've shown merger-related cost cutting and maximizing your domestic footprint to push more higher-margin products to more customers -  within the boundary of anti-trust concerns that aren't seen as significant in the Fortis-ABN case - is vital for generating better returns from the lower-growth banking markets of Europe's richest economies. \u001d  It's true that after rebuffed merger overture to banks like Dexia and KBC, Fortis gave up on Benelux consolidation, committing itself to diversifying abroad so that its home market contributed no more than 30% of net profit by 2009. \u001d  Given that has a ring of ABN Amro's failed strategy, Fortis shareholders mightn't be that sad to see a return to home truths. \u001d  Indeed, few people reckoned ABN Amro's Benelux assets would be up for sale in circumstances where Fortis' superior management - judging by most performance ratios - is well placed to call the shots in any future combination. Fortis could hardly pass up on the opportunity. \u001d  Fortis' relatively low retail-banking profile in the Netherlands, and the likelihood RBS will have dibs on much of ABN Amro's European corporate-banking business, does suggest cost-saving by eliminating overlap won't be huge. \u001d  But the savings are bigger than any Barclays can reasonably expect from the Benelux, quite apart from the potential for longer-term revenue gains Fortis can expect if it picks up ABN Amro's asset-management, private-client, and Asian operations. \u001d  As for the financing, using Fortis' shares, trading at a discount to many of its peers' and ABN Amro's , as an acquisition currency is a cheap way to finance a EUR27-billion contribution to the consortium's bid. \u001d  If Fortis funds around a fifth of that with debt, and considering the excess capital it has at its disposal, that would leave its capital ratios in line with its objectives and make the acquisition earnings enhancing in 2008, according to analysis by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. \u001d  With that financial and strategic logic underpinning Fortis' involvement in the RBS consortium, ABN Amro shareholders may well yet have a sweet offer on the table alongside Barclays'. \b \u001d  (Matthew Curtin has been a financial news reporter since 1990, and has reported on international finance and business for Dow Jones Newswires - from South Africa, Singapore and now Paris - since 1994.

(6764.TO) said Monday its restructuring efforts were beginning to bear fruit, as it swung into the black on an operating basis last fiscal year and forecast a net profit for the current year. \u001d  The Osaka-based electronics maker booked a Y49.57 billion group operating profit in the year ended March, compared with a Y17.15 billion operating loss the previous year. \u001d  Sanyo is in the midst of a major restructuring that has included job cuts, factory closings and exits from unprofitable businesses. Last year the company received a Y300 billion bailout from Goldman Sachs and other investors. \u001d  Its efforts have been overshadowed by resignations of top executives, faulty accounting that led to the restatement of past results and product recalls. \u001d  But Sanyo President Seiichiro Sano said Monday his focus was on the company's bottom line. \u001d  \"The major theme for this fiscal year is to achieve a net profit on a consolidated and parent basis,\" he said. \u001d  \"We had an operating profit last fiscal year through our restructuring efforts. This restructuring will continue unabated.\" \u001d  Sanyo said its group net loss improved to Y45.36 billion versus a Y205.66 billion loss a year earlier, even as its group sales fell 7.6% to Y2.215 trillion from Y2.397 trillion. \u001d  Sanyo's restructuring efforts were most apparent in its electronic component division, where it shot up to a Y18.33 billion operating profit from a Y28.55 billion operating loss a year ago. The company said one factor was its semiconductor operations, which climbed into the black during the period. \u001d  Industry observers and people close the matter say Sanyo is currently seeking a buyer for its semiconductor operations. \u001d  The company said its net losses continued because it booked the cost of reorganizing its digital camera business, increasing overseas production of its mobile phone handsets and cutting its global payroll. \u001d  While that marked a strong improvement, Sano said its mobile phone and digital camera operations still faced \"very harsh\" conditions and would be a major focus for the company as it strove to retain profitability. \u001d  For the current fiscal year, the company forecasts a group net profit of Y20 billion on revenue of Y2.230 trillion. \u001d  Sano assumed leadership of the company last month after Toshimasa Iue, whose grandfather founded the company, stepped down. Iue cited difficulties in working with major investors such as Goldman as reasons for his departure. \u001d  A Goldman spokesman said the company had no comment on Sanyo's earnings or current financial condition. \u001d  Sanyo Electric's earnings are based on U.S. accounting standards. \b \u001d  -By Jay Alabaster and Hiroyuki Kachi, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; jay.alabaster@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 05:33 ET (09:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"82879685571fd3f0aba24b91621ea327","symR":["12027.FR","CNI","CNR.T","CP","CP.T","PCA.T","PCZ","RDSA","RDSA.LN","RDSB","RDSB.LN","TOT","CA1363751027","CA13645T1003","CA71644E1025","FR0000120271","GB00B03MLX29","GB00B03MM408"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Cdn Pacific Rail Plans For Potential Oil-Sands Boom","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T17:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12027.FR","CNI","CNR.T","CP","CP.T","PCA.T","PCZ","RDSA","RDSA.LN","RDSB","RDSB.LN","TOT","CA1363751027","CA13645T1003","CA71644E1025","FR0000120271","GB00B03MLX29","GB00B03MM408"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","RAI","XAEX","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \b   By Monica Gutschi \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--With an eye to the huge potential from Alberta's oil-sands development, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) plans to build the first new rail subdivision in its network in more than 30 years to serve a cluster of proposed refineries. \u001d  \"We see significant opportunity for growth,\" said Ray Foot, the railroad's vice-president of merchandise marketing and sales. \u001d  Canadian Pacific said it has applied for regulatory approval to construct rail lines along 16 miles of right-of-way in Sturgeon and Strathcona counties just northeast of Edmonton. \u001d  Companies such as Petro-Canada (PCZ), France's Total S.A. (TOT), and Holland's Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) have plans to build, or are building bitumen upgraders in the area. As well, there are other oil-sands and energy-related developments underway near the small town of Fort Saskatchewan on the North Saskatchewan River. \u001d  Alberta's oil sands have proven reserves of 174 billion barrels, second only to Saudi Arabia. Oil-sands production was 1.1 million barrels a day in 2005 and is forecast to be nearly triple that amount by 2015. \u001d  Although he refused to speculate on total potential volumes, Foot noted that rails carry most of the byproducts created in the production of refined oil from the bitumen extracted from the oil sands - such as sulphur, petroleum coke, and asphaltene. \u001d  Foot also said there is growing demand for rail service to bring in the construction materials such as steel and cement for the proposed developments. \u001d  \"In addition to that long-term business that we anticipate, we are very excited about the short-term opportunities to move in construction materials,\" Foot said. \u001d  Canadian Pacific plans to spend C$15 million immediately to improve its logistics and distribution capabilities in the area. \u001d  The remainder of the project would be built in stages in conjunction with the construction of the bitumen upgraders. Foot said he expected it would take about two years to obtain all the regulatory and environmental approvals necessary to begin building the rail lines, as well as the planned logistics centers, marshalling yards and rail bridge crossing the North Saskatchewan river \u001d  \"At this point in time, the upgraders have been announced,\" Foot said. \"Our actual construction will be done in lockstep with the upgraders moving forward, and the volumes related to those.\" \u001d  The total cost of the project would depend on the eventual size of the rail line, he said. But given the time frames needed for the approval process and initial construction, he said the railroad has taken the first step of amassing the land necessary and seeking approval from the Canadian Transportation Agency. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.cpr.ca \b \u001d  -Monica Gutschi, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2017; monica.gutschi@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 13:29 ET (17:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"83202df9c9a81c9bb5bf3ef2d5f23d42","symR":["NGX.T","NXG","OPW.T","CA6664161024","CA6834761059"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Opawica: Northgate Minerals To Buy 10M Shrs Of Opawica At C$0.07/Shr","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T20:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NGX.T","NXG","OPW.T","CA6664161024","CA6834761059"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","MNG","PCS","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 16:23 ET (20:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"841114c8bccf1c2ee355e6a8d01ad95a","symR":["ALFAGP.YY","TCELL.IS","TKC","TLSN.SK","SE0000667925","TRATCELL91M1"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Cukurova Asks Altimo In Crt To Accept $1.45B Repayment -IHA","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T13:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ALFAGP.YY","TCELL.IS","TKC","TLSN.SK","SE0000667925","TRATCELL91M1"],"IndustryCodes":["CTS","FIS","TLS","XDJGI","XHEX","XISL","XNYA","XSTT","XSXA"],"Story":"\u001d  ISTANBUL (IHA)--Cukurova Holding said Monday it has applied to a British Virgin Islands court for a ruling that ensures the Russian telecom investment firm Altimo accepts a debt repayment of $1.45 billion, allowing the Turkish company to recover its 13.8% stake in mobile operator Turkcell (TKS), the Ihlas news agency, or IHA, reported. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 09:28 ET (13:28 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"84402580b746493068a0e8147f697b8c","symR":["IDC.T","CA45937P1071"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": International Datacasting Announces Shareholder Intent To Sell Stock>IDC.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T13:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IDC.T","CA45937P1071"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT"],"Story":"\b   OTTAWA, ONTARIO--(CCNMatthews - May 28, 2007) - International Datacasting Corporation (TSX:IDC) announced today that it has been advised that one of its shareholders, Magito B.V.

A Sydney-based Deutsche Bank spokeswoman also declined comment. \u001d  Alcan's board last week urged shareholders to reject Alcoa's hostile cash and shares offer on the grounds that it was too low and completion of the merger was too uncertain due to regulatory and other hurdles. \u001d  But Alcoa said last week it is sticking to its offer,  saying management has already met with a significant number of Alcan's shareholders and \"are pleased to have received strong support for the combination.\" \u001d  Alcan has also not ruled out the option of buying Alcoa, in what's known as a Pac-Man strategy after the popular 1980's video game. \u001d  It has also said it is in talks with third parties about other options. \u001d  Along with Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton (BHP), the Sydney Morning Herald report said other interested parties could include Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (RIO), Anglo American Plc (AAUK), Xstrata Plc (XTA.LN), Rusal, Chinese groups and private equity groups. \u001d  The newspaper said BHP has progressed no further than other companies that have made a preliminary expression of interest. A BHP Billiton spokeswoman declined to comment. Last week, Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper said Alcan was in talks with BHP. \u001d  The report comes amid a wave of speculation surrounding consolidation in the booming resource sector. \u001d  Among the more high profile deals, nickel producer LionOre is at the center of a C$6.8 billion takeover battle between Xstrata and Russia's OAO Norilsk Nickel. Rio Tinto has also been the subject of takeover speculation over recent weeks, with BHP Billiton named by analysts at Citi as a potential suitor. \u001d  However, analysts downplayed the chances of a tilt by Rio Tinto or BHP Billiton for Alcan, pointing to limited synergies with the Canadian company's assets. They see a tie-up between Alcoa and Alcan as the most beneficial, and obvious, outcome. \u001d  \"Rio certainly has done the numbers but that doesn't mean they'll bid,\" Global Mining Research analyst Tony Robson said. \u001d  \"Rio is a value-driven company and you'd need an aluminum price of US$1-US$1.10/lb to justify a bid for Alcan on NPV (net present value) terms,\" he said, noting aluminum is now at US$1.27/lb - a level considered historically high. \u001d  \"Question is, does Rio believe in such a high long-term price assumption?\" \u001d  Robson also noted that Alcan's downstream packaging and engineered products divisions are a risk given low profit margins, which would likely further reduce synergies for the likes of Rio Tinto or any of the other names linked to the company. \u001d  \"Alcoa has quoted synergies of US$1 billion but it's likely to be a lot less for other potential bidders like BHP Billiton or CVRD,\" Robson said. \u001d  Gavin Wendt, analyst at Sydney-based Fat Prophets, also played down the synergies between the likes of Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton with Alcan. \u001d  \"Alcan surely is talking to other companies to find a white knight, but Alcoa is the main player,\" Wendt said. \u001d  Another analyst, who did not want to be identified, said a white knight bid for Alcan is likely to emerge more from elsewhere than Rio Tinto or BHP Billiton given what he sees as limited synergies. \u001d  The analyst believes Chinese resources companies or private equity groups could also take a close look at the Canadian aluminum producer. \u001d  However, analysts at global ratings agency Fitch said earlier this month, Aluminum Corp. Of China, the world's second largest alumina producer and fourth largest aluminum producer, is unlikely to bid alone for Alcan. \u001d  Fitch Ratings Asia Pacific Director Danny Chen said Chalco is not in a financial position to go it alone, while global synergies may be light. \u001d  Alcoa taking on Alcan would create the world's largest producer of the light-weight metal at 7.7 million metric tons, followed by Russia's United Company Rusal with 4 million tons. \u001d   Alcoa-Alcan's combined alumina output, a key raw material for aluminum production would come to 20.9 million tons. \u001d  United emerged this year from the three-way merger of Russian Aluminium, Sual and Swiss-based Glencore. \u001d  More than half of Alcan's assets are in North America with downstream capacity concentrated in Europe and bauxite and alumina operations in Asia, Australia and Africa. \u001d  Rio Tinto produced 844,700 tons of aluminum in 2006, and 16.4 million tons of alumina, with BHP at 1.36 million tons of aluminum and 4.19 million tons of alumina. \u001d   Rio Tinto shares closed up 1.5% at A$94.15 on the Austrlaian Stock Exchange. BHP Billiton was up 1.5% at A$31.13. \b \b   -By Lyndal McFarland, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2957; \b    lyndal.mcfarland@dowjones.com \b   -Edited by Paul Dekkers \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 02:38 ET (06:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"85ddbb83c3bb4ec68c4cf763842fa287","symR":["GS.T","NHC.T","CA37989N1069","CA66705B1040"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gluskin Sheff + Associates Acquired Over 10% Outstanding Shares Of Northstar Healthcare >GS.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T19:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GS.T","NHC.T","CA37989N1069","CA66705B1040"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","SCR"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 15:36 ET (19:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"85f3e5134b7911138d3e98d986b9cd34","symR":["LBN.UN.T","LIQ.UN.T","CA5363452007","CA53635C1059"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Liquor Stores And Liquor Barn -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T10:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LBN.UN.T","LIQ.UN.T","CA5363452007","CA53635C1059"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bYou can identify many of these statements by looking for words such as \"believes\", \"expects\", \"will\", \"intends\", \"projects\", \"anticipates\", \"estimates\", \"continues\" or similar words or the negative thereof.

The worker's right hand and wrist were drawn into the machine, resulting in serious hand injuries, including severe damage to the right thumb. The incident occurred at the company's plant at 145 Queen Street in Strathroy, about 36 kilometres (22 miles) west of London. \b \bGlendale International Corp. pleaded guilty, as an employer, to failing to ensure an in-running nip hazard on the glue machine that endangered the safety of the worker was equipped with, and guarded by, a guard or other device that prevented access to the pinch point, as required by Section 25 of the Regulations for Industrial Establishments. This was contrary to Section 25(1)(c) of the act. \b \bThe fine was imposed by Justice of the Peace Elaine Babcock of the Ontario Court of Justice in London. In addition, the court imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge, as required by the Provincial Offences Act.

Although the loan does not contain a negative pledge, the seniority of the loan is considered the same as that on Mitsubishi's issued bonds, since the company has not provided any negative pledges when issuing bonds. \u001d  A Japanese-language version of this media release is available on Standard & Poor's Research Online at www.researchonline.jp, or via CreditWire Japan on Bloomberg Professional at SPCJ <GO>.

A normal course issuer bid allows the Fund to purchase its units for cancellation through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\"). Any such purchases will be made by the Fund at the prevailing market price at the time of such purchases in accordance with the requirements of the TSX. The commencement of the normal course issuer bid is subject to review and approval by the TSX. \b \bThe Board of Directors has also approved the Fund's Information Circular, which details a proposed amendment to the Fund's mandatory market purchase program. The proposed amendment increases the amount of units which may be purchased by the Fund for cancellation from 0.25% to 1.25% of the outstanding units of the Fund in respect of each calendar quarter. The floor-price at which the mandatory market purchase plan becomes effective will also be increased from less than 90% to less than 95% of the most recently calculated net asset value per unit of the Fund. These proposed amendments will bring the Fund's mandatory market purchase program in-line with similar programs of other investment funds. The Fund will seek unitholder approval of these proposed amendments at the Fund's Annual and Special Meeting to be held on June 28, 2007. \b \bStrategic Energy Fund \b \bStrategic Energy Fund is an investment trust that seeks to provide unitholders with superior rates of return through a diversification strategy focused on investment opportunities within the Canadian energy sector. The Fund invests in established companies, early-stage energy companies and, to a lesser extent, special energy issuers, each with prospects for high growth in the near to medium term and the potential for long-term capital appreciation. \b \bThe Fund's investments in established companies, including energy royalty and income trusts, are made with a view to generate sufficient income to permit the Fund to make monthly cash distributions to unitholders. \b \bInvestments in early-stage energy companies are focused on both private and public issuers with strong, experienced management teams that have proven track records of enhancing shareholder value and successfully executing exit strategies. As well, the Fund may invest in undervalued issuers where Sentry Select Capital Corp., the investment advisor to the Fund, believes that capital appreciation can be realized. \b \bTrading information and NAV \b \bStrategic Energy Fund units trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol SEF.UN. As of May 24, 2007, the Fund's closing price on the TSX was $9.28 per unit and the most recent net asset value as of May 23, 2007 was $11.49 per unit. \b \bSentry Select Capital Corp. \b \bSentry Select Capital Corp. is a Canadian wealth management company who manages over $8 billion in gross assets as of April 30, 2007.

(\"General Shale\") for an aggregate price of $107,000,000, subject to closing adjustments for debt and non-cash working capital. The Fund will be responsible to pay transaction and wind-up related expenses out of the sale proceeds received from General Shale. General Shale, based in Johnson City, Tennessee, is an affiliate of Wienerberger AG, the largest brick company in the world headquartered in Vienna, Austria. \b \bUnder terms of the agreement, General Shale will indirectly acquire the Fund's wholly owned subsidiaries, Arriscraft International Limited Partnership and Arriscraft International Holdings (Canada) Inc., which, respectively, operate and hold the Arriscraft International business in Canada and the United States. The bulk of the proceeds will be paid to the Fund's unitholders through the redemption of all outstanding Fund units at a currently estimated cash redemption price of approximately $7.50 per unit. The final redemption price per unit will depend on purchase price adjustments, transaction costs and expenses associated with the wind-up of the Fund. To the extent price adjustments, transaction costs and wind-up expenses are different from the Fund's estimates, or if any unforeseen adjustments, costs or expenses arise, the actual amount paid to unitholders could be different. To offset the impact of the transaction costs and wind-up expenses, General Shale has agreed to partially reimburse the Fund for a portion of those costs and expenses. \b \bThe estimated per unit redemption price represents a premium of approximately 26.7% over the 20-day volume weighted average price for the Fund's units on the Toronto Stock Exchange for the period ending on Friday, May 4, 2007, the last full trading day prior to the day the Fund announced it was in discussions with a third party concerning a possible transaction. \b \bThe transaction is subject to the approval of the Fund's unitholders at a special meeting, the receipt of regulatory approvals and certain third party consents. It is anticipated that the redemption of Fund units will occur by the end of July 2007. The actual date of the redemption will be set and announced following the closing of the sale transaction. At that time, the board of trustees of the Fund will assess the potential for any other further costs, obligations or liabilities (including tax liabilities) that must be met to wind-up the Fund and intends to establish a reserve for such amounts out of the estimated redemption price per unit noted above. On the redemption of the Fund units, all sale proceeds available after the adjustments, costs and expenses noted above and in excess of the reserve, which reserve the board of trustees currently estimates may be approximately $0.20 per unit, will be distributed to unitholders. The reserve funds, net of any amount paid to satisfy any valid Fund costs, obligations and liabilities after closing, of which none is currently known or expected, will be paid to Fund unitholders as the balance of their unit redemption price in due course once all regulatory filings and tax clearance certificates have been completed or obtained. \b \bDavid Boles, President and CEO of Arriscraft said, \"The acquisition is a good result for our unitholders. It is also a good result for Arriscraft and our employees as General Shale has informed us that it intends to continue to operate the Arriscraft production facilities and grow the Arriscraft business in North America. \b \bGoldsmith, Agio, Helms Securities, Inc., the financial adviser to the board of trustees of the Fund in respect of negotiating the transaction, has provided to the board of trustees an opinion that the estimated consideration to be received by the unitholders under the transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the unitholders of the Fund. In addition, the board of trustees retained Crosbie & Company Inc. (\"Crosbie\") to provide an independent fairness opinion and Crosbie has delivered an opinion to the board of trustees that the estimated consideration to be received by the unitholders under the transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the unitholders of the Fund. Based on this advice and other factors, the Fund's board of trustees has unanimously approved the transaction and resolved to recommend that the Fund's unitholders approve the proposed sale to General Shale at a special meeting to be held in July 2007. \b \bF. David Rounthwaite, Chairman, speaking on behalf of the independent trustees said, \"We are very pleased to support and to be recommending what we believe is an attractive transaction for the Fund's unitholders. The transaction represents a positive outcome for Arriscraft, its unitholders and its employees, as well as a combination that promises to reinforce Arriscraft's position as a leading North American manufactured stone producer.\" \b \bHolders of approximately 27.8% of outstanding Fund units have agreed with General Shale to vote their units in favour of the proposed sale transaction. \b \bFurther information about the record date for determining unitholders eligible to receive notice of and to vote at a special meeting of unitholders to approve the transaction and the date of the meeting will be made public as soon as practicable. A circular describing the proposed transaction will be mailed to unitholders in connection with the meeting and will be available on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com. The transaction is expected to close in late July 2007. \b \b \b    << \b    Details of the Transaction \b \b    The following is a summary of certain details concerning the transaction: \b \b    -   Acquired Entities. Subsidiaries of General Shale will acquire \b        directly and indirectly from Arriscraft International Operating \b        Trust, the Fund's wholly owned subsidiary, all the outstanding \b        securities of (i) Arriscraft International Limited Partnership, the \b        owner and operator of Arriscraft's Canadian business, and \b        (ii) Arriscraft International Holdings (Canada) Inc., the holding \b        company that indirectly owns Arriscraft's U.S. operating entity, \b        Arriscraft International LLC. \b \b    -   Outstanding Units. Immediately prior to closing, assuming the \b        exercise of all outstanding options and exchange of exchangeable \b        securities, there will be approximately 9,934,167 units of the Fund \b        outstanding. \b \b    -   Purchase Price Adjustments. The aggregate purchase price for the \b        Arriscraft business will be $107 million. The purchase price will be \b        reduced by the total amount of indebtedness of Arriscraft at closing \b        and will be increased dollar for dollar to the extent non-cash \b        working capital of the Fund exceeds $13.5 million, up to a maximum \b        purchase price increase of $2.75 million. Out of these proceeds, the \b        Fund will pay the estimated transaction and wind-up costs. General \b        Shale will partially reimburse transaction and wind-up costs that \b        exceed current expectations. Also, out of the proceeds, Arriscraft \b        International Limited Partnership will pay the severance costs to the \b        current president and CEO and current CFO of Arriscraft (who will not \b        be continuing in those roles post-closing) that are payable as a \b        result of change-of-control provisions in their employment contracts. \b        These severance costs are estimated to be $2.45 million. \b \b    -   Closing Conditions. Completion of the transaction is subject to \b        customary closing conditions including receipt of all necessary \b        approvals such as unitholder and regulatory approvals and certain \b        other conditions, including Arriscraft's indebtedness not exceeding \b        $32 million plus the actual CEO and CFO severance costs and \b        Arriscraft having at least $13 million of non-cash working capital. \b \b    -   Voting Support. Holders of approximately 27.8% of outstanding Fund \b        units have agreed in writing with General Shale to vote their units \b        in favour of the transaction. The voting agreements are of a \b        customary nature and terminate if the board of trustees terminates \b        the agreement with General Shale by exercising its fiduciary out \b        rights. The unitholders who have agreed to vote their units of the \b        Fund in favour of the transaction are a corporation owned by the \b        former owner of the Arriscraft business that owns all the special \b        voting units of the Fund, the management group who own all of the \b        Restricted A units and Restricted B units of the Fund (who have \b        agreed to give up certain additional distribution rights on their \b        units to receive the same consideration per unit as other \b        unitholders), the current president and CEO and the current CFO. \b \b    -   Minority Approval. The approval of the majority of \"minority\" holders \b        for purposes of Ontario Securities Commission Rule 61-501 and \b        Regulation Q-27 of the Autorit&#233; des march&#233;s financiers du Qu&#233;bec will \b        also be required. Units held by (i) a corporation owned by the former \b        owner of the Arriscraft business, which holds a subordinated \b        unsecured exchangeable debenture issued by Arriscraft International \b        Limited Partnership that will be paid off at closing, and (ii) the \b        current President and CEO and the current CFO, who will receive \b        severance payments at closing, which represent in the aggregate \b        approximately 10% of the outstanding voting units or a total of \b        981,033 units, will be excluded from such minority vote. \b \b    -   Redemption Procedure. At or prior to the closing of the sale \b        transaction, the board of trustees will assess the potential for any \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 07:53 ET (11:53 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"909ae76d901634e20f044fd3affddbef","symR":["BCP.LB","BPI.LB","PTBCP0AM0007","PTBPI0AM0004"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"BCP CEO Against Bylaws Changes; 40% To Vote Against -Paper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T06:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BCP.LB","BPI.LB","PTBCP0AM0007","PTBPI0AM0004"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","XDJGI","XENX","XP20"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LISBON (Dow Jones)--Banco Comercial Portugues' (BCP.LB) Chief Executive Paulo Teixeira Pinto is against the changes in the bank's bylaws proposed by the lender's supervisory board, to be voted at a shareholders meeting Monday, weekly Expresso reported Saturday without citing sources. \u001d  The proposed changes, which intend to make a takeover of the bank more difficult after its failed bid for smaller rival Banco BPI (BPI.LB) earlier this month, are expected to be rejected by 40% of the votes. \u001d  The supervisory board, which is headed by Jorge Jardim Goncalves, founder and former chief executive of BCP, proposes giving the supervisory board the right to appoint the executive board and require a 75% majority of issued votes to change the company's bylaws, up from the current 66%. \b \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.expresso.pt \b \u001d  -By Lisbon Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; 351-21-319-1863 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 02:24 ET (06:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"909dbae156227f068398719bb06cf09a","symR":["ANFGY","ANTO.LN","GB0000456144"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Chile Antofagasta Inks Early Labor Deal With 2 Unions - Repot","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T20:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ANFGY","ANTO.LN","GB0000456144"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SANTIAGO (Dow Jones)--Chilean copper miner Antofagasta Minerals, a unit of Antofagasta plc (ANTO.LN), signed new contracts with two unions ahead of the legally mandated schedule, La Segunda afternoon daily reported Monday. \u001d  Antofagasta reached agreements with the Mina-Puerto union at its Los Pelambres Mine and with the Michilla union at the Michilla mine, the newspaper reported. \u001d  Based on local labor laws, contract talks with these two unions were scheduled to begin in September. \u001d  At Pelambres, Antofagasta reached a 45-month deal, which will expire in February 2011.

The London-listed company produced 465,000 metric tons of copper last year. \b \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.lasegunda.cl \b \u001d  -By Carolina Pica, Dow Jones Newswires; 56-2-460-8544; carolina.pica@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 16:49 ET (20:49 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"920fd8423f2a87342ef6df48d503df08","symR":["DJDAY","LEE"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"G7 Political, Economic Calendar - Day Ahead","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T06:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DJDAY","LEE"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bAll dates are in GMT. \b \bMonday, May 28, 2007 \bGMT                                                        Expected  Previous \b0900  ITA          6-month T-Bill Auction \b0900  ITA          29-day T-Bill Auction \b0900  ITA          24-month Zero-Coupon Bonds Auction \b1330  EU           ECB call for main refi tender \b2330  JPN  Apr     Labor Force Survey                       4.0%      4.0% \b2330  JPN  Apr     Household Spending                       +0.1%YY   +0.1%YY \b2350  JPN  Apr     Retail Sales, prelim                               -0.7%YY \bN/A   UK   May     House Prices Survey                                +0.7%MM \b                                                                      +6.8%YY \bN/A   GER          ASEM foreign mins meeting \bN/A   US           Memorial Day holiday; all banks, \b                   markets and businesses closed \bN/A   ITA          Italy municipal elections, day 2 of \b                   voting \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"92245bcd8cd2e212b821ec3eb7eeecb1","symR":["LTO.MI","IT0003990402"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Lottomatica's GTECH Secures 10-Yr Kansas Lottery Contract","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T15:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LTO.MI","IT0003990402"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XMIB"],"Story":"\b \u001d  ROME (Dow Jones)--Italian gaming company Lottomatica SpA (LTO.MI) said Monday its U.S. unit GTECH Corp. secured a 10-year contract to run the Kansas Lottery that will boost the unit's revenue by about EUR60 million from the third-quarter of 2008. \u001d  Lottomatica said GTECH will provide an online lottery system, terminals, wireless Internet Protocol-communications network and ongoing services for the Kansas Lottery. \u001d  \"We are pleased to continue our long-standing partnership with the Kansas Lottery,\" said W.

The airline, which is 50%-owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, swung to a pretax loss of SEK1.14 billion in 2001 from a SEK2.83 billion profit in 2000. After initiating a SEK2.5 billion program to cut costs and sell off non-core assets, SAS reported a 2006 pretax profit of SEK292 million and said after the first quarter it expects continued growth in the global economy and its markets. \u001d  As part of the restructuring to help the airline recover, SAS workers accepted concessions in their contracts but the latest strike is an effort by cabin crew to reinstate some benefits and conditions. \u001d  \"Things are good at the company. Why can't we get some of that back now?\" said HTF negotiator Tommy Mases. \u001d  Talks have focused on working conditions rather than wages. SAS flight attendants in Sweden earn an average $56,131 a year, including allowances, for a 26-hour working week. Most of HTF's 10 or so demands are focused on working conditions rather than salary increases, Mases said. \u001d  \"We want one weekend a month off. We want at least 20 minutes to eat between flights,\" said Mases. \"Sometimes we only have five minutes or no time at all to eat. Somewhere you have to balance work with how much somebody needs food and rest.\" \u001d  Despite a return to profitability, SAS says it still has work to do and says further concessions would hinder the company's five-year strategic program, to be launched mid-June. SAS says the new plan will contain measures to boost revenue and additional cost-cutting measures to lift profitability. \u001d  SAS Sweden spokeswoman Ulrika Fager said HTF's demands equate to a 25% increase in staff costs each year compared with the 10.3% increase over three years SAS had previously accepted. \u001d  \"HTF's demands make us less flexible than our Swedish competitors,\" Fager told Dow Jones Newswires. \"We have to reach an agreement that can keep us competitive.\" \u001d  The latest strike in Sweden follows a three-day wildcat strike in Denmark last month over working conditions, which cost SAS an estimated SEK100 million. \u001d  SAS has faced 100 strikes in the past 10 years, 73 of which were illegal strikes in Denmark. SAS Spokesman Bertil Ternert said newly-appointed Chief Executive Mats Jansson is \"tired\" of the labor battles, having faced three in his first five months on the job. \u001d  \"SAS Sweden has to play hardball,\" said Lars Heindorff, ABG Sundal Collier analyst. \"They can't afford not to. First it was the Danes and now it's the Swedes. Management needs to get this fixed now.\" \u001d  HTF's Mases said he expects another offer from the airline later Monday. \u001d  SAS has a 45% share of the Nordic market with SAS Sweden making up 33% of the total. The largest Nordic competitor is Finnair (FIA1S.HE) with 14%, followed by FL Group's (FL.IC) Sterling with 7% and Ryanair (RYAAY) with 5%. The company  is chiefly a short-to-medium haul business carrier. \u001d  SAS shares in Stockholm, which have doubled in the last 12 months, traded flat at SEK153.50 at 1349 GMT Monday, underperforming a higher broader market. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sasgroup.net \u001d  -By Adam Ewing, Dow Jones Newswires; +46 8 545 130 95; adam.ewing@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 10:23 ET (14:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a16e3df26456eceab732cc710a3637ca","symR":["CLF","RIO","VALE5.BR","BRVALEACNPA3"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CVRD Declines Comment On Reports It's Eyeing Cleveland-Cliffs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T13:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CLF","RIO","VALE5.BR","BRVALEACNPA3"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","STL","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SAO PAULO (Dow Jones)--Brazilian mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (RIO), or CVRD, declined comment Monday on reports that it is in talks to acquire U.S.-based iron ore producer Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF). \u001d  \"CVRD does not comment about market rumors,\" the company's press office said. \u001d  Last week, several press reports said CVRD, the world's largest producer and exporter of iron ore and iron pellets, was in talks to acquire Cleveland-Cliffs.

Decisions on major foreign acquisitions and any changes to foreign ownership rules should be suspended until after the process has been completed, he said. \u001d  The Commons finance and industry committees should also hold hearings on foreign takeovers during the summer break, he added. \u001d  Dion said Alcoa Inc.'s (AA) recent takeover bid for Alcan Inc. (AL) raises the question of whether reciprocity should be a factor governing takeovers in Canada. Alcoa's home state of Pennsylvania has rules that would make it extremely difficult for Alcan to take over Alcoa. \u001d  Since Alcoa comes from a jurisdiction that protects it from takeover, it must be determined whether Alcoa should face tougher rules in Canada when it seeks to take over Alcan, he said, according to Canadian Press. \u001d  As well, Investment Canada makes decisions based on whether it judges a takeover to confer \"net economic benefit\" on Canada, said Dion, adding not a single takeover has been blocked in many years. \u001d  While the takeovers of Inco and Falconbridge by foreign companies were judged to confer net economic benefit, Dion said many would argue that the net economic benefit for Canada would have been greater if Inco and Falconbridge had achieved a made-in-Canada merger, or if, for example, a three-way merger of Alcan, Inco and Falconbridge had been contemplated, Canadian Press reported. \u001d  He said such possibilities cannot be considered under the current one-at-a-time approach adopted by Investment Canada. \u001d  In addition, several U.S. states have rules that, unlike Canada, allow corporate boards to consider the impact of a takeover on stakeholders other than shareholders. Ottawa has a responsibility to look at whether Canada should consider the adoption of such rules, he said. \u001d  Finally, according to Canadian Press, he noted some business leaders have suggested that certain resource industries should be considered strategically important. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 11:30 ET (15:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones &

The plan is still subject to approval by Chinese regulators. \u001d  The official said Carlsberg had also talked to Lanzhou Huanghe Enterprise's largest shareholder, Lanzhou Huanghe Xinsheng Investment Co., about raising its stakes in its ventures with Lanzhou Huanghe Enterprise and deepening cooperation in production and business operations. \u001d  Carlsberg has invested a total of CNY150 million in its four brewery joint ventures with Shenzhen-listed Lanzhou Huanghe Enterprise, holding a 30% stake in each of them, said the official at the Chinese beer maker. \u001d  Officials at Carlsberg weren't immediately available for comment, and officials at Lanzhou Huanghe Xinsheng couldn't be reached Monday. \u001d  Carlsberg Chief Executive Nils Andersen said in November the company plans to invest between DKK3 billion and DKK5 billion over the 2007-2009 period to expand its capacity in Asia, and the majority of the investments will go to western China. \u001d  Analysts have said beer consumption in western China has been growing rapidly in recent years, at an annual rate of about 15%. \b \u001d  -Sun Yan contributed to this story; Dow Jones Newswires; 8621 6120-1200; yan.sun@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 00:35 ET (04:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ac9c12e65b90fd0336c04110acd4fb33","symR":["CAE.T","CGT","EGY.T","CA1247651088","CA2928491067"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Engenuity Tech Holders OK Deal With CAE Unit","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T13:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CAE.T","CGT","EGY.T","CA1247651088","CA2928491067"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","SOF","XDJGI","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 09:02 ET (13:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"aca1bfbea7e411fee92bdd151ea6a972","symR":["GS.T","NHC.T","CA37989N1069","CA66705B1040"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gluskin Sheff Buys 381,900 Shrs Of Northstar Healthcare","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T19:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GS.T","NHC.T","CA37989N1069","CA66705B1040"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","SCR"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Gluskin Sheff + Associates Inc.

Cukurova subsequently took out a $1.4 billion loan, but Babayev said it was too late. \u001d  \"We decided that since we had begun the process of appropriating the shares, we wouldn't stop it,\" he said, adding that a ruling could be expected toward the end of June. \u001d  He confirmed that should Altimo receive the stake, it would be forced to make a buyout offer to the rest Turkcell's shareholders, which include Nordic telecom group TeliaSonera (TLSN.SK). \u001d  Some analysts said this could benefit the Russian company. \u001d  \"A larger stake (in Turkcell) would give Altimo greater leverage in asset-swap talks with TeliaSonera, with which Altimo is involved in a separate dispute over (Russian mobile firm OAO) MegaFon,\" MDM Bank analyst Elena Bazhenova said in a research note. \u001d  An extra 13.8% in Turkcell would give TeliaSonera control over the Turkish operator, something it had been hoping to do before Alfa topped its offer for Cukurova's stake back in 2005. \u001d  TeliaSonera owns almost 44% of MegaFon, Russia's third-largest mobile operator by users. Altimo has a blocking stake in that same company, although its ownership of the shares is subject to an ongoing legal challenge by Bermuda-registered fund IPOC. \u001d  In recent months, Altimo - which also owns more than 40% of Russia's No. 2 cellular provider, OAO Vimpel Communications (VIP) - has been seeking a tie-up with an international telecom group, although negotiations have so far failed to yield results. \u001d  Company Web sites: http://www.turkcell.com.tr \u001d  http://www.cukurova.com.tr \u001d  http://www.altimo.org \u001d  -By Will Bland and Andrew Langley, Dow Jones Newswires; +7 495 974 80 55; william.bland@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 08:29 ET (12:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"aeb60c3e9aa1654e088cfd2311a933d0","symR":["6764.TO","SANYY","JP3340600000","6764.TO","SANYY","JP3340600000"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Sanyo Elec Last FY Group Net Loss Y45.4B Vs Y205.7B Loss","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T05:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6764.TO","SANYY","JP3340600000"],"IndustryCodes":["CSE","ENT","X225","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 01:57 ET (05:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"aebea9b1122f3d870e8d8c2926da0ad9","symR":["1022047.FR","FR0010220475"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Brazil May Take Bids On Rio-To-Sao Paulo High-Speed Rail Link","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T13:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1022047.FR","FR0010220475"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  RIO DE JANEIRO (Dow Jones)--Brazil's government may hold a tender in August for the construction of a $9 billion high-speed rail link between Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the transport ministry said Monday. \u001d  If current planning schedules are kept, construction of the 403-kilometer link could start early next year. \u001d  Dilma Rousseff, chief of staff to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, will meet representatives of the European International Bank during a trip to Italy this week.

(5030.KU) Monday signed a contract to design and construct a $7 billion pipeline to be laid across northern Malaysia that will divert up to a third of oil now being carried through the Malacca Strait. \u001d  The signing, with project owner Trans-Peninsula Petroleum Sdn. Bhd. and  Indonesia's PT Tripatra, was witnessed by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and visiting Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. \u001d  Under the plan, crude oil shipped from the Mideast would be refined in Kedah on the northwestern coast and pumped through the 300-kilometer pipe to Kelantan on the eastern coast. It would then be loaded onto tankers bound for Japan, China and South Korea, completely bypassing Singapore and the Malacca Strait. \u001d  Work on the pipeline will begin next year and finish in 2014, said Rahim Kamil Sulaiman, chairman of Trans-Peninsula Petroleum. \u001d  \"This is not a political project. It is a commercial undertaking. The project is economically viable,\" he told a news conference. \u001d  Rahim said the pipeline will be a substitute for the Straits of Malacca, through which half the world's oil is shipped. \u001d  The strait is also notorious for robberies and hijackings, although the number of attacks has fallen since Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, which share the waterway, increased patrols in 2005. \u001d  Around 30% of vessels that transit the strait are oil tankers, he said, adding that the company aims to divert 30% of the traffic once the pipeline is completed. \u001d  Rahim said the timing of the pipeline is perfect as the oil market is shifting to East Asia, with China now being the world's second-largest oil consumer. \u001d  Trans-Penisula has also tied up with Saudi Arabia's Al-Banader International Group for oil supplies but has given no details. \u001d  Funds for the construction of the pipeline will come from local and foreign investors, Rahim said, but declined to reveal details. \u001d  Kedah Chief Minister Mahdzir Khalid told reporters that two refineries, costing a total of $9 billion, will be built in Kedah by 2010 with a combined refining capacity of 450,000 barrels a day. \u001d  Malaysian companies SKS Ventures and Merapoh Resources Corp. are expected to unveil details of the refineries in August, he said. \u001d  In a statement, Trans-Peninsula said the project will create reserve oil facilities for Asia, which accounts for about a third of world oil consumption. \u001d  It said offshore mooring facilities will be built in Yan in Kedah and Bachok in Kelantan to accommodate very large crude carriers, while a major storage tank will be built in Jeli in Kelantan. \u001d  In the first phase to be operational by mid-2011, it said the pipeline can carry 2 million barrels of oil a day with a 60 million barrels of storage capacity.

They are unlikely to be opened until after next month's legislative elections. \u001d  How he handles them will be a litmus test of Sarkozy's proclaimed pro-market tendencies in a country suspicious of capitalism and with deep traditions of state involvement in the economy. The most prickly plans include privatizations of major French companies that could help finance Sarkozy's tax cuts and other reforms - and would almost certainly incite mass protests and strikes. \u001d  Since Sarkozy needs to stay popular to win a parliamentary majority, he is putting off the sensitive questions until after the June 10 and 17 parliamentary elections, said Aurore Wanlin, a researcher at the Centre for European Reform: \"After that, we will see. In his vision for France, the state has an important role to play in the economy.\" \u001d  Sarkozy's new staff is largely mum about the biggest dossiers: a long-stalled merger between national gas company Gaz de France and utility giant Suez, and the selloffs of state stakes in Electricite de France, nuclear engineering giant Areva and airport operator Aeroports de Paris, known as ADP. \u001d  Newly appointed officials at the presidential Elysee Palace and the Finance Ministry did not return calls seeking comment on Sarkozy's industrial plans. \u001d  Investors and big businesses, meanwhile, are eager to uncover Sarkozy's plans for the state's $228.5 billion in assets of traded companies. \u001d  The weekly financial newspaper Le Revenu last week published an investor guide to the government's portfolio, which ranges from a 31% stake in Safran, a conglomerate that makes jet engines, to a 19% holding in Air France-KLM. The newspaper speculated on possible share sales for 10 companies, but recommended buying only one: ADP. \u001d  French construction company Vinci has declared an interest in an eventual privatization of the airport operator, the newspaper said, explaining the stock's upside potential. \u001d  French power giant EDF is \"ready\" to put more shares on the market if the government decides to do so, Chairman Pierre Gadonneix said at the company's annual shareholders' meeting in Paris last week. Under French law, the state could sell an additional 17% of the company, lowering its stake to 70%. \u001d  Areva President Anne Lauvergeon, who has a long-standing relationship with Sarkozy - she was an economic adviser to President Francois Mitterrand when Sarkozy was budget minister - may be hoping to realize her ambition of an exchange listing for Areva shares. In 2005, Areva's initial public offering plan was blocked by then-Finance Minister Thierry Breton amid opposition to relinquishing control of such a strategic industry. \u001d  Another possibility for Areva is forging closer ties with Alstom, famed for its high-speed trains. At a news conference this month, Alstom Chairman and Chief Executive Patrick Kron said he sees \"an interest\" in forging closer ties with France's state-owned nuclear engineering firm, while stressing the government hadn't yet gotten around to studying the dossier. \u001d  Sarkozy is thought to favor a partial privatization of Areva. Martin Bouygues, CEO of Bouygues, which owns a 25.3% stake in Alstom, has long said his company would be interested in buying a stake in Areva. Another option mulled by the Journal du Dimanche this month is the sale of an Areva stake to French oil giant Total. \u001d  As for Aeroports de Paris, Sarkozy's election increases \"chances for a full privatization in the future\" though a \"full exit\" is not imminent, Franco-Belgian banking group Dexia said in a research note earlier this month. \u001d  The planned Suez-Gaz de France marriage - arranged by Sarkozy's one-time rival former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin to fend off a bid for Suez by Italy's Enel SpA - is on hold. Villepin's successor, Francois Fillon, said Wednesday the government is considering other possibilities and will review the deal in late June or early July. \u001d  For a merger to take place, the government would have to privatize GDF, something Sarkozy promised not to do when he was finance minister in 2004. Villepin introduced legislation allowing the government to reduce its stake to 33%, a move vigorously opposed by unions and Socialist lawmakers. \u001d  Both companies say their union is the best option, but insist they will be all right if it doesn't happen. Suez announced this month it has amassed an 11% stake in Spain's Gas Natural, which analysts said could make a good alternative if the GDF deal falls through. \u001d  Sarkozy has made clear the priority of his \"ambitious industrial policy\" is Airbus, and has vowed to seek new investors or inject new cash in the European planemaker. It became a major French campaign issue after massive layoffs combined with an enormous golden handshake for the ousted chief executive sparked a public outcry. \u001d  Airbus was on the menu of Sarkozy's first overseas visit, to see German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He picked an Airbus factory near Toulouse for his first domestic visit to talk with unions and management. \u001d  Airbus has suffered from a falling U.S. dollar - the currency in which it sells planes - and two years of delays to the 555-seater A380, which have wiped more than $6.6 billion off Airbus' profit forecasts for 2006-2010. \u001d  The French government currently owns 15% of EADS, while Paris-based Lagardere SCA owns 7.5%. Their combined stake is balanced by Stuttgart, Germany-based DaimlerChrysler AG, which holds 22.5% of voting rights in the defense group. \u001d  Sarkozy has cited his experience with Alstom as a possible model: As finance minister, Sarkozy engineered a euro2.5 billion, state-orchestrated bailout to steer the train and power-plant builder away from bankruptcy. \u001d  \"Alstom was much simpler,\" said Pierre Boucheny, an analyst at Kepler Equities in Paris. \"With EADS, Daimler and the Germans have always said that the state doesn't have a role in managing companies.\" \u001d  Der Spiegel reported last week that Merkel was cool about Sarkozy's plans to raise the state's stake in EADS. \u001d  \"The German government's position on EADS is to pursue a private investors' solution and to reduce public stakes in the company,\" government spokesman Thomas Steg told reporters in Berlin. \u001d  Analysts said Sarkozy's handling of the dossier will speak volumes about his diplomatic skills and free-market tendencies. \u001d  \"He's first and foremost pragmatic,\" said Boucheny. \"He's someone who believes in the market but who also believes the state has a role to play.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 12:23 ET (16:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b71838aca48f27dc17f828204a889586","symR":["7007.TO","9104.TO","JP3319200006","JP3362700001"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Mitsui OSK To Build Fuel Carrier With Omani Partner -Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T17:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["7007.TO","9104.TO","JP3319200006","JP3362700001"],"IndustryCodes":["MAR","TRQ","X225","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Mitsui O.S.K.

The CBI survey showed pricing expectations reached their highest level in over 10 years, so this component of the (PMI) survey may also remain elevated,\" Ward said. \u001d  On the U.S. Treasurys market, traders will watch for the payrolls report due Friday. \u001d  Treasury yields hit multi-month highs late last week. While an especially strong jobs report could spark yields to reach fresh highs, another surprisingly low figure could encourage investors to again grow hopeful of an impending cut in interest rates, helping Treasurys to stage a recovery after their month-long decline. \u001d  \"If unemployment is a strong number, I think we definitely break through the high-end in yield,\" said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed income trading at D.A. Davidson, with the 10-year rate possibly pushing to 5%. That key psychological mark hasn't been hit since August of last year. \u001d  Analysts at Barclays Capital in New York are expecting 140,000 new jobs to be created in May, with market expectations for the data ranging from 44,000 to 180,000 new jobs. \u001d  If the report were to come in at 140,000, that could be \"a bit of relief\" for Treasurys, said Dominic Konstam, head of interest rate strategy at Credit Suisse, as many investors are fearing a stronger number. \u001d  Even if a much stronger figure were to take a toll on Treasurys, pushing prices lower and yields higher, Konstam said that he doesn't expect the market to be too damaged by the report. \u001d  John Canavan, market analyst at Stone and McCarthy in New York, pointed to renewed investor concerns about dwindling interest in U.S. Treasurys overseas as another factor that has and that could continue to put pressure on the bond market. \u001d  If data this week manage to once again take the 10-year note through a 4.90% yield, \"it's probably a pretty quick shot back to 5%,\" Canavan said. \u001d  He said 5% is the next key level for the note and a yield that may well entice overseas buyers to jump back in. \u001d  In Japan, prices of government bonds recovered Monday from earlier losses on buying on dips and on technical factors, with Japan's banks and insurers said to be pacing the rebound. \u001d  Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui said that there isn't a set timetable for when the central bank will next raise interest rates, Asahi Shimbun reports. \u001d  ENERGY: \u001d  Oil prices edged lower in Asian trading Monday after a Nigerian oil workers' unions strike that threatened to reverse the sale of government refineries ended over the weekend. July Nymex dropped 38 cents to $64.82, after gaining more than a $1 on Friday. \u001d  However, the market expects U.S. summer holiday driving to keep up gasoline demand and support the broader market. \u001d  METALS: \u001d  Spot gold is trading flat at $655.40, after its $2.40 rise on Friday. The market is drawing no clues from narrow currency movements, and gold's technicals point sideways and a lack of momentum. For now, gold is seen in a trading band of around $655-658. Copper futures were little changed. \b \u001d  CALENDAR: \b \bMonday, May 28, 2007 \bGMT                                                      Expected  Previous \b0900  ITA          6-month T-Bill Auction \b0900  ITA          29-day T-Bill Auction \b0900  ITA          24-month Zero-Coupon Bonds Auction \b1330  EU           ECB call for main refi tender \b2330  JPN  Apr     Labor Force Survey                       4.0%      4.0% \b2330  JPN  Apr     Household Spending                       +0.1%YY   +0.1%YY \b2350  JPN  Apr     Retail Sales, prelim                               -0.7%YY \bN/A   UK   May     House Prices Survey                                +0.7%MM \b                                                                      +6.8%YY \bN/A   GER          ASEM foreign mins meeting \bN/A   US           Memorial Day holiday;

(AA) launched a US$27 billion hostile takeover for Montreal-based Alcan Inc. (AL). Alcan's board on May 22 urged shareholders to reject the offer on the grounds it was too low and that its completion was too uncertain due to regulatory hurdles. \u001d  \"We suggest that the government first appoint a blue ribbon panel of experts to review the issues and make recommendations on changes to the Investment Canada Act within three months,\" Liberal leader Stephane Dion said at a news conference. \u001d  \"The government should hold back decisions on major foreign acquisitions and any changes to foreign ownership rules until after this process has been completed.\" \u001d  At the same time, the Liberals also want a special sub-committee of the Finance and Industry Committees to hold hearings on the issue through the summer. \u001d  Dion said he wasn't being protectionist, but wants Canadian companies to be \"champions\" in the global market. \"For that, we need to understand more of the rules of our competitors and to see which part of these rules would make sense in Canada,\" he said. \u001d  He said the Liberals would prefer to work with the minority Conservative government on the issue and will only \"figure out something else\" if the government disagrees with the proposals. The three opposition parties together have the majority of seats on the Finance and Industry committees. \u001d  Prime Minister Stephen Harper said the government in Budget 2007 had promised to review Canada's competition policies, including foreign investment legislation. \"And we are in the process of doing that,\" Harper said during question period in the House of Commons. \u001d  He said takeovers are a fact in a global economy, and while foreign companies are taking over Canadian firms, Canadian investments overseas are also growing. \"That's part of being in a globalized economy,\" he said. \u001d  A new Ipsos-Reid survey for CanWest Global found that 56% of Canadians believe foreign ownership is a problem in Canada and only 40% think it benefits the economy. Some 48% say the government isn't strict enough in regulating foreign investment and ownership rules. \u001d  In the last two years, the Canadian government approved 64 foreign takeovers of domestic firms with a combined asset value of C$93.6 billion (US$86.7 billion), according to Industry Canada data. \u001d  A foreign company that proposes to take over a Canadian firm with assets of at least C$281 million must file an application for review, seeking approval from the industry minister, a government official told Dow Jones recently. (The threshold is based on a formula linked to gross domestic product growth so the figure varies each year. Last year for example, the threshold was C$265 million. The threshold for a non-World Trade Organization member is C$5 million.) \u001d  The company proposing the takeover must demonstrate that the transaction has a net benefit to Canada. The industry minister makes his determination of net benefit based on six factors laid out in the Investment Canada Act. These include level of activity in Canada, the number of Canadians employees and competition, among other things. \u001d  \"The net benefit is the benefit of the entire transaction. Every transaction has positives and negatives. The positives have to outweigh the negatives,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u001d  The minister has 45 days to make his decision, and can unilaterally extend it for another 30 days. Any extensions beyond 75 days must be negotiated with the investor. \u001d  In the last five years, it's taken a little more than 45 days for the minister to make his decision, the official said. No applications were rejected in that time, he added. \b \u001d  -Nirmala Menon, Dow Jones Newswires; 613-237-0668; nirmala.menon@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 15:35 ET (19:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bcc1b5ad7b81d42361d237cf5c314006","symR":["LTS.WA","PLLOTOS00025","LTS.WA","PLLOTOS00025"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Poland's Lotos Shareholders Set 2006 Dividend At PLN0.36/Shr","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T12:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LTS.WA","PLLOTOS00025"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 08:05 ET (12:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"beacfccabbe8799956e6c63f1ce0abb6","symR":["ARU.T","CA0515441040"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Aurelian Decl 4-for-1 Stock Split>ARU.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T12:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ARU.T","CA0515441040"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 08:16 ET (12:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf2bfd6b9db9f95aae9106706972ebca","symR":["IIP.UN.T","CA46071W1068"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"InterRent REIT Announces Proposed Consolidation/Deconsolidation Of Its Trust Units","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T13:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IIP.UN.T","CA46071W1068"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 09:01 ET (13:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf62260b8a2c211fe2f8db3e7e5a0fd3","symR":["BGP.XX"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Blackston Fears Union Pressure Will Hit Returns","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T09:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BGP.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  PARIS (Financial News)--Blackstone Group has admitted trade union and political pressure on its investors and on industry tax breaks could harm its returns, Private Equity News reported Monday. \u001d  The alternative investments firm last week added to the risk factors section of its updated listing document filed with U.S. regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u001d  Pressure on private equity firms has intensified in the two months since Blackstone filed its original listing document. Its warning comes as the G8 countries meet next week in Germany, where they will face lobbying from a global network of trade unions over what they perceive as the negative impact of buyouts on companies, jobs and society. \u001d  In a new section of its risk factors, Blackstone said: \"U.S. and foreign labor unions have been agitating for greater legislative and regulatory oversight of private equity firms and transactions. Labor unions have also threatened to use their influence to prevent pension funds from investing in private equity funds.\" \u001d  Blackstone has met some of the campaigning unions, including the Switzerland based UNI Global Union, although future talks were unlikely, sources said. All parties declined to comment. \u001d  Potentially more serious is the threat to Blackstone's tax arrangements and structure due to revisions or challenges by the U.S. authorities. In its SEC filing, Blackstone said it was \"subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, including changes to treat all or part of certain capital gains as ordinary income\". \u001d  Personal investment gains from private equity are treated as capital gains, which gain taper relief over a number of years, so the tax burden is significantly lower than the top rate of income tax. Blackstone warned that by listing it might lose partnership status and have to become a company, increasing its tax liability and reducing the value of the common units that make up its public offering. \u001d  In a public letter to the SEC in mid-May, the AFL-CIO trade union in the U.S. said it was \"strongly urging the SEC to require Blackstone Group to register as an investment company\". Blackstone declined to comment about its listing or risk warnings. \u001d  A source close to the process said the changes to the warnings were driven by the SEC. However, industry sources said Blackstone's status was unlikely to change. In the filing, Blackstone said it would raise some $7.75 billion by selling a fifth of the company's ownership units to the public and the Chinese Government. \u001d  Blackstone's phenomenal growth in assets under management has yet to be affected - it added about $10 billion from the start of March to the beginning of this month and runs $88.4 billion, nearly a third more than at the start of the year. \u001d  Blackstone Group has gained exclusivity in talks to buy Italian restaurant chain Strada for GBP140 million. The offer price of about 10 times Strada's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization reflects Blackstone's appetite to bulk up its existing restaurant holding company Tragus, which operates the Caf&#233; Rouge and Bella Italia chains. In December, Blackstone bought Tragus for GBP267 million from LGV, the in-house buyout arm of U.K. insurer Legal & General. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 05:14 ET (09:14 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf876567f21efae1f1a97b0f7cd14756","symR":["EESR.RS","TGKE.RS","RU0008959655","RU000A0JKZF0"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"TGK-5 To Raise $453 Mln Through New Share Issue","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T07:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EESR.RS","TGKE.RS","RU0008959655","RU000A0JKZF0"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 03:45 ET (07:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c034e7ec0723950524094f588c7ed14e","symR":["IPR.V","MLY.T","CA45324A2002","CA8520671071"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Sprott Molybdenum Participation In Option Agreement To Acquire Shares Of Inca Pacific >MLY.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T12:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IPR.V","MLY.T","CA45324A2002","CA8520671071"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","ONF"],"Story":"\bTORONTO, May 28 /CNW/ - (TSX: MLY, MLY.WT) - Sprott Molybdenum Participation Corporation (the \"Corporation\") announced today that it has entered into an option agreement with RAB Special Situations (Master) Fund Limited (\"RAB\").

(WXX.T) shares continued to fall Monday by almost 8% following a crucial mistake in reporting first-quarter sales. But company officials said sales momentum is still rising and that the company has moved to avoid further errors by adding two financial experts to their team. \u001d  Last week, the action sports apparel retailer said it had issued wrong first-quarter sales figures earlier in the month. The Burlington, Ont.-company said its sales growth had been 15.5% or a total of C$41 million, rather than the initially reported 31% growth to C$46.5 million. \u001d  The stock lost 6.1% in the two days after the correction, and sank even further on Monday. \u001d  In Toronto, West 49 closed at C$1.28, down 11 Canadian cents. \u001d  Chief financial officer Steve Boyack said in an interview that he regretted the error, and that the market's reaction was \"very unfortunate,\" but that the company has been focusing on making strides towards a more robust financial reporting team. \u001d  \"It was a human error and occurred in consolidation\" of sales figures as systems are not yet fully integrated, Boyack said. \u001d  West 49 recently hired two variance specialists, with retail experience in public companies such as Hudson's Bay Co. (HBC.YY). Boyack said he hopes that by consolidating the company's back offices to the main Burlington location that the control environment will improve. \u001d  \"Obviously there is more work to be done,\" Boyack said. He expects the office consolidation to be completed in September. \u001d  As for the reaction in the share price, Boyack says he thinks there is a \"small segment (of shareholders) that overreacted.\" \u001d  Despite the recent downturn, Boyack remains positive and says he is excited about the company's growth, the three acquisitions the company has made since going public and the 10 to 12 new stores to open in the coming year. \u001d  West 49's first priority this year is to make existing businesses more profitable while maintaining a respectable rate of growth of the top line, he said. \u001d  The company's first-quarter earnings are expected in mid-June. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.west49.com \b \u001d  -Mirella Christou, Dow Jones Newswires: 416-306-2025 mirella.christou@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 17:15 ET (21:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c1690d39ba26a3c1a4d8430ccc6b4887","symR":["3436.TO","JP3322930003"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Japan's Sumco Expects 1H Grp Net Pft Y36.0B","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T06:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["3436.TO","JP3322930003"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 02:01 ET (06:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c17d0825431321f95d7e13d2ff75f11b","symR":["CCE.V","VGQ.T","CA2006971006","CA9278641084"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Virginia Sells Its Tantale Erlandson And Uranium Nord Properties And Signs A Partnership Agreement With Nunavik Mining Exploration Fund (NMEF) On The Champdore And Riviere Georges Projects>VGQ.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T13:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CCE.V","VGQ.T","CA2006971006","CA9278641084"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","MNG","PCS"],"Story":"\b   MONTREAL, QUEBEC--(CCNMatthews - May 28, 2007) - \b \bTANTALE ERLANDSON \b \bVirginia Mines Inc.

This figure surpasses the previous record of $382 million set by the six-day opening of \"Spiderman 3\" earlier this year.  \"Pirates\" continues to please audiences around the world with exceptionally strong exit polls. \b \u001d  Domestically, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" raised its weekend estimate to $156 million (including Thursday night showings). The film set a new record for the four-day Memorial Day Weekend with its gross of $142 million (including Monday estimates), surpassing the previous high of $122.8 million set by \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" in 2006. \b \u001d  At the international box office, Disney's latest \"Pirates\" adventure shattered records from Russia to Japan with its phenomenal $245 million cume through Monday (including Monday estimates).  The film had record-breaking openings (figures are through Sunday) in their respective markets in the following countries: Korea ($18.4 million), Japan ($15.9 million; US Productions only), Russia ($13.7 million), Spain ($11.6 million), Taiwan ($4.5 million) and Netherlands ($2.8 million).  It also set new Walt Disney Studio records in the U.K. ($26.6 million), France ($17.7 million), Germany ($16.8 million) and Australia ($9.9 million).  With its six-day tally of $245 million, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" has set a new international record that surpasses the previous six-day high of $232 million set by \"Spiderman 3\" a few weeks ago.  \"Pirates\" still has a few markets yet to open including China and India. \b \u001d  Commenting on the announcement, Zoradi said, \"We knew that audiences all over the world were excited to see Johnny Depp and the rest of the fantastic 'Pirates' cast in this latest adventure, but this record-setting response at the global box office has been nothing short of incredible.  'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' now has the distinction of having the biggest opening in movie history, and we're extremely proud of that achievement. Credit goes to the multitude of talent both in front of and behind the camera. Jerry Bruckheimer, Gore Verbinski and their exceptional teams as well as the creative minds of writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have proven to be the perfect recipe for success.\" \b \u001d  \"Pirates\" which rolled out on over 29,000 screens worldwide, showed on a record number of digital screens both domestically (1,064) and internationally (414) bringing the global total to 1,478.  The film has already become the Studio's 54th release to join the $100 million club internationally and the 53rd film to reach the $100 million plateau domestically -- unprecedented in the industry. \b \u001d  \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" picks up where the record- breaking 2006 smash hit left off, with our heroes Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) allied with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in a desperate quest to free Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from his mind-bending trap in Davy Jones' locker.  With the terrifying ghost ship, The Flying Dutchman, and its commander Davy Jones under the control of the East India Trading Company, there is havoc on the Seven Seas.  Navigating through treachery, betrayal and wild waters, the heroic trio must forge their way to exotic Singapore and confront the cunning Pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat).  Now headed beyond the very ends of the earth, each must ultimately choose a side in a final titanic battle -- as not only their lives and fortunes, but the entire future of the freedom-loving Pirate way hangs in the balance. \b \bSOURCE  Walt Disney Studios \b \u001d    /CONTACT: Heidi Trotta of The Walt Disney Studios, +1-818-560-7280 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 14:04 ET (18:04 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c8b0806f5e91ffd17dcd9d2290eda0f1","symR":["SAAB-B.SK","SE0000112385"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Saab: Pakistan Surveillance Systems Order Cut By SEK1.35B","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T06:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SAAB-B.SK","SE0000112385"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  STOCKHOLM (Dow Jones)--Saab AB (SAAB-B.SK) Monday said Pakistan has decided to renegotiate a contract for the company's airborne surveillance system in a move that will reduce the value of the deal by SEK1.35 billion. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 02:44 ET (06:44 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ca0b88d4e575c9fe034b828a9e375c9f","symR":["SPM.T","CA80917V1058"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Scorpio Mining Corporation Pre-Feasibility Update>SPM.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T12:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SPM.T","CA80917V1058"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG"],"Story":"\bVANCOUVER, May 28 /CNW/ - Scorpio Mining Corporation (TSX:SPM) (the \"Company\") wishes to update its shareholders with respect to the advancement of the ongoing Pre-Feasibility level studies on the Nuestra Senora silver-zinc project, Mexico. \b \bA meeting was held on May 16, 2007 with all engineering firms involved in the study.

(\"Opawica\" / the \"Company\") (TSX:OPW) announces that the Company has settled the terms of a private placement, Option and Joint Venture agreement with Northgate Minerals Corporation (\"Northgate\") (TSX:NGX). \b \bPRIVATE PLACEMENT \b \bNorthgate has agreed to subscribe for 10,000,000 shares of Opawica at $0.07 per share in a private placement for proceeds to Opawica of $700,000. This placement represents approximately 9% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Opawica and is subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange. \b \bOPTION AND JOINT VENTURE, Opawica Matachewan, Ontario, Properties \b \bIn addition to the above private placement Northgate and Opawica have agreed to an Option and Joint Venture agreement, also subject to Toronto Stock Exchange approval, whereby Northgate may earn up to a 55% interest in all of the mineral rights to Opawica's Matachewan, Ontario, properties and a 100% interest in surface access, easement and/or rights on at least 14 Opawica claims out of the 66 claims presently owned or under option by Opawica in the Matachewan area. These 14 claims are contiguous to the northern boundary of Northgate's Young-Davidson property where Northgate has reported measured, indicated and inferred reserves and resources of approximately 2.1 million ounces of gold. \b \bNorthgate may earn its various interests in the Opawica properties by Northgate concluding the above $700,000 private placement, paying Opawica $200,000 in cash, incurring $750,000 of firm exploration commitments on Opawica's Matachewan properties and by incurring a further $1,250,000 of optional exploration expenditures on Opawica properties all within the next 36 months. \b \bIn addition, subject to certain conditions, Northgate has agreed to mine and mill, at cost plus 15%, any Northgate and Opawica Joint Venture ores that are discovered on Opawica's Matachewan properties, at the proposed 100% owned Northgate Young - Davidson gold project, in the event that the Young Davidson project is advanced to commercial production. \b \bFinal documentation concerning the above agreements will be finalized and submitted for TSX approval in the next several weeks. \b \bOPAWICA MATACHEWAN, ONTARIO, PROPERTIES - 2007 Exploration Program \b \bAs a result of recent surface trenching, sampling and the deep Titan geophysical survey, a drill program has been recommended on Opawica's Matachewan properties. \b \bThe deep Titan-24 Survey initiated in April 2007 has been completed by Quantec Geoscience Ltd. (\"Quantec\"). \b \bA total of 40 anomalies have been identified by the Titan interpretation group of Quantec based on the results of the Titan-24 DC Resistivity, IP and MT data inversions. A program of surface back-hoe stripping is in progress to evaluate the near surface Titan anomalies that will be followed by diamond drilling. \b \bIt appears that the Camking Gold Zone and the Walker copper-gold zones have associated Titan anomalies. \b \bThe Walker Zone is a copper-gold-silver zone associated with quartz veining, pyrite and chalcopyrite mineralization in a syenite dike and Temiskaming sediments as a roof pendant over a strike length of 600 meters striking east-west. Shallow and deep Titan anomalies are associated with this zone over a strike length of 600 meters. The zone currently being explored is situated approximately 900 meters north of the Young Davidson gold zone currently being explored by Northgate. \b \bDrilling of the Opawica anomalies is scheduled to commence on or about June 15, 2007. In addition, ground geophysics will commence in June on Opawica claims that are contiguous to the northern border of the Young Davidson property with the objective of finding further drill targets that are on or near the Opawica and Young Davidson common boundary. \b \bDrilling that will start in June, 2007 will test any targets found on the 14 Opawica claims contiguous to the Young Davidson property as well as on the 40 anomalies outlined by the Titan-24 survey noted above. It is expected that at least 40 holes of about 200m each will be drilled prior to year end. \b \bOpawica is the Operator of the exploration programs on the Opawica Matachewan properties until Northgate has earned its 55% interest in and to the Opawica properties.

The All Items Index has now advanced 132.2 per cent above the cyclical low in October 2001. \b \bThe Metal and Mineral Index posted another record high in April, the third in as many months, and is 85.3 per cent above the previous peak in June 1988. Many metals climbed to new heights (nickel, cobalt, lead, uranium and potash) alongside ongoing strength in China's industrial activity (up 17.4 per cent year-over-year in April), the global upswing in metal-intensive investment in processing plant, oil and gas drilling and pipelines and booming aircraft orders. \b \bCash-rich mining companies are moving to strengthen their position in the global marketplace in what is turning out to be an extended 'super-cycle' for metal prices. The opening up of many emerging economies in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Russia, the Baltic States and Eastern Europe, as well as strong projected growth in China and India, has more than offset the marked slowdown in the United States over the past year and points to a period of sustained demand growth for metals and minerals. \b \b\"The recent acquisition of Canada's two largest nickel producers, as well as a host of prospective smaller transactions, reflects expectations that the international supply/demand balance for nickel will remain in deficit through the first half of 2008,\" says Patricia Mohr, Vice-President, Economics and commodity market specialist at Scotiabank. \"While prices will eventually unwind from today's spectacular levels, prices should remain quite elevated over the balance of the decade, given only a handful of planned major mining developments and strong trend growth in stainless and specialty steel demand.\" \b \bThe driving force behind the recent bid for Canada's largest aluminium company, ranked third in the world with a 9.2 per cent share of global smelter output, by a U.S.-based producer appears to be less related to expectations of high aluminium prices and more to the need to bolster market position and clout in a rapidly changing global environment. China's capacity expansion in aluminium has been breathtaking since 2003, up 22.3 per cent per annum, with China quickly emerging as the world's top producing country with 32 per cent of global output and Chalco the world's fourth largest smelter. A Russian company has recently catapulted into the top position in aluminium, with the merger of three companies. The net result, industry concentration has increased substantially in aluminium, nickel and copper in the past year, with the top five producers now accounting for 40.1 per cent, 51.5 per cent and 39.7 per cent respectively of world production. \b \b\"This year promises to be another strong year for global aluminium consumption, with a gain of 8.5 per cent,\" says Ms. Mohr. \"China's consumption will soar by 28 per cent in 2007, boosted by expansion of the electric transmission system, and Europe's demand remains high, more than offsetting auto and housing-related weakness in the United States.\" However, an even stronger gain in world smelter output (up 12 per cent) with substantial capacity expansion in China, Iceland, Russia and Dubai and the re-start of some U.S. smelters may turn the supply/demand balance from a deficit into a surplus, as 2007 unfolds. \b \bSpot uranium prices have advanced to US$125 per pound in late May, up 73.6 per cent since late 2006. Global interest in nuclear power continues to grow, with 252 new reactors now under construction, scheduled or proposed. LME nickel prices are over US$23 per pound in late May, 142 per cent above a year earlier, and prices for steel alloying agents (molybdenum and cobalt) are robust. \b \bWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have increased from US$60.74 per barrel in March to US$65.20 in late May, a substantial rebound from weather-related weakness in early 2007. Low U.S. gasoline inventories, linked to unusually heavy refinery outages and maintenance ahead of the driving season (with aging refineries now being upgraded) pushed up average U.S. retail gasoline prices to US$3.26 per gallon on May 21, a record level in data back to 1993, even surpassing the spike in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The strength of crude oil prices also reflects a fairly snug world supply/demand balance. \b \bThe Forest Product Index also inched up in April, as northern bleached softwood kraft pulp prices rose to the highest level since early 1996 and U.S. fine paper prices showed surprising strength, more than offsetting further slippage in lumber. However, Western Spruce-Pine-Fir 2x4 lumber prices rebounded to US$260 per thousand board feet in late May, on news that U.S. new home sales jumped to 981,000 units annualized in April (up 16 per cent), with homebuilders offering sharply lower prices to spur sales. \b \bThe Agricultural Index strengthened in April. Cash canola prices (FOB Vancouver) rose from US$331 per tonne in March to US$337 (up 37 per cent year-over-year), though Canadian dollar appreciation will reduce receipts for Prairie farmers. Demand for vegetable oils is strong in China and India and a shift in plantings by U.S. farmers away from soybeans to corn for ethanol has propelled soyoil prices to record highs. Canadian canola/rapeseed breeders are focusing on developing high-omega canola varieties that produce canola oils with zero trans-fat in processed products. \b \bScotia Economics provides clients with in-depth research into the factors shaping the outlook for Canada and the global economy, including macroeconomic developments, currency and capital market trends, commodity and industry performance, as well as monetary, fiscal and public policy issues. \b \b     /CONTACT: Patricia Mohr, Scotia Economics, (416) 866-4210, pat_mohr@scotiacapital.com; Paula Cufre, Scotiabank Public Affairs, (416) 933-1093, paula_cufre@scotiacapital.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 09:08 ET (13:08 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d0ea13208c1a0a259d387e44bb9036ef","symR":["BCP.LB","BPI.LB","SAN.MC","STD","ES0113900J37","PTBCP0AM0007","PTBPI0AM0004"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"BCP Removes Bylaws Change From Holders Meeting Agenda","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T21:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BCP.LB","BPI.LB","SAN.MC","STD","ES0113900J37","PTBCP0AM0007","PTBPI0AM0004"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","INF","INS","XDAX","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XIBEX","XNYA","XP20","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 17:15 ET (21:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d2cb4a507cf4a11529efe4055e18101d","symR":["MDC.YY"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": With A 64% Increase In First Quarter Net Earnings...

Net earnings for this provider of life and health insurance and retirement savings products rose from $30.4M in the first quarter of 2006 to $49.8M on March 31, 2007, for a 63.5% increase. Operating income reached new heights at $68.1M, an improvement of $24.0M. This excellent quarterly performance is attributable mainly to improved disability claims experience, return on investment and administrative spending growth kept below income growth. Insurance premium income stood at $580.5M, up $60.1M. This brings total insurance, annuity and other premium income to $783.7M for the period. Insurance sales grew by 94.8% and totalled $98.0M, $47.7M more than on March 31, 2006. Assets under management and administration stood at $22.3B, for a $2.3B increase since the beginning of the year. \b \bWith performances like these, the Company continues to contribute solidly to the profitability of its parent company, Desjardins Group, the largest cooperative financial group in Canada. From January to March 2007, Desjardins Group accumulated combined surplus earnings before patronage dividends of $265 M. The portion of Desjardins Financial Security's net earnings attributable to its ultimate shareholders, the Desjardins caisses, stood at $48.0M, an improvement of $19.6M. Return on shareholder equity was 21.6%, compared to 16.3% in the first quarter of 2006, and remains one of the best in the financial services industry. \b \bMr. Alban d'Amours, President and Chief Executive Officer of Desjardins Group, and also Chief Executive Officer of Desjardins Financial Security, said he was very satisfied with the Company's performance in the first quarter of 2007. \"Results like these, in a market as competitive as the Canadian life and health insurance market, are remarkable in themselves and a tribute to the quality of our insurance subsidiary's management team. Already well-established in Quebec, Desjardins Financial Security is perfectly positioned to pursue its development elsewhere in Canada, where it wants to double its market shares by the end of 2008.\" \b \bMr. Richard Fortier, President and Chief Operating Officer of Desjardins Financial Security, was particularly pleased with the Company's strong group and business insurance sales growth. \"The visibility we gained when we acquired the Government of Labrador and Newfoundland public service employees group insurance contract in 2006 has helped us sign major new contracts not only outside Quebec, where sales have increased by close to 70% in the first quarter, but also in Quebec, where we have more than tripled our sales over the same period.\" \b \bStrong group insurance sales growth \b \bIn the first three months of 2007, net earnings for the group insurance line of business, including group and business insurance plans and plans offered through financial institutions, like the Desjardins caisses, stood at $31.8M, compared to $18.9M in 2006. In group and business insurance, sales have more than doubled compared to the first quarter of 2006, increasing from $42.0M to $88.7M. Premiums totalled $339.0M, for an improvement of $49.2M. These excellent results are due to the acquisition of new groups of 1,000 or more members, and the natural growth of existing groups. Premiums from plans offered through financial institutions, especially credit insurance plans, stood at $117.0M, for a $5.1M increase. \b \bIndividual insurance premium and sales growth \b \bIn this business line, net earnings totalled $12.9M, compared to $10.4M in the first three months of 2006. The 16.0% increase in Vision coverages sold through financial security advisors assigned to the caisses is primarily responsible for the 4.1% gain in gross premium volume, which stood at $116.4M for the period. Sales totalled $9.3M, a $1.0M improvement due mainly to a solid performance outside Quebec. Lastly, the premium volume for products sold by direct distribution stood at $21.5M, representing a $1.7M increase over the first quarter of 2006. \b \bIncrease in mutual fund sales \b \bIn Savings, net earnings for the first three months of 2007 stood at $5.1M, compared to $1.2M in 2006. Overall sales, which totalled $368.0M, were down by $19.8M over 2006. Mutual fund sales stood at $226.8M, compared to $162.4M a year earlier. In individual savings, Millennia sales had an excellent start to the year, crossing the $50.0M mark, for an 18.4% increase over 2006 figures. The Millennia III family of segregated funds was expanded and now includes four new Millennia III Franklin Templeton/QuotentiaI funds. These new funds were responsible for generating 30.7% of the quarter's sales. At $85.3M, total sales of individual savings products were down $8.6M from 2006. Group retirement savings sales totalled $55.9M, a drop of $75.6M from the first quarter of 2006, during which major contracts were signed and sales stood at $131.5M. \b \bAbout Desjardins Financial Security \b \bDesjardins Financial Security, a subsidiary of Desjardins Group, the largest integrated cooperative financial group in Canada, specializes in individual and group life and health insurance, as well as retirement savings products and services.

The rig will be dedicated to drilling thermal CSS wells; we anticipate drilling 12 additional wells for a total of 16 CSS wells in 2007. Proposals for the third rig, to be available in February 2008, have been received from two drilling companies and we expect to award the contract in the next few days. \b \bThermal Program \b \bFour new thermal CSS wells have been drilled and completed as oil wells in the second quarter. The wells started with cold production at an average rate of 30 bopd each. These are encouraging results since we can expect a significant increase in production rates after completion of the first steam injection cycle in the four wells commencing in July. \b \bThe contract for six steam generators has been awarded to a US manufacturer. We expect delivery of the first two generators in December 2007 and January 2008 and one additional generator thereafter in each quarter of 2008. Construction has commenced for a second 2,500 bopd Central Processing Facility (\"CPF\") in the southern portion of the Issaran field to accommodate production from CSS wells. We expect the CPF and expanded production facilities to be operational in December 2007. \b \bAcceleration of Thermal Program in 2008 \b \bIn 2008, the thermal drilling program will be accelerated further when the third drilling rig will be deployed in the Issaran field. Acceleration of the thermal drilling and facilities program in 2008, by utilizing the two new rigs and delivery of six new steam generators, will have a positive impact on the Corporation's production target for 2008. \b \bConventional Drilling Program \b \bEven though no additional conventional development locations were drilled in the last two months, the Corporation has maintained its average production from the Issaran field at 6,000 bopd and current production is 6,500 bopd. The existing rig is currently drilling a Nukhul development location to increase conventional production and will then move to the West Issaran discovery area to drill three delineation wells by mid-July. The rig will then resume drilling the remainder of its conventional drilling program for the second half of 2007. We currently anticipate drilling 16 more wells for a total of 31 conventional wells in 2007. \b \bExpanded Exploration Program \b \bA new 60 square kilometre, 3-D seismic program for the Issaran Concession area was approved by the Operating Committee in Cairo last week to complete geophysical interpretation of leads at West Rahmi and the remainder of the Concession area. The program is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2007 when the first seismic crew becomes available. The Corporation is expecting to commence exploitation of the Rahmi area before the end of 2007. \b \bPAKISTAN \b \bOn May 15, the Operating Committee met in Islamabad with partners of the Safed Koh Concession and approved deploying a second larger rig for drilling the offset Dewan 5-A location at the Salsabil field. The well has been re-designed to mitigate surface-hole problems and is expected to commence drilling in August as soon as the rig is mobilized to the new location. \b \bThe current rig will be moved to the Zindapir prospect area following completion of the access road and securing all necessary equipment required for drilling the well. The 2,100 metre exploration well is expected to commence drilling in September. \b \bManagement of Rally Energy and the operator had several meetings with the Minister of Petroleum of Pakistan, Secretary of Petroleum and the Director General of Petroleum Concessions regarding the gas price issue. The Corporation has been informed that a final decision will be made during the first week of June. We have been advised by the operator that once confirmation of the gas price is received, Salsabil field production can commence within 30 days. \b \b2007 PRODUCTION GUIDANCE \b \bWith sustained conventional production from the Issaran field, excellent initial productivity from several conventional wells drilled earlier this year, additional conventional drilling, new thermal production from CSS wells and development of the new discovery at West Issaran, we anticipate that the 2007 Issaran average production targets of approximately 7,400 bopd will be met. Average gas production for 2007 from Pakistan is now expected to be approximately 1,000 boepd due to the delay in production commencement, with an exit rate at full plant capacity of 2,900 boepd. \b \b \b    << \b                   ---------------------------------------- \b    >> \b \b \bBased in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Rally Energy is an oil and gas exploration, development and production company. The Corporation's primary area of operations is in Egypt, where it has a 100% operating interest in the Issaran Oilfield, a significant heavy oil development opportunity with strong growth potential. In Pakistan, the Corporation holds a 30% interest in the Safed Koh Block, where it is participating in the development of a large natural gas/condensate discovery. \b \b \b    << \b                 ------------------------------------------- \b \b                         FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \b    >> \b \b \bExcept for statements of historical fact, all statements in this news release - including, without limitation, statements regarding production estimates, potential reserves and future plans and objectives of Rally - are forward-looking statements that involve various risks and uncertainties.

Since then, sales of Fosamax for the treatment of osteoporosis and Paget's disease have been strong. \b \bUse of Fosamax has been linked to an increased risk of developing Osteonecrosis of the jaw (\"ONJ\"), also known as \"jaw death\". ONJ can be extremely painful and can cause jaw bones to rot and die. Merck is now warning consumers about the possibility of developing ONJ and Health Canada is monitoring the situation. \b \bThe Statement of Claim alleges that Merck failed to adequately warn patients and physicians that Fosamax has been associated with an increased risk of developing ONJ. Michael Peerless, a partner with Siskinds LLP, says \"We believe that through this lawsuit Merck will be required to explain to Canadian consumers what it knew about the risks associated with Fosamax and when it first became aware of those risks. In this case, as with all of these types of cases, we are concerned about whether Canadians were adequately warned of the risks associated with using the product in question.\" \b \bIt is too early at this stage to quantify the claims of potential class members, but it is anticipated that the amount is significant.

(CGJ.AU) - raising the possibility rival bidder Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES.AU) could proceed unchallenged. \u001d  The decision by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR.XX) and CVC came after the consortium finished a two-week period of due diligence on the country's second-biggest food and liquor group Friday. \u001d  \"KKR and CVC are out of the consortium,\" a spokesman for the consortium said. \u001d  The spokesman said there were four remaining members of the bidding team - TPG, Carlyle Group, Blackstone Group LP and Bain Capital LLC - but wouldn't rule out further changes. \u001d  A person close to one of the remaining members said that firm is still considering its options, and proceeding as a four-member group remains on the cards. Other members of the consortium couldn't be reached for comment. \u001d  The buyout firms' departure strengthens Wesfarmers' grip on the sale process, and casts a shadow over the state of the business which was formally put up for sale in February after a profit downgrade. The Wesfarmers-led syndicate was already considered the frontrunner after building up a 12.8% stake following a raid on the retailer's share register last month. \u001d  It made an indicative A$16.47 a share proposal to Coles' board April 3, trumping a A$15.25 share offer from the KKR consortium last October that was rebuffed by the board. \u001d  Coles shares closed at A$17.36, down 9 cents, valuing it at A$20.81 billion. Confirmation KKR had walked away was made after the market closed while CVC's departure was announced during trade. The stock has eased back over the past week from a record A$17.95 earlier this month. \u001d  U.K. retailer Tesco PLC hired an adviser to look at a possible bid for Coles but pulled out of the race earlier this month, people familiar with the situation have said. \u001d  Prior to CVC and KKR's withdrawal the consortium had four joint leaders CVC, KKR, TPG and Carlyle and two junior partners, Bain and Blackstone. A new consortium could have TPG and Carlyle leading, with Bain and Blackstone remaining junior partners, the person close to a bidding member said. \u001d  Partnering in a bid with Coles' rival Woolworths Ltd. (WOW.AU) - which is keen to acquire the group's general merchandise assets - remains a possibility, the person said. Woolworths is yet to commit to any bidding party or start due diligence, but is considered a key element in blunting Wesfarmers' strategic edge. \u001d  Including Woolworths to the bid would allow the buyout consortium to offer tax rollover relief for some investors. A tie-up may also go some way to countering the perceived advantage Wesfarmers holds in keeping Coles in Australian hands. \u001d  Woolworths wasn't immediately available to comment. Wesfarmers is leading a buyout consortium including European buyout group Permira, local firm Pacific Equity Partners and Macquarie Bank Ltd. \u001d  Earlier last month Wesfarmers unsuccessfully approached some institutions with a proposal to buy their shares in Coles at A$17.25 a share each, people close to bidding process have said.    As part of Wesfarmers' condition to begin due diligence Friday, the consortium signed a standstill agreement preventing it from buying any more shares in the retailer. \u001d  Coles was not immediately available to comment. \u001d  -By Susan Murdoch, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9671-4393; susan.murdoch@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 08:48 ET (12:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"da50156f160f8b74a0795796cadb79c5","symR":["SVW.T","CA83149P1027","SVW.T","CA83149P1027"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Silverwing Energy Plans Minimum C$25M Unit Offer >SVW.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T20:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SVW.T","CA83149P1027"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Corrected May 28, 2007, 17:03 EDT (21:03 GMT)\u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 16:57 ET (20:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"db648fa2089c7b05488f97be46f6dd78","symR":["SAS.SK","SE0000805574"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"SAS Sweden Cancels Flights For Tue May 29 >SAS.SK","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T11:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SAS.SK","SE0000805574"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  STOCKHOLM (Dow Jones)--Scandinavian airline SAS AB's (SAS.SK) Swedish unit Monday said it would cancel most of its flights Tuesday as a strike among its cabin crew continues. \u001d  SAS said negotiations with the HTF labor union continues but that a resolution in the conflict has yet to be reached. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 07:24 ET (11:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"dbb77d707a2bd669dd9d7663f2f9da2e","symR":["FCX","US35671D8570"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Chile Codelco, Phelps Aim To Extend El Abra Copper Mine Life","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T19:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FCX","US35671D8570"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SANTIAGO (Dow Jones)--Chilean state copper giant Corporacion Nacional del Cobre, or Codelco, and Phelps Dodge, a unit of Freeport McMoran Copper & Gold Corp.

In addition, the company's margins rose to historically high levels on nickel prices and a focus on cost-cutting. \u001d  \"We would highlight that CVRD has been able to improve margins, bringing consolidated Ebitda margin to 56% this quarter, as it achieved higher nickel prices - $40,000 versus $32,000 (in the fourth quarter of 2006) - and lowered costs sequentially,\" UBS Investment Research said in a recent report. \u001d  More important, the strong margin figures are expected to become a trend after the company embarked on an intense effort to rein in costs. \u001d  \"We would note Ebitda margin as the principal indicator in the first-quarter results, primarily because the reduction in costs observed between the fourth quarter 2006 and first quarter 2007 is a tendency that is expected to be maintained in coming quarters,\" Sao Paulo-based brokerage Brascan Corretora said in a report. \u001d  However, analysts did rain on CVRD's first-quarter earnings parade, noting that deliveries declined for the second-consecutive quarter compared with the previous quarter. \u001d  \"The fact that iron ore sales volumes suffered a decline of 10% compared with the last quarter of 2006 causes us some apprehension, even though there is a clear seasonal effect on sales according to each year's quarters,\" Brascan said. \u001d  Sales volumes declined to 55.792 million metric tons in the first quarter, compared with 61.046 million tons in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 63.111 million tons in the third quarter of 2006. \u001d  CVRD attributed the dip to heavy seasonal rains that affected production and deliveries. The first quarter is typically CVRD's weakest because of the seasonal factors. \u001d  But iron ore sales volumes did rise 1.7% compared with the first quarter of 2006, bumped by the wealth of new projects that entered production, such as the giant Brucutu mine, during 2006. \u001d  Costs also rose at a higher-than-expected pace, according to BMO Capital Markets. \u001d  \"Adjusted cost of goods sold were also 14.1% higher than expected, primarily due to higher-than-expected nickel expenses,\" BMO Capital said. \u001d  BMO Capital also noted a jump in net financial expenses related to financing for the company's $17.6 billion purchase of Inco last year, which resulted in more short-term debt in the quarter. However, the higher expenses should be short lived. \u001d  \"With the takeout of the bridge loan completed as of April 27, we would expect financial costs to trend back to a more normalized level next quarter,\" BMO Capital said. \u001d  And the future still appears rosy for CVRD, given that base metals prices continue to trade at historic highs. In addition, the second quarter will include the 2007 price increase of 9.5% for iron ore fines and 5.28% hike for iron pellets. \u001d  According to UBS, volume growth in iron ore to 300 million metric tons in 2007 and nickel to 280,000 metric tons combined with higher prices for each raw material \"should contribute to significant top-line and earnings growth.\" \u001d  Brascan also noted that Chinese economic growth, which reached 11% in the first quarter, continued to bode well for CVRD. China is CVRD's primary iron ore client. \u001d  \"In our opinion, the expectations are even better for the second quarter because the international scenario and Chinese economy continue to be outstanding,\" Brascan said. \u001d  CVRD local shares traded 0.7% higher at 71.70 Brazilian reals ($36.73) in midafternoon trade Monday, in line with the overall market. The company's American depositary receipts, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, did not trade because of the Memorial Day holiday. \u001d  The company's locally traded shares are up 33.9% so far in 2007, and up 58.2% in the past 12 months. \b \u001d  -By Jeff Fick, Dow Jones Newswires; 55-11-3145-1481; jeff.fick@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 12:35 ET (16:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"de474d024227858166b0bc0f7d91f7c0","symR":["CVC.YY","PBL.AU","AU000000PBL6"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Australia's PBL: CVC In Discussions Over Media Sale","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T05:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CVC.YY","PBL.AU","AU000000PBL6"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","FIS","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 01:32 ET (05:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"de7e2682f43fa200f8a594af368d6aed","symR":["BPE.MI","PMI.MI","IT0000064482","IT0000066123"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Pop Milano, Pop Emilia Romagna Boards OK Merger","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T16:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BPE.MI","PMI.MI","IT0000064482","IT0000066123"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","XDJGI","XMIB"],"Story":"\u001d  ROME (Dow Jones)--The boards of Italian mutual banks Banca Popolare di Milano SCARL (PMI.MI) and Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna SCARL (BPE.MI) Monday approved a merger that creates the country's seventh-largest bank by number of branches. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 12:50 ET (16:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"df72dfe116b9b73d348b17c870a099f7","symR":["DIS","US2546871060"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Fire Suspends Broadcast Of New York City ABC Station","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T05:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DIS","US2546871060"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Updates with details) \b \u001d  NEW YORK (AP)--A fire at the WABC-TV studios in Manhattan knocked out Sunday night's programming and caused the evacuation of the television network's building. \u001d  Channel 7's Sunday night broadcast was suspended a few minutes before the 11 p.m. news.

Attention is now focused on the nature and tempo of Sanyo's reform drive. The company's difficulty restoring its financial health likely frustrate Goldman and other backers, especially since Sanyo faces sharp drops in prices for its digital cameras and other products. \u001d  The company reported group sales of Y2.215 trillion, down 7.6% from Y2.397 trillion a year earlier. \u001d  Despite this, the electronics maker booked a Y49.57 billion operating profit in the year to March, compared with a Y17.15 billion operating loss a year earlier. \u001d  \"Our recovery on a net basis was delayed due to additional costs in (our) reform steps,\" said Sanyo in an earnings release.

(500520.BY) Monday said its fiscal fourth-quarter net profit fell 26.5% on the year due to a high base effect last year when the firm sold a stake in a subsidiary. \u001d  Mahindra said net profit for the January-March quarter fell to INR2.36 billion from INR3.21 billion a year ago. \u001d  \"In the fourth quarter last (fiscal) year we sold a shareholding in Mahindra Financial,\" Managing Director Anand Mahindra told reporters in reference to the financial year ended March 2006. \u001d  \"If you remove the gain from this stake sale then our net profit for this fourth quarter has actually grown by about 36%,\" he said. \u001d  In the January-March 2006 quarter, Mahindra sold a 29% stake in Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. (532720.BY), worth INR1.46 billion, during the initial public offering of the unit, company officials said. \u001d  Mahindra, which is India's largest utility vehicle and tractor maker by sales volume, said its total revenue for the January-March quarter rose 20.7% to INR31.77 billion compared with INR26.33 billion a year ago. \u001d  The company's board also approved a final dividend of INR2.5 a share and a special dividend of INR1.50 per share. \u001d  Separately, Mahindra - which also produces light trucks, buses, industrial engines and three-wheelers - hopes to complete the purchase of a controlling stake in Punjab Tractors Ltd. (500344.BY) by June, a senior company official said. \u001d  \"The open offer (for a 43.3% stake in Punjab Tractors) has opened today and we hope the transaction will be over by end-June,\" said Bharat Doshi, president for finance and corporate affairs. \u001d  In addition, Mahindra Automotive Sector President Pawan Goenka said the company is developing two new vehicle platforms with an investment of INR6 billion each. \u001d  \"One platform will be a sports utility vehicle which will be slightly upmarket...and the other product will be a mass market vehicle which can be used for both cargo and passengers,\" Goenka said, without giving a timeframe for the launch. \u001d  Mahindra, which is the flagship of the Mahindra Group, said expenditure increased to INR24.34 billion during the fourth quarter of fiscal-year 2007 from INR20.17 billion a year earlier, as raw material costs rose nearly 18% to INR19.28 billion. \u001d  However, the company managed to lower raw material expenses as a proportion of net sales - a barometer of profitability - during the quarter on better operational efficiency, analysts said. \u001d  Mahindra sold 78,696 tractors during the quarter, 4.2% more than a year earlier. Its utility vehicle sales grew 18.5% to 39,879 units. \u001d  The Mahindra Group also has interests in auto parts, telecommunications, real estate and resorts. \u001d  Mahindra has a 51:49 joint venture with France's Renault (13190.FR) in India called Mahindra Renault Pvt. Ltd., which makes the French car maker's Logan model in the country. \u001d  In February, Mahindra also agreed to build a shared 400,000-per-year car production capacity facility in south India with Nissan Motor Co. (7201.TO) and Renault. \u001d  Renault holds a 44% stake in Nissan. \u001d  However, analysts remain worried that the Reserve Bank of India's recent measures to curb inflation by raising rates may affect demand for Mahindra & Mahindra's products. \u001d  \"The biggest worry for the company is higher interest rates, which could dampen demand,\" said Ashutosh Goel, automobile analyst at Edelweiss Capital. \u001d  Goenka said that, while there were no immediate signs of a slowdown in sales due to higher borrowing costs for the company, sales for the industry could see some moderation. \u001d  Mahindra's consolidated total income for the year ended March 31, 2007, rose to over INR179.12 billion from INR126.48 billion a year ago, the company said. \u001d  -By Neelabh Chaturvedi and Nitin Luthra, Dow Jones Newswires; +91-011-23074020; nitin.luthra@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 11:15 ET (15:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ef12f5f3e043dc210c4a535a19f039a1","symR":["SI","SIE.XE","DE0007236101"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Siemens's Cromme Expects More Disclosures From Probe -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T10:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SI","SIE.XE","DE0007236101"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDAX","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--The chairman of Siemens AG's (SI) supervisory board expects there could be further revelations resulting from the bribery investigation at the company, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reports. \u001d  \"I can't rule out that there could be some rude surprises in the next months,\" the paper cites Gerhard Cromme as saying.

Additional upgraders such as the Northern \b       Lights project are possible. \b \b    -  Canadian Pacific (CP) has assembled the necessary land and route, and \b       is applying to the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) to build rail \b       lines that will serve new oil sands upgraders and other facilities. \b \b    -  Canadian Pacific's Scotford Subdivision is the key rail corridor \b       connecting CP's Calgary to Edmonton main line with Alberta's \b       Industrial Heartland region. Running 36.5 miles north-east from \b       Edmonton to Scotford, CP's operations on the Scotford Subdivision \b       serve established customers such as Shell Canada, and its existing oil \b       sands upgrader facility at Scotford. \b \b    -  CP maintains daily service connecting its Scotford Yard facility with \b       main line connections at Edmonton. With expansion underway at Shell's \b       existing Strathcona County Upgrader, CP is looking to add capacity to \b       its Scotford Yard in addition to its Industrial Heartland expansion \b       project. \b \b    -  CP is proposing the addition of a new Sturgeon Subdivision which will \b       provide rail service to shippers located on the north side of the \b       North Saskatchewan River in Sturgeon County. \b \b    -  The Sturgeon Subdivision is proposed to run north through industrial \b       zoned property within Strathcona County to a crossing of the North \b       Saskatchewan River. A proposed bridge over the North Saskatchewan \b       River will align the Sturgeon Subdivision to follow west and route \b       through a proposed Upgrader site. \b \b    -  On the Sturgeon Subdivision, CP is also proposing a potential \b       marshaling yard facility designed to meet the service requirements of \b       customers on the north side of the North Saskatchewan River and, a \b       spur line to meet future business development projected for Sturgeon \b       County and to provide a location for trans-loading operations. \b \b    -  CP's long term focus is on moving by-products created from the \b       Industrial Heartland area upgraders which include sulphur, petroleum \b       coke, asphaltene and various liquids & gases. Market potential varies \b       based on the timing of construction projects, but total rail market \b       potential is significant. \b \b    -  CP's short term focus is on inbound construction material, including \b       steel, pipe, cement, vessels, modules, etc. However, total market \b       potential is largely dependent on the timing of construction projects. \b \b \b                     Oils Sands Development - Quick Facts \b \b    -  Alberta's oil sands are one of the earth's largest bodies of oil. \b       Proven reserves are 174 billion barrels, second only to Saudi Arabia. \b       All current commercial oil sands deposits are located in northern \b       Alberta. In 2005, annual oil sands production reached 1.1 million \b       barrels per day (bpd). In 2006, Canada's National Energy Board \b       forecast that base case bitumen production would rise to 3.0 million \b       bpd by 2015. \b \b    -  Even when using only proven reserves, Alberta's bitumen resource would \b       be sufficient to handle Canada's domestic oil demand for 250 years. \b \b    -  Typical oil sands deposits are comprised of 75-80% inorganic material \b       (quartz sand, silt and clay predominantly), 10-12% bitumen and 3-5% \b       water. \b \b    -  Bitumen normally consists of very long chain hydrocarbon molecules. \b       Relative to light crudes, bitumen has an excess of carbon or shortage \b       of hydrogen. Bitumen is virtually a solid at ambient temperatures. \b \b    -  In order to make bitumen acceptable for conventional refineries, it \b       must be upgraded to Synthetic Crude Oil (SCO). This intermediate \b       process produces higher value Synthetic Crude Oil (SCO) and related \b       byproducts. \b \b    -  Currently, two-thirds of the bitumen produced is upgraded into SCO in \b       Alberta before being shipped to downstream markets. \b \b    -  While a wide range of technologies are used to upgrade bitumen, in \b       general the process consists of cracking bitumen under heat and \b       pressure in the presence of catalysts to break up the long chain \b       molecules into much smaller molecules. Excess carbon is then either \b       extracted from the bitumen or is combined with added hydrogen in order \b       to produce lighter hydrocarbons. \b \b    -  Upgrading typically produces very light hydro-carbons known as \"off- \b       gasses\". Off gasses can be used as fuel in an upgrader, or if there is \b       sufficient quantity and economic value, some off gasses can be \b       processed and marketed separately as fuel or feedstock for \b       petrochemical plants. \b \b    -  Bitumen also contains impurities, that may be extracted in the \b       upgrading process.

Closing is subject to certain conditions and is anticipated to occur on or about June 15, 2007. \b \bThere is no production associated with the assets to be sold. The assets represent approximately 5 percent of both the Company's undeveloped land and its total proven and probable reserves as at December 31, 2006, and generated other income of approximately $180,000 in the first quarter of 2007.

Kazatomprom is owned by the Kazakh government. \b \b\"We are pleased to build on the longstanding and strong business relationship we have with Kazatomprom,\" said Jerry Grandey, Cameco's president and CEO. \"This MOU provides significant growth opportunities for both companies.\" \b \bUnder the terms of the MOU, Cameco will work with Kazatomprom to study the feasibility of constructing a uranium conversion facility in Kazakhstan and elsewhere. Cameco would provide the technology and potentially hold an interest of up to 49%, at the company's discretion. \b \bThe MOU also provides for doubling future production from the Inkai uranium deposit, raising total annual production to 10.4 million pounds on a timeframe to be confirmed. \b \bThe Inkai project is located in Kazakhstan and is owned and operated by Joint Venture Inkai (JVI), which consists of Cameco (60%) and Kazatomprom (40%). JVI has regulatory approval to construct a full-scale in situ recovery mine and mill that is expected to achieve commercial production in 2008, ramping up to 5.2 million pounds of annual production in 2010 (Cameco's share is 3.1 million pounds). While the existing project ownership would not change, Cameco's interest in additional capacity under the MOU would be 50% with the remainder held by Kazatomprom. Cameco's share of 10.4 million pounds of annual production would be 5.7 million pounds. \b \bKazatomprom, one of the world's largest uranium producers, has significant uranium resources with ambitious plans to grow its uranium production capacity in Kazakhstan. This will contribute to increased future demand for conversion capacity in Central Asia. \b \bCameco anticipates that binding agreements will be signed in 2007 and that various government approvals will be required as the agreements are implemented. The company plans to provide more detailed information at that time. \b \b\"Cameco's vision is to be a dominant nuclear energy company and we continue to look for other opportunities for uranium value-added processing in Canada and around the world as the nuclear renaissance unfolds,\" Grandey said. \"Development decisions involve many long-term factors including favourable market conditions and are dependent on supportive jurisdictions like Saskatchewan.\" \b \bCameco, with its head office in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, is the world's largest uranium producer. The company's uranium products are used to generate electricity in nuclear energy plants around the world, providing one of the cleanest sources of energy available today. Cameco's shares trade on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges. \b \bStatements contained in this news release, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences, without limiting the generality of the following, include: the impact of the sales volume of fuel fabrication services, uranium, conversion services, electricity generated and gold; volatility and sensitivity to market prices for uranium, conversion services, electricity in Ontario and gold; competition; the impact of change in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; imprecision in decommissioning, reclamation, reserve and tax estimates; environmental and safety risks including increased regulatory burdens and long-term waste disposal; unexpected geological or hydrological conditions; adverse mining conditions; political risks arising from operating in certain developing countries; terrorism; sabotage; a possible deterioration in political support for nuclear energy; changes in government regulations and policies, including tax and trade laws and policies; demand for nuclear power; replacement of production; failure to obtain or maintain necessary permits and approvals from government authorities; legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation, regulation or restructuring of the electric utility industry in Ontario; Ontario electricity rate regulations; natural phenomena including inclement weather conditions, fire, flood, underground floods, earthquakes, pit wall failure and cave-ins; ability to maintain and further improve positive labour relations; strikes or lockouts; operating performance, disruption in the operation of, and life of the company's and customers' facilities; decrease in electrical production due to planned outages extending beyond their scheduled periods or unplanned outages; success of planned development projects; and other development and operating risks. \b \bAlthough Cameco believes that the assumptions inherent in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on these statements, which only apply as of the date of this report.

(0142.HK) said Monday it will pursue growth through acquisitions and support the reelection of its chief executive, after one of the company's major shareholders called for a review of its growth strategy. \u001d  London-based fund Marathon Asset Management LLP, which owns about 6% of First Pacific, issued a statement to the conglomerate's shareholders urging them to vote against the reelection of Chief Executive Manuel Pangilinan during the annual general meeting on June 1. \u001d  Marathon Asset Management is the second-largest institutional shareholder in the Hong Kong-listed, Asia-focused conglomerate, after Brandes Investment Partners LP, according to data from the Hong Kong stock exchange. First Pacific, controlled by Indonesia's Salim family, has substantial holdings in the Philippines and Indonesia. \u001d  Marathon Asset Management said Pangilinan is determined to pursue an \"acquisition-oriented growth strategy,\" when the company should instead be using its cash to buy back shares. \u001d  \"We have become convinced that (Pangilinan) is not the right person to take the firm through the next several years due to his determination to pursue an acquisition-oriented growth strategy as a means of boosting firm value,\" Jeremy Hosking, founder of Marathon Asset Management, said in the statement dated May 16. \u001d  \"Acquisition growth only benefits value to the extent that we buy cheaply, now an unlikely outcome six years after the end of the Asian crisis.\" \u001d  In a statement, First Pacific said it disagreed with Hosking's proposals, adding it has \"full confidence\" in Pangilinan. \u001d   The company said a dual strategy - driving organic efficiencies and execution of strategic acquisitions - is the most effective way of delivering sustainable shareholder value. \u001d  First Pacific said it is convinced that new opportunities for profitable investment will be found in Asia. The company said Asian countries such as the Philippines are expanding and performing at unprecedented rates, and  demand for goods and services is emerging. \u001d  The company said it has no current plans to sell additional shares to raise capital, but it is essential to have a mandate to do so. \u001d  The comment was in response to Marathon Asset Management urging shareholders to vote against the resolution, as an option to issue more shares would enable fund-raising for acquisitions. \u001d  First Pacific recently completed the purchase of 83.97% of the Philippines' Maynilad Water Services Inc., which supplies water to the western part of Manila. It also raised its holding in  Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PHI) by acquiring an indirect 6.4% stake. \u001d  First Pacific added a share buyback in the current business environment isn't the most effective way to create long-term value. It said the company doesn't have a significant cash surplus for a buyback, adding it had to finance the purchase of the indirect stake in PLDT with long- and short-term borrowings totaling US$420 million. \b \u001d  -By Joyce Li, Dow Jones Newswires; 852-2802-7002; joyce.li@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 02:59 ET (06:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f83ea281d326686ff6b240b0bf3eb028","symR":["RER.T","CA7559022024"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Real Resources Tgt Raised To C$16 From C$12.50: GMP >RER.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T12:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RER.T","CA7559022024"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 08:40 ET (12:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f842f9928b956f6158ffcbf22ff6f947","symR":["6501.TO","HIT","JP3788600009"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Japan's Hitachi:Keep FY09 Sales-Oper Pft Ratio Target Of 5%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T06:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6501.TO","HIT","JP3788600009"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 02:12 ET (06:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f8b02739d2a83863179d64b1a9c4b48a","symR":["PDN.AU","PDN.T","AU000000PDN8"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Paladin Resources Ltd.: Kayelekera Project, Malawi>PDN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T12:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PDN.AU","PDN.T","AU000000PDN8"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF","XDJGI","XISL","XORD"],"Story":"\u001d  PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 05/28/07 -- \u001d   Paladin Resources Ltd.

(TOL.AU) shareholders Monday agreed to spin off the rail and ports assets of Australia's largest transport company into a separate company - Asciano Ltd. \u001d  Under the plan, the company's investors will keep their existing shares and receive a stapled security made up of one new share and one new unit in Asciano for each share they own in Toll. \u001d  Toll Chief Executive Paul Little said the arrangement would give the Melbourne-based company access to key infrastructure without the need to own it, thereby satisfying competition regulations, and allowing it to raise as much as an additional A$1 billion in debt for acquisitions. \u001d  \"This gives us a lot of capacity on our balance sheet,\" Little told reporters after the meeting. \u001d  \"This restructure will allow both the Asciano business and our business to grow more aggressively,\" he said. \u001d  Shares in Toll Monday closed down 1.5% at A$22.03, compared with the broader market ending little changed. \u001d  Toll investors passed the spinoff plan, with 368.2 million shares in favor and 376,996 against. \u001d  If court approval is gained, Asciano shares will start trading on June 6. \u001d  Toll acquired the ports business, a 62% stake in Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd. (VBA.AU), Australia's second-largest airline, and full control of the Pacific National rail business, in which Toll previously had a half stake, from its A$6 billion acquisition of Patrick Corp. last year. \u001d  Toll had to spin off Asciano because the need to invest capital in the rail and ports assets restricted the company's acquisition plans and raised antitrust concerns, Little said. \u001d  \"Toll previously had achieved a 20% pretax return on capital,\" he said. \u001d  \"To be going down to a sub-10% return was something we felt our shareholders weren't overly excited about, and we needed to address that problem and this was the best outcome,\" Little said. \b \u001d  Leadership Position Maintained \b \u001d  He told the meeting that after the spinoff Toll would remain one of Asia's leading providers of integrated logistics services. \u001d  \"With Asian logistics markets expected to grow at rates of up to 25% per year, expansion of Toll Asia is a key platform for the development of the Toll business,\" Little said. \u001d  Toll still had an appetite for acquisitions, he told reporters after the meeting. \u001d  \"There are a number of smaller acquisitions that we believe we can move forward with very quickly and I think the larger ones are certainly available too,\" Little said. \u001d  The company was seeking acquisitions in Australia, New Zealand and Asia, and later this week will announce an equity stake in Hong Kong-based Cargo Services Far East Ltd., Little said. \u001d  The acquisition of the stake in the privately held freight forwarding company will help Toll expand its logistics business in and out of China, he said. \u001d  He declined to say how large the equity stake in Cargo Services was. \u001d  Toll will also announce in a few weeks a joint venture with Virgin Blue, in which the company will have exclusive use of \"belly space\" in Virgin's aircraft to help Toll expand its international logistics business, Little said. \u001d  \"And over and above that, Toll has recently commissioned three of its own purpose-designed 737 air freighters and we are now running them around Australia,\" he said. \u001d  \"The specialized Toll freighters plus the Virgin Blue 'belly space' collectively will give us a wonderful platform for our air freight business,\" Little said. \u001d  Asciano is seeking to acquire bulk rail assets in Queensland and Western Australia states and to participate in ports expansion, Chief Executive Mark Rowsthorn told reporters after the meeting. \u001d  The company wants to gain customers in Queensland to carry coal and agricultural commodities in Western Australia, he said. \u001d  Rowsthorn is comfortable with Asciano's A$6 billion net debt, which is \"comparable with our peers in infrastructure and arguably we could push the gearing harder if we chose to do that.\" \u001d  The company had a gearing of about 60%, which will rise to 67% in the company's first three years as it invests in expanding its Brisbane ports assets and its national rail network, he said. \u001d  Asciano also has joined a consortium that is bidding to build and operate a 2,600-kilometer railroad in Saudi Arabia to carry freight, he said. \b \u001d  -By Andrew Harrison, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9671-4323; andrew.harrison@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Marissa Chew \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 04:24 ET (08:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fb47742a44023d51f472aefaa98ee85a","symR":["CADAY"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Toronto Stks Higher At Midday, Led By Base Metals -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T15:53:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CADAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  New York markets were closed, which made for thin trading in Canada. \u001d  Overall, nine of Toronto's 10 sector indexes were higher. \u001d  The strongest sector was materials, which was up 0.97%.

The aggregate weighted average stabilized capitalization rate on the Shopping Centres analyzed by the appraisal firm was 6.58% at March 31, 2007. \b \bOf the total fair value of Shopping Centres at December 31, 2006, approximately 91% was determined through independent appraisals conducted by the appraisal firm. The Shopping Centres were appraised on an individual basis, with no portfolio effect considered. The remainder of the values of the Shopping Centres, which consisted primarily of recently completed development projects and acquisitions, were based upon the costs of these Shopping Centres to First Capital Realty. The independent appraisals were prepared so as to comply with the fair value model described in the IAS 40 - Investment Property and the International Valuation Standard. \b \bThe primary method of appraisal was an income approach, since purchasers typically focus on expected income. For each property, the appraisers conducted and placed reliance upon a) a direct capitalization method, which is the appraisers' estimate of the relationship between value and stabilized income, normally in the first year and b) a discounted cash flow method, which is the appraisers' estimate of the present value of future cash flows over a specified horizon, including the potential proceeds from a deemed disposition. The determination of these values required management and the appraisers to make estimates and assumptions that affect the values presented, and actual values in a sales transaction may differ from the values shown above. Based on these valuation methods, the aggregate weighted average stabilized capitalization rate on the Shopping Centres as at December 31, 2006 was 6.81%. \b \bABOUT FIRST CAPITAL REALTY (TSX:FCR) \b \bFirst Capital Realty is Canada's leading owner, developer and operator of supermarket-anchored neighbourhood and community shopping centres, located predominantly in growing metropolitan areas.

With the addition of this new destination, GOL's daily flights from Fortaleza (CE) will reach the furthest regions of Brazil through connecting flights in Belem (PA), Manaus (AM), Porto Velho (RO) and Rio Branco (AC). \b \u001d  Cruzeiro do Sul is the second-largest city in Acre and is the main city of the Alto Jurua region. The city is only accessible by road during the June- August summer months via the unpaved BR-364 highway, and boats are the most common mode of transportation for people and goods. GOL's flights will contribute to the development of the region by offering travelers a safe, alternative form of transportation at affordable fares. \b \u001d  Acre's main agricultural exports are cassavas, corn, chestnuts and beans. The state also produces rubber and has strong lumber and furniture industries. Cruzeiro do Sul is GOL's second destination in Acre; the Company began regular flights to the capital, Rio Branco, in August 2004. The city's airport, Cruzeiro do Sul International Airport, is located 14 kilometers from the city's center and is a base for commercial jets as well as medium and large cargo aircraft. \b \u001d  \"The launch of this new destination is a response to customer demand and will allow greater access to tourism and commercial activities in the Amazon region and neighboring countries, particularly with Peru,\" says Tarcisio Gargioni, Vice President of Marketing and Services at GOL. Cruzeiro do Sul is only 250 kilometers from Pucalpa, Peru by plane. \b \u001d  Tickets to Cruzeiro do Sul are available for purchase through GOL's website (http://www.voegol.com.br).

(URS) agreed to buy rival engineering company Washington Group International Inc. (WNG) for about $2.6 billion in cash and stock, in a deal that highlights a construction boom driven by energy-efficiency and government projects. \u001d  The deal, valued at $80 for each Washington Group share, represents a 14% premium to that company's share price of $69.97 at 4 p.m. EDT on Friday, the last trading day before the Memorial Day holiday. \u001d  The acquisition comes as power companies invest aggressively in emissions reduction and energy conservation, while federal agencies such as the U.S. Departments of Defense and Energy increasingly outsource engineering and construction projects to the private sector. It continues a streak of acquisitions for San Francisco-based URS. After helping the company rebound from near-bankruptcy 18 years ago, Chief Executive Martin Koffel has turned it through acquisitions into one of the world's largest engineering-services companies. Most recently, the company bought EG&G Technical Services Holdings LLC from buyout partnership Carlyle Group in 2002 for $335 million. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  URS's latest target, Washington Group, is an engineering and construction company in Boise, Idaho, focused on customers in government, mining and power - industries that URS is keen to reach, as they increasingly invest in infrastructure and energy-efficiency projects. The acquisition also fills in URS's need for construction capabilities, an area where it previously hadn't focused. \u001d  \"This allows us to be one of the fully integrated engineering and construction firms,\" Koffel said in an interview. \u001d  The deal will create the fourth-largest publicly traded engineering-and-construction company in the U.S., based on 2006 revenue, the companies said. The companies' combined 2006 revenue would have been $7.6 billion. Based on previously issued guidance, the companies expect to have combined 2007 revenue of approximately $8.6 billion. The combined company would have projects in over 50 countries and have more than 54,000 employees. \u001d  URS said it expects the increased size to better position the combined companies in high-growth markets such as power, infrastructure and environmental management. Other industry heavyweights include Fluor Corp. (FLR), Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC) and KBR Inc. (KBR). The combined company also will have one of the largest teams of nuclear scientists and engineers in the industry. It hopes to meet growing demand for a range of engineering and construction services on large, complex transportation and water and wastewater projects, as well be a major contractor for the U.S. government. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 17:20 ET (21:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ffb0706af2fc62111963d3259118654b","symR":["SAS.SK","SE0000805574"],"date":"2007-05-28","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"SAS Sweden Cancels Flights For Tuesday May 29","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-28T11:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SAS.SK","SE0000805574"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 28, 2007 07:16 ET (11:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."}]
