Preliminary results for the quarter include approximately $569 million home closing revenue, $502 million home orders, and $1.2 billion ending backlog. These results represent declines of 37%, 28% and 39% from the second quarter of 2006, consistent with the trends for April and May previously announced on June 6, 2007. \u001d  Cancellations rose to approximately 37% of gross orders for the quarter, compared to 32% in the second quarter 2006 and 27% in the first quarter 2007. \"As reported by other homebuilders, the housing market in general continues to be very challenging,\" said Steven J. Hilton, chairman and CEO of Meritage Homes. \"Weak demand and high inventory levels have increased competition among homebuilders, pressuring margins despite reductions in new home starts, lot supplies and operating costs. We continue to adjust our operations to compete effectively, maintain a strong balance sheet and better position ourselves for the future.\" \u001d  Due to continued deterioration in the housing market during the second quarter of 2007, the Company expects to incur additional pre-tax charges in the $75 to $80 million range related to inventory impairments and the write-off of land options. These charges are based on the Company's regular quarterly review of all projects. \u001d  In addition, the Company's operations in Ft. Myers/Naples, Florida continue to be significantly challenged and management expects the homebuilding market in southwest Florida will continue to be severely depressed for the foreseeable future. As a result, the Company believes the goodwill and other intangible assets relating to a February 2005 acquisition in Ft. Myers/Naples are impaired, and anticipates recording non-cash, pre-tax charges in the second quarter of 2007 of approximately $28 million relating to these assets. \u001d  \"Southwest Florida has been experiencing some of the most difficult housing market conditions in the country. While our 2006 home closings there represented only approximately 2% of our Company-wide closings, our year-to-date 2007 home closings in Ft. Myers/Naples are down more than 70% from the level a year ago,\" said Mr. Hilton. \"We have been unable to renegotiate acceptable terms for existing lot options, which led us to terminate all of our existing option contracts, and we have been unable to acquire new lots at prices that reflect today's market values. Both factors significantly limit this division's available lot inventory.\" \u001d  Meritage plans to release second quarter 2007 earnings on Thursday, July 26, 2007 after market close. A conference call has been scheduled to review and discuss these results on July 27, 2007, at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.)

(0716.HK), the world's second-largest shipping container maker by revenue, plans to significantly boost its specialized container business over the next few years to benefit from strong profit margins and consistent demand. \u001d  The Hong Kong-listed company, which has a 22% share of the global container market, is in talks with several European manufacturers of specialized containers with hopes of setting up joint venture facilities in China, Chief Executive Teo Siong Seng said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  Singamas said the shift in strategy could help it better manage the cyclical volatility of the container shipping industry, which is dominated by standard containers. Specialized units can be refrigerated or outfitted for purposes such as transporting chemicals and glass. \u001d  Illustrating the volatility of the standard container market, Singamas sold about 400,000 standard containers in the first half, about double the amount it sold in the same period in 2006. Last year, production delays and a steep market downturn knocked down net profit by 60% to US$18 million, from US$44.9 million the previous year. \u001d  Teo said demand for specialized containers is less prone to the impact of the cyclical shipping market. A greater reliance on those containers would likely help the company keep a more consistent stream of orders. \u001d  Teo said that in four to five years, Singamas hopes to get 30% of its revenue from specialized containers, compared with 10% now. Deals with foreign companies are key to the plan. \u001d  \"Many European container manufacturers have approached us about shifting their production to China as costs rise and competition increases,\" Teo said. \u001d  \"We can help them produce containers and also to promote their brands in the expanding Chinese market, which has been dominating the world in terms of container demand,\" he said. \u001d  Based in Hong Kong, the company has production facilities in eight Chinese cities, as well as one in Indonesia. \u001d  For a start to the new business focus, Singamas signed a licensing and sales agency agreement with Dutch producer Flax Field Trading B.V. to produce the company's first tank containers in Guangdong province. \u001d  Production began in January with an initial annual capacity of 9,000 containers. Singamas expects the factory to break even by the end of next year. \u001d  \"Our partnership talks now mainly involve original equipment manufacturing business, but we hope to move toward joint venture cooperation in the next few years,\" said Teo. \u001d  He declined to name any of the parties Singamas is in talks with, however. \u001d  Last week, Singamas' larger rival China International Marine Containers Group Co. (000039.SZ), which controls 51% of the container market, got approval to buy an 80% stake in Dutch tank container maker Burg Industries B.V. for EUR108 million. \u001d  CIMC and Burg are the world's two biggest makers of tank containers. \u001d  Teo said Singamas has no plans to make similar acquisitions. \u001d  He said the sale of specialized containers command sharply higher profit margins than conventional, dry freight containers. \u001d  Conventional containers have gross margins of about 6% to 8% each for Singamas, but Teo wouldn't say how much the margin is on specialized containers. \u001d  But some of them can sell for up to US$30,000 each, while one standard 20-foot container box - measured in 20-foot equivalent units or TEUs - currently sells for around US$1,800 to US$1,900. \u001d  Despite the recent market volatility for standard containers, demand has rebounded at a rapid pace, and the business will remain as Singamas' largest revenue contributor, said Teo. He said he expects annual global demand for containers to total 3 million TEUs until 2010, up from about 2.5 million TEUs ordered last year. \u001d  \"Much of the world's demand for containers is driven by China, so the continued rise in the country's exports will also mean buoyant demand for us,\" Teo said. \u001d  Deliveries of new container ships on order will also drive demand for container boxes, said Teo. \u001d  New container ship deliveries will peak between 2007 and 2009, with about 1.5 million TEUs of new capacity expected to be added each year, according to Singamas. The world's container ships had total capacity of about 8.5 million TEUs at the end of last year. \u001d  Singamas expects to sell over 700,000 TEUs this year from 583,543 TEUs last year. \u001d  The strong orders \"show that our net profit will definitely be better this year versus 2006,\" said Teo, without elaborating. \b \u001d  -By Jeffrey Ng, Dow Jones Newswires; 852-2802-7002; jeffrey.ng@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 04:26 ET (08:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"02c066cd3df1781808395747d458c34f","symR":["ACL"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Alcon (ACL) Block: 100,000 Shrs At 136.77","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T17:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACL"],"IndustryCodes":["MDS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\bALCON INC. \bLast trade  NMS: +1.15 at 136.77 on 0.10 downtick \bTrade vol:       100,000 =   30.9% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:     100,000 =   30.9% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:      37,146 =    7.5% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:         323,200 =   65.4% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:   494,567 / Prev day +0.39 on 603,200 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:20 ET (17:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"02cf185388403015e3db2d336f4def59","symR":["BANF"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.006633],"ret5":[0.9677493],"Headline":"BancFirst Sees 26c/Shr Gain In 3Q From Investment Sale >BANF","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BANF"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  BancFirst Corp.

Shefferly of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Detroit approved the sale, which is predicted to leave unsecured creditors with a lump sum of $162,000. \u001d  American Camshaft must first use proceeds from the sale to repay its obligations to North Fork Bank and satisfy a $1.1 million bill from the town of Grand Haven, Mich., for back property taxes. \u001d  Under bankruptcy law, unsecured creditors get paid only after secured lenders are repaid and administrative expenses fulfilled. \u001d  According to the sale terms, Hilco also won rent-free access to its premises for the next six months while the buyer attempts to sell off American Camshaft's old manufacturing equipment. The six-month period includes payment of utilities, trash removal and Internet access - charges that creditors complained will eat away at their recovery. \u001d  \"Thus, the debtors are proposing to sell all the estate's remaining hard assets for only approximately 50% of the appraised orderly liquidation value, then continue to pay rent and utilities for six months so Hilco can re-sell the same equipment at a premium, reaping significant profits,\" creditors said in a court filing last month. \u001d  Creditors speculated that American Camshaft was being cornered into the sale by pre-bankruptcy lender North Fork Business Capital Corp. \u001d  \"North Fork has no interest at all in maximizing the value of the assets, but is interested only in assuming that a sale occur quickly and for sufficient funds to satisfy its debt,\" the creditors said. \u001d  American Camshaft, a unit of China's Asimco Technologies Ltd., proposed the sale to creditors only two weeks ago, and had urged Shefferly to make a quick decision before its July liquidation deadline - a requirement set in the asset purchase agreement. \u001d  The Peoria, Ill., manufacturer was forced to sell off its assets after it failed to garner offers for the business as a going concern. \u001d  Since filing for Chapter 11 six months ago, the company has been steadily selling off assets. It recently closed a $1.1 million equipment sale to Cummins Inc. (CMI) in late June. \u001d  American Camshaft made camshafts for original-equipment manufacturers and other \"tier one\" suppliers in the heavy-truck market. The unit was created after auto-parts maker Asimco bought Federal-Mogul Corp.'s (FDMLQ) powertrain business out of bankruptcy in 2003. Its customers included Cummins, Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and General Motors Corp. (GM). \u001d  The company filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 9, blaming a decline in automobile sales and high energy and material costs. \b \u001d  -Erika Lovley, Dow Jones Newswires; 202 862-6615; erika.lovley@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:34 ET (18:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0388d93c642c351daf39c846d05e47a0","symR":["TMMI"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1],"ret5":[1],"Headline":": Michael Fernandez (TMMI.PK) announced today that the Nevada Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against Custodian Corene Dion-King","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TMMI"],"IndustryCodes":["CSV"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BEVERLY HILLS, CA, July 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - Michael Fernandez (TMMI.PK) stated that on Monday July 2, 2007 a TRO was issued by the District Court in Minden, Nevada.

(BBVA S.A., Aa1, Prime-1). This Series represents its first CT issued in USD. \u001d  Moody's (P)Aaa rating is based on the following key characteristics of BBVA's issuance of covered bonds: (i) the current rating of the Sponsor Bank (senior unsecured rating of Aa1), (ii) Moody's view of the high credit quality of the cover pool which is comprised of public-sector loans in Spain, (iii) the current assets and projected liabilities composition and (iv) the sizeable 43% nominal over-collateralisation required by the Spanish Financial Law. \u001d  Although Moody's considers the Covered Bonds to be linked to the rating of the Sponsor Bank, there may be a certain cushion for the Sponsor Bank downgrade without affecting the Aaa assigned to the Covered Bonds. \u001d  The provisional rating addresses the expected loss posed to investors by the Cover Bond at the legal final maturity. Other non-credit risks have not been addressed, but may have a significant effect on yield to investors. \u001d  Moody's issues provisional ratings in advance of the final sale of securities, and these ratings only represent Moody's preliminary opinion. Upon a conclusive review of the transaction and associated documentation, Moody's will endeavour to assign a definitive rating to the bonds. \u001d  To obtain a copy of Moody's pre-sale report for this transaction, please contact the client service desk in London on 44(0) 207772 5454 or visit our web page on www.moodys.com.

These mortgages were extended to people with a poor credit history or a weak capacity to service their debts, or both. \u001d  The proportion of subprime borrowers who are behind in their payments, known as the delinquency rate, has risen sharply since early 2006. \u001d  The most likely proximate cause of the rise in delinquencies is the steady rise in the federal-funds rate between 2004 and 2006. That increased the cost of servicing these mortgages, which were initially fixed at very low rates and are now being refinanced at much higher rates. \u001d  Unsurprisingly, repossessions have also risen sharply, from about 1.4% of the stock of mortgages at the end of last year to 2.5% today. \b \bLingering Subprime Problems \b \u001d  Unlike in March, when these stresses seemed confined to the subprime lenders themselves, the strains are now showing up in some of the complicated derivative instruments based upon these loans. \u001d  The recent, widely-publicised problems at two Bear Stearns hedge funds could be isolated incidents. However, they just as likely to be representative of problems elsewhere, but which remain hidden from our view. \u001d  The financial markets have reacted to these developments by pricing in greater levels of uncertainty. \u001d  At the end of June, the implied volatility derived from options on the S&P 500 had risen to 15% from around 10% just a few weeks earlier. This can be interpreted to mean that the markets are now expecting equity markets to be around 50% more volatile than they had previously expected. \u001d  At the beginning of June, the spread demanded by investors on high-yield corporate bonds over U.S. Treasuries was around 2.5%. That compensation for risk has risen to around 3.2% today. \u001d  That also suggests investors have become more risk averse over the last few weeks. \u001d  Everywhere one looks today, financial markets appear to be wary about the likely fallout from these mortgage markets and from the complicated derivatives to which they have given life. \u001d  On the plus side, the U.S. economy is in a fairly robust state. Employment is probably set to rise healthily over the near term and corporate profit growth is still strong. \u001d  But a credit crunch, by which we mean a widespread and indiscriminate increase in lending standards, doesn't necessarily have its roots in a downturn in the underlying economy. \u001d  It seems equally likely that a credit crunch might be brought about by one or two high-profile corporate failures, or simply a reassessment of bank lending practices. \u001d  With respect to the latter, this seems all the more probable given the increasing complexity of lending practices and debt vehicles. \u001d  We have already seen some planned bond issues shelved as investors have suddenly started to ask harder questions about what they are lending to and how much risk they are really taking. \u001d  If the U.S. subprime mortgage market is the catalyst for a widespread credit crunch, then global economic growth will almost certainly slow, and financial markets will be forced to price in this gloomier outlook with all the usual, associated consequences. \u001d  So while Americans continue to insist on celebrating independence from the British, the rest of us can not similarly celebrate independence from America's capital markets \b \u001d  By Danny Gabay, 44-207-796-9561; danny.gabay@fathom-consulting.com \u001d  (Danny Gabay is director of Fathom Financial Consulting and was previously chief UK economist for JP Morgan Chase.) \u001d  Opinions expressed are those of the author, and not of Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  This column is published for information only, and it neither constitutes, nor is to be construed as, an offer to buy or sell investments.

Stoll \b    OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--Auto supplier Dana Corp. (DCNAQ) has reached a settlement with two of its biggest unions and received a planned investment commitment for up to $750 million led by private-equity firm Centerbridge Capital Partners L.P., the company said Friday. \u001d  A critical component of the labor agreement involves setting up union-managed voluntary employees' beneficiary associations, or VEBAs, to handle retiree health and long-term disability benefits for workers. Dana would cease providing those benefits and fund the VEBAs, which are separate trusts, with a payment of about $700 million in cash and $80 million in stock of the reorganized company.    Centerbridge's plan to invest $500 million into Dana underscores the interest deep-pocketed funds have in the auto sector and allows Dana to fund the VEBA and meet its obligations in the new labor agreements. Other investors could bring another $250 million in capital. \u001d  The moves, if approved, would be key pieces in forming Dana's exit from Chapter 11, which could happen by year end. Dana first revealed the agreements in court papers early Friday morning. Both the labor and investment deals are subject to approval from the bankruptcy court. \u001d  Dana is one of a number of auto-parts companies that have tumbled into bankruptcy proceedings amid production cutbacks by U.S. vehicle manufacturers. Dana began its Chapter 11 reorganization in March 2006. \u001d  The deals with the United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers, which are subject to ratification votes, lessen the possibility of a strike that could disrupt production. Dana said in court documents that the union agreements will save it more than $100 million a year. \u001d  Toledo, Ohio-based Dana sought to cut wages and benefits and filed a motion with the court to cancel its labor contracts, a move the UAW and United Steelworkers unions said would lead to a strike if granted. \u001d  The unions collectively represent about 8,000 Dana workers - more than half of the company's hourly U.S. work force. \u001d  But the sides negotiated, with Centerbridge an active party. In fact, UAW President Ron Gettelfinger, in a statement, said the settlement \"would not have been possible without the involvement of Centerbridge.\" \u001d  The VEBA would allow Dana to remove a liability of about $1 billion from its balance sheet, according to the court papers. \u001d  Dana also plans a two-tier wage system in all union plants. \u001d  In return for concessions, Dana is offering buyouts, clauses that maintain buyers of plants it sells take on union contracts, and is offering job opportunities at union plants. \u001d  Dana also agreed to reserve new shares of a reorganized company for a bonus to be paid to \"certain union employees\" after emerging from Chapter 11. \u001d  \"Through our negotiations with the USW and the UAW, and negotiations with Centerbridge for the investment that will contribute to our ability to fund the VEBAs, we have reached what we believe are fair and constructive agreements,\" Dana Chief Executive Mike Burns said in a statement. \b \b   VEBA Could Be Trend \b \u001d  Dana's proposal for a VEBA for non-pension retiree benefit obligations follows a similar move made by Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) in 2006. Goodyear's deal was struck with the USW. \u001d  Dana's VEBA is significant because of the inclusion of the UAW, which begins contract negotiations with the Big Three Detroit auto makers. General Motors Corp., (GM) Ford Motor Co. (F) and DaimlerChrysler AG's (DCX) Chrysler Group are set to lobby to form much larger VEBAs that would be managed by the UAW, according to people at each of the auto makers. \u001d  While the VEBA monetizes Dana's health-care obligations and protects medical benefits for retirees, the move is considered risky for the union because it takes on management of the obligation. \u001d  The UAW is seen as far more averse to risk than some other unions, including the USW. The UAW, however, had years ago forged a similar VEBA deal for truck maker Navistar International Corp. (NAVZ) and now the ground could be more fertile for the U.S. auto makers in their quest to create a VEBA for more than $100 billion in UAW retiree health-care obligations. \u001d  But Dana's deal is unique because it was won under protection of U.S. bankruptcy court, where unions often have their backs against the wall because of the potential for labor contracts being thrown out. The UAW has considerable clout with the Big Three and a VEBA arrangement is anything but a done deal. \b \b   Centerbridge Played Key Role \b \u001d  Centerbridge has been working with Dana's unions, and in bankruptcy reorganizations, private-equity firms sometimes align themselves with labor unions in a bid for control of a company. \u001d  Centerbridge has committed to purchase $500 million in convertible preferred stock in a reorganized Dana and \"facilitate\" investment of up to $250 million.. \u001d  The emergence of Centerbridge as Dana's financial backer represents the latest salvo by deep-pocketed investors to control distressed auto companies. \u001d  Some firms have been combing the industry in hopes of taking advantage to massive revenue streams and the ability to shake out costs from North American operations via bankruptcy or other means. \u001d  Centerbridge's partnership with Dana, if successful, represents a victory for the New York firm after it had shown interest in other companies recently sold, including GM's Allison Transmission and Daimler's Chrysler unit. \u001d  Dana can terminate the agreement with Centerbridge if it receives a superior proposal. Centerbridge would be entitled to a breakup fee of up to $22.5 million and an expense reimbursement of $4 million, according to the motion. \u001d  Under the investment proposal, Centerbridge initially would nominate two members of a seven-member board and choose an independent director. Two would be chosen by the creditors' committee, both of whom would be independent. Another director would be chosen by the creditors' committee from a list prepared by Centerbridge and containing at least three independent candidates. The other member would be the CEO. \u001d  To get the Centerbridge investment, Dana must file a reorganization plan and disclosure statement by Sept. 3 and get confirmation of the plan by Feb. 28, 2008. The investment also is subject to approval of the new union deals. \u001d  -By Terry Kosdrosky of Dow Jones Newswires; 313-226-1251; terry.kosdrosky@dowjones.com \u001d  -John D.

The technology demonstrations are designed to highlight the benefits of home base stations and feature Alcatel-Lucent's Femto Base Station Router (BSR), an innovative solution that packs W-CDMA/HSPA radio access and core network elements into one compact, easy-to-deploy unit. \b \u001d  These demonstrations are a key element in efforts to deliver high-speed mobile voice and data services to Softbank's customers in their homes and business locations. \b \u001d  The range of demonstrations Alcatel-Lucent is conducting with Softbank include the completion of circuit-switched voice calls and the delivery of high-speed data services using Softbank handsets, and High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) technology using laptops equipped with HSDPA PC cards. \b \u001d  \"These successful demonstrations represent a big step forward for Alcatel-Lucent in establishing itself as a leader in the delivery of in-building wireless solutions,\" said Frederic Rose, President of Alcatel-Lucent's activities in Asia-Pacific. \"Alcatel-Lucent's Femto BSR offers an ideal way for service providers - such as Softbank Mobile - to deliver broadband wireless services in a home or small office more efficiently than a traditional cellular network could.\" \b \u001d  Based on Alcatel-Lucent's revolutionary \"flat IP (Internet Protocol)\" architecture, the Femto BSR integrates the W-CDMA Node B and packet core network elements, including the radio network controller, into a single, compact box. This technique reduces the number of network elements (and related \"layers\") that network traffic has to travel through, eliminating bottlenecks in the network and thereby increasing data throughput and lowering latency. Additionally, this approach enables operators to deploy and optimize smaller, stand-alone base stations that register themselves on the network, making them easier for the service provider to manage, even in large numbers. \b \u001d  In addition to the savings in cost and space, the Femto BSR offers exceptional flexibility, enabling operators to support a variety of deployment scenarios; the Femto BSR can be offered with integrated radio network controller (RNC) functionality, router functionality or both, depending on the needs of the operator and the network architecture they have in place. \b \u001d  As a global leader in the development and deployment of third-generation (3G) networks, Alcatel-Lucent has deployed commercial 3G (W-CDMA/HSPA and CDMA/EV-DO) systems for more than 70 operators worldwide. \b \b    About Softbank \b \u001d  Softbank Group is the holding company for several businesses linked to Internet culture, technology services and e-commerce. Three companies are at the core of the operation: Softbank BB for broadband infrastructure, Softbank Telecom for fixed communication and Softbank Mobile for mobile telecommunication business. \b \b    About Alcatel-Lucent \b \u001d  Alcatel-Lucent (Euronext Paris and NYSE: ALU) provides solutions that enable service providers, enterprises and governments worldwide, to deliver voice, data and video communication services to end-users.

The bond was expected to price after the roadshows finished, subject to market conditions. \u001d  The person familiar with the situation told Dow Jones Newswires that the company would review the situation later in the year, depending on market conditions, but that the bond is now \"clearly not going to happen this side of this autumn.\" \u001d  -By Kate Haywood, Dow Jones Newswires, +44 (0) 20 7842 9315, kate.haywood@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 05:54 ET (09:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"068c151194cc9dfb4f568e220dae3b69","symR":["F"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9967069],"ret5":[0.9582876],"Headline":"Ford Motor (F) Block: 4,191,600 Shrs At 9.15","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["F"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bFORD MOTOR CO. \bLast trade  NMS: Unch at 9.15 on 0.02 downtick \bTrade vol:     4,191,600 =   42.5% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   7,451,000 =   75.6% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:  21,761,414 =   56.0% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:       9,856,200 =   25.4% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:38,825,820 / Prev day -0.27 on 61,977,272 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:56 ET (13:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0690ea8c814659a3f543c85369224cc2","symR":["SLB"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.000113],"ret5":[1.017435],"Headline":"Schlumberger (SLB) Mkt On Close Buy Imbalance: Shrs 206600","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLB"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:40 ET (19:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"069ae79db61903dfeacd840ae53c348b","symR":["WRE","WRE"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9870764,0.9870764],"ret5":[0.9600804,0.9600804],"Headline":"Washington REIT Enters $75M Revolving Credit Pact","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WRE"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:10 ET (14:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"069faa2bf57165ea927aab25995acb43","symR":["000338.SZ","2338.HK","MAN.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","CN000A0B9CD4","CN000A0MQ7K5","DE0005937007","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.008915,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Germany's MAN, China's Weichai In Talks Over JV In China -4-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["000338.SZ","2338.HK","MAN.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","CN000A0B9CD4","CN000A0MQ7K5","DE0005937007","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","FAC","TRQ","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d   Volkswagen's supervisory board chairman Ferdinand Piech told Dow Jones Newswires last year that VW might export its Brazilian heavy-trucks for example to Eastern Europe.

(BOT) rose $1.85 to $208.15 before the opening bell Friday following a report saying Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME) is boosting its bid for the parent of the Chicago Board of Trade for the third time. \u001d  Citing sources, The Wall Street Journal reported that under the new terms, the Merc would offer CBOT 36.2% of a combined company, up from 34.6% before, the Journal reported. \u001d  The Journal said the move is part of an effort to secure a winning vote Monday for the deal by CBOT shareholders. \u001d  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE), a rival derivatives market in Atlanta, made a bid in March for CBOT that has been consistently valued higher than the Merc's because of ICE's buoyant stock price. \u001d  Shares of CME had yet to trade, while IntercontinentalExchange shares were up 2.1% at $154.95. \b \b   Microsoft Slips On Charge For Xbox Repairs \b \u001d  Shares of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) were down 19 cents at $29.80 before the opening bell Friday, the day after the software giant said it would take a charge of up to $1.15 billion to cover a hardware failure in its Xbox 360 videogame console. \u001d  The company said it will take a $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion pretax charge and extend the Xbox 360 warranty for consumers after experiencing an \"unacceptable\" number of repairs to Xbox 360s already sold. Microsoft executives declined to discuss the technical problems in detail but said a number of factors can cause malfunctions leading to a failure of the Xbox 360 systems. The problems are indicated by three flashing red lights on the front of the console. \b \b   Newmont Up After Ditching Hedges, Merchant Banking \b \u001d  Shares of Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) rose 1.9% to $40.34, the day after the company said it's eliminating its entire 1.85 million-ounce gold hedge position and plans to discontinue its merchant banking segment. \u001d  The Denver-based gold producer said that during June, it spent $578 million to eliminate its entire price-capped forward sales contracts. The company will report a pretax loss of roughly $531 million on the early settlement of the contracts, after a $47 million reversal of previously recognized deferred revenue. \u001d  Newmont also said it's considering alternatives for its merchant-banking unit, including a possible sale or initial public offering. As a result of this decision, Newmont said it will take a non-cash impairment charge of roughly $1.7 billion in the second quarter. \b \b   aQuantive Up; Buyout By Microsoft Clears Hurdle \b \u001d  Shares of aQuantive Inc. (AQNT) rose 1.4% to $65.80 after the company said that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in connection with its proposed acquisition by Microsoft expired Thursday. \u001d  Expiration of the HSR waiting period is a condition to completion of the merger between AQuantive and Microsoft. \u001d  The company said in a document filed with the SEC that the merger remains subject to a number of closing conditions, including approval by its shareholders at a special meeting scheduled for Aug. 9. \u001d  On May 18, Microsoft said it would acquire the Seattle digital marketing company for $66.50 a share in a cash transaction valued at around $6 billion. \b \b   Rio Tinto Falls On Report It's Eyeing Alcan, Alcoa \b \u001d  American Depositary Shares of Rio Tinto PLC (RTP) fell 1.7% to $319.21 following a report saying the world's second-largest mining company plans to gatecrash a $28 billion hostile bid battle between the aluminum giants Alcan Inc. (AL) of the U.S. and Canada's Alcoa Inc. (AA) \u001d  London's Daily Telegraph cited people close to the process as saying Rio Tinto, listed in London and Sydney, has engaged Credit Suisse Group (CS) and Deutsche Bank A.G. (DB) to advise it on a range of options, including a bid for Alcan. Another possibility is a bid for Alcoa, although this is thought less likely, the report says. \u001d  Shares of Alcoa were up 25 cents at $41.60 in pre-open electronic trade, while Alcan shares were up 35 cents at $85.45. \b \b   Futures Up Ahead Of Jobs Data \b \u001d  U.S. stock futures edged higher Friday ahead of data that could show that the Federal Reserve forecasts of a modestly improving economy and reasonably contained inflation are on target. \u001d  S&P 500 futures rose 1.60 points to 1536.20, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 15 points to 13665 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.2 points to 1,999.2. \u001d  The market's attention turns to the nonfarms payroll report, due out 8:30 a.m. EDT. Nonfarm payrolls probably rose by about 130,000 in June, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by MarketWatch. The unemployment rate probably stayed at 4.5% for a third straight month, near the lows for this business cycle, according to the median forecast. Average hourly earnings probably rose by 0.3% \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:29 ET (12:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"090e8e852eba766726363b4caec43776","symR":["PSV.T","CA74623J1003"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Pure Energy Svcs Issues Notices Of Default To Supplier Of Fracturing Sand","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T21:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PSV.T","CA74623J1003"],"IndustryCodes":["DRL","OIE","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 17:13 ET (21:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"091d6d89d13e70f43373792510ed57e9","symR":["METR.BA","MGS","ARP6558L1178"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Argentina's Govt Ousts Metrogas Director General -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["METR.BA","MGS","ARP6558L1178"],"IndustryCodes":["GAS","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Corrected July 6, 2007 15:25 ET (1925GMT)\u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:13 ET (18:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0935a72933b6ca8cb67c2b874df10ba1","symR":["MTH"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9827909],"ret5":[0.9311635],"Headline":"Meritage Homes 2Q Cancellations Rose To 37% Of Gross Orders","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MTH"],"IndustryCodes":["HOM","HPR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:33 ET (12:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"098457b1b10c2d785cbbfe37fa857e55","symR":["EMA.T","CA2908761018"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Emera Boosts Annual Dividend To C$0.91/Shr From C$0.89","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EMA.T","CA2908761018"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Emera Inc.

Just yesterday, company said a trial showed its experimental treatment for arthritic knees, hylastan, was no better than a steroid.

Another potential winner is Yahoo (YHOO), which provides search and display ads on the eBay site. Besides extending that relationship, UBS says, \"we could even envision YHOO acting as a distribution partner and traffic provider to Kijiji.\" (GS) \u001d  9:43 (Dow Jones) Well that was fast. Following news that CME raised the share exchange component of its bid for CBOT (BOT), CME's offer was valued higher than the competing bid for ICE, based on Thursday's closing share prices. However, after the open, with CME down and ICE shares trading higher, the ICE offer is again the more lucrative option, on a share exchange basis.

AMD officials could not be reached for comment about the investment. \u001d  Shares of Transmeta surged almost 31% to 90 cents on the news. AMD rose 0.7% to $14.29. \u001d  Transmeta has been struggling itself. In April, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company said it no longer plans to make microprocessors, instead focusing on licensing its technologies and intellectual property that aim to reduce power consumption in PC chips. \u001d  The company is reducing its work force by 15% to 20%. Transmeta reported a first-quarter loss of $18.7 million on sales of $2.1 million. It said it had $25.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 31. \u001d  - Matt Andrejczak; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:55 ET (15:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"10301ad05f7ef9d39b2f7eff44d9e1b9","symR":["CEMARGOS.BO","CHOCOLATE.BO","COA04AO00013","COH04AO00018"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Colombia 3Q Stk Outlook: Cautious Optimism After Weak 1H","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CEMARGOS.BO","CHOCOLATE.BO","COA04AO00013","COH04AO00018"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","FOD","OFP","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Inti Landauro \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  BOGOTA (Dow Jones)--After two consecutive quarters of declines, Colombia's benchmark stock index should increase modestly in the July-through-September period thanks to an expected rise in already robust corporate profits and attractive valuations. \u001d  Analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires expect the key IGBC stock index to climb on average 4.5% in the third quarter after falling 4.3% and 0.5% in the first and second quarters, respectively. Interest rate rises sparked profit-taking on five years of spectacular gains, including triple-digit advances in dollar terms in 2004 and 2005, according to MSCI Barra. \u001d  \"Companies are doing well, the Colombian economy is growing, the trend (in recent poor share performance) should change,\" said Paula Delgadillo, a market analyst with local brokerage Valores Bancolombia. \u001d  The country's gross domestic product is growing at its fastest pace in almost three decades, expanding 6.8% in 2006 and almost 8% in the first quarter of this year. Companies' earnings growth remains strong. \u001d  Firms catering to private consumption, such as food maker Grupo Nacional de Chocolates SA (CHOCOLATE.BO), and in the construction sector, such as Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS.BO), will probably benefit most from the economic growth, said Marcela Giraldo, an analyst with local brokerage Corredores Asociados. \u001d  Isagen SA (ISAGEN.BO), a state-owned power company, recently placed 19.2% of its shares, which will begin trading on the Colombian Stock Exchange in the coming days. It will probably be a good performer during the quarter as demand during the sale surpassed the supply of shares. \u001d  \"When the stock starts to trade normally, demand will be strong, but without effects on the index, since it won't be part of the basket until at least the end of the quarter,\" said David Rivera, a stock analyst with local brokerage Asesores en Valores. \u001d  The IGBC is revised quarterly, and Isagen is expected to be included on the index from the fourth quarter. \u001d  The recent poor performance of the Colombian market, especially compared with that of other regional markets, should attract investors looking for bargains, Giraldo added. \u001d  The Colombian stock index fell 4.7% in the first half of the year, but gained 4.5% in June. The Brazilian key stock index soared 22% in the first half, and the Mexican benchmark index added 18% in the same period. \u001d  During the second quarter, investors shied away from Colombian shares on concerns about accelerating inflation and rising interest rates, Giraldo said. \u001d  The Colombian Central Bank has gradually raised its key rate to 9% from 6% 15 months ago to reduce inflationary pressures. \u001d  Higher rates are making financing more expensive for Colombian companies and may weigh on consumption in the coming months, thus hurting their domestic sales. \u001d  Colombia's 12-month inflation rate hit 6.23% in May, accelerating from 4.48% at end 2006. The rate is much higher than the Central Bank's target range of 3.5% to 4.5%. \u001d  In June, however, inflation dipped and analysts, investors and central bank officials expect inflation to fall further in coming months, easing the pressure for interest rate hikes. \b Table of Recent Trends Index: IGBC \b          End           End           End         End \b          2Q/07         1Q/07         4Q/06       3Q/06 \bIndex     10,637.66     10,686.38     11,161.14   9,250.98 \bQtr-to-Qtr \bChanges   -0.5%-4.3%         +21%        +21% \b \bCurrency: Colombian Peso \b             End           End           End        End \b             2Q/07         1Q/07        4Q/06      3Q/06 \bPeso Vs Dlr  1,974         2,202.3      2,240      2,398 \bQtr-to-Qtr \bChanges      +12%          +1.7%        +7.1%      +7.4% \b \bIGBC Stock Exchange Index \b2Q Index High: 10,917.26 (04/09) \b2Q Index Low: 10,011.01 (05/30) \b2Q Close: 10,637.66 (06/29) \bLatest close: 10,746.58 (07/06) \bLatest close vs 2Q high: down 1.6% \bLatest close vs 2Q low: up 7.3% \bLatest close vs 2Q close: up 1% \b \u001d  (This is the third in a series of seven articles on third-quarter prospects for Latin America's major stock markets.) \b \u001d  -By Inti Landauro, Dow Jones Newswires; 57-1-600 19 80; colombia@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"103244b9df260cbcbba961c22c0d4f81","symR":["TXN","US8825081040"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9976526,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.021909,-0.00099],"Headline":"Texas Instruments (TXN) Mkt On Close Sell Imbalance: Shrs 69300","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TXN","US8825081040"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:50 ET (19:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"104dbfcb38156acf7948863145ca4f29","symR":["TCNT.YY","TX"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,1.039147],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.026098],"Headline":"Venezuelan Congress To Review Labor Issues At Sidor -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TCNT.YY","TX"],"IndustryCodes":["CON","MNG","STL","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  CARACAS (Dow Jones)--A group of Venezuelan lawmakers from the congressional social development committee will review ongoing worker issues at the Sidor steel company, according to a report by the state-owned news agency. \u001d  Members of congress will seek to resolve standing industrial security and worker pay issues, the Agencia Bolivariana de Noticias reported late Thursday. \u001d  Officials at Sidor could not immediately be reached for comment. \u001d  Lawmakers have already met with representatives from Sidor, a company owned by the Argentine-Italian conglomerate Techint through its subsidiary Ternium (TX). \u001d  In recent months, some unionized workers asked the government to make good on President Hugo Chavez's threats to nationalize the steel company. \u001d  After prolonged negotiations, Sidor agreed to a number of conditions, and Venezuela's Mining Minister, Jose Khan, has said that nationalization is no longer being considered. \u001d  Workers have accused the company of unfair labor practices that violate Venezuelan laws. \b \u001d  -By Raul Gallegos, Dow Jones Newswires; +58-212-564-1339; raul.gallegos@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:06 ET (14:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"10a29c995f1f4335d0031ef578858884","symR":["7267.TO","HMC","JP3854600008"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,1.002436,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.00406,-0.00099],"Headline":"Lawsuit Filed Against Honda Hybrid Mileage Claims -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["7267.TO","HMC","JP3854600008"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In what appears to be the first legal challenge of the mileage claims of hybrid vehicles, a California man has filed a class action lawsuit against Honda Motor Co.'s (HMC) U.S. unit, the Detroit News reported Friday. \u001d  The newspaper said John True, a jazz piano player from Ontario, Calif., filed the suit in March after concluding that his Honda Civic Hybrid averaged just 32 miles per gallon in mixed city/highway driving. The gas-electric hybrid's advertised mileage is 49 mpg in the city and 51 mpg on the highway, according to the Detroit News. \u001d  The newspaper said True's frustration with the actual mileage of his hybrid versus the advertised mileage echoes that of other owners, many of whom voice their complaints on online message boards, and reflects the findings of some independent tests, including one by Consumer Reports. \u001d  The lawsuit claims American Honda Motor Co. has misled consumers in its advertisements and on its Web site. The suit notes that while the Environmental Protection Agency and automobile window stickers say \"mileage will vary,\" some Honda advertisements read \"mileage may vary.\" That implies that it's possible to get the mileage advertised, said William H. Anderson, a Washington, D.C., attorney for True. \u001d  \"I can tell you that the 49/51 figures are EPA numbers, not Honda numbers,\" Honda spokesman Sage Marie told the Detroit News. \"Some customers achieve the EPA mpg figures and some don't, as fuel economy performance is a function of conditions, traffic, driving style, load, etc.\" \u001d  According to the newspaper, the spokesman said the \"vast majority of Civic Hybrid customers are satisfied with the performance since it delivers consistently and substantially higher numbers than comparable nonhybrid vehicles in the real world. It is possible to attain the EPA estimates, and customers do all the time.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:01 ET (13:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"10aa6fd9a77a274062f66d9a29511777","symR":["NWA","US6672801015"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Association Of Flight Attendants Distribution Completes Post Bankruptcy Unsecured Claims Paid To Northwest Pact Employees","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NWA","US6672801015"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:08 ET (14:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"111ef91048a9abadb81d6211d3d34f36","symR":["DG"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Dollar General (DG) Block: 627,600 Shrs At 21.98","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DG"],"IndustryCodes":["RTB","RTS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bDOLLAR GENERAL CORP. \bLast trade NYSE: +0.01 at 21.98 on zero tick \bTrade vol:       627,600 =   15.2% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   2,372,400 =   57.5% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:   1,640,624 =   45.7% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:       4,122,891 =  115.0% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol: 3,586,148 / Prev day +0.01 on 2,265,500 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:16 ET (20:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"112b921eeed30daf5f4bf4921dd5fc02","symR":["CHC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Centerline Holding Increases Loan Pact To $625M >CHC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T21:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CHC"],"IndustryCodes":["MFN","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \b   DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Centerline Holding Co.

You always have challenges when you have a program this complicated going together in what is really kind of record time,\" Mike Bair told reporters at a briefing two days before the first 787 was scheduled to be unveiled. \u001d  \"It's stuff we know what to do with,\" Bair said. \"We are expediting a lot of parts right now, and we're going to make sure we get the production system running the way it needs to run.\" \u001d  The 787 that will be displayed on Sunday still has about 1,000 temporary fasteners that must be replaced with permanent ones, and machinists will have to spend several more weeks installing and testing electrical wiring and other systems before the plane is ready to fly, Bair said. \u001d  Flight testing on the midsize, long-haul plane is expected to begin in late August or September, he said. \u001d  \"We don't schedule first flights,\" Bair said. \"The airplane flies when it's ready. To put a firm date on the calendar might make you do something you don't want to do.\" \u001d  The 787, Boeing's first all-new plane since airlines started flying the 777 in 1995, is scheduled to enter commercial service next May, when Japan's All Nippon Airways Co. (9202.TO) takes delivery of the first of 50 Dreamliners it has ordered. \u001d  To date, Boeing has won 642 orders for the 787, selling out delivery positions through at least 2013, the year rival Airbus expects to roll out its competing A350 XWB. \u001d  The 787 will be the world's first commercial jetliner made mostly of carbon-fiber composites, which are lighter and sturdier than aluminum. Boeing has said that and other technological advances will make the 787 more fuel-efficient and cheaper to maintain. \u001d  Bair said Boeing isn't worried it will run into the types of delays that have plagued Airbus's A380 superjumbo because it comes down to wiring. \u001d  He estimated that the A380 has some 350 miles of wiring - the main source of production problems that forced about two years of delays, slashing billions off its profit forecast for the coming years. \u001d  \"We're not going to have that problem,\" Bair said, noting that the 787 has about 60 miles of wiring. The A380 is scheduled to enter commercial service in October. \u001d  Boeing has said it will deliver 112 787s during its first two years of production, with an ultimate goal of having each plane spend just three days in final assembly, compared to 10-14 days for the larger 777, which like Boeing's older jets is made mostly of aluminum. \u001d  Because demand for the 787 has exceeded the company's expectations, it is looking at ways to boost production rates, but is not ready to say how much faster those rates will be or when the increase will happen. \u001d  \"What we're trying to avoid is making a premature decision on rates that would cause a lot of people to build a lot of facilities they might not need,\" Bair said. \u001d  Though it anticipated the problem, an industrywide shortage of airplane fasteners has proved to be one of the stickiest production snags Boeing has encountered so far. \u001d  Bair said it will probably take another month or two before the first 787 gets fully fitted with permanent fasteners, and he expects the shortage to remain a problem for six to nine more months. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:26 ET (18:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"11d1da599ca452e314ebfe030dd19ef7","symR":["RIG"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9929412],"ret5":[0.958552],"Headline":": Transocean Inc.

LAUDERDALE, Fla., July 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- More U.S. workers believed in a strengthening economy and job market in June, despite declining confidence in their ability to find a new job themselves, according to a recent survey of 3,136 working adults. The Spherion(R) Employee Confidence Index, a monthly gauge of overall worker confidence, increased 1.2 points to 58.7 in June, its highest number since February. The survey, conducted by Harris Interactive(R) on behalf of Spherion Corporation (NYSE: SFN), also shows that over three-fourths (77%) of workers remain confident that they will not lose their jobs in the next year. \b \u001d  According to the Index, the percentage of workers who believe there are more jobs available increased four percentage points to 27 percent.  Despite this rise, the percentage of workers lacking the confidence in their ability to find a new job increased by two percentage points, to 14 percent. \b \u001d  \"Recent economic reports about the manufacturing sector and inflation suggest that the U.S. economy is in good shape and workers are certainly feeling this in their pocketbooks, as both incomes and personal spending have recently risen,\" said Roy Krause, president and chief executive officer of Spherion.  \"In addition to all of this, the job market is still quite healthy as employers add to their payrolls on a consistent basis. Even though total job growth has slowed in comparison to 2006, it's much more difficult to find skilled workers this year. Market dynamics are forcing companies to be more creative and the most emergent employers are offering additional recruiting and retention incentives to remain competitive.\" \b \b    Results from the June Spherion Employment Report: \b \u001d  Employee Confidence Index: Worker Confidence Highest Since February: The Employee Confidence Index increased 1.2 points to 58.7 in June, reaching its highest point since February 2007. The Index, which measures workers' confidence in their personal employment situation and optimism in the macroeconomic environment, reveals that more workers were confident about the economy and job market. \b \b    -- Macroeconomic Confidence Index Increases: The Macroeconomic Confidence \b       Index rose 2.8 points point to 43 in June, as more workers reported \b       optimism in job availability and the strength of the economy. The Index \b       level is 2.7 points higher than a year ago. \b \b    Specific findings from the Macroeconomic Confidence Index include: \b \b        -- 21 percent of U.S. adult workers believe the economy is getting \b           stronger, compared to 19 percentage points in the previous month. \b        -- 27 percent of U.S. adult workers believe that more jobs are \b           available, up four percentage points from May. \b \b    -- Personal Confidence Index Dips Slightly: The Personal Confidence Index \b       decreased 0.6 points to 74.3 in June, as the percentage of workers not \b       confident in their ability to find a new job increased. \b \b    Specific findings from the Personal Confidence Index include: \b \b        -- 14 percent of U.S. adult workers are not confident in their own \b           ability to find a new job, compared to 12 percent in May. \b        -- 65 percent of U.S. adult workers feel confident in the future of \b           their current employer, showing no change from May. \b \b    Job Security Index: Worker Confidence in Their Job Security Remains Strong \b    -- 77 percent of U.S. workers believe that it is unlikely that they will \b       lose their jobs in the next twelve months. The Job Security Index is \b       one percentage point lower than the level recorded in May and a year \b       ago. \b \b \u001d  Job Transition Index: Over Half of Workers Do Not Plan to Look for a New Job in the Next 12 Months \b \b    -- Over half (55%) of workers are unlikely to look for a new job in the \b       next 12 months; one-third (34%) of workers do plan to look. For the \b       second consecutive month, the Job Transition Index remained at 34 \b       percent. The Index is two percentage points lower than the level in \b       June 2006. \b \b \b    About the Spherion Employment Report \b \u001d  As part of the Spherion(R) Emerging Workforce(R) Series of employment surveys, the monthly Spherion Employment Report provides a snapshot of the latest workforce trends across the country and is issued in conjunction with state and national labor market releases. Three key indices are measured: the Spherion Job Security Index, which captures how likely respondents think it is that they will lose their job or that their job will be eliminated in the next 12 months; the Spherion Job Transition Index, which captures how likely respondents are to look for a new job in the next 12 months and the Employee Confidence Index that measures employees' overall confidence in the economy, their employer and their ability to find other employment. The Employee Confidence Index is calculated from the results of four components that reflect these aspects of employee confidence. For each component item a 'score' is calculated by taking the difference of the percentage of positive responses and the percentage of negative responses. These four scores are then averaged to indicate an overall level of employee confidence, with each score ranking on a scale from 0 (no confidence) to 100 (complete confidence). A reading above 50 indicates a positive confidence level. \b \b    Methodology \b \u001d  The June 2007 Spherion Employment Report is based on data from the Harris Interactive QuickQuery(SM) online omnibus conducted monthly by Harris Interactive(R) on behalf of Spherion Corporation. A U.S. sample of 3,136 employed adults, aged 18 years and older, was interviewed in a series of two polls conducted between June 4-6 and June 11-13, 2007 (May 2007 n= 3,422). Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education and region were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting adjusted for respondents' propensity to be online. \b \u001d  With pure probability samples, with 100 percent response rates, it is possible to calculate the probability that the sampling error (but not other sources of error) is not greater than some number. With a pure probability sample of 3,136 U.S. employed adults, one could say with a 95 percent probability that the overall results would have a sampling error of +/- 2 percentage points. However, that does not take other sources of error into account. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no theoretical sampling error can be calculated. \b \b    About Spherion \b \u001d  Spherion Corporation (NYSE: SFN) is a leading recruiting and staffing company that provides integrated solutions to meet the evolving needs of companies and job candidates.

Some experts view the shift as an emerging threat to the U.S. economy, while others see benefits for consumers, saying an expanding list of suppliers diminishes the impact of any single disruption. \u001d  Still others see the shift simply as a reflection of globalization, whereby emerging economies lean on rising financial strength and technological know-how to become tougher competitors. \u001d  New research by investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS) suggests four countries in particular - Brazil, Russia, India and China, or the so-called BRIC countries - are grabbing the most market share from U.S. companies. The BRIC's share of the industry's market value has grown from virtually nothing 15 years ago to more than one third today, while U.S. companies' stake has dwindled from more than half to less than a third. \u001d  The biggest factor, most analysts agree, is the growth of state-controlled national oil companies, including PetroChina Ltd. (PTR), an arm of China National Petroleum Corp.; Russia's OAO Gazprom (GSPBEX.RS), the world's biggest natural gas producer; and Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR), or Petrobras. And the high price of oil - crude futures finished Friday close to $73 a barrel - is playing a big role in their expansion plans. \u001d  CNPC last week acquired rights to search for oil in Canada. India's state-owned oil company, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (500312.BY) divulged plans last month to expand in Brazil. And in May the Venezuelan government took majority control of its last privately run oil projects, part of a resource nationalization strategy also being pursued by Russia. \u001d  Whether this trend is bad for U.S.'s long-term strategic interests is debated by analysts and executives. \u001d  Daniel Yergin, author of \"The Prize,\" the Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the oil industry, said it's time to acknowledge what's been evolving for years: U.S. oil companies simply don't have the clout they did a decade or two ago, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. \u001d  \"A lot of our energy debate harkens back to a world when we were much more self sufficient and doesn't take into account the reality of how integrated we are into a much larger and complex global marketplace,\" Yergin said. \u001d  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) remains the world's largest publicly traded oil company, and its $39.5 billion profit in 2006 was a record for U.S. companies. Yet the Irving, Texas-based company pumped just 3% of the world's oil last year. National oil companies, which control almost 90% of global oil reserves, produced the bulk of the world's supply. \u001d  ConocoPhillips (COP) Chairman Jim Mulva said the global petroleum hunt has become very competitive due in part to the rising influence of the BRIC countries, though he stopped short of calling them dominant. After all, U.S.'s daily oil consumption of about 21 million barrels dwarfs that of the BRIC countries, whose combined daily use last year was about 15 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Department. \u001d  Still, Mulva credited China and India with creating energy policies focused on keeping their economies expanding - something he believes the U.S. sorely lacks. \u001d  \"When energy prices increase, we tend to place blame and not address the real issue: that is, how are we going to develop a long-term energy plan that stresses conservation, additional resources, technology and diversification versus the unrealistic expectation of independence,\" said Mulva, whose company operates in more than 40 countries and posted a record annual profit of $15.5 billion last year. \u001d  Jerry Taylor, an energy analyst at the Cato Institute, a free-market oriented think tank, said the trend documented in the Goldman Sachs report doesn't necessarily make the U.S. more vulnerable. Governments have rarely used the so-called \"oil weapon\" by cutting off supplies to other markets, he said. If they did they'd risk hurting themselves, due to lost revenue, more than they'd hurt the U.S., he added. \u001d  Goldman Sachs cites several reasons for U.S.'s declining role, such as the growth of production outside of North America and Europe and consolidation, including BP PLC's (BP) acquisitions of U.S. companies Amoco and Arco. \u001d  At the end of the first Gulf War in 1991, slightly more than half of the 20 largest companies in the energy industry by market capitalization were from the U.S., while less than half were European, according to the Goldman Sachs' study. Now, BRIC countries and Europe account for more than two-thirds of the companies, while U.S. companies make up less than a third. \u001d  Antoine Halff, head of energy research at Fimat USA LLC, said the shift, driven mainly by the energy needs of the BRIC countries themselves, has its benefits. As more countries boost their production of oil and gas, hurricanes, terror attacks, pipeline accidents and other disruptions have less impact on the worldwide supply chain - and on prices for consumers. \u001d  But others see longer term risks to the U.S. relying too much on energy resources other nations control. \"Energy is beginning to look like a political weapon, and countries that have access to resources are sitting very pretty,\" said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. \u001d  Increasing fuel efficiency and developing alternative energy sources are ways the U.S. could mitigate this disadvantage, Gheit said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:36 ET (20:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"12ef28a60a3a0de10fab863509b976ec","symR":["UKDAY"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"UK May Mfg Output +0.4% On Mo, +1.0% On Yr","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T08:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 04:30 ET (08:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"134dd67253d1b7b67d7ae7da2df442e4","symR":["9401.TO","JP3588600001"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Japan's Rakuten Files Suit Seeking TBS Acctg Book Disclosure","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T09:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["9401.TO","JP3588600001"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Rakuten Inc. (4755.JA) said Friday that it has filed a lawsuit with the Tokyo District Court, seeking disclosure of securities acquisitions by Tokyo Broadcasting System Inc.

In June, the Tokyo High Court and the Tokyo District Court rejected Rakuten's requests for the release of TBS's accounting records on securities trades. \u001d  By turning to the legal system, Rakuten is trying to determine whether TBS has been involved in cross-shareholding deals to ward off any hostile takeover bids, while tie-up talks with Rakuten are underway. \u001d  In 2005, Rakuten emerged as TBS' top shareholder and proposed to integrate operations with the TV broadcaster. But since then, their talks on a possible partnership have stumbled. \u001d  Rakuten in April said it would boost its stake in TBS to more than 20% from just over 19%, essentially making TBS a Rakuten group firm. \u001d  But at a general shareholders' meeting in late June, TBS shareholders approved a plan that will allow the radio and TV broadcaster to adopt takeover defense steps. \b \u001d  -By Yoshio Takahashi, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; yoshio.takahashi@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 05:08 ET (09:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"139584754444a1cfcf5378b660f2ea0c","symR":["MDU"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9944904],"ret5":[1.002755],"Headline":"MDU Resources Sees Deal Adding To '07 EPS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MDU"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:57 ET (20:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"13adbacc0bc293c061c779d199c7363e","symR":["AAPL","BOL","EYE","MSFT","T","UBS","UBSN.VX","WBP.XX","CH0024899483","US00206R1023","US0378331005","US0717071031","US5949181045"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9851111,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9966633,0.995819,0.9996727,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.049963,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.027027,0.9798328,0.9998364,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"=WSJ.COM/Morning Brief: Microsoft Gaming Efforts Have Setback","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAPL","BOL","EYE","MSFT","T","UBS","UBSN.VX","WBP.XX","CH0024899483","US00206R1023","US0378331005","US0717071031","US5949181045"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","CPR","FIS","FTS","MDS","MDV","SOF","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSMI","XSP5","XST5","XSTT","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \b   By David Hall \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE \b \u001d  HONG KONG (Dow Jones)--Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) decision to extend warranties on Xbox 360 videogame consoles represents an expensive setback to efforts to expand its business from software to hardware. \u001d  The company said it will take a pretax charge of more than $1 billion to repair defects in its next-generation game machine. Any customer experiencing a hardware failure now will be covered by a three-year warranty from the date of purchase, Bloomberg reports, while previous warranties lasted one year in the U.S. and Asia and two years in Europe. Xbox users have been posting complaints about the \"Red Ring of Death,\" a reference to a circle of red LED lights around the power button that signals a massive hardware failure, since Microsoft launched the Xbox in November 2005, Forbes says, but some gamers who returned their consoles for repairs were plagued by the same problems again. A person familiar with the matter tells The Wall Street Journal that the problem is related to too much heat being generated by components. \u001d  Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, blamed the problem on the company's own hardware design, the Financial Times writes, and he added that Microsoft came to realize the problem about a year after the console was launched. The problems with the Xbox 360 highlight the pitfalls of Microsoft moving beyond its forte of software engineering into hardware, the Journal says. During a conference call, Bach explained that the company has been able to \"engineer around\" some of the problems and new consoles will include hardware fixes, but won't be redesigned to eliminate the problem, Forbes writes. While Bach declined to say exactly how many consoles were affected, the size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that one-third to as many as one-half of Xbox machines are flawed, according to the New York Times. \u001d  Microsoft's push into videogames hasn't been a profitable endeavor, the Journal notes. The company has reported a cumulative loss of $3.08 billion in the past three fiscal years for its home and entertainment division, of which Xbox is a major part, the paper points out. But the Xbox is still an important initiative by Microsoft and is seen by many analysts as the company's attempt to compete with Sony Corp. (SNE) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) for dominance in home electronics, the Times writes. However, the popularity of Nintendo Co.'s (NTDOY) Wii console also has been a challenge, as Wii has outsold Xbox every month since it went on sale in November, Bloomberg says. And with competitors looking to gain market share, analyst Matt Rosoff from research firm Directions on Microsoft tells the news agency that Microsoft's problems won't \"help the Xbox compete against Nintendo, and it may be the stumble\" that PlayStation 3-maker Sony needs to win sales. \b \b   Advanced Medical Eyes Bausch \b \u001d  Advanced Medical Optics Inc. (EYE) is looking to broaden its reach in the eye-care sector with a proposed $4.3 billion cash and stock offer for Bausch & Lomb Inc. (BOL). The offer could upset an existing $3.7 billion all-cash deal signed by Warburg Pincus, The Wall Street Journal notes, but the Advanced Medical bid also may raise antitrust issues and any deal would require Bausch shareholder approval. Under the Advanced Medical bid, Bausch investors would receive $45 a share in cash, plus $30 in stock, Bloomberg says. The deal could attract other participants, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s (GS) private-equity arm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts or others, people familiar with the matter tell the Journal. Private-equity firms largely have avoided jumping in on each other's signed deals, so such a move would be a major development, the paper adds. \u001d  The offer highlights Advanced Medical's aim to expand its presence in the industry to cover everything from contact-lens solution to laser eye surgery to cataract implants, the Journal writes. While the company had said in May that it was interesting in buying Bausch, the offer surprised some analysts because Advanced Medical recently had been through an expensive recall of its Complete MositurePlus contact-lens solution, the New York Times says. Bausch has had its own problems with recalls after its ReNu with MoistureLoc solution was linked to an outbreak of fungal infections last year, the paper notes. \b \b   Also Of Note... \b \u001d  Washington Post: White House efforts to keep congressional Republicans united over the Iraq war suffered another major defection as New Mexico Sen.

But they suspect it may be the same thing that triggered the die-off eight years ago: rapid warming of Arctic waters where the whales feed. \u001d  Science: From old adages to modern pop psychology, the notion that women talk more than men is pervasive. But according to a new study, the biggest to date, the two sexes are in fact pretty much neck and neck.

Powered by clean-burning, environmentally-friendly compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel, an Interstate Waste Services Co., Inc. demonstration truck will handle trash collection duties at the event. \b \u001d  \"Putting trucks like these into operation in the New York area and all across the country is one of the best strategies available today for reducing air pollution and cutting greenhouse gases,\" said Joanna Underwood, President of Energy Vision, a national environmental organization. \"I might say that this refuse truck is the rock star of the refuse industry!\" she said. \b \u001d  The Live Earth Concert demonstration vehicle, the world's cleanest heavy-duty refuse collection truck, has been provided to Interstate Waste by Clean Energy (NASDAQ:CLNE), North America's leader in clean transportation, and Hallahan Truck Sales, Holtsville, NY-based natural gas Autocar refuse truck dealer. Clean Energy and Hallahan have partnered to supply natural gas-powered refuse trucks and companion fueling services to New York area refuse fleets. Based in Sloatsburg, NY, Interstate Waste Services provides solid waste and recycling services within Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. \b \u001d  The demo truck deployed at the Live Earth Concert, like the almost 2,000 other natural gas garbage trucks now operating across the U.S., reduces greenhouse gas emissions by about 11 to 23 percent compared to diesel, according to a study of natural gas engines just completed for the California Air Resources Board. \b \b   Why Refuse Trucks Matter \b \u001d  The 136,000 refuse trucks operating in the U.S. burn approximately 1.2 billion gallons of diesel fuel a year, releasing almost 27 billion pounds of the greenhouse gas, CO2. Every gallon of diesel fuel they burn emits more than 22 pounds of CO2. In addition to contributing to global climate change, diesel-fueled trash trucks are one of the most concentrated sources of health-threatening air pollution in virtually all cities. \b \u001d  \"Unlike many other trucks or buses, refuse trucks travel every residential street -- stopping and starting and pouring their emissions onto virtually every door step,\" Underwood said. Diesel emissions are a well-known trigger of asthma attacks and are also linked to rising cancer rates. \b \u001d  Natural Gas Trucks: Fighting Climate Change in the Near and Long Terms \b \u001d  Replacing old diesel refuse trucks with the new fully-operational natural gas models offers the chance to achieve multiple benefits, not just in the near term but also in the long term. Their use helps address severe pollution and greenhouse gas challenges today, according to Underwood. \"But natural gas trucks also help pave the way toward better and better fuel options in the future. The sophisticated natural gas engine can take increasing advantage of clean renewable bio-methane fuel, which is beginning to be produced from the greenhouse gases that now escape from the many thousands of landfills, sewage plants and agricultural waste sources across the country. In the longer term, they form a bridge to the era of hydrogen-fueled vehicles.\" \b \u001d  Energy Vision is a New York-based, national non-profit organization that analyzes and promotes ways to make a swift transition to pollution-free renewable energy sources, and to the clean, petroleum-free transportation fuels of the future. Its Associates have published Greening Garbage Trucks: Volumes I and II, on trends in alternative fuels use in the refuse truck sector.

Such linkups would maximize the limited financial room France Telecom has for maneuver given its high level of debt. \u001d  Didier Lombard, chairman and chief executive of the 27.4% state-owned telecommunications giant, said France Telecom has its eye on privatization opportunities in Algeria and Vietnam. \u001d  In June, France Telecom teamed up with private equity group Mid-Europa Partners to buy Austrian mobile-phone operator One. \u001d  Mid-Europa bought a 65% stake in One, with France Telecom taking the remaining 35%. \u001d  France Telecom said the deal, which gave One an enterprise value of around EUR1.4 billion, had no impact on its net debt ratio targets - which is important for a heavily indebted company. France Telecom's net debt stood at around EUR42 billion at end-2006. \u001d  At a meeting with financial journalists here, Lombard said the company is particularly interested in expanding in Algeria, where the state telecommunications company Algeria Telecom is planned to be at least partially privatized. \u001d  \"We have a lot of affinity with our Algerian partners,\" he said. There are over 40 companies from around the world expected to show interest in taking part of Algeria Telecom. \u001d  The authorities there have yet to announce definitively the terms of any privatization. \u001d  Lombard also said France Telecom is interested in Vietnam, which he views as another growth market, although telecoms assets that come up for sale there are likely to prove expensive. The Vietnamese government is gearing up for a major privatization program slated for later this year. \u001d  Vietnam's post and telecommunications sector is  expected by the government to generate 60 trillion dong ($3.75 billion) in revenue in 2007, up 22.4% from 2006. \u001d  State-owned Vietnam Post and Telecommunication Corp., the sector's largest firm, had 14.9% revenue growth last year to VND38.33 trillion. The number of telephone owners is expected to rise to 38 million this year from around 30 million a year ago. \u001d  France Telecom recently acquired Spanish Internet provider Ya.com from Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) for EUR320 million. \u001d  The French company is also waiting for works council approval to sell its Dutch subsidiary to Deutsche Telekom. \u001d  Company Web site: www.Francetelecom.com \u001d  -By A.H.

However, after the open, with CME down and ICE shares trading higher, the ICE offer is again the more lucrative option, on a share exchange basis. Based on recent share prices, ICE's $11.45B bid compares with CME's offer of $11.28B. CME off 1.2% at $549, while ICE up 0.6% at $153. BOT up 3.9% at $214.

Caledonia Investments, CBOT's largest shareholder, which balked at earlier terms, confirmed Friday it plans to vote for the CME/CBOT deal, which would create the world's largest derivatives exchange.

Still, the market continues to reflect the widely held view the FOMC will be content to leave the funds rate at its current level at the Aug. 7 and Sept. 18 policy meetings. (HLP) \u001d  9:14 (Dow Jones) The 10-year yield, near 5.180%, if it clears the 5.144%-5.195% resistance band, which charts say is likely, will be the on the way up to 5.305%. The profit-taking point in that case would be 5.252%. The spot U.S. Dollar Index, near 81.60, if it breaks out on the intraday charts above 81.66, would be going for the upper end of its 81.95-81.31 intraday trading range. The euro, near $1.3600, is liable to dip to $1.3452. The signal for the move would be decisive trading below $1.3528.

(NYSE:MDT) announced the commercial launch of its latest cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator, the Concerto(R) CRT-D, and its latest implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, the Virtuoso(R) ICD. Both devices are the first of their kind in Japan equipped with key features, including wireless telemetry. \b \u001d  ICDs are implanted medical devices used to detect sudden, potentially fatal arrhythmias and automatically deliver therapies to restore the normal rhythm of the heart. CRT-D devices are equipped with the functions of an ICD while also providing cardiac resychronization therapy for patients suffering from heart failure, in which the left and right ventricles (lower chambers) of the heart fail to provide a synchronized beat. In addition to the above functions, the Concerto and Virtuoso are the first devices in Japan with three new features. \b \u001d  Wireless Functionality Reduces Time Needed for Follow-Ups and Procedures \b \u001d  Implanted devices such as pacemakers and ICDs are capable of internally recording the patient's pulse, device therapies delivered, and other similar data over a certain period of time. This information is then obtained by the patient's doctor during in-office follow-up visits every three to four months and used to determine the patient's subsequent treatment and therapies. Conventional devices require an in-office visit where a reader is placed over the implanted device to allow for transfer of this data; the Concerto and Virtuoso provide this information wirelessly, precluding the need for patients to disrobe. Changes to certain device settings can also be performed using the wireless function. Additionally, the initial settings programmed during device implant can be performed wirelessly, avoiding the placement of the programming head in the sterile field ordinarily used for this function, thereby potentially reducing the time for surgical procedures. \b \b   Reducing Shocks Minimizes Patient Burden \b \u001d  ICDs detect and provide therapy to terminate dangerous arrhythmias. This therapy may take the form of anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) or electrical shock (known as defibrillation). ATP is a mild and relatively painless form of therapy compared to a shock, which may be uncomfortable, and can cause the patient to experience apprehension or fear. The Concerto and Virtuoso are capable of delivering ATP while simultaneously charging the capacitor (ATP During Charging(TM)) to provide a shock, if needed. This means that if the arrhythmia is not terminated using ATP, the devices are able to deliver the electrical shock with no delay, giving patients access to the safe, painless ATP therapy while minimizing patient burden. \b \u001d  Measuring Impedance in the Thoracic Cavity and Reporting Symptoms to Physician \b \u001d  Heart failure patients may experience fluid building up in their lungs, leading to a worsening condition. The Concerto and Virtuoso are the first devices in Japan capable of measuring the impedance in the thoracic cavity between the device implanted below the clavicle and the lead implanted in the ventricle, allowing the device to record the level of fluid in the patient's lungs. The OptiVol(R) Fluid Status Monitoring diagnostic feature allows physicians earlier access to warning signs of deteriorating heart failure, which can then be used for early treatment of the patient's heart failure. \b \u001d  In addition to the regular CRT-D and ICD functions of the Concerto and Virtuoso, the introduction of the above three features in Japan may allow for improved quality-of-life for heart failure and high-risk arrhythmia patients. \b \u001d  \"It is significant that today Japanese patients have access to the latest Medtronic devices, the Concerto CRT-D and Virtuoso ICD,\" said Steve Mahle, president of Medtronic's Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management business. \"In the past, Japanese physicians often had to wait extended periods of time before being able to offer their patients the newest device therapies such as wireless telemetry. But in working closely with the Ministry of Health, Law and Welfare, we are able to safely bring these products to market to benefit thousands of Japanese patients with heart failure and arrhythmias.\" \b \b   Concerto and Virtuoso Main Features \b \u001d  First devices in Japan equipped with Medtronic's exclusive Conexus(R) Wireless Telemetry \b \b   --  Feature uses official MICS (Medical Implant Communication \b        Service) bandwidth at 402-405 megahertz, preventing \b        interference from cell phones and other common electronic \b        devices. \b \b   --  SmartRadio(TM) function automatically switches channels when \b        noise interference is detected, allowing for safe wireless \b        data transmission. \b \b   First devices in Japan with ATP During Charging(TM) \b \b   --  Anti-tachycardia pacing can be performed during charging of \b        the capacitor to provide a shock. \b \u001d  First devices in Japan with Medtronic's proprietary Optivol(R) Fluid Status Monitoring \b \b   --  Thoracic impedance measured 64 times daily; daily average \b        recorded by device. \b \b   --  Device stores data for up to 14 months and is capable of \b        providing a report at follow-up. \b \b   About Medtronic \b \u001d  Medtronic, Inc.

The sale price represents a multiple of 1.9 x 2006 revenues. \u001d  ABN Amro said in an early research note the market would likely mark down expectations of the total disposal proceeds, which includes two other portfolios, to around GBP500 milion from a previous expectation of around GBP600 million. \u001d  \"They have fallen short,\" analyst Paul Gooden said. He said ABN Amro would reiterate its sell rating on the business, on the basis that the remaining business would be more dependent on Trinity's \"troubled\" national newspapers, which include the Mirror and the People. \u001d  Lorna Tilbian, at Numis Securities, said, however, that the transaction was \"sensible for both sides\", adding that Trinity had secured a \"reasonable price.\" \u001d  Numis, which rates both companies hold, said that the acquisition was attractive for DMGT as it \"bolsters\" that company's presence in the South East, currently its smallest region, and should be earnings-enhancing. \u001d  However, the downgrade in expectations underlines falling confidence in the U.K. regional newspapers market. \u001d  The Racing Post, which in 2005 attracted a bid from a consortium including a former member of the U.K. government, Robin Cook, valuing it at GBP210 million, is expected to be sold shortly for around GBP190 million, according to press reports. Trinity Mirror has consistently declined to comment on the ongoing sale process. \u001d  Trinity in late 2006 said it planned to sell the Southern newspapers, alongside a portfolio in the English midlands including the Birmingham Evening Mail, and the Racing Post, a horse-racing specialist newspaper. \u001d  At 0750 GMT shares in Trinity Mirror were trading up 0.1% at 546 pence in London. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.trinitymirror.com \b \u001d  -By Jessica Hodgson, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 92 93; jessica.hodgson@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 03:54 ET (07:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1e1feb74dfb97db4fdf9bd711de82975","symR":["MGT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"MGT Chmn And CEO Buys $5 M Worth Of MGT Shares","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MGT"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1e257f818499bf4f83c56bd1abae119e","symR":["6701.TO","NIPNY","JP3733000008","US6290502045"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": NEC and Daiwa Securities Group Inc.

(RCL) urged Asian countries Friday to improve their port facilities to accommodate larger ships as the company expands its operations in the region to gain new customers. \u001d  \"Our primary focus this time is to develop the Asian market for sourcing for customers and to begin to build our brand into a leadership position,\" said Adam Goldstein, president of Royal Caribbean, the world's second-largest cruising company. \u001d  \"It is really important for hubs in Asia to commence infrastructure improvement ... it's a matter of execution at this point,\" he said. \u001d  Asia's port infrastructure is cited by the cruising industry as a major obstacle for ship and passenger capacity, with many ports falling short of having adequate transportation in and out of port facilities. \u001d  But Goldstein, who also announced the opening of the Miami-based company's Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore, acknowledged that another of his company's challenges in Asia was to sell sea cruises as an attractive alternative to land vacations. \u001d  \"The growth of cruising ... is in part dependent on our ability to convince people of the benefits of taking a vacation on the water, because there are so many choices of land vacations,\" Goldstein said. \"So we have that battle ahead of us in Asia. Because most people (here) don't understand the value for money, the different activities, all the experiences that you can have.\" \u001d  Goldstein said that the company aims to build its presence in the region through public relations campaigns and advertising. It is also posting international representatives in various locations and setting up an office in Shanghai to tap into the growing Chinese market. \u001d  Royal Caribbean says its 1,998-passenger Rhapsody of the Seas will become the largest ship in the region when it begins its deployment in December. The cruise will offer cuisine from the region, Western-style entertainment, and service staff who can speak some local languages, Goldstein said. \u001d  The number of cruise passengers in the Asia-Pacific region is projected to grow by more than 40% from 1.07 million in 2005 to 1.5 million by 2010, Royal Caribbean said in a statement, citing a May 2005 study by Ocean Shipping Consultants, a London-based independent consultancy. \u001d  Today, the Asia-Pacific region lags behind the Caribbean, Europe and Alaska as a cruise destination. But Asian officials say there is long-term growth potential for a region with improving ports and alluring destinations.or the \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 06:39 ET (10:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1e85384ae814b29789601a922bb10289","symR":["MTH"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9827909],"ret5":[0.9311635],"Headline":"Meritage Homes Ends 2Q With $1.2B Backlog >MTH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MTH"],"IndustryCodes":["HOM","HPR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:32 ET (12:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1ec9e52faa70de7fdde77c42b6c8383d","symR":["BT","BT.A.LN","PXC.LN","GB0005846018","GB0030913577"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.011099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.028199,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: BT Brightview Buy Casts Cloud Over Pipex","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T07:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BT","BT.A.LN","PXC.LN","GB0005846018","GB0030913577"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\u001d  0713 GMT [Dow Jones] BT's (BT) acquisition of Brightview is a small deal but it provides significant read-across for Pipex (PXC.LN) says Dan Gardiner at Bridgewell.

He replaces Peter Wuffli, 49, effective immediately. \u001d  The move, first reported on the Wall Street Journal's Web site, appears to be the handiwork of Marcel Ospel, UBS' 57-year-old chairman, former CEO and architect of the major Swiss banking merger in 1997 that formed UBS. \u001d  Alongside the change, Ospel will extend his tenure as chairman for at least another three-year term. \u001d  UBS said the move stems from the board's unanimous refusal to accept a succession plan put forth by Ospel roughly one year ago, which called for Wuffli to succeed Ospel as chairman, with the latter retiring from the bank altogether. Ospel denied that there had been rifts in strategy and said UBS has no changes to business plans or growth initiatives underway. \u001d  However, the changes immediately gave rise to fears that Wuffli was sacked because UBS is set to report further hefty losses from a failed in-house hedge fund, Dillon Read Capital Management, which is being shut down. \u001d  \"It remains to be seen whether all of the subprime hit was kitchen-sinked last quarter, or if there is more marked-to-market in 2Q,\" said Kinner Lakhani, London-based analyst with ABN Amro. First-quarter earnings from UBS were dented by 150 million Swiss francs ($123 million) in losses from Dillon Read from trades on mortgage securities gone bad. Lakhani rates UBS at hold with and CHF80 target. \u001d  UBS Chairman Ospel said second-quarter earnings, due Aug. 14, will \"contain both positive and negative swings\" but are expected to be broadly in line with market expectations. Ospel said he wouldn't discuss Dillon Read trading patterns more specifically. \u001d  Lakhani said that is little comfort, given that sizable losses at Dillon Read or elsewhere could easily be masked though healthy returns in other units. \u001d  The shares veered sharply lower in pre-market trading, but recovered to open slightly higher. At 1054 GMT, the stock was up CHF0.65, or 0.9%, at CHF74.45 amid a slightly higher Swiss blue chip market. \u001d  Analysts said they were taken aback by Wuffli's immediate departure - Rohner is assuming the top job Friday, and Ospel said Wuffli will leave \"shortly\" - given that the bank was nearing the end of a costly expansion in fixed income, where it has spent months hiring bankers and building teams in areas such as commodities and leveraged finance, traditional weak spots. \u001d  The Swiss banking regulator told the AP that it hadn't intervened in the CEO change and had learned of it Friday morning. \u001d  In recent months, Wuffli has had to contend with a slew of setbacks and with criticism from analysts over UBS' lagging share price, with some critics urging UBS to consider a breakup of the bank to avoid a conglomerate discount that has set in. \u001d  UBS has disappointed analysts several quarters running by missing earnings expectations, mainly because of rising costs for the fixed-income efforts. \u001d  As a result, UBS shares have slumped compared with those of cross-town rival Credit Suisse Group (CS). Since November, when UBS reported the first in what became a series of quarterly slides in fixed income revenue, UBS shares have shed 0.7%, while Credit Suisse stock has gained 13%. \u001d  Other setbacks for UBS include the loss of several high-profile bankers earlier this year, among them investment banking president and veteran dealmaker Ken Moelis, who left after the bank's conservative ways prevented it from making inroads in hot areas such as leveraged finance. \u001d  And in May, UBS was forced to shut in-house hedge fund Dillon Read after losses from trading mortgage securities weighed on the bank's fixed-income revenue. \u001d  Incoming CEO Rohner will also have to address calls to consider a split-up of its main arms, which are investment banking and private banking, or financial services for the wealthy. \u001d  Earlier this year, a faction of investment bankers had been pushing to spin out the investment bank from UBS, with speculation centering on Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH). UBS rejected the speculation in May, saying it remains committed to keeping the bank together in spite of the recent turmoil. \u001d  Meanwhile, a recent study by Deutsche Bank argued that UBS should reconsider the private banking arm as well. Deutsche analyst Matt Spick urged UBS to either restructure or sell less profitable units, such as a U.S. brokerage arm, to banish a conglomerate discount UBS trades on. \u001d  Despite repeated vows from chairman Ospel and incoming CEO Rohner to keep UBS intact, analysts said the calls to break up the bank will persist. \u001d  \"There is an enormous valuation gap of CHF38 billion at UBS, and until that's meaningfully addressed the talk will continue,\" said Peter Thorne, a London-based analyst with independent brokerage Helvea SA. \u001d  Rohner, who holds a Ph.D in economics, began his career in the investment banking arm of Swiss Bank Corp. one of the banks that merged to form UBS in 1997. \u001d  After that deal, Rohner rose through UBS' ranks quickly, and was named chief risk officer in 1999. He transferred to UBS' private bank in 2001, advancing rapidly in that unit as well, becoming head of all UBS' private banking activities in 2002. \u001d  Rohner will be replaced by Raoul Weil as head of the private banking arm, which also oversees business with corporate clients and a domestic retail operation. \u001d  Wuffli's departure was as abrupt as his ascent in 2001. Then, he was named president of UBS after the then-CEO Luqman Arnold lost a power struggle with Ospel. Wuffli was named CEO two years later. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.ubs.com \u001d  -By Katharina Bart, Dow Jones Newswires; ? 43 443 8043; katharina.bart@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 06:59 ET (10:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1f559365f5c4ee1af08511fc51089f27","symR":["HLT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9964999],"ret5":[0.9857799],"Headline":"Hilton Hotels (HLT) Block: 500,000 Shrs At 45.49","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HLT"],"IndustryCodes":["LOD","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bHILTON HOTELS CORP. \bLast trade  NMS: +0.10 at 45.49 on 0.01 downtick \bTrade vol:       500,000 =   12.5% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   2,806,600 =   69.9% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:   1,497,870 =   29.8% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:       4,013,400 =   79.7% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol: 5,032,676 / Prev day +9.34 on 104,785,920 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:50 ET (13:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1f6bf7ab3a42a5daa9aaf03a9d1c0a13","symR":["LMC","LUN.T","CA5503721063"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Lundin Mining Raised To Outperf From Sector Perf: Natl Bk>LMC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:53:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LMC","LUN.T","CA5503721063"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI","XISL","XSXA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:53 ET (11:53 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1f9231dded3e8a20b2726fe33761f83e","symR":["LI"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Laidlaw Intl 3Q Rev $868.9M Vs $860.7M, +1.0% >LI","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LI"],"IndustryCodes":["TAT","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:45 ET (11:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1fbcd5c52ed0980d001943fd57083513","symR":["AZN","AZN.LN","GB0009895292"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9920252,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.040616,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"AstraZeneca Buys Back 0.2M Shares At 2684P >AZN","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T07:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AZN","AZN.LN","GB0009895292"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--AstraZeneca said Friday that it purchased for cancellation 214,143 ordinary shares at 2684 pence per share on July 5. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 03:26 ET (07:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1fc679f06ddc3668e16e07a49fff965f","symR":["1055.HK","600029.SH","ZNH","CN0008139643","CN0009084145"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9823529,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9067227,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": China Southern Announces New International Routes Starting In July","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1055.HK","600029.SH","ZNH","CN0008139643","CN0009084145"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\bGUANGZHOU, China--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \u001d  China Southern Airlines, (NYSE:ZNH)(HKSE:1055)(SHA:600029) - www.cs-air.com/en - the world's 9th largest airline and the largest airline in The People's Republic of China will launch four new international routes in July, from Guangzhou to Yangon, Phuket, Siem Reap, and Vientiane respectively. \b \u001d  The new services to Yangon and Vientiane are the first routes operated by China Southern to Burma and Laos.

Industry observers attribute the price surge to strong demand and higher milk prices. \u001d  Because cheddar is the benchmark for mozzarella and other cheeses, some big pizza chains, including Yum Brands Inc.'s (YUM) Pizza Hut and Papa John's International Inc. (PZZA), already have responded by raising their prices. \u001d  There are few active cheese traders at the CME and the volume of cheese that changes hands is small, the GAO said, making it susceptible to price manipulation. Less than 2% of all cheddar cheese made in the United States is traded at the CME, among only 30 participants, which range from dairy cooperatives to large companies. \u001d  The GAO investigation came at the request of several farm-state senators who were concerned about the CME's vulnerability to price distortions. \u001d  The agency found that the 1997 transfer of spot cheese trading to the CME, from the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, Wis., where allegations of price manipulation also surfaced, resulted in greater oversight by the CME as well as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \u001d  But otherwise, the structure of the market is largely the same, the report said. \u001d  The CFTC has reviewed complaints about cheese price manipulation at the CME, the report said, but those reviews have not resulted in any legal action. \u001d  The GAO recommended that the U.S. Department of Agriculture audit the cheese prices companies report in a separate survey to ensure their accuracy. As part of a farm price support program, the department sets a minimum price of unprocessed milk that is based in part on a survey of cheese prices, including the price of cheese traded at the CME. \u001d  Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., one of the five senators who requested the study, called on the department to \"improve its oversight of the prices it receives in order to better protect our hardworking dairy farmers.\" \u001d  Most cheese in the United States is traded through long-term contracts, which use the CME price as a reference price. \u001d  Susan Ruland, a spokeswoman for the International Dairy Foods Association, said her members support the GAO's recommendation that the USDA audit cheese prices and have called for such a move for some time. \u001d  The association's members include Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT), ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG) and Dean Foods Co. (DF). \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:51 ET (11:51 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"20833ca72169bb10d5990b06a5afd59a","symR":["5786.FR","MT","MT.AE","LU0140205948","NL0000361947"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,1.029003,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.021135,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": ArcelorMittal Announces Organisational Changes","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5786.FR","MT","MT.AE","LU0140205948","NL0000361947"],"IndustryCodes":["STL","XAEX","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XNYA"],"Story":"\bLUXEMBOURG & ROTTERDAM, Netherlands--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \b   Regulatory News: \b \u001d  ArcelorMittal, the world's leading steel company, today announces senior organisational changes.

Later, MedQuist came under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and became subject of several law suits after a probe into alleged improper billing practices over the past years. \u001d  Analysts note that it's the first time that Philips officially says that MedQuist is non-core and they reckon this means that the company seeks a buyer for its stake, now valued at EUR250 million.   They see the move as a positive. \u001d  MedQuist is \"mostly a risk factor for Philips without adding much to the overall value,\" said SNS analyst Victor Bareno, who rates shares at add. \u001d  A disposal of \"this troubled unit\" would \"add close to 1% to the growth rate\" of the company's medical unit and \"close to 1%\" to its margin, Dresdner Kleinwort's Janardan Menon said. Menon rates shares an add. \u001d  At 1243 GMT, Philips shares are down 0.4%, or EUR0.12, at EUR32.77, while the benchmark AEX was up 0.6%. \u001d  Philips' announcement followed a filing by MedQuist to the SEC, containing financial information of the company for the years 2003-2005. MedQuist still has to file to the SEC its financial information for 2006, which it is expected to do during the third quarter. \u001d  Over 2006, MedQuist had unaudited sales of $370 million and an operating loss of $10 million. \u001d  Philips also said that it will take a non-cash impairment charge of around EUR35 million on its 70% MedQuist stake. The company did so after its annual goodwill test for impairment. \u001d  It will have \"no impact\" on full-year earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, or EBITA, for its medical systems unit, Philips said. \u001d  MedQuist is part of Philips' Medical Systems, a unit which focuses on improving health care, and - as it deals in back office-related services - MedQuist doesn't fit well into the business, Philips' spokesman Jayson Otke said. \u001d  The original plan - when Philips acquired the MedQuist stake - was that the automation of MedQuist's medical transcription business via Philips' speech recognition technology could further build on MedQuist's leading position in this industry. \u001d  There is no lockup on the Philips stake in MedQuist. \u001d  Dresdner Kleinwort's Menon said private equity players and competitors like U.S.-based Nuance Communications inc (NUAN), 3M Health Information Systems and eScription might be possible buyers. \u001d  Company Website: http://www.philips.com \u001d  By Mathijs Schiffers; Dow Jones Newswires; +31-20-5890270; mathijs.schiffers@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:55 ET (12:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"209c256c188e9825c905d2af8b3b36a6","symR":["BKC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Burger King Corp.

(KSE) by reaching an agreement in principle over the terms of the deal with the New York State Department of Public Service. \u001d  Formal documentation of the agreement in principle is currently being prepared and is expected to be filed with the NYPSC shortly, National Grid said in a statement. The terms of the agreement will be publicly available at that time, it said. \u001d  The merger is scheduled to be put before the NYPSC for a vote on August 22. If the vote is positive, National Grid expects to complete the acquisition shortly after. \u001d  \"This is a nice step forward,\" said Ian Mitchell, an analyst at JP Morgan. \"There was concern that the deal could drag on...but the vote is earlier than it could have been.\" He said the deal now looks on course to meet National Grid's target for completion in Autumn. \u001d  The NYPSC had previously criticized the deal, saying that National Grid wasn't offering a large enough share of the deal's savings to customers. It also proposed National Grid sell off KeySpan's 2,400-megawatt Ravenswood power plant. \u001d  Mitchell expects to see positive terms once the details of the agreement are released. \"National Grid were pushing back quite hard in negotiations,\" he said. He said he didn't expect the company to give up the $200 million of synergy savings it has promised shareholders through the deal and he also said he didn't expect it to capitulate to the NYPSC's demands that it sell the Ravenswood plant. \u001d  National Grid says the deal will deliver $800 million of savings to KeySpan customers. \u001d  National Grid operates the U.K. electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks. It also operates five local distribution networks that serve around 3.4 million customers in New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. It's subsidiary Rhode Island Gas delivers to 245,000 customers. \u001d  KeySpan is the fifth largest distributor of gas in the U.S. It serves 2.6 million customers in New York, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. \u001d  When combined, the companies will be the third largest utility in the U.S. \u001d  National Grid shares were down 0.14%, or 1 pence, at 1038 GMT Friday at 721 pence. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.nationalgrid.com \u001d  http://www.keyspanenergy.com \b \u001d  -By James Herron, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9317; james.herron@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 06:55 ET (10:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2114104566b43191ccbea8c38d889e1a","symR":["MTEX"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9836735],"ret5":[0.9844898],"Headline":"Mannatech To Take Action To Address Concerns Of Texas Atty Genl","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T17:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MTEX"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:46 ET (17:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"212755bfdbb35fd4a442470d76439d73","symR":["WSM.LN","GB00B1VWM162"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Credit Suisse Lifts Wellstream Price Target","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T08:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WSM.LN","GB00B1VWM162"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE"],"Story":"\u001d  0805 GMT [Dow Jones] Credit Suisse lifts Wellstream (WSM.LN) price target to 600p from 500p, following the announcement of the possibility of an expansion of its new Brazilian plant. \"Using conservative assumptions on capex and a phased increase in capacity, our estimates of '08-'10 could increase by 12%, 12% and 22% to 31.4p, 45.9p and 48 p respectively,\" the bank says, stressing \"if\" the expansion is implemented.

Truck manufacturers in Europe are positioning themselves for the technical leap needed to meet tough new E.U. standards, expected to be outlined this summer. \u001d  Gradually toughening E.U. standards already have forced truck manufacturers to spend more money on research and development. But there are concerns that the lower fuel efficiency that some new emission-control systems bring about could raise costs for drivers, and therefore slow future sales. \u001d  All truck makers could be financially affected if customers begin to postpone the purchase of new trucks, said Paul Greening, director of emissions and fuels at the Brussels-based European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA. \u001d  \"With fuel making up about a third of a truck's costs, efficiency is very important when a customer is choosing a vehicle,\" Greening said. \u001d  Anders Johannesson, vice president of environment and public affairs at Volvo AB (VOLV), said his company's profit would be hurt if sales fall. But, he said, that might not happen. Demand for cutting-edge trucks should remain strong in Europe, he said, partially because some countries, such as Germany with its Maut road toll system, are giving significant financial incentives to truckers using green vehicles. That system gives substantial benefits to truckers who drive cleaner vehicles through Germany. \u001d  \"We are spending a lot of money on R&D, and a lot of that goes to meeting the emission legislation with engine developments, which is very costly for the industry,\" Johannesson said. \"You have to have a large economies-of-scale to handle the increased costs.\" \u001d  In 2000, heavy-duty diesel vehicles contributed 21% of land-based NOx emissions and 7% of particulate emissions in the 15 E.U. member states at that time. Despite expected growth of 50% in road traffic between 2000 and 2020, the European Commission forecasts NOx emissions will fall to 18% of the E.U. total and particulates will drop to 1% of the E.U. total by 2020, as the tough new standards kick in and older vehicles leave the road. \u001d  The U.S. and Japan are also putting tight caps on emissions. The U.S. introduced standards on Jan. 1 that will be gradually phased in until 2010. Japan will reduce emission levels further in 2010. Both countries' future limits will be tighter than the Euro 5 levels. Euro 5 is the second-strictest level in the E.U.'s gradually tightening system for emissions. \u001d  Greening estimates that Euro 6 standards will cost the European truck makers about EUR2.3 billion a year by 2020, mostly because of the extra spending on hardware and R&D. Currently, total sales in the European truck industry amount to around EUR70 billion a year. In the E.U., trucks carried 44% of the bloc's inland freight in 2005, the last full year of statistics from ACEA. \u001d  Germany's DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX), the world's leading truck maker with more than half a million Mercedes-Benz and Freightliner trucks sold in 2006, spent EUR1.02 billion research and development in its truck division in 2006, up 8% from EUR944 million in 2005. A company spokeswoman said a big chunk of that spending is to meet the tightening emissions standards. Though the company recently sold off its Chrysler unit, the truck-maker continues to be known by the combined name, pending the completion of the sale to private equity group Cerberus Capital Management. \u001d  Volvo, the world's second-largest truck maker, spent 8.35 billion Swedish kronor, or around EUR903 million, on research and development in 2006, an 11% increase from 2005. In the first three months of 2007, it spent SEK2.33 billion, 20% more than the same period in 2006. In addition to the Volvo brand, the company makes Renault and Mack-branded trucks. \u001d  \"In many cities, the air coming out of Euro 5 and Euro 6 (engines) is cleaner than the air coming into them,\" Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson said in June. \u001d  To meet the new standards, DaimlerChrysler and Volvo are developing engine systems that use urea-based chemicals in a separate storage tank to reduce harmful exhaust gases. Proponents of this system - known as selective catalytic reduction, or SCR - say it is more fuel efficient, and widely available in Europe. But it does add weight to the truck and adds to the cost of filling the tank. \u001d  Mid-size European manufacturers, such as Sweden's Scania AB (SCV-A.SK) and Germany's MAN AG (MAN.XE), back an alternative called exhaust gas recirculation, though they also make trucks using the SCR system. Their system reduces emissions by cooling the combustion temperature using recycled exhaust gas. It doesn't use additives, but fuel efficiency is slightly lower. \u001d  DaimlerChrysler and Volvo also make gas-recirculation engines for North America because there's no distribution network there for the fuel additives used in the SCR system. \u001d  \"More than 50% of spending on engine development has been to try to meet emission standards,\" Scania spokesman Hans-Ake Danielsson said. \"The technical challenge is significant. As soon as Germany introduces Maut for Euro 6, we'll be ready for it.\" \b \u001d  -By Adam Ewing, Dow Jones Newswires; +46 8 545 130 95; adam.ewing@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 00:00 ET (04:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"229e7e5a56665ad513793fed5964a1ec","symR":["GASS"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9528205],"ret5":[0.9461538],"Headline":"StealthGas In New Time Charter Pacts, Extends Current Pacts","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GASS"],"IndustryCodes":["MAR"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:39 ET (13:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"22af810cfa35e24c55323dee74f26d2b","symR":["BBD.A.T","BBD.B.T","BDRBF","CA0977511017","CA0977512007"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,1.012581,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,1.046774,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Bombardier Wins 82 Million Euro Order from SNCF for 19 Additional High-Capacity AGC Trains","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BBD.A.T","BBD.B.T","BDRBF","CA0977511017","CA0977512007"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  BERLIN, GERMANY -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 07/06/07 -- \u001d   Bombardier Transportation announced today that it has received an additional order for 19 high-capacity AGC type (Autorail Grande Capacite) trains from the French National Railways (SNCF).

(OTCBB:GDTI), innovators of groundbreaking threat detection technology with critical and immediate applications for the homeland security and healthcare markets, has announced its Strategic Initiatives for fiscal 2007 and beyond. This announcement was made by William Donovan, President and Chief Operating Officer of Guardian Technologies International. \b \u001d  Guardian's strategy capitalizes on the increasing global demand for products and services that promote health and safety through cutting-edge threat detection technologies that enable x-ray scanners, medical MRIs and other advanced imaging technologies to not just \"see\" the contents of scanned objects, but to identify potential compound and physiological makeup. The Company's three-part, highly-focused plan consists of: \b \b   1. Significantly driving shareholder value through a high-margin, \b        high-growth business model that capitalizes on \b        market-disruptive technologies \b \b   2. Continue aggressive commercialization of next generation threat \b        detection technology for global multibillion dollar homeland \b        security markets \b \b   3. Continue aggressive development and commercialization of \b        advanced disease detection technology for multibillion dollar \b        healthcare and medical imaging markets \b \u001d  Mr. Donovan said, \"Guardian has entered a new era with unprecedented opportunities for growth. We continue to see the results of our robust and highly-efficient commercialization strategy and follow through on our strategic goals. We strongly believe that the proprietary technology we have developed has immediate and profound applications and that over the next 12 to 24 months we will continue to gain new customers and ultimately solid revenues.\" \b \u001d  Strategic Initiative 1--Significantly drive shareholder value through a high-margin, high-growth business model that capitalizes on market-disruptive technologies \b \u001d  Guardian's overriding commitment to shareholder value has long been a tenet of the Company's overall corporate vision. To this end, the Company has identified a two year opportunity pipeline in excess of $150 million. Cooperative research and development agreements with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other key government and private agencies have already begun to move to the next stage. Additionally, limited new security technologies have been introduced into airport security checkpoint procedures since the 1980s, Guardian believes that the Company's next generation products are well positioned to fill that void. \b \u001d  Mr. Donovan said, \"Guardian is firmly committed to doing everything in our power to build both immediate and long-term value for our shareholders. As our current investors have already seen, Guardian has a proven ability to execute its strategic business model.\" \b \u001d  Strategic Initiative 2--Continue aggressive commercialization of next generation threat detection technology for global multibillion dollar homeland security markets \b \u001d  Background: Guardian has developed and is currently opening up major international markets for its homeland security-focused PinPoint(TM) product. PinPoint enhances current-generation security x-ray scanners with the ability to autonomously determine the actual chemical composition of items viewed rather than relying on human operator vigilance and interpretation. Put simply, Guardian's technology can automatically alert security officers to the presence of explosives or other dangerous substances hidden in baggage. No other existing technology can do this. \b \u001d  This initiative has already seen substantial real-world market success, including: \b \b   --  June 29, 2007--Guardian announced the completion of its first \b        commercial contract for PinPoint. The milestone contract was \b        signed with a high-profile Russian security organization. \b \b   --  June 27, 2007--Guardian announced the successful completion of \b        a milestone test that effectively accelerates the \b        commercialization of PinPoint in the lucrative Russian market. \b \b   --  June 22, 2007--Guardian announced a milestone patent filing \b        for its advanced threat detection technology. The patent wraps \b        additional technological imaging advancements around its \b        existing eleven patents. \b \u001d  Mr. Donovan said, \"We are very excited about our recent developments in Russia in particular. We believe that once PinPoint is being actively used in real-world, high-pressure situations that we will be able to significantly accelerate our commercialization initiatives across other major markets around the globe.\" \b \u001d  Strategic Initiative 3--Continue aggressive development and commercialization of advanced disease detection technology for multibillion dollar healthcare and medical imaging markets \b \u001d  Background: Existing medical imaging devices used in Computer Aided Detection (CAD) are further improved with Guardian's auto-diagnostic ability to detect anomalous tissue (e.g., tumors) and other potential disease states or conditions. This technology can detect tumors smaller than those a radiologist can see with the naked eye, enabling earlier treatment and potentially increasing survival rates. \b \u001d  This initiative has also already seen substantial real-world market success, including: \b \b   --  June 22, 2007--Guardian announced a milestone patent filing \b        for its advanced threat detection technology. The patent wraps \b        additional technological imaging advancements around its \b        existing eleven patents. \b \b   --  April 26, 2007--Guardian signed a collaboration and strategic \b        alliance agreement with Confirma, a market leader for CAD \b        systems for breast MRIs. \b \b   --  April 3, 2007--Guardian announced that a recent clinical \b        survey showed that employing the Company's Signature \b        Mapping(TM) demonstrated its ability to detect and \b        characterize tumors in screening mammograms. \b \u001d  Mr. Donovan said, \"We are particularly excited about all of the milestones we have accomplished for healthcare industry product Signature Mapping. Not only do we believe that our product can potentially help save thousands of lives with earlier disease detections, we also believe that this market sector could be particularly valuable for our Company and for our investors.\" \b \b   Summary \b \u001d  Guardian optimizes the risk and reward profile of its business model by continuing to develop multiple revenue streams through targeting two multibillion dollar markets, the fast-growing homeland security industry and the vital healthcare industry. Managing risk is an important issue in our industries, and we are very careful never to over-expose our products, or to dilute our overall equity. Additionally, we believe that Guardian has positioned itself to enter this new era of growth at the right time, in the right markets and with the right products, which we believe is a testament to Guardian's compelling value proposition. \b \b   About Guardian Technologies International \b \u001d  The impact of Guardian's industry-first computer aided detection technologies are immediate and profound for helping to eliminate human error in both the Homeland Security and the Medical Industry sectors. The Company's software solutions can be seamlessly installed to complement existing imaging devices, such as baggage scanners and medical MRI, to scan the contents of any image and immediately identify items of interest not easily discernable by the human eye. \b \b   --  Airport Security: Guardian's technology complements and \b        enhances current-generation baggage x-ray scanners with the \b        ability to automatically and effectively detect, locate, and \b        identify explosives and other types of threats. \b \b   --  Disease Identification: Existing medical imaging devices used \b        in Computer Aided Detection (CAD) are further improved with \b        Guardian's auto-diagnostic ability to detect anomalous tissue \b        (e.g., tumors) and other potential disease states or \b        conditions. \b \b   --  Technology-Independence: Because Guardian's technologies \b        utilize and process the actual image output generated by the \b        original imaging systems, virtually any existing or future \b        imaging device can be upgraded with Guardian's products, \b        delivering an instant, multi-billion dollar potential customer \b        base with no competition. \b \u001d  Guardian's technology and product development partnerships include a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRDA) with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security - Science and Technology Directorate.

J&F I Finance Co. will be merged with and into Swift & Co. \u001d  At the same time, Standard & Poor's revised the CreditWatch implications of all ratings on Swift, including the 'B' corporate credit rating, to positive from developing, where they were placed on May 29, 2007, following JBS S.A.'s (JBS; B+/Watch Neg/--) announcement that its holding company J&F Participacoes (J&F; not rated) had signed an agreement for the acquisition of 100% of U.S.-based Swift for $1.4 billion (enterprise value). \u001d  All ratings on J&F I Finance are placed on CreditWatch with positive implications, meaning the ratings may be raised or affirmed following the completion of Standard & Poor's review. The ratings on Brazil-based meat processing company JBS remain on CreditWatch with negative implications, where they were placed on May 29, 2007 following the Swift acquisition announcement. \u001d  Proceeds from the proposed notes offerings will be used to finance the acquisition of Swift, along with $500 million of equity from J&F, and approximately $300 million-$400 million of borrowings on Swift's proposed $700 million asset-based revolving credit facility (unrated), which matures in May 2012. \u001d  Pro forma for the transaction, rated debt at Swift will be approximately $600 million. \u001d  Although Swift is being acquired by J&F I Finance, a subsidiary of J&F, Standard & Poor's views JBS and Swift as one economic entity given the common ownership, management, and lines of businesses of the two companies, the consolidation of the Swift brand under one owner, and the willingness of its owners to contribute $500 million of equity to complete this transaction. \"We believe that the new owners will face some challenges in acquiring Swift given its very weak performance of the last several years due to mad cow disease, its low margins, the highly competitive operating environment, and the inherent differences of the U.S. market,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Jayne Ross. \u001d  The resolution of the CreditWatch will depend on the final acquisition and funding details, including the ultimate capitalization structure at Swift and JBS. The Swift ratings could be raised to 'B+' and equalized with JBS, and JBS' ratings would be affirmed if significant additional equity is contributed to the transaction, for example as a result of the announced commitment to JBS from BNDES Participacoes S.A. for up to R$1.46 billion (approximately US$750 million) and a commitment from J&F for up to R$390 million (approximately US$200 million). Upon closing of the new financing transaction, Standard & Poor's existing senior unsecured and subordinated debt ratings on Swift will be withdrawn when these notes get repaid. \u001d  \"We will resolve the CreditWatch listings for both Swift and JBS upon closing of the acquisition and completion of the financing,\" said Ms. Ross. \"Any further significant change in financing details could result in a revision of these proposed ratings at both Swift and JBS.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:15 ET (17:15 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"244ba43430dfe5ba31bb86f1efbe2743","symR":["BOT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"CBOT Holdings Cl A (BOT) Ind: 209.0-213.0 Last 206.15","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BOT"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:30 ET (13:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2452b852fe2fcdb15b4feba464fc1681","symR":["PHLY"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Philadelphia Consolidated Holding Corp.

Healthy fundamentals at both companies help make the transaction 3% GAAP earnings accretive in 2009, Chen says. In the shorter-term, Chen sees the deal as 1% GAAP earnings dilutive next year. Assuming the merger goes through, Chen's updated 2008 pro-forma EPS estimate is at $19.05, from $19.55. He increased his pro-forma 12-month price target to $645, from $650. CBOT hits all-time high of $218.00. Recently at $217.52, up 5.5%. CME down a bit at $553.58.

Sept silver dipped below support around roughly $12.50 but quickly attracted buying, enabling this contract to also trade higher, Young says.

(ALS) \u001d  12:11 (Dow Jones) The euro has broken through Y168 against the yen for the first time as it continues to hit new all-time highs against Japan's currency. Carry trades are driving the euro's rise, as investors borrow yen at cheap interest rates to buy euros that pay higher returns. ECB's rate is 4.0%, while the BOJ's is 0.50%. Recently, the euro was at Y167.99 after earlier touching Y168.05. Late Thursday, it was at Y167.10.

Credit default swaps for both M and SHLD have widened this morning. M officials weren't immediately available for comment, and SHLD declines to comment. A couple of weeks ago, the rumor had been that Macy's was to be taken private for $52 a share by Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts, Goldman Sachs and Providence.

It saw its share of the European market increase 0.2% to 14.2% as demand for its Peugeot 207 and Citroen C4 Picasso models stabilized its performance in a tough European market. \u001d  Peugeot-Citroen said it expects \"to see continued improvement in market share\" in Western Europe in the second half of 2007, propelled by demand for the Peugeot 207 hatchback and CC models, the C4 Picasso and the Grand C4 Picasso. \u001d  The launches of Peugeot's 4007, 308, and 207 SW models as well as the Citroen C Crosser will also bolster demand, the company said. \u001d  Peugeot-Citroen's first-half sales figures outperformed those of local rival Renault SA (13190.FR) where vehicle sales fell 3.8% year-on-year. \u001d  \"The volumes are positive\" said Pierre-Yves Quemener, an analyst at Kepler Securities. But he noted that the figures are \"soft\" compared to those of German competitor Volkswagen AG (VLKAY). \u001d  Peugeot-Citroen is Europe's second-largest car producer in terms of unit sales after Volkswagen. \u001d  Quemener raised his target price for Peugeot-Citroen to EUR77 from EUR65 before the company disclosed its sales numbers. \u001d  He said he believes Chairman Christian Streiff could give an operating margin target of at least 4% for Peugeot-Citroen's car divisionbetween 2007 and 2010. \u001d  Streiff said in May that, when Peugeot-Citroen reports  its first-half results on July 25, he will give an indication on guidance for the second half, adding that in September, the company will be able to give earnings guidance through 2010. \u001d  At 1112 GMT, Peugeot-Citroen shares were up EUR2.76, or  4.5%, to EUR64.20, outperforming a higher overall market and making Peugeot-Citroen the biggest gainer in the CAC-40 index. \u001d  Peugeot-Citroen's vehicle sales in Western Europe dipped slightly in the first six months of 2007 to 1,234,000 from  1,235,200 a year earlier, while sales outside Western Europe were stable at 530,000 units. \u001d  \"The sales in Europe are holding up well,\" said Thierry Huon, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who rates the stock outperform. \u001d  The company said it forecasts \"sales growth\" outside Western Europe for 2007. \u001d  Peugeot-Citroen's two brands saw their share of first-half sales virtually unchanged. The company sold 1 million vehicles under the Peugeot brand and 764,000 Citroen-branded vehicles. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.psa-peugeot-citroen.com \b \u001d  By Jethro Mullen, Dow Jones Newswires; 33 1 4017 1738; jethro.mullen@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:27 ET (11:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2825b03679b6b19ca89c24d768d59b15","symR":["CME"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Chicago Mercanti (CME) Block: 18,700 Shrs At 558.25","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T17:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CME"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bCHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE HOLDINGS INC.

A survey of three market analysts had pegged second quarter earnings at between BRL304 million and BRL347.1 million. \u001d  The company reported second-quarter earnings per share of BRL0.31, up from BRL0.22 seen a year ago. \u001d  Aracruz attributed the rise in its net profits during the period, among other factors, to an increase in prices and sales volume of pulp. \u001d  \"Our big driver during the period was the huge pulp sales volume prompted by high international demand,\" Aracruz Chief Financial Officer Isac Zagury told Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  The company reported second-quarter revenues of BRL979.8 million, up 11% from BRL881.8 million in the comparable period a year ago. Revenues from pulp sales reached 941.4 million, up from BRL856 million seen in the second quarter of 2006. \u001d  Aracruz said its second-quarter 2007 sales of pulp reached 832,000 metric tons, up 15% from 722,000 tons from the second quarter of 2006. \u001d  Second-quarter pulp sales volume was a record, Aracruz said. Due to the high demand for pulp, the company said it increased pulp prices by 5% in the second quarter compared with a year ago. \u001d  Paper sales were 15,000 metric tons, up 7% from 14,000 tons seen in the year ago period. \u001d  Despite an 11% appreciation of the Brazilian real versus the U.S dollar in the 12 months through the end of the second quarter, Aracruz saw a positive impact of BRL71 million in its results because of hedge operations. \u001d  \"As we have our costs in Brazilian reals and our revenues, in large part, in dollars, we opted for hedge operations to neutralize losses from the local currency appreciation,\" Zagury said. \"We have seen that the strategy was right, and we posted a gain because of it.\" \u001d  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, rose 1% in the second quarter to BRL430 million. The company's Ebitda margin ended the second quarter at 44%, down from 48% in the second quarter of 2006. \u001d  The company's net debt increased slightly in the period. Net debt as of June 30 was BRL2.13 billion, compared with BRL2.12 billion as of March 31. \u001d  On Friday, Aracruz became the first publicly traded Brazilian company to report second-quarter 2007 earnings. \u001d  As of 1318 GMT, the company's preferred shares were up 0.31% at BRL13.13 on the Brazilian Stock Exchange. \b \u001d  -By Rogerio Jelmayer, Dow Jones Newswires; 55-11-3145 1480; rogerio.jelmayer@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:46 ET (13:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"28ccc4bfcd54632276657d3ef7ff2643","symR":["LOV"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1],"ret5":[0.9571429],"Headline":"Spark Networks(R) To Reorganize In The United States","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LOV"],"IndustryCodes":["CSV","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:52 ET (16:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"28e5e037cb4e7b0678ca3e68dad6d053","symR":["JNJ","US4781601046"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.009496,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.009818,-0.00099],"Headline":"Johnson & Johnso (JNJ) Block: 285,200 Shrs At 62.13","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JNJ","US4781601046"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","MDV","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bJOHNSON & JOHNSON \bLast trade NYSE: -0.15 at 62.13 on zero tick \bTrade vol:       285,200 =    3.8% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:     619,100 =    8.3% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:   2,522,488 =   20.4% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:       7,418,998 =   60.1% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:12,338,777 / Prev day +0.33 on 8,300,092 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2906cc0cf5df60c0fa32a21aa3e18e44","symR":["INOC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP MCMURPHY Surrenders 5,753 Of INNOTRAC CORPORATION >INOC-Amended","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T21:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["INOC"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 (Amended Filing) \b \bISSUER: INNOTRAC CORPORATION \bSYMBOL: INOC \b \bFILER: MCMURPHY JAMES R \bTITLE: Vice President \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b4/16/07            Surrender*               5,753       $2.82          $16,223 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 100,629 (Direct) \b \b  * - Insiders can surrender shares back to the company to pay taxes or cover \b      the cost of an option exercise. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

The Malibu Hybrid's appearance continues through the last out of one of MLB's highlights of the year. \b \u001d  Thanks to an affordable hybrid powertrain option, the all-new 2008 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid not only will be the most refined new midsize sedan in the neighborhood, but one of the most fuel-efficient, as well. Powered by the GM Hybrid System, the first-ever Malibu Hybrid delivers an EPA rating of 24 mpg city and 32 mpg highway -- a two-mpg increase over the non-hybrid four- cylinder model -- and will be Chevrolet value-priced, offering customers an affordable hybrid choice. \b \u001d  \"The beauty of the Chevy Malibu Hybrid is that customers don't have to choose between a stylish, expressive, fuel-saving sedan full of standard content and the gasoline that goes in the tank,\" said Chevrolet General Manager Ed Peper. \"The Malibu Hybrid's winning package of uncompromising design and fuel economy will help us assert leadership in the midsize sedan segment and meet the needs of Chevy customers.\" \b \u001d  Production of the Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid is scheduled to begin in October, with vehicles arriving in dealerships shortly thereafter. The system will be available as a powertrain option on the base LS model, which also features Electric Power Steering, Automatic Climate Control and the StabiliTrak electronic stability control system. \b \u001d  The GM Hybrid system featured on the Malibu Hybrid saves fuel by using sophisticated controls and software, as well as a unique, 36-volt electric motor/generator mated to GM Powertrain's 2.4L Ecotec VVT four-cylinder engine and Hydra-Matic 4T45 four-speed transmission. The GM Hybrid system maintains the vehicle's sporty feel and seamlessly reduces fuel consumption by: \b \b \b    --  Shutting off the engine when the vehicle is stopped, to minimize \b        idling \b    --  Restarting the engine promptly when the brake pedal is released \b    --  Enabling early fuel shut-off during vehicle deceleration \b    --  Capturing vehicle kinetic energy during deceleration through \b        regenerative braking to charge the advanced nickel metal hydride \b        battery \b    --  Performing intelligent battery charging when it is most efficient \b \b \u001d  The GM Hybrid system provides additional power, when required, during launch from the electric motor/generator. At wide-open throttle, such as during a passing maneuver, the system enhances acceleration by using the motor/generator to bolster the gasoline engine and achieve maximum power. \b \u001d  The GM Hybrid system also is designed to automatically maintain full accessory functionality -- including climate control -- when the vehicle is stopped, so that hybrid operation is seamless to the driver and passengers. The Malibu Hybrid delivers an appropriate balance of fuel economy and cabin comfort with an air conditioning system with two selectable modes. The Hybrid A/C mode favors more fuel-efficient performance by limiting the draw on the hybrid powertrain, while the normal mode provides maximum passenger comfort in hot climates and enhances defogging performance. \b \u001d  Malibu Hybrid models make a statement away from the gas pump, too, thanks to specific exterior appointments such as 16-inch low rolling resistance tires and unique hybrid badging. Inside, a special gauge cluster provides information and feedback about the hybrid powertrain's operation. \b \u001d  The 2008 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid is covered by GM's five-year / 100,000- mile powertrain warranty, the most comprehensive in the industry. In addition, the Malibu Hybrid's advanced nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery pack is covered by an eight-year / 100,000-mile warranty. \b \u001d  General Motors Corp. (NYSE: GM), the world's largest automaker, has been the annual global industry sales leader for 76 years. Founded in 1908, GM today employs about 280,000 people around the world. With global headquarters in Detroit, GM manufactures its cars and trucks in 33 countries.

The Decision focused on the determination of the deemed common equity level, a degree day (volume) forecast methodology, the EnergyLink(TM) program and Risk Management program that were the principal issues outstanding after a series of settlement agreements had been achieved in negotiations with intervenors. The OEB approved Enbridge's proposed weather forecasting methodology, an increase of 1% in the equity thickness component of its capital structure and directed that the EnergyLink and Risk Management programs be discontinued. \b \bThe impact of the OEB's Final Decision is to allow Enbridge Gas Distribution to recover an approximate additional amount of $18 million in its Final rates. The impact of these final rate changes will vary based on the amount of natural gas used. For the typical residential customer(i), the changes will result in an approximate increase of $8 per annum or 1.5 per cent on their total annual bill. \b \bThe issues covered by settlement agreements negotiated in December of 2006 and January of 2007 included the amount to be recovered in rates related to capital expenditures and the 'all other operating and maintenance' category of expense, as well as the inclusion of Demand Side Management program costs which had been determined in an earlier proceeding. Further negotiations yielded resolution to the customer care service provision and the customer information system replacement project costs as well as the proposal to allow third parties to access the customer bill and billing envelope inclusive of a revenue sharing proposal related to that access. \b \bIn January, 2007, the original settlement agreement allowed Enbridge to recover a portion of an expected deficiency in advance of the release of the OEB's Final Decision. Effective April 1, 2007, Enbridge received OEB approval to adjust its 2007 Interim rates to recover an annualized amount of $26 million. \b \bEnbridge Gas Distribution is Canada's largest natural gas distribution company and delivers natural gas to about 1.8 million customers in many Ontario communities including the GTA, Ottawa, Barrie and Niagara Falls. Enbridge Gas Distribution distributes gas in New York State through St. Lawrence Gas, in New Brunswick through Enbridge Gas New Brunswick and is affiliated with Gazifere in southwestern Quebec. Enbridge Gas Distribution is owned by Enbridge Inc., a Canadian-based leader in energy transportation and distribution. \b \b(i)A typical residential customer uses 3,064 cubic metres of natural gas a year for home and water heating. \b \b \b \b \b         FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT: \b \b         Enbridge Gas Distribution \b         Debbie Boukydis \b         Media \b         (416) 495-5682 \b         Email: debbie.boukydis@enbridge.com \b         or \b         Enbridge Gas Distribution \b         John Whelen \b         Investment Community \b         (403) 231-3944 \b         Email: john.whelen@enbridge.com \b         Website: www.enbridge.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 06:25 ET (10:25 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2c2c8f46c294111dd7ecd3bd561a7582","symR":["DLM"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Del Monte Foods Enriches the Lives of Chicago's Youth by Supporting Chef Art Smith's Common Threads Summer Camp 2007","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DLM"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b   More than 100 Children Thrive, Both In and Out of the Kitchen, as  the Common Threads Summer Camp Offers Cooking and Gardening Classes, \u001d       Movement Programs, Cultural Experiences, and Much More \bSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \u001d  Del Monte Foods (NYSE:DLM) is proud to announce its support of Common Threads Summer Camp 2007 -- a nonprofit organization founded in 2002 by Chef Art Smith that is committed to teaching underprivileged children about different cultures, as well as developing self-discipline and respect for others through classes on food and the arts.

He now has 30 days to appeal the sanction. \u001d  According to the SVS, Pinera bought 3 million Lan shares for about $18.7 million on July 24, 2006. \u001d  The earnings were publicly released later that day after the market closed. \u001d  Lan gained 2.6% that day and then another 4.5% the following session and many analysts increased their share price targets for Lan in the wake of the data. \u001d  Pinera's defense has repeatedly said the SVS investigation was politically motivated to hurt his presidential aspirations, an allegation Finance Minister Andres Velasco denied Friday. \u001d  \"I categorically rule that out...the securities superintendent runs an autonomous, prestigious and very serious institution,\" Velasco told Radio Duna. \u001d  The SVS also fined Juan Jose Cueto, another key Lan shareholder, some $57,000 for making a similar purchase. \u001d  Lan's share price was seemingly unaffected by the fine as it was down 1.0% at 1954 GMT, the same level it had been trading earlier in the session amid profit-taking.

(AQNT) has cleared an antitrust regulatory hurdle, the companies said Friday. \u001d  The Federal Trade Commission mandates a waiting period to review anticompetitive fallout from large mergers. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday, aQuantive said the waiting period passed without requests for further information from the FTC. \u001d  \"We're obviously pleased,\" said Tom Phillips, a spokesman for Seattle-based aQuantive. A shareholder meeting to vote on the sale of the company is scheduled for Aug. 9. \u001d  Phillips said aQuantive is still working out how the organization, which employs 2,560 people worldwide, with 662 in Seattle, will look after the buyout. \u001d  Microsoft's Live search engine lags far behind sites operated by Google Inc. (GOOG) and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) in the number of searches performed each month. As a result, Microsoft racks up far fewer dollars from the small text ads placed next to search results. \u001d  Microsoft's acquisition of aQuantive, announced in May, followed Google's announcement that it would pay $3.1 billion for online ad technology company DoubleClick Inc. Microsoft was reportedly interested in DoubleClick as well; aQuantive's ad-serving technology could help the Redmond-based software maker close the gap with Google. \u001d  Microsoft shares slipped 19 cents to $29.80 in recent trading, while aQuantive shares jumped 88 cents, or 1.4%, to $65.75. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:28 ET (18:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"33b002aeeb27bfb421ded3c8e5d7bf1c","symR":["BFTH"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE:Harbinger Grp Proposes Plan To Reorganize Bally >BFTH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BFTH"],"IndustryCodes":["RCS","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Adds details about the group's reorganization plan and bacgkround.) \b   By Jared A. Favole \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  A shareholder group led by hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners on Friday offered its own plan to restructure Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp. (BFTH), and said the troubled fitness chain should delay its bankruptcy proceedings. \u001d  The group's plan paves the way for Harbinger Capital to own 80% of a reorganized Bally and would give shareholders the ability to own the remaining 20%, according to a letter sent to Bally and included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u001d  Harbinger Capital teamed up with Liberation Investment Group, Bally's second-largest shareholder, to propose the plan, according to Friday's SEC filing. Together, the two entities beneficially own 4.6 million Bally shares, or an 11.2% stake in the Chicago-based company. \u001d  The group's proposed plan comes about a month after Bally announced that it would enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection amid higher expenses and weak profits. The fitness chain's own reorganization plan allows it to raise $77.5 million in new cash, and includes canceling existing equity, a sticking point with Liberation Investment. \u001d  The hedge fund has threatened to haul the fitness chain into bankruptcy court, claiming that Bally's pre-packaged bankruptcy plan was \"draconian\" as it cancels all existing equity. \u001d  The group led by Harbinger Capital said its plan offers shareholders a substantial amount of recovery and is undeniably superior to Bally's own plan. The group said its plan would also help Bally avoid litigation that would result if it continues with its own plan. \u001d  Harbinger Capital said the group made the proposed plan because representatives of Jefferies & Co., the financial advisor for Bally's debtors, indicated that they would be receptive to it. \u001d  The group's plan will pay holders of Bally's senior subordinated notes $60 million in cash in lieu of equity once the chain is reorganized. Holders of rejection and subordinated claims against Bally will receive full cash payments. \u001d  Under Bally's proposed plan, there would be a reduction in the principal outstanding on Bally's existing senior subordinated notes by $150 million by exchanging all existing senior subordinated notes for a new class of notes, common equity and the right to participate in a $77.5 million rights offering. \u001d  The group said it expects to finalize its plan before July 27, the deadline for Bally to solicit creditors' votes for its plan. \b \u001d  -Jared A.

\b   By Stefan Kloet \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--An Icelandic consortium led by Marel HF (MARL.IC) Friday said it wouldn't accept a EUR47-a-share offer for Dutch industrial conglomerate Stork NV (39067.AE) from Candover Investment PLC (CDI.LN). \u001d  The move makes the consortium, called LME, the second large shareholder to publicly come out against the bid by the U.K. investment firm, which would value Stork at EUR1.5 billion. \u001d  The Stork management and supervisory boards have recommended the Candover offer, which represents a 19% premium over Stork's average closing share price of EUR39.38 in the three months to June 19. \u001d  At 1039 GMT, Stork shares were down EUR0.41, or 0.9%, at EUR47.75. \u001d  Candover declined to comment other than to say that it noted Marel's statement and was carrying on with getting its bid ready. \u001d  The consortium, which consists of Landsbanki Islands, Marel Food Systems and Eyrir Invest, said in its statement that it is now the single largest shareholder in Stork, with about 19.5% of the shares of the Dutch company. \u001d  LME said there is more room for value creation within Stork and that it has shared its opinion with other large shareholders of Stork. \u001d  Aviva PLC (AV.LN), which holds a 5.14% Stork stake, has already said that it wouldn't tender its shares to Candover. \u001d  \"The offer is simply too low,\" asset manager Alex Otto of Dutch Aviva-subsidiary Delta Lloyd told Dow Jones Newswires, adding that Aviva wouldn't tender its shares unless a bid would come in \"at least 10% higher.\" \u001d  Stork management has been under pressure for more than a year from hedge funds U.K.-based Centaurus Capital Ltd. and U.S.-based Paulson & Co., which have sought a breakup of the company. The funds have said that Stork should focus on its aerospace division, as this would generate more value for shareholders. \u001d  The company's aerospace operations make parts for cockpits and wings for customers, including Dassault Systemes SA (13065.AE), Airbus and Boeing Co. (BA). The other Stork units are food systems and technical services.

Some people think that if pushed, non-doms could simply run off to other tax havens, such as Switzerland. \u001d  This ignores an important fact: In Switzerland, tax exiles do pay tax. In fact, the Swiss system could be a useful model for the U.K. Each year the country's non-doms are charged the equivalent of what it would cost to rent their homes for five months. So the bigger their houses, the more they pay. These non-doms may pay less tax than if they stayed in their original countries. But they still pour a decent amount into Swiss coffers. Although there are only 4,221 of them, they contribute 1.3% of direct national tax revenue, according to KPMG. \u001d  Why not adopt a \"residency tax\" for non-doms in the U.K.? One way of doing this would be to base it on rental values, as in Switzerland. Another would be to calculate it as a percentage of the value of their homes. Something like 2.5% would be roughly equivalent and probably do the trick. If somebody had a GBP 1 million ($2.02 million) house, they would pay GBP 25,000. The charge on a real top-notch residence -- like that owned by Lakshmi Mittal, the steel magnate -- would be a few million pounds a year. \u001d  One advantage of this solution to the non-dom tax break is that it would be relatively easy to police. Unlike offshore assets, houses are very visible -- and can't be moved around. Another advantage is that it is unlikely to drive many people offshore. The non-doms would still keep all of their foreign assets away from the U.K. taxman and avoid paying capital-gains or inheritance tax. \u001d  Yet another benefit is that it would probably raise a decent sum of money. The U.K. had 112,000 non-doms in 2005. If each paid GBP 25,000, the tax take would be GBP 2.8 billion -- enough to cut income taxes by just more than 2%. \u001d  Wouldn't such a tax drive down house prices? Well, yes. But that might not really be such a bad thing. After all, high house prices -- especially in central London, where the non-doms' tax breaks help crowd out the \"doms\" -- obviously aren't in the country's interest. \b \u001d  Chinese IPOs \b \u001d  \"One country, two systems\" is how Beijing describes China's relationship with Hong Kong. \"One company, two prices\" might be just as apt. On average, the share prices of dual-listed Chinese companies trade in Hong Kong at levels 42% lower than the very same companies' shares in Shanghai. Can investors profit from China's value gap? \u001d  The usual trade is to buy the undervalued share, short-sell the overvalued one, and wait for the prices to converge. But Chinese capital-account restrictions make it hard for investors to exploit this arbitrage in the usual way. So companies are doing it instead. \u001d  This year, Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies are expected to float in Shanghai in droves, raising some $50 billion, according to PriceWaterhouseCoopers' estimates. By raising cheap money on the mainland, where their shares are more likely to trade at a premium, companies like PetroChina and China Mobile -- each of which plans to raise $6 billion this year -- can use the proceeds to buy real assets elsewhere. \u001d  Chinese regulators are encouraging that kind of move, which is another demonstration of their ability to play the capitalist game on their own terms. For one, it will help mop up the excess demand for stocks that created the valuation gap in the first place. It will also help boost the Hong Kong market -- just as the city celebrates the 10th anniversary of its handover by the British to China. \u001d  Not everyone is a winner, however. The first day share-price rise of companies listing in Shanghai this year has often been as much as 100%. Take China Cosco Holdings, China's biggest shipping firm. When it listed in Shanghai last month, its shares rose 93% on the first day -- and have since traded up more. If all of this year's IPOs were so underpriced, the foregone capital gains to the Chinese state would be enough to fund the country's rural education program for more than 10 years. In this arbitrage, at least, Beijing is treating foreign speculators and the local poor in an even-handed way. \b \u001d  Spanish networks \b \u001d  In Spain, knowing the right people, otherwise known as enchufe, is essential for getting ahead. That's fine as far as everyday life is concerned but not when the practice extends to the country's supposedly independent regulators. \u001d  The European Commission has just found Telefonica, Spain's incumbent telecom operator, guilty of illegally freezing out rivals from the lucrative broadband market by charging too much to access its network. Because those charges are set by the Spanish telecom regulator, the CMT, Brussels is essentially accusing the watchdog of favoring the national champion. \u001d  This is becoming something of a habit among Spanish regulatory bodies. Brussels already castigated the energy regulator for throwing obstacles in the way of German utility E.On's ultimately failed bid to take over Spain's biggest utility, Endesa. The CNE imposed 19 conditions on E.On's bid, most of which were later declared illegal by Brussels. \u001d  Meanwhile, the former head of the stock-market regulator, Manuel Conthe, accused the government of compromising the watchdog's independence by pressuring it to favor a rival bid for Endesa by Italy's Enel and Spanish construction firm Acciona. E.On's mistake was trying to bulldoze its way into the Spanish energy market without having any enchufe. Enel and Acciona, which had plenty, got together to bid -- and won. \u001d  Spain is hardly alone in the use of enchufe. Other European so-called independent institutions have also moved to protect national champions. The Italian equivalent of having enchufe is to be raccomandato. But two wrongs don't make a right. Spain has recently emerged as a powerful economy. This is despite, rather than because of, its regulation. In the future, it needs open competition policed by fair watchdogs. Not enchufe. \u001d  -- Hugo Dixon, John Paul Rathbone and Fiona Maharg Bravo \u001d  --- \u001d  For more commentary, go to www.breakingviews.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 00:30 ET (04:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"353d6836bdcb7899ab225fc8364ea518","symR":["GE","US3696041033"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.003638,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.057952,-0.00099],"Headline":"General Electric (GE) Block: 588,800 Shrs At 38.48","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GE","US3696041033"],"IndustryCodes":["IDD","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bGENERAL ELECTRIC CO \bLast trade NYSE: -0.06 at 38.48 on zero tick \bTrade vol:       588,800 =    2.2% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   5,886,700 =   22.4% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:   9,725,225 =   26.5% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:      26,259,192 =   71.4% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:36,754,400 / Prev day -0.16 on 25,969,148 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"357e3038bc9a832fcc81bc79cfcf6d47","symR":["MCV.VH","VN000A0MLVG6"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Cavico Corporation Awarded Construction Contract Valued at US $3.75 M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MCV.VH","VN000A0MLVG6"],"IndustryCodes":["CON"],"Story":"\bCavico Corporation Awarded Construction Contract Valued at US $3.75 M \b \bLOS ANGELES & HANOI, Vietnam--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \b   Cavico Corporation announced today it has been awarded a contract \bvalued at US $3.75 million to build the access and service road for \bDambri Hydropower plant.

Juan Carlos Romero last week ordered the provincial power distributor EDESA SA to ignore the instructions from Cammesa. \u001d  Salta is a relatively small province, so its power demand isn't overly significant. But some analysts worry that the rebellion sets a precedent. \b   Brazil Does Argentina A Favor \u001d  In Brazil, the political decision to help Argentina overcome these problems with an increase in electricity transfers was made earlier in the week. However, Mines and Energy Ministry technicians had to verify that transmission lines could take the extra load. \u001d  According to the ministry spokesman, Brazilian exports can't expand beyond the 1,050 average MW level because of the limitations of the transmission lines connecting the neighboring grids. \u001d  According to a report in the local O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper Wednesday, the energy will probably come from oil- and coal-fired thermoelectric plants in the southeast of the country. Argentina will pay for the generation and transmission of the energy. \u001d  Investment in Argentina's electricity-generating capacity hasn't kept pace with economic growth, which has topped 8% for the past four-and-a-half years. As a result, Argentina faces energy shortages. \u001d  The related decision to transfer Brazil's rights to one million cubic meters of gas from Bolivia to Argentina will also be considerable value to its southern neighbor. According to the Brazilian Mines and Energy Ministry official, the transfer was approved by Bolivian Hydrocarbons Minister Carlos Villegas. \u001d  The shortfalls in Bolivian gas supply have added to the strain on Argentina's already-stretched energy grid. More than half of the latter's power capacity comes from generators that are either entirely gas-fired or run combined-cycle turbines. \u001d  Brazilian state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR), or Petrobras, has a contract to receive up to 30 million cubic meters of gas a day from Bolivia. That contract takes priority over the contract that the Andean country has with Argentina. \u001d  Currently, Petrobras only needs between 26 million and 29 million cubic meters a day. \u001d  After his meeting with Kirchner in Buenos Aires late Wednesday, Garcia Linera said his country's gas commitments to Argentina were \"guaranteed.\" \u001d  This comment appeared to refer not to the current contract for 7.7 million cubic meters a day but an agreement to add an additional 20 million cubic meters a day by 2012. The first phase of that expansion is due to come on line in 2009. \u001d  Garcia Linera said that if private companies were unable to complete the required infrastructure improvements to fulfill this commitment, both countries' state-owned energy companies - Argentina's Enarsa and Bolivia's Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales de Bolivia - will \"take responsiblity\" for the projects. \u001d  -By Alastair Stewart and Michael Casey, Dow Jones Newswires; 55-11 3145-1479; Alastair.stewart@dowjones.com; michael.j.casey@dowjones.com; 54-11-4313 1918 \u001d  (Bernd Radowitz contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"362d505551ce4383238d8ff8f83f114f","symR":["MEO.XE","DE0007257503"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Metro: Tax Reform To Cause EUR160M-180M Non-Cash Tax Expense","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T09:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MEO.XE","DE0007257503"],"IndustryCodes":["RTB","RTS","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--The German corporate tax reform will lead to additional, non-cash effective tax expenses of between EUR160 million to EUR180 million in the third quarter, Metro AG (MEO.XE) said Friday. \u001d  The planned reduction of the income tax rates, as part of the German corporate tax reform, necessitates a revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities. \u001d  Presumably this will lead to an extraordinary, additional, non-cash effective tax expense in the range of about EUR160 million to EUR180 million for Metro Group in the third quarter. \u001d  Metro Group's earnings outlook is based upon earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, and remains thus unaffected. \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 05:56 ET (09:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"364a497b7aa08a3cbc313d5f8b5ad6ab","symR":["TGT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9797357],"ret5":[1.006167],"Headline":"Target Corp (TGT) Mkt On Close Buy Imbalance: Shrs 219300","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TGT"],"IndustryCodes":["RTB","RTS","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:40 ET (19:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"365fab15e22cd0f6ede0e9b4473be694","symR":["BFTH"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Bally Total Fitness Confirms Receipt of Alternate Restructuring Proposal","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BFTH"],"IndustryCodes":["RCS","XRUS"],"Story":"COMPANY CONTINUES TO SOLICIT CONSENTS FOR ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED PREPACKAGED PLAN OF REORGANIZATION \b \b \u001d  CHICAGO, July 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Bally Total Fitness (OTC Bulletin Board: BFTH), today announced that its Board of Directors has received a letter from current shareholders Liberation Investments, L.P., Liberation Investments, Ltd., Harbinger Capital Partners Master Fund I, Ltd. and Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations Fund L.P., which proposes an alternate chapter 11 plan of reorganization for the Company.

A)) means Verizon Wireless customers in the area can access the company's high-speed wireless network and enjoy two prime services: BroadbandAccess, the company's enhanced high-speed wireless service, with average user speeds of 600 kilobits per second (kbps) to 1.4 megabits, geared toward mobile professionals, business customers and vacationers; and V CAST, a consumer-oriented multimedia service that offers music and short content on demand, including cutting-edge 3D games, music videos, news, weather and sports. \b \u001d  The network expansion equips Verizon Wireless' business customers, including attendees of the upcoming NGA Meeting at the Grand Traverse Resort, to experience a truly untethered mobile office experience, enabling them to wirelessly access their calendars, the Internet, email and critical business information residing behind their companies' firewalls. Vacationers can surf the Internet and email friends and family members from the beach along the southern portion of Grand Traverse Bay or while tooling around the Cherry Festival. \b \u001d  With the added benefit of V CAST, consumers also now have access to the most comprehensive selection of downloadable music, high-quality videos and the coolest 3D games found anywhere. \b \b    BroadbandAccess \b \u001d  BroadbandAccess provides mobile workers the ability to get their corporate information as if they were attached to the information via a high-speed wired connection but with the freedom of true mobility. Developed with a range of users in mind, the service enables large enterprises, small to medium-sized businesses and mobile professionals to conduct business anytime, anywhere in the BroadbandAccess coverage area via a secure, true high-speed data connection. \b \u001d  Business customers, residents and vacationers can access information when they are on the road with BroadbandAccess. Customers in enhanced broadband wireless coverage areas can expect average download speeds of 600 kilobits per second (kbps) to 1.4 megabits and average upload speeds of 500-800 kbps, which means customers can download a 1 Megabyte email attachment-the equivalent of a small PowerPoint(R) presentation or a large PDF file-in less than 15 seconds and upload the same-sized file in less than 25 seconds. The enhanced coverage areas enable Verizon Wireless customers to download files approximately six times faster than customers of wireless service providers who use non-EV-DO technology. Also, customers who travel outside the enhanced BroadbandAccess coverage area with an EV-DO device will switch seamlessly to the company's NationalAccess service. \b \u001d  \"Our enhanced BroadbandAccess service gives our customers three key advantages in wireless communication-speed, mobility and security,\" said Greg Haller, president-Michigan/Indiana/Kentucky Region, Verizon Wireless. \"With these advantages comes an increase in productivity and bottom-line business benefits.\" \b \b    V CAST \b \u001d  The company's high-speed network also enables its V CAST multimedia services, offering customers the ability to download full song tracks, play cutting-edge 3D games and stream video clips straight to the handset with top transmission speeds. With content updated daily, customers can watch dozens of on-demand videos, including breaking news, weather, sports highlights and the hottest entertainment clips. \b \u001d  V CAST Music, available to customers with V CAST Music-enabled handsets, is the world's most comprehensive, over-the-air mobile music service. Customers with V CAST Music can download song tracks directly to their Verizon Wireless handsets or to PCs equipped with Windows(R) XP operating software. The V CAST Music on demand service includes access to a catalog of more than 2 million songs. \b \b    Coverage \b \u001d  Verizon Wireless' expansion of BroadbandAccess and V CAST coverage includes much of the Grand Traverse Bay area, including downtown, the Grand Traverse Resort, Cherry Capital Airport, Traverse City State Park, Acme, Bates, Grawn and Grelickville. It also includes the following major roads: \b \b \b    -- US Route 31 between Grawn and Yuba \b    -- Michigan Highway 72 between Williamsburg and County Road 616 \b    -- Michigan Highway 37 between Michigan Road 113 North to the south end of \b       Old Mission Peninsula \b \b \u001d  \"Traverse City is a vital market with dynamic, tech-savvy businesses and vacationers who want to stay connected,\" Haller said. \"The launch of our broadband network here provides our customers with access to the very latest wireless technology.\" \b \u001d  The multi-million dollar expansion entailed installing high-tech wireless hardware and software in wireless transmission sites throughout the region. It is part of an ongoing network investment by Verizon Wireless that has totaled $39 billion nationally in the last seven years-$5 billion on average every year since the company was formed-to increase the coverage and capacity of its national network and to add new services. More than $915 million of this investment was spent in Michigan. \b \u001d  Verizon Wireless was the first national wireless provider to commercially launch a high-speed wireless broadband network in the United States. Traverse City is the latest markets to be added to Verizon Wireless' EV-DO network coverage area, now available to more than 210 million people. In Michigan, Verizon Wireless' broadband network is also available in southeastern Michigan; the greater Flint area; the greater Lansing area; and West Michigan, including Grand Rapids, Holland and many surrounding communities. \b \u001d  BroadbandAccess is available for $79.99 monthly access with a new one- or two-year customer agreement. For a limited time, Verizon Wireless customers with an existing voice plan can receive unlimited BroadbandAccess service for $59.99 monthly access. A new two-year customer agreement is required. BroadbandAccess service also is available as an integrated option on select notebook and laptop computers. \b \u001d  For more information about Verizon Wireless products and services, call 1- 800-2 JOIN IN or go to www.verizonwireless.com. \b \b    About Verizon Wireless \b \u001d  Verizon Wireless operates the nation's most reliable wireless voice and data network, serving 60.7 million customers.

(6502.TO) has agreed to sell a 10% interest in U.S. nuclear reactor manufacturer Westinghouse Electric Co. to a Kazakh state-run resources company as part of efforts to secure uranium, The Nikkei reported in its Saturday morning edition. \u001d  Toshiba, which currently holds a 77% stake in Westinghouse, will sign an agreement as early as this month to sell 10% to Kazatomprom for slightly more than Y60 billion. Kazakhstan has the world's second-largest uranium reserves, accounting for about 20% of the global total. \u001d  U.S. government approval is required for transactions in which a foreign entity takes a stake in an American business possessing nuclear technology. U.S. officials are said to have indicated that the deal poses no problems. \u001d  Securing uranium, which is used as a nuclear fuel, is a challenge in the face of rapidly growing global energy demand. Over the next two decades, 150 nuclear reactors are expected to be built around the world, many of them in China and India. In the U.S. alone, plans are in place to construct about 30 nuclear reactors by 2020. \u001d  By having Kazatomprom in its alliance and securing a long-term supply of uranium, Toshiba expects to win more orders from power companies in the U.S. and elsewhere. \u001d  The tie-up will help Kazatomprom expand its sales channels worldwide and accelerate mining projects. Toshiba and Westinghouse are expected to transfer uranium-processing technology to Kazatomprom as well. \u001d  Japan now procures uranium mainly from Australia and Canada. But amid concerns about a supply shortage, it has decided to strengthen ties with Kazakhstan. The two countries announced a joint statement on cooperation in uranium-processing technology and trade when the Japanese minister of economy, trade and industry, Akira Amari, visited Kazakhstan in April. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:19 ET (17:19 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"3919fb0a848bb83d5f828ef84723584c","symR":["IWV"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.001352],"ret5":[1.010707],"Headline":"iShrRu3000 (IWV) Block: 133,500 Shrs At 88.76","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IWV"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\bISHARES RUSSELL 3000 INDEX FUND \bLast trade  NMS: +0.38 at 88.76 on 0.04 downtick \bTrade vol:       133,500 =   36.3% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:     267,000 =   72.5% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:     149,169 =   42.2% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:         368,200 =  104.1% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:   353,866 / Prev day +0.02 on 162,900 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:46 ET (18:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"391a63be422df98bba98a5ac04b7837b","symR":["KFT","KFT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Kraft Foods Enters Bridge Facility Pact >KFT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KFT"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:37 ET (20:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3932114a7c9c67814b42bddd6058b535","symR":["TXCC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"TranSwitch Corp Announces The Completion Of The Exchange Of Certain Of Its 5.45% Convertible Plus Cash Notes Due 2007 For Its 5.45% Convertible Notes Due 2010","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T21:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TXCC"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 17:02 ET (21:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"393c9bc2ee138589f8a41bb1d58dea9b","symR":["KTF"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.993619],"ret5":[0.9917958],"Headline":": DWS Municipal Income Trust (KTF) Declares a Monthly Distribution","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T21:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KTF"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\bNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \u001d  DWS Municipal Income Trust (NYSE symbol: KTF) declared a monthly dividend of $0.048 per common share, payable on July 31, 2007 to shareholders of record on July 16, 2007. The Ex-date is July 12, 2007. The previous monthly dividend was $0.048 per share. \b \u001d  The current distribution rate represents a 5.26% annualized dividend yield based on the closing market price of $10.95 on July 5, 2007 and a 4.91% annualized dividend yield on a closing NAV of $11.72 on the same date. \b \u001d  Future earnings of the Fund can not be guaranteed and the Fund's dividend policy is subject to change. For more information on KTF please contact a representative at (800) 349.4281 or visit us on the web at www.cef.dws-scudder.com. \b \u001d  Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Annualized dividend yield is the latest monthly dividend shown as an annualized percentage of net asset value/market price at month end. Annualized dividend yield simply measures the level of dividends and is not a complete measure of performance. Market price, annualized dividend yield, net asset value are historical and will fluctuate and do not guarantee future results. \b \b    NOT FDIC/ NCUA INSURED -- MAY LOSE VALUE -- NO BANK GUARANTEE \b    NOT A DEPOSIT -- NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY \b \u001d  DWS Municipal Income Trust seeks to provide high current income exempt from federal income tax by investing in a diversified portfolio of investment-grade tax-exempt securities. \b \u001d  The fund invests in individual bonds whose yields and market values fluctuate, so that your investment may be worth more or less than its original cost. Additionally, although the fund seeks income that is federally tax-free, a portion of the fund's distributions may be subject to federal, state, local and alternative minimum tax. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate risk such that when interest rates rise, the prices of the bonds, and thus the value of the bond fund, can decline and the investor can lose principal value. \b \u001d  Investments in closed-end funds involve risk. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering, and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.

Based on the closing price of the company's Class A shares on July 4, 2007, the dividend represents an annualized yield of approximately 5.5% percent. \b \b \b    << \b    Fiscal 2007 Third Quarter Highlights \b \b    -   Operating revenue(1) increased 8.2% \b    -   New business bookings increased 40% \b    -   Hired 3 new search professionals, including a new Managing Partner in \b        Calgary, as part of the Company's growth strategy, at the expense of \b        net operating income \b    -   115% increase in investment income \b    >> \b \b \bFinancial Results \b \bThird Quarter Ended May 31, 2007 \b \bFor the three months ended May 31, 2007, operating revenue(1) increased 8.2% to $3,568,119 compared to operating revenue(1) $3,298,409, in the third quarter a year ago. \b \b\"As we execute our growth strategy and invest in building our team of search professionals, we will incur additional costs that will have an adverse affect on our margins and net earnings in the near term. However, as our new partners and professional staff ramp up their utilization rates and add revenue, we expect revenue growth and margin enhancement over the longer term,\" said C. Douglas Caldwell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \b \bExpenses have been impacted by litigation costs, associated with the company's defense of a statement of claim brought against the company, and the planned investment in new search professionals. This resulted in total expenses, including variable and fixed compensation, general and administration, and amortization, increasing to $3,906,520 from $2,911,658 for the same period in the previous year. \b \bLitigation and legal fees in the third quarter of 2007 jumped to $307,672 from $51,909 in the same period of the previous year. Litigation fees together with the previously mentioned new hires and related compensation resulted in a third quarter operating loss(1) of $338,401, compared to operating income of $386,751 in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. \b \bInvestment income for the third quarter of 2007 more than doubled to $332,422 from $154,479 in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. \b \bOn an after tax basis, net earnings for the quarter were positive at $61,287, compared to $388,118 in the third quarter a year ago. \b \bNine Months Ended May 31, 2007 \b \bOperating revenue(1) for the nine months ended May 31, 2007 increased to $10,523,424, compared to $10,239,517 for the same period in fiscal 2006. Total expenses, including executive compensation, general and administrative, and amortization were $10,809,592 compared to $9,488,651 for the same period a year ago. \b \bEliminating the impact of increased litigation fees incurred in fiscal 2007 would result in an operating profit of $144,940 for the nine months ended May 31, 2007. Operating loss(1) for the first nine months of fiscal 2007 totaled $286,168 compared to operating income of $750,866 in the same period in 2006. \b \bInvestment income for the first nine months of 2007 increased to $625,291 from $483,374 in the corresponding period in 2006. In addition, there are currently unrealized portfolio gains of approximately $695,000. \b \bNet earnings for the nine months ended May 31, 2007, totalled $335,167, compared to $937,883 for the same period a year ago. \b \bAs at May 31, 2007, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $5,024,156 and marketable securities of $13,499,279. The company had no long-term debt as at May 31, 2007. \b \b(1) Operating revenue and operating income are non-GAAP measures, \b \bhowever, the company believes that they provide a useful understanding of \b \bthe performance of its core human capital services operations as they \b \bexclude income or loss from investments and taxes. \b \bAbout The Caldwell Partners \b \b=-------------------------- \b \bThe Caldwell Partners International Inc., founded in 1970, was Canada's first executive search firm.

The long term target of 7% is maintained. \u001d  For the Business area Cruise & Ferries in 2007, the EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 2.5% - 3%. Operating revenues in 2007 is expected to be at approximately NOK35 billion. \u001d  Sales of assets in the second quarter will have a positive effect, contributing to an estimated net result for Aker Yards in 2007 of NOK800 million - NOK900 million. \u001d  Aker Yards` shares in Aker Invest and Aker Oilfield Services have been sold to Aker Capital, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aker ASA, with a profit of approximately NOK260 million, which reflects a substantial growth in shareholder value during the past few years. \u001d  The main reason for the revised estimates lies in the heavy load in the Finnish operations, and is mainly related to the building of ferries. \u001d  The very high level of growth in activity level at the same time as the market is booming has lead to a lack of resources giving a knock-on effect on the total backlog of ferries. The number of ferries in the backlog in Finland is seven, of which five will be delivered in the next 12 months. \u001d  In addition, the suppliers of the shipyards are also experiencing a booming market, leading to higher prices than anticipated. This is giving a negative effect on most of the backlog in the business area Cruise & Ferries. \u001d  Yrjo Julin, President and CEO, said: \"We have decided it is correct to revise project estimates, primarily related to ferries based on the cost increases we see in the suppliers market, our tight delivery schedule, as well as the general high activity level in all areas of the value chain. \u001d  \"We have identified a set of immediate actions in order to rectify the situation, and the operating model in Finland will be re-evaluated, and a new structure will be in place soon.\" \u001d  As a result of the ongoing process in Finland, the second quarter results release for 2007 has been postponed to 24 August 2007. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:52 ET (06:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3bb188c952ced50567088d7d9b027ca6","symR":["AXT.YY","DGH.YY"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EU Clears Doughty Hanson To Buy Telecom Equipment Co AxCom-2","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T09:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AXT.YY","DGH.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["FDR","FIS","RTS"],"Story":"\b   AxCom is being bought from Axel Johnson International AB for an undisclosed sum.

However in a statement from both companies, CBOT Chairman Charles P. Carey said, \"I urge our shareholders and members to vote for the merger.\" \u001d  The Chicago exchanges repeatedly have said they believe they have enough shareholder backing to close the deal. \u001d  CME and CBOT first struck a merger agreement in October. IntercontinentalExchange, a rival derivatives market in Atlanta, made a bid in March for CBOT that has been consistently valued higher than CME's because of ICE's buoyant stock price. \u001d  Based on prices early Friday, ICE's $11.4 billion offer compares with the $11.3 billion bid, based on CME's revised offer. \u001d  CBOT shares recently rose 4.1% to $214.50, and CME shares were down 1.2% to $549.16. ICE shares were up 2.2% at $155.20. \u001d  ICE said in a letter Tuesday to top CBOT officials that it's willing to enter talks regarding potential enhancements to its merger proposal, including higher value for CBOT holders' exercise rights at the Chicago Board Options Exchange and an alternative integration plan. ICE also sent a signed copy of its merger proposal, and said it remains valid through July 12, three days after the vote is scheduled to occur. \u001d  -Aaron Lucchetti; aaron.lucchetti@wsj.com; 212-416-3705; and Josee Rose; josee.rose@dowjones.com; 201-938-5400 \u001d  (Jesse Thomas contributed to this report.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:04 ET (14:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3c53f48584b8bbf045765355c64c2b04","symR":["MTK.T","CA57681U1093"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Securely transfer real-time and historical data with the new MatrikonOPC Tunneller 3.0","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MTK.T","CA57681U1093"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  EDMONTON, July 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - MatrikonOPC(TM) is pleased to announce the release of the MatrikonOPC Tunneller(TM) 3.0 now including encryption and lossless data compression.

In previous incidents two young Nigerian children were taken from their families but returned unharmed. \u001d   When contacted by Dow Jones Newswires a spokesman for main insurgent group the Movement for the Emancipation for the Niger Delta, or MEND, denied responsibility for the kidnap branding it a \"callous\" act. Jomo Gbomo said the group has offered to help find the girl. \u001d  MEND, which initiated the trend of hostage-taking in early 2006, has since abandoned the practice and now concentrates on pipeline sabotage and attacking oil company facilities in order to disrupt the production and export of crude and the operation of Nigeria's oil industry. \u001d  Antoine Halff, analyst at FIMAT, agreed renewed attacks in the Delta don't bode well for the prospect of fledgling attempts at negotiations between Delta rebel militias and the new government of President Umaru Yar'Adua. \u001d  \"A new spiral of violence could not only further delay an elusive recovery in Nigerian crude production, but also severely undermine the stability of the fragile, budding Yar'Adua administration,\" said Halff. \"If Nigerian history is any guide, there is a risk that signs of political weakness by the new government in the face of renewed unrest in the Delta be perceived as a call for action by the country's powerful military, leading to further escalation in unrest and supply disruptions.\" \u001d  Pearmain at Global Insight also raised this point and said because of the extra publicity that goes with the abduction of a child it is more likely President Yar'Adua would increase the army's presence in Port Harcourt and the wider Niger Delta region. \u001d  But Sebastian Spio-Garbrah, analyst at Eurasia Group, believes a lot of the crude futures market reaction in recent days has been over the top. \u001d  \"The market is completely overshooting and is likely over-stretched on unfounded Nigerian fears,\" he said, noting even a relatively bearish Department of Energy report indicating greater crude product stockpiles failed to dampen the market and pushed crude futures higher. \u001d  Spio-Garbrah said the kidnapping is more likely related to activity by a criminal gang, rather than a coordinated move by a militant group, and remains confident the country will stabilize and that output will continue to be return. \u001d  \"Structurally we still believe that Nigerian supplies will grow in stability for the rest of the year and likely even surpass its OPEC quota of 2.4 million barrels a day by the late fall,\" he said. \b \u001d  -By Angela Henshall, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9285; angela.henshall@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:10 ET (15:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"40d1c30b4efa160d28152010ebc83508","symR":["VOLV","VOLV-B.SK","SE0000115420","SE0000115446","US9288564001"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Claes Nilsson Appointed New Head For Volvo Trucks Europe Division","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VOLV","VOLV-B.SK","SE0000115420","SE0000115446","US9288564001"],"IndustryCodes":["TRQ","XDJGI","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:23 ET (11:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"40ecde00054fb5a8569834c576fb735d","symR":["HLT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9964999],"ret5":[0.9857799],"Headline":"Hilton Hotels (HLT) Block: 343,000 Shrs At 45.58","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HLT"],"IndustryCodes":["LOD","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bHILTON HOTELS CORP. \bLast trade  NMS: +0.19 at 45.58 on 0.05 downtick \bTrade vol:       343,000 =    3.5% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   5,482,600 =   56.4% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:   1,497,870 =   29.8% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:       9,716,900 =  193.1% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol: 5,032,676 / Prev day +9.34 on 104,785,920 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:39 ET (14:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"410e5b2be0fbb476fcbed560cd516b60","symR":["MSC","PMTC","RUTH","SIGI","SVVS","TMWD"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,1.000576,0.9763555,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,1.029971,0.9294741,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"US Hot Stocks: MSC PMTC RUTH SVVS SIGI TMWD -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MSC","PMTC","RUTH","SIGI","SVVS","TMWD"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","INP","INS","ISV","RES","SOF","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Material Sciences Corp.

The outlook is revised to stable. \u001d  The rankings reflect the company's highly experienced management team, satisfactory and ever-improving level of automation, as well as a sound and developing internal control curriculum. After undergoing significant management and systems changes and relocating to a new facility in Irving, Texas, the company is poised for continued growth under the direction of an experienced mortgage banking staff. \u001d  Management emphasizes efficiency and effectiveness, and has embedded strict quality control and compliance throughout AHM's servicing platform. The company continues to invest in infrastructure improvements that focus on technology enhancements. Policies and procedures are well written, and provide sound guidance for all employees. Management has further strengthened internal controls and is now implementing more formalized supervision and oversight over key servicing areas to minimize potential risk issues associated with a growing portfolio. The training program has been augmented, resulting in a much more robust curriculum. AHM's prudent default methodologies, loss mitigation processes, and competent foreclosure procedures serve to effectively minimize losses. The revamped auditing program includes a sound system that includes monthly quality control monitoring and appropriate management response to any findings noted. A recently developed and improved annual internal audit with an effective audit scope and schedule will further mitigate risk by helping identify potential servicing issues that might result in future monetary losses to the organization. \u001d  Outlook \u001d  The outlook is stable. Effective senior and middle management teams have been established. Senior management adeptly selected Dallas, Texas, for its new servicing platform, which is an area that has an abundance of experienced loan servicing and call center personnel. Moreover, key upper management positions have been filled by well-qualified and experienced loan servicing professionals who were relocated from other areas. There is evidence of cohesion and cooperation among all supervisory personnel, which has created an environment that promotes best practices, proactive decision making, solid default management, and sound customer service. Policies and procedures are effectively established. Stringent internal controls have been developed, and quality control is emphasized. AHM continues to invest and enhance technology, and management has approved strategies to accommodate planned growth.

All of such wells were commercially productive excepting re-entry of a well in Roosevelt County, New Mexico. \b \u001d  For fiscal 2007, gas reserves constituted approximately 84% of the Company's total proved reserves and approximately 66% of the Company's revenues. \b \u001d  The Company reported net income of $608,385, or $.33 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2007 as compared to $788,805, or $.43 per diluted share, for fiscal 2006, a 23% decrease. \b \u001d  Operating revenues in fiscal 2007 were $2,971,717, a decrease of 20% over 2006 operating revenues of $3,719,643.  The average sales price received of $6.75 per Mcfe decreased 14% from the $7.86 per Mcfe received in fiscal 2006. Oil production decreased 2% and gas production decreased 8% during fiscal 2007 due to normal decline in production.  Revenues from oil and gas royalty interests accounted for approximately 24% of the Company's revenues for fiscal 2007 and 2006. \b \u001d  Total operating expenses were $2,376,841, a decrease of 9% from 2006 operating expenses of $2,604,677 resulting from an impairment of a long term asset in fiscal 2006 amounting to approximately $262,000. \b \u001d  The Company owns oil and gas properties in ten states, with the majority of its activity centered in West Texas.  The Company continues to focus its efforts to increase oil and natural gas reserves, through exploration and development as well as acquisitions. \b \u001d  In accordance with the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Mexco Energy Corporation cautions that statements in this press release which are forward-looking and which provide other than historical information involve risks and uncertainties that may impact the Company's actual results of operations.

(SNE) issued a public apology Friday for a violent video game that features a bloody shootout inside an Anglican cathedral, but it didn't address the Church of England's demands the company withdraw the game. \u001d  The church has demanded that Sony stop selling the game \"Resistance: Fall of Man,\" which includes a gunbattle between an U.S. soldier and aliens inside a building that resembles Manchester Cathedral in northwest England. \u001d  The entertainment giant said in an apology, published Friday in The Manchester Evening News, that company officials had met with church community leaders and Sony acknowledged the game had caused offense. The company said it now considered the matter closed. \u001d  \"It was never our intention to offend anyone in the making of this game, and we would like to apologize unreservedly to them for causing that offense, and to all parts of the wider community who we might also have offended,\" Sony Computer Entertainment Europe President David A. Reeves said in the apology. \u001d  Manchester Cathedral's dean, the Very Rev. Rogers Govender said the apology fell short of what the church had requested. \u001d  \"We asked Sony to withdraw the game,\" he said in a statement. \"They have refused to do this.\" \u001d  \"We asked Sony to make a substantial donation to community groups nominated by the Cathedral. They have refused to do this,\" he said, referring the church's education department, which works to fight gun violence in Manchester. \u001d  Govender also urged Sony and others in the computer industry to agree not to set violent game in places of prayer and worship. \u001d  Sony declined to comment on the church's outstanding demands, but Reeves did promise that Manchester Cathedral wouldn't be used in future Sony video games. \u001d  Reeves last month apologized in a letter sent to Manchester Cathedral to anyone who was offended by the game. The letter was then posted on the Church of England's Web site. \u001d  \"We now consider the matter closed, and will not be making any further comment,\" the company said in a separate statement. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:24 ET (17:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"422a99cd265949edb4991f7584808c1a","symR":["EOA.XE","EON","VTG.YY","VTT.XE","DE0006012008","DE0007614406"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Vattenfall Admits To Mistakes In Handling Kruemmel Plant Fire","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EOA.XE","EON","VTG.YY","VTT.XE","DE0006012008","DE0007614406"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","MUT","OTA","XDAX","XDJGI","XES","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\u001d  FRANKFURT (AP)--German power generator Vattenfall Europe AG (VTT.XE) admits it made mistakes in its reponse to a fire last week at its Kruemmel nuclear power plant. \u001d  The 1.3-gigawatt Kruemmel reactor, which Vattenfall jointly owns with E.ON AG (EON), was shut down following a fire in a transformer June 28. \u001d  The person in charge of the reactor opened two valves, which triggered the shutdown, Bruno Thomauske, the head of Vattenfall Europe Nuclear Energy, said. \u001d  However, the valves shouldn't have been opened, Thomauske said. \u001d  Initial talks aimed at opening an investigation into the incident will take place Saturday or Monday, the German Ministry for the Environment told Dow Jones Newswires. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:41 ET (16:41 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"42475929fd317db7fcf81cb6d78b7f9f","symR":["JPM","US46625H1005"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9963243,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.0194,-0.00099],"Headline":"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) No Mkt On Close Imbalance.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JPM","US46625H1005"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:50 ET (19:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"424d4bec1a89e23ea1de5062657342ea","symR":["OTD"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"O2Diesel Gets Notice From AMEX Regarding Listing Standards","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OTD"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:29 ET (20:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"427fb2eb3f0c484f31260059677d46ec","symR":["MGM"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9958107],"ret5":[0.9662591],"Headline":"4 Hurt In Las Vegas' New York-New York Casino Shooting-Police","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MGM"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:12 ET (12:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"431ba41cc3efd3f3871dc27e85829efb","symR":["WNL.LN","GB00B05MGT12","WNL.LN","GB00B05MGT12"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"White Nile Ld Sees Sudan Licence As Legally Binding","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WNL.LN","GB00B05MGT12"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:06 ET (15:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"43b812869e1da6d21cec44218d107694","symR":["PKTR"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Packeteer, Inc. to Announce Second Quarter 2007 Operating Results","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T09:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PKTR"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  CUPERTINO, Calif., July 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Packeteer, Inc.

The review of Walgreen's long-term rating is prompted by Moody's concern that the company's historically conservative financial policy is gradually becoming more aggressive. Aggregate cash outflows for new store development and acquisitions are increasing at a time when the company is also returning significant cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. \u001d  Ratings placed under review for downgrade are the following: \u001d  - Unsecured issuer rating of Aa3. \u001d  The following rating is affirmed: \u001d  - Short-term rating of Prime-1. \u001d  Moody's notes that, while the company's initiatives over the previous several years had been internally financed, the pending Option Care acquisition will be partially funded by an upsized commercial paper program. The Option Care transaction is the latest of several acquisitions of drug stores, specialty pharmacies, and in-store medical clinics since the end of 2005. The aggregate price of the prior acquisitions was about $800 million. The level of investment in fixed assets and working capital largely for new store development has increased over time with capital expenditures growing to an anticipated $1.7 billion for the August 2007 fiscal year compared to $1.3 billion in August 2006 and $1.2 billion in August 2005. Additionally, Walgreen's share repurchase program has also trended higher over time, with $896 million repurchased in the nine months from September 2006 through May 2007, $669 million in the August 2006 fiscal year, $782 million in 2005, and $299 million in 2004. \u001d  During the review, Moody's will consider (1) the company's current philosophies regarding internal growth and acquisitions, (2) the likelihood that shareholder returns, investment in new drugstore development, and acquisitions could exceed operating cash flow plus inflows from exercise of employee stock options, and (3) the potential impact of the company's operating and financial strategies on future debt protection measures given that credit metrics are already weak compared to many Aa issuers. \u001d  Walgreen Company, with headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, operates 5751 drug stores in 47 states and Puerto Rico. Revenue for the fiscal year ending May 2007 was $53 billion. Walgreen is purchasing Option Care, Inc, an operator and franchisor of about 106 specialty pharmacies with revenue of about $717 million. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:09 ET (20:09 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4431338ba5706475509cdd8f14465a1e","symR":["FODL"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Forster Drilling Corporation Issues Letter to Shareholders","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FODL"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\bHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \b   Dear Shareholders and Friends, \b \u001d  During the first half of 2007, Forster Drilling Corporation (OTCBB:FODL) has made significant strides in its endeavor to build a model drilling organization. Moving forward from here, the Company remains confident in our evolving business plan of deploying the best drilling rigs in the oilfield, crewed by highly-qualified personnel. Significant progress has also been made toward increasing the fleet, recruiting talented individuals to join our committed team, and continuing execution of a conservative, strategic growth plan. \b \u001d  Also, during the first half of the year, we added another dimension to our drilling operations by expanding to Western New Mexico and Eastern Arizona to drill helium/CO2 wells. We purchased, refurbished and modified an Ingersoll-Rand T4 rated to 4,000' depth capability and deployed it to the St John Field. This field, which is bisected by the New Mexico Arizona border, is the largest known CO2- field in the Northern Hemisphere. To support these operations and expand our geographic reach, plans include opening an office and yard in Springerville, Arizona in the near future. \b \u001d  This year, the Company obtained $2 million in bank loans and placed $3 million in convertible debentures which enabled the building of the second and third rigs. This, along with income from drilling operations, has increased the capitalization of the Company and moved it further toward a listing of the Common Stock on a major exchange. This is a main objective for the second half of 2007, as well as a critical component for the future growth of the Company. Additionally, the Company is near finalizing a mezzanine debt facility for which the proceeds will be used to build two additional rigs that can be deployed before year end. \b \u001d  Forster Drilling Corporation endeavors to position itself at the high end of the value proposition in all three of our businesses. We believe reliability and speed will lead to continued growth in revenues and profits. Highlights of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries are as follows: \b \u001d  Forster Drilling, Inc. A total of three rigs will be in the field before the end of July. The Company acquired two more National drawworks during the first part of the year bringing the total to six National drawworks to be refurbished and rebuilt into \"better-than-new\" drilling rigs. Construction has already begun on the fourth rig, a National 50 with an 11,000' depth capability. The Continental-Emsco A-550 drawworks has been rebuilt and will be the prime mover of a rig that we will build and sell to a third party. \b \u001d  Forster Tool & Supply, Inc. In order to minimize outsourcing, Forster Tool & Supply has built a standalone engine shop at the Odessa, Texas manufacturing facility. This shop has the ability to completely rebuild and overhaul all Caterpillar diesel engines. Further, a machine shop was added in the mechanics' bay which has not only reduced the turnaround time on making parts, but significantly reduced the cost of those parts. A third bay is planned for the main shop facility. This will add another 7,000 square feet of space and become the pump shop where mud pumps will be configured to the Drilling Company's specifications, as well as repairs and maintenance. \b \u001d  Forster Exploration & Production, Inc. We are looking at the prospects of potential drilling customers and, where attractive and low-risk projects exist, will attempt to participate with them as a working interest owner. \b \u001d  In summary, we are presently on track to have five or more rigs in the field by the end of the year. We are concentrating on the development of the Arizona facility and providing support to our customer. These activities will support our major objective of having our Common Stock listed on a major exchange by the end of the year. \b \u001d  On behalf of the leadership team at Forster Drilling Corporation, we appreciate the confidence you have placed in us as the stewards of your investment. We are committed to protecting it and growing it responsibly. \b \b   Kindest regards, \b \b   Fred Forster III \b \b   Chairman, President, and CEO \b \b    CONTACT: Forster Drilling Corporation, Houston \b             Fred Forster III, 713-266-8125 \b \b    SOURCE: Forster Drilling Corporation \bCopyright Business Wire 2007 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:03 ET (15:03 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"445484e2f5eae97eaafb01f2a2130d58","symR":["00913.AE","AKZOY","ICI.LN","ICIYY","SGP","GB0004594973","NL0000009132"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: UK Regulator Says Akzo Must Bid For ICI By Aug 9","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["00913.AE","AKZOY","ICI.LN","ICIYY","SGP","GB0004594973","NL0000009132"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","DRG","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XFFX","XFT1","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Roberta B.

In a statement issued to the London Stock Exchange the regulators said the Dutch company must state its intentions regarding U.K. rival ICI by 5pm on 9 August. \u001d  In early June, Akzo Nobel, the world's largest coatings company by market share, made an indicative offer for ICI of 600p per share in cash, valued at GBP7.2 billion (EUR10.65 billion), an off that ICI rejected on grounds that it \"significantly undervalues ICI.\" \u001d  The Takeover Panel said in its statement that each party has accepted the watchdog's ruling. Both Akzo Nobel and ICI declined to comment Friday on the matter. \u001d  A trader who asked not to be identified said the regulator's \"put up or shut up\" ruling places Akzo Nobel on the back foot and indicates that Akzo is still interested, otherwise the meeting with the panel would have resulted in Akzo walking away. The trader said he therefore expects a raised bid from Akzo. \u001d  Another trader, who also asked not to be identified,  noted media reports Friday that ICI had requested the deadline be set. He said the move seems aimed at getting  Akzo to bid higher than its initial indication of 600p per share, and that price talk in the market is now over 650p. \b \u001d  Company Web sites: http://www.akzonobel.com \u001d  http://www.ici.com \b \u001d  By Roberta B.

The letters contained the warning: \"Hundreds will die. We are inside. You cannot stop us.\" \u001d  A federal law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told the Associated Press the FBI \"does not assign high credibility to the threat\" because of the circumstances surrounding the letters, including their brevity and the nonspecific nature of the threat. The investigator spoke on condition of anonymity. \u001d  Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said the firm was working closely with law enforcement authorities, adding that authorities told the firm they don't believe the threat is credible. \u001d  \"We take any threat to the safety to our people seriously,\" DuVally said. \"We have a broad range of security measures in place to counter all likely threats and we're monitoring the situation closely.\" \u001d  New York FBI spokesman James Margolin said the bureau was trying to determine the origin of the letters. \"All threats are taken seriously,\" he said. \u001d  The letters, postmarked in late June from the New York boroughs of Queens and the Bronx, were being analyzed by FBI and U.S. Postal inspectors at the FBI crime lab in Washington, D.C., and at the postal service lab in Dulles, Va., said Tom Boyle, a spokesman for the Postal Inspection Service. \u001d  Another investigator familiar with the case told the AP it may be difficult to isolate the fingerprints of whoever sent the letters because others have touched the envelopes after they were deposited in neighborhood mailboxes. \u001d  The investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity did so because they weren't authorized to discuss the case with the media. \u001d  Investigators said they also will be looking for DNA evidence that may have been contained in saliva left when the envelopes were sealed.

We need to talk to the parties ... We'd like to see an alliance between MOL and OMV in all activities and I think it will happen,\" Ruttenstorfer said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires here. \u001d  Any takeover would not affect OMV's dividend program, he added. \u001d  \"We'll continue our payout to shareholders. We had a payout of around 23% last year and we're still looking to raise that to around 30%,\" he said. \u001d  OMV, however, has yet to formally start negotiations with MOL or the Hungarian government about a merger, although invitations to both parties continue, said Ruttenstorfer. The government and OMV have been cool in response to OMV's increased stake in the company. \u001d  An OMV-MOL tie-up is needed, Ruttenstorfer said, because of ongoing consolidation in Europe's oil sector and because companies like OMV and MOL will require even deeper pockets to bankroll big projects such as the proposed Nabucco gas pipeline to bring gas from central Asia to Europe. OMV and MOL, along three other companies, each have a 20% stake in the Nabucco consortium. \u001d  There were no immediate plans by OMV, which is 31.5%-owned by the Austrian government, to raise its stake in MOL to 25% plus one voting right, which could ward off other potential buyers such as Russian state gas monopoly OAO Gazprom (GSPBEX.RS). \"We're observing the situation right now,\" Ruttenstorfer said. \u001d  Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany has branded OMV's rising ownership in MOL as part of a \"hostile\" takeover attempt and said the government, through its special voting rights in MOL, planned to protect the company. \u001d  Ruttenstorfer questioned a MOL strategy of buying its own stock this year - a ploy, analysts say, aimed at fending off a possible takeover - and said the company's finances were not being used as well as they should be. \u001d  Ruttenstorfer would neither confirm nor deny that OMV has asked Barclays PLC (BCS) and JP Morgan & Co. (JPM) for a EUR13.5 billion loan to finance a MOL takeover. \u001d  He would likewise neither confirm nor deny that European Union regulators have given a tentative green light to an OMV-MOL merger scenario under certain conditions. \"We don't comment on our private discussions,\" he said. \u001d  Ruttenstorfer said OMV was open to other acquisitions or stakes in companies such as state-run Serbian Oil Industry (NIS) to aid OMV's growth, but said no active discussions were happening with firms at the moment. \u001d  OMV is targeting a production target of 500,000 barrel-oil-equivalent per day by 2010, from 320,000 barrel-oil-equivalent today. \b \u001d  -By Spencer Swartz, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)207 842 9357; spencer.swartz@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:13 ET (14:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"45b2cd00c4d0ae136ee06c920c61fdee","symR":["GEF","GEFB"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.983646,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.017637,-0.00099],"Headline":"CFO HUML Sells 22,367 Of GREIF INC >GEF","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GEF","GEFB"],"IndustryCodes":["CTR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: GREIF INC \bSYMBOL: GEF \b \bFILER: HUML DONALD S \bTITLE: Chief Financial Officer \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/3/07-7/5/07      Exercise*               22,367      $13.10         $293,008 \b7/3/07-7/5/07      Sale                    22,367      $61.63       $1,378,402 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 15,740 (Direct) \b \b  * - Exercised 2 years, 9 months after vesting and 5 years, 2 months before \b      expiration. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

Experienced advisors with proven records of collecting sizable assets are commanding rich premiums for jumping ship. \u001d  Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER), the largest retail brokerage house in the U.S., recently sweetened its upfront deal to 150% and complemented it with richer performance-based back-end bonuses that could push the total recruiting package to more than 200% of a broker's annual revenue. \u001d  UBS Wealth Management US, which was the first on Wall Street to roll out a formal 200% deal last year, also increased its upfront pay for new recruits to a maximum of 140% of production in recent months. \u001d  \"Undoubtedly, business is growing, so there's a lot of money on the street and more bidding up of producer pay,\" said Robert Salwen, a compensation consultant who deals with Wall Street firms. \"But if it stagnates or go south, you'll probably see an easing.\" \u001d  Morgan Stanley's new bonus applies to brokers whose haul of commissions and fees over the past 12 months puts them in the top 20% of producers for advisors with similar levels of experience. Veterans with 16 or more years in the business need to produce $960,000 to qualify. Those with 11 to 15 years need to generate $805,000 and those with eight to 10 years of experience need to produce $620,000. \u001d  The new deal will allow select brokers to get up to 140% of the commissions and fees that they generate over the past year in a mix of cash through a nine-year forgivable loan and a stock grant that vests over six years. \u001d  The other 75 points of the bonus will be given over a period of three years and will be tied to several hurdles related to annual production and asset growth. \u001d  \"There's not a lot of fast money and trading profit now, because it's more fee-based and asset gathering,\" said Bill Willis, a recruiter for major Wall Street firms. Retail brokerage houses, he said, still want to grow organically, but \"more reliable business is involved, so the proven brokers are in demand.\" \u001d  -By Evelyn Juan, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2312; evelyn.juan@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"45c79140e87f1696af482be2dc8b14bd","symR":["MSLH.LN","GB00B012BV22"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Marshalls 1H Revenue GBP210M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MSLH.LN","GB00B012BV22"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:01 ET (06:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"460faa105119ae472a4eb14d5b6de732","symR":["SHI.LN","GB0008025412"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: SIG Trading Update Ahead Of Expectations - Numis","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T08:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SHI.LN","GB0008025412"],"IndustryCodes":["DIB","SVC","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  0828 GMT [Dow Jones] SIG's (SHI.LN) 1H trading update is \"ahead of our expectations,\" says Numis.

(AL) of the U.S. and Canada's Alcoa Inc. (AA) \u001d  The Daily Telegraph cited people close to the process as saying Rio Tinto, listed in London and Sydney, has engaged Credit Suisse Group (CS) and Deutsche Bank A.G. (DB) to advise it on a range of options, including a bid for Alcan. \u001d  Another possibility is a bid for Alcoa, although this is thought less likely, the report says. \u001d  \"We don't comment on market speculation,\" Rio Tinto spokesman Nick Cobban said of the report. \u001d   A London-based analyst at a major bank said that Rio Tinto could be looking to become an aluminum \"heavyweight,\" but retaining low electricity costs for aluminum production would be a major challenge. \u001d  Rio Tinto \"would have to be comfortable that there would be no renegotiation of power supply agreements by local governments,\" he said. \"You can see why they would be interested, but it's still a fairly hefty entry price, with (Alcan's) share price doubling over the last six months,\" he added. \u001d  Rio Tinto's shares in London fell almost 1%, or 31 pence, to a low of 3,970 pence on the report but have since recovered, along with other leading mining groups. \u001d  At 0859 GMT its shares were marginally lower on the day at GBP39.98 pence. \u001d  In June, Alcan Chief Executive Richard Evans e-mailed Alcoa CEO Alain Belda rejecting the possibility of talks between the companies. \u001d  Alcan has indicated company executives and its board were standing by their opposition to the Alcoa hostile takeover bid. \"Alcoa chose to take their offer to our shareholders. Alcan's board rejected it,\" Alcan spokeswoman Anik Michaud said this week. \"We're continuing to pursue other alternatives.\" \u001d  The market has been rife with rumors that a white knight may assist Alcan in fending off Alcoa, with names such as BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP), Rio Tinto and Brazilian mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (RIO) mentioned. \u001d  Earlier this month, Rio Tinto announced what its new CEO Tom Albanese described as, \"one of the most significant investments made by Rio Tinto in recent years,\" a US$1.8 billion expansion of its Yarwun alumina refinery in the Australian state of Queensland. \u001d  The mining giant will boost annual output at its 100% owned plant in Gladstone to 3.4 million metric tons from 1.4 million tons by 2011. \u001d  -By Melanie Burton and Adam Smallman, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0) 20 7842 9412; melanie.burton@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 05:14 ET (09:14 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4716d302a5115d7d837bc79ab1081015","symR":["QUA.T","CA7473191012"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Quadra Mining Tgt Raised To C$25 From C$17: R James >QUA.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["QUA.T","CA7473191012"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:35 ET (11:35 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"476f8f835261e8d79519be672229a2a2","symR":["EEM"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.009691],"ret5":[1.02162],"Headline":"iShrMSEmrgMkt (EEM) Block: 175,000 Shrs At 137.87","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EEM"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\bISHARES INC.

But he thinks it's also an opportune time to acquire brokerage firms and individual financial advisors. \u001d  Heavy compliance demands and capital investment requirements are spurring some smaller broker-dealers to align themselves with larger firms that have greater resources, Roth says. \u001d  Moreover, changes taking place at regional and national brokerage firms, including consolidation and uncertainty over the future of fee-based brokerage accounts, might cause advisors there to stop and consider their options, Roth says. \u001d  Roth is executive director of AIG's executive office, a newly formed management team overseeing the four broker-dealers that constitute AIG Advisor Group, a division of American International Group Inc. (AIG). The broker-dealers are: AIG Financial Advisors Inc., based in Phoenix; American General Securities Inc. in Houston; Royal Alliance Associates Inc. in New York; and FSC Securities Corp. and Advantage Capital Corp., which are co-managed and co-located in Atlanta. \u001d  Roth has also been president and chief executive of Royal Alliance since joining the firm in January 2006. \u001d  About 8,000 registered representatives, many of whom are also investment advisors, are affiliated with AIG Advisor Group. They manage nearly $122 billion in total client assets. \u001d  Roth spoke with Dow Jones Newswires about AIG's growth and acquisition plans and the opportunities he sees amid the changing brokerage landscape. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. \b \u001d  DJ: Tell us about AIG Advisor Group's growth and acquisition strategy. \b \u001d  ROTH: Our main driver of the business is keeping current advisors happy. We plan to see most growth coming from our current advisors doing more business. \u001d  We're supplementing that with acquisitions. Historically, a little less than half of our growth has come from these acquisitions. It's possible, if consolidation increases, that these acquisitions could indeed be more than half our growth, but that's not the plan. \b \u001d  DJ: What about acquiring individual advisors? \b \u001d  ROTH: Our firm has a recruiting group that is out looking all the time for larger, high-quality advisors who might just want to find a different home. They represent a smaller portion of our growth than the acquisitions do, but they are an important part of our growth plan. They become available to us when there's other activity going on. When there's consolidation, say with the regional firms, often the better brokers will say to themselves: \"Wow, my clients will have to go through this change. Maybe I should look around and see if it's best to go with the acquiring company or look for other options.\" In the last two years we've seen a fair amount of activity of that type. \b \u001d  DJ: What types of firms and financial advisors are you looking to acquire? \b \u001d  ROTH: The perfect candidate for us, in terms of acquisition, is either a local or regional firm that has high-quality financial advisors, which we would define as larger producers with a clean track record from a regulatory and customer-complaint standpoint. They generally would be clustered in one or two or three states around the headquarters of this business. The revenues of those firms tend to run in the $10 million and up range. They typically have at least 100 advisors. \u001d  We sometimes find the advisors are really the catalyst for the broker-dealer selling. They're going to the broker-dealer management team and saying: \"I enjoy working with you. I feel we've outgrown the relationship. Either you have to affiliate with someone else or I'm going to.\" It's kind of an interesting dynamic. \b \u001d  DJ: How are investors' needs changing and how is AIG responding? \b \u001d  ROTH: People are all planning for retirement, as opposed to just assuming they'll be able to live off their pension. They're living a lot longer. They've learned to adjust to a lifestyle that they're not willing to give up. They need cash flow into retirement. What this all adds up to for us is investing very significantly in a platform that will do whatever the client needs it to do, depending on their personal situation, their level of investable assets and oftentimes their age and lifestyle. \b \u001d  DJ: You plan to add unified managed accounts to your platform. How's that going? \b \u001d  ROTH: We are building - and this is through a joint venture with National Financial, which is owned by Fidelity Investments - a unified management account, which will be rolled out in two phases. One will be the last quarter of 2007 and the next phase will be sometime during the first half of 2008. It allows advisors and their clients to place their assets of all types into one account. It allows us to manage those assets in a way that is really a much more holistic approach to asset management for clients. \b \u001d  DJ: Will there be a minimum asset level for these accounts? \b \u001d  ROTH: Yes, there will be. We haven't set minimums yet. They will not be particularly high. They're really designed for the mass affluent client and larger. \b \u001d  DJ: A U.S. appeals court has stayed until October a decision that effectively bans fee-based brokerage accounts. How does this affect AIG? \b \u001d  ROTH: It doesn't really affect us in terms of the way we currently run our business. It does make life more difficult for advisors with the regionals and wirehouses (who may need to move clients out of these accounts). Most people in our business believe that ruling will help us very significantly over time.

The unions then requested the unemployment back pay for all the weeks plants were idled, including the holiday week. \u001d  The company argued employees had otherwise been paid for the holiday week and therefore were not entitled to unemployment pay for that week, while the union said the holiday pay agreement was a strike settlement unrelated to the unemployment pay claims. \u001d  The Supreme Court agreed to review the case after lower courts issued conflicting rulings. Chief Justice Thomas Moyer wrote in the court's decision that it was clear that \"the purpose of this payment was to replace the lost Independence Week shutdown period,\" and that the unions had not presented convincing evidence to the contrary. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:31 ET (06:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"47efb65fcf5c0f6e53c40e911a05117d","symR":["TNET.BT","BE0003826436"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Telenet Board Approves Debt Refinancing Plan - Telenet","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TNET.BT","BE0003826436"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \b   Edited Press Release \b \u001d  BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Belgian cable company Telenet Group Holding NV (TNET.BT) said Friday that its Board of Directors has approved a debt refinancing plan pursuant to which Telenet will refinance its existing senior bank debt, senior notes and senior discount notes. This will result in Telenet's total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization or Ebitda ratio rising to approximately 5.0x. \u001d  The plan, which is being implemented at a time of favorable terms for issuers in the debt markets, is expected to refinance existing debts at a lower financing cost and to generate additional cash proceeds, the significant proportion of which is available for distribution to shareholders of Telenet by way of a capital decrease, subject to shareholders' approval. \u001d  The total distribution under the proposed plan is expected to be in the range of EUR5 to EUR8 per share and is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of this year.        Telenet intends to appoint one or more financial institutions to lead the process on behalf of Telenet. Based on proposals received from financial institutions, Telenet expects to lower its average financing cost, increase the overall average life of its debt and enhance future returns to equity investors. The projected interest and principal repayments of the new facility are expected to be supported by the projected cash flow of the company. \u001d  Since the refinancing repays the U.S. dollar denominated senior discount notes, Telenet's potential exposure to fluctuations in the value of its foreign currency obligations will also be substantially diminished. \b   \bCompany website: http://www.telenet.be \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:57 ET (15:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"47efccb5a6ab00b9c4fb39b38353a0b4","symR":["0001.HK","CHEUY","DB","DBK.XE","DE0005140008","HK0001000014"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,1.00027,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9966223,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE:Cheung Kong's Shrs Jump After Deutsche Bank Ups Stake","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T08:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0001.HK","CHEUY","DB","DBK.XE","DE0005140008","HK0001000014"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","REA","RED","XATI","XDAX","XDJGI","XES","XHSG","XNYA","XST5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Adds share price; comments from analyst, research notes.) \b \u001d  HONG KONG (Dow Jones)--Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd.'s shares (0001.HK) ended sharply higher Friday after Deutsche Bank AG (DB) increased its holding in the Hong Kong developer, the property flagship of tycoon Li Ka-shing, to 5.25% from 2.25% and an investment bank raised its target price on the stock. \u001d  Cheung Kong's Hong Kong-traded shares closed up 7.1% at HK$110.20, after hitting an intraday high of HK$110.40, outperforming the benchmark Hang Seng Index's 1.3% gain. \u001d  In a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange late Thursday, Cheung Kong said Deutsche Bank had bought 69.03 million Cheung Kong shares at an average price of HK$102.764 on June 28. Based on those figures, Deutsche bank spent around HK$7.09 billion on the shares. \u001d  At the same time, Deutsche Bank cut its short position in the Hong Kong blue chip to 0.72% from 9.55%, the statement said. \u001d  Francis Lun, a manager at Fulbright Securities Ltd., said: \"The stake buy from Deutsche Bank is a good sign; it's a show of confidence in Cheung Kong.\" \u001d  Investor interest in Cheung Kong was also fueled by Credit Suisse Group raising its target price on the developer Friday to HK$122 from HK$116, on the back of Li, Cheung Kong's chairman, increasing his ownership over the past few weeks. Li now owns 39.75% of the company. \u001d  A further boost came from Merrill Lynch's upgrade Friday of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.'s (0013.HK) share price target to HK$98 from HK$92. Cheung Kong derives a large chunk of its profit from the telecommunications-to-property conglomerate through its 49% ownership. Hutchison Whampoa's shares in Hong Kong ended 6.3% higher Friday at HK$83. \u001d  Merrill Lynch said it raised Hutchison's target price because an expected turnaround in the company's third-generation mobile operations will stoke investor demand. \u001d  \"We maintain our buy rating, and see earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization turnaround for its 3G business to be announced during its interim results in late August as a potential re-rating catalyst in the near term,\" Merrill Lynch said. \u001d  Deutsche Bank's increased holding in Cheung Kong comes on the heels of an increase in its stake in Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (0011.HK), a Hong Kong-listed unit of HSBC Holdings PLC (HBC). \u001d  Deutsche Bank raised its stake in Hang Seng to 8.07% from 0.73% between June 22 and June 28, and cut its short position in the bank to 5.67% from 27.24%. \b \u001d  -By Joyce Li, Dow Jones Newswires; 852-2802-7002; joyce.li@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 04:12 ET (08:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"47f7ff601dafa56b1c10511ce56aacde","symR":["MB.T","CA58515N1050"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MEGA Brands Tgt Cut To C$22 From C$24.50: Scotia >MB.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MB.T","CA58515N1050"],"IndustryCodes":["ENT","TMF","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"47fc4944086755e998c4cdb8bf1bd1f4","symR":["AVPA","NCT.U.T","CA6823481073"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Laurus Master Fund Boosts Credit Facility For 180 Connect By $8M >NCT.U.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AVPA","NCT.U.T","CA6823481073"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Corrected July 06, 2007 08:11 ET (12:11 GMT)\u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:32 ET (11:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"480dbef154e4c960b0ec988277d228ae","symR":["MRLBV.HE","FI0009000665"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: M-real Sale Of Map Merchant Positive - FIM","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T07:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MRLBV.HE","FI0009000665"],"IndustryCodes":["PAP","XDJGI","XHEX"],"Story":"\u001d  0721 GMT [Dow Jones] M-real's (MRLBV.HE) deal to sell its Map Merchant Group to Antalis for EUR382M is a good deal, says Sampo Timonen at FIM Securities.

Following news that CME raised the share exchange component of its bid for CBOT (BOT), CME's offer was valued higher than the competing bid for ICE, based on Thursday's closing share prices. However, after the open, with CME down and ICE shares trading higher, the ICE offer is again the more lucrative option, on a share exchange basis. Based on recent share prices, ICE's $11.45B bid compares with CME's offer of $11.28B. CME off 1.2% at $549, while ICE up 0.6% at $153. BOT up 3.9% at $214. (JLT) \u001d  9:40 (Dow Jones) The Economic Cycle Research Institute says its Future Inflation Gauge fell to 117.8 in June from an upward-revised 118.5 in May (had been 118.2). At the same time, a smoothed version of the annualized growth rate moved deeper into negative territory in June at a negative reading of 4.2% from an upward-revised negative reading of 3.5% in May (had been down 3.8%). \"Although U.S. economic growth is beginning to firm, the U.S. future inflation gauge is still in a cyclical downswing, suggesting that U.S. inflation pressures are still ebbing,\" says Lakshman Achuthan, managing director at ECRI.

Caledonia Investments, CBOT's largest shareholder, which balked at earlier terms, confirmed Friday it plans to vote for the CME/CBOT deal, which would create the world's largest derivatives exchange. (JLT) \u001d  9:19 (Dow Jones) The September fed funds futures contract, at 94.75, prices in an implied funds rate of 5.25%. Sept had priced in a 5.245% implied yield just before the jobs report. Still, the market continues to reflect the widely held view the FOMC will be content to leave the funds rate at its current level at the Aug. 7 and Sept. 18 policy meetings. (HLP) \u001d  9:14 (Dow Jones) The 10-year yield, near 5.180%, if it clears the 5.144%-5.195% resistance band, which charts say is likely, will be the on the way up to 5.305%. The profit-taking point in that case would be 5.252%. The spot U.S. Dollar Index, near 81.60, if it breaks out on the intraday charts above 81.66, would be going for the upper end of its 81.95-81.31 intraday trading range. The euro, near $1.3600, is liable to dip to $1.3452. The signal for the move would be decisive trading below $1.3528. (SWC) \u001d  9:07 (Dow Jones) The dollar is reversing some its modest gains against its rivals on the back of a slightly-better-than-expected jobs report, and is now back to little changed versus the euro from day-earlier numbers. Analysts said the dollar's sharp, knee-jerk jump may have been a result a holiday-thinned trading. Early Friday, the euro was at $1.3596 from $1.3601 just before the data was released and $1.3598 late Thursday, while the dollar was at Y123.35 from Y123.23 pre-data and Y122.90 late Thursday, according to EBS.

The economy is still strong. Jobs growth is still very strong.\" Comex gold down $1.80 to $648.80 an ounce for the day, compared to $651 two minutes ahead of the data. September silver down 5c to $12.53 compared to $12.56 before report. Much of the movement has been dictated by the Treasury market, Kaplan adds. (ALS) \u001d  9:01 (Dow Jones) There was a 12,000 increase in total construction jobs with no net change in residential construction, itself an improvement compared to past declines. (JJM) \u001d  9:00 (Dow Jones) Aggregate hours worked - combines the workweek with the employment gain - showed a 0.5% gain in June. That's a very solid increase in this important proxy for the input to production (was up 0.3% in manufacturing) suggesting good growth in June. (JJM) \u001d  8:55 (Dow Jones) For the first time, CME is offering more for CBOT (BOT) than the competing bid from ICE, based on Thursday's closing prices, following news that CME has raised the share exchange component of its bid to .375 from .35. Based on Thursday's closing share prices, CME's $11.48 billion bid is worth roughly $100 million more than the offer from ICE. (JLT) \u001d  8:52 (Dow Jones) Near-term supply concerns have forced the Brent crude forward curve into backwardation. Broker says concerns over Nigerian supply has seen buyers rush into the front months with the result that ICE Aug Brent is up 74c and Nov down 11c. \"This is typical of a market beginning to panic,\" says broker. But warns profit taking could pare the gains ahead of the weekend. ICE Aug Brent trades up 74c at $75.48/bbl while Nymex August WTI trades up 57c at $72.38/bbl.

Known as Regulation NMS, it requires brokers to instantly route orders to the market displaying the best price among dozens of alternatives. \u001d  The costs of building and maintaining the technology to accomplish this have been monumental, say industry veterans, and concerns remain that the technology may still falter under the onslaught of storms of trading order data. Exchanges, which came under the sway of Reg NMS along with other automated marketplaces in March, have already suffered numerous trading outages that halted their ability to instantly transfer orders to rival markets. \u001d  In the brokerage community, costs related to the new regulation may ultimately force small and medium-size brokerages to outsource stock trading to larger firms, say industry veterans. \u001d  \"The large firms couldn't have scripted it better if they were in charge of writing the regs themselves,\" said Curt Bradbury, chief operating officer of Stephens Inc., a Little Rock, Ark.-based brokerage firm that employs about 60 institutional traders, salespeople and analysts. \u001d  Stephens will stay the course, Bradbury said, offering research and trading on small-cap growth stocks that are not followed by larger firms. However, it has cut its trading force and coverage group over the past three years and is likely to outsource some trading orders on a piecemeal basis to larger firms. \b \b   High Costs \b \u001d  All of Wall Street has been choking on the high cost of maintaining the salespeople, traders and analysts who support their equity-trading organizations. The 2003 and 2004 legal and regulatory settlements that prohibit brokers from subsidizing stock research with investment-banking income has further exacerbated the issue. However, larger firms say they can combat declining profits by amassing greater market share. \u001d  \"There is no question that NMS is going to disintermediate a lot of the players,\" says Carlos Hernandez, global head of equities at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s (JPM) investment-banking unit. \"The payoff is many years away, and firms with bigger, deeper pockets who can subsidize equities trading with other businesses are better positioned.\" \u001d  Demands from mutual funds and other large investors to lower commissions even further will increase if stock markets begin to swoon, making weaker players even more vulnerable, he and others said. \u001d  \"The big are going to get bigger,\" said Tim Cox, vice president of market structure strategy at Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER). \"Reg NMS over the course of a couple of months will make technology a real differentiator.\" \u001d  The big firms have already been exercising their muscle, expanding their electronic-trading capacity and creating connections with other markets to capture the best prices internally. Citigroup Inc. (C) on Monday said it will pay about $680 million in cash and stock to buy Automated Trading Desk, an electronic platform with about 120 broker/dealer customers that it says handled roughly 6% of the equity trading volume on major exchanges in the U.S. last year. \u001d  Reg NMS, whose start date was delayed several times at the request of brokerage firms, will be phased in for 250 stocks on Monday and most of the rest of the U.S. market by Aug. 20. \u001d  \"We have invested in our technology platform over the past two years specifically to prepare for the Reg NMS environment,\" said Bob Peterson, head of equities at Piper Jaffray, a Minneapolis-based broker, arguing that the enhanced technology will make the firm's execution services on small- and mid-cap stocks \"even more valuable for our clients.\" \u001d  But consultants are wary, saying it may take several months for the rule's impact to reach the bottom line. \u001d  \"Firms are going to have do a serious cost-benefit analysis because it may be cheaper to have someone else doing their execution for them,\" said Holly Stark, a trading consultant at Efficient Frontiers in New York. \"Fast routing requires a big technology spend.\" \b \b   Some Concern \b \u001d  Paul Atkins, a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission, who dissented on many provisions of the regulation, remains concerned. \u001d  \"I will continue to watch carefully the implementation of Reg NMS and hope that its consequences turn out to be a nonevent - other than the thousands of hours and multiple millions of dollars spent in an effort by market participants to implement it,\" he said in a speech May 7 to a securities industry group. \"The trouble is that the real consequences for our markets will not be known for years, after the damage has been done and after trading patterns have shifted in unpredictable ways and perhaps to other venues.\" \u001d  Big brokerage firms still make plenty of money trading stocks with customers from their own inventory but not from acting as an agent in placing the orders. They and smaller firms also prosper from executing stock orders for individual investors, which are generally exempt from the automated execution rules of Reg NMS. \u001d  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) booked $3.6 billion from trading equities in its first fiscal half that ended May 25, overshadowing $2 billion of commission revenue from its agency and clearing businesses. In a starker illustration of the eclipse of equities brokerage, Goldman booked $8 billion of revenue in the first half of 2007 from fixed-income trading and principal investments. \b \b   Other Pressure \b \u001d  Reg NMS is not the only force pressuring smaller firms' equities operations. Goldman, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Merrill Lynch, among others, are encouraging mutual funds and other big traders to consolidate their equity-trading commissions into pools residing at the big brokers. If the client wants to reward smaller firms for trading ideas, the executing brokers will funnel money from the commission pool to the smaller broker, a process approved by the SEC. \u001d  The process appears to be taking hold.

The company's common stock continues to trade on AMEX. \u001d  The Company's Chief Executive Officer, Alan Rae, said, \"In our previous quarterly and annual filings, we stated that  the Company would not be able to maintain the ongoing listing requirements of the AMEX without additional capital.  We identified this position at the beginning of the year and developed and implemented a plan to address the issue both from an immediate as well as long term point of view.  This plan includes the previously announced agreement with Fusion Capital as well as other financing agreements.  Due to regulatory delays out of our control, the implementation of this plan has taken longer than expected. As a result of this delay, we were not able to meet the shareholders equity requirement prior to receiving notice of non compliance this week.  We have maintained regular communication with the AMEX since early in the year and will file our compliance plan with them  by the 27th of July.  We believe recent financing efforts, the changing dynamics of O2Diesel's commercial development in markets such as India, plus the acquisition of ProEco Energy, which  will add a substantial asset to our balance sheet,  puts the Company in a strong position to succeed in expanding sales of our products globally while rewarding shareholders with greater long-term value.\" \u001d  More About O2Diesel: The Company and Its Fuel Technology \u001d  O2Diesel Corporation (AMEX: OTD) and its U.S. subsidiary O2Diesel, Inc., isa pioneer in the commercial development of a cleaner-burning diesel fuel alternative that provides exceptional performance and environmental qualities for centrally fueled fleets and off-road equipment of all kinds.

Sorrells \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  BERLIN (Dow Jones)--European government bond prices spent the day in negative territory Friday digesting Thursday's European Central Bank and Bank of England interest rate decisions before falling further on strong U.S. June nonfarm payrolls figures. \u001d  The U.S. Labor Department reported a gain of 132,000 nonfarm payrolls during June, above the economists' consensus estimate of 128,000 new jobs. Additionally, May figures were revised upward from 157,000 new workers to 190,000. \u001d   The positive economic news fueled concerns in the market the U.S. Federal Reserve will now be in no hurry to cut U.S. interest rates and sent U.S. Treasurys tumbling. The September bund contract followed, plunging to a daily low of 109.81 before clawing its way back up to 110.00. \u001d  The revision of May's data was the primary shock, since data released earlier this week had hinted at higher June payroll figures, Marc Ostwald, an analyst with Insinger de Beaufort said. \u001d  \"I think the market had this priced in,\" he said. \"We're probably going to move to what I call a technical market now. I don't think the market reaction is going to be much more dramatic than it's been already.\" \u001d  He added the main factor to watch was whether the news would push 10-year bund yields above 4.70% and the upward to 4.76% and 4.80%. But, as the session continued, the yield came close to that level at 4.695%, but never quite reached it. \u001d  At 1430 GMT, the September bund contract on Eurex was down 0.28 at 109.95. The 10-year benchmark bund was down 0.17 at 96.71 to yield 4.67%.   The September gilt future contract was down 0.21 at 103.13, while the 4% gilt, due 2016, was down 0.10 at 89.105 to yield 5.532%. \u001d  Prior to the release of U.S. employment data, bund contract markets had already traded lower, testing support forecast at 110.00 and continuing the downward price trend that started July 3, after a slight rally toward the end of June. \u001d  Analysts attributed the slow markets to a variety of factors, including a partial reversal of recent safe haven flows and mixed feelings about comments made at Thursday's ECB press conference. \u001d  The ECB decision means short rates are unlikely to be driven \"by pure rate expectations, but by the back end of the money market curve,\" Alan James, analyst at Barclay's Capital Research said. \u001d  The one other major piece of data Friday, the release of German May manufacturing orders, had little impact on the market, even though it outperformed expectations. Orders rose 3.2% in May, compared with forecasts of a 0.5% rise and a revised fall of 1.6% in April. \u001d  The bund yield curve was mixed as the yield spread between the two-year and 10-year bunds widened 0.5 basis point to 14.5 basis points, while the 10-year/30-year spread narrowed 2.0 basis points to 10 basis points. \u001d  U.K. gilts also moved lower  as analysts noted expectations of higher U.K. interest rates were already well-entrenched in the market. \u001d  \"We are cautious about recommending outright bullish positions,\" said Alan James, analyst at Barclay's Capital Research in a note. \"But with November pricing in a significant risk of more than 6.0% while October is pricing in around an 80% chance of a move, we recommend receiving November versus September or October,\" James said. \u001d  Stronger-than-forecast May industrial production, which rose 0.6% on the month, compared with expectations of a 0.3% increase, and manufacturing output, which rose 0.4% in May, from 0.3% in April, added to the negative tone in the first half of the session. \u001d  Dealers reported some evidence of dip-buying by investors, which led to the long end of the yield curve flattening slightly. \u001d  \"The slightly stronger-than-expected manufacturing data proved largely irrelevant given the focus on the U.S. data and overall poor sentiment in bunds and Treasurys,\" said Ostwald. \u001d  \"There remained some outperformance given all the bad news on U.K. rates is already heavily discounted, and that the terms for switching out of equities into gilts are at the best levels for nearly five years, which encouraged further liability driven investment related demand,\" Ostwald added. \u001d  The yield on the 10-year gilt rose above 5.55% in the wake of the sell-off in Treasurys after the release of the strong U.S. data, but recovered as the U.S. market pared its losses. \u001d  The yield spread between the two-year and 10-year gilt disinverted 1.0 basis point to -24.5 basis points from -25.5, while the 10-year/30-year spread inverted a further 0.5 basis point to -65.0 basis points from -64.5. \b \u001d  -By Niels C.

(WMT) is also called, is expected to report sales growth of about 10%, according to several retail analysts. \u001d  \"Sales of the main commercial chains in recent months  haven't been that encouraging,\" the Monex brokerage said in a report. \"On the contrary, they have shown a strong slowdown from 2006.\" \u001d  Several factors are expected to limit sales growth at Walmex and competitors such as Comercial Mexicana (COMERCI.MX) and Organizacion Soriana (SORIANA.MX). \u001d  Retail sales and advertising were boosted in the second quarter of 2006 by the World Cup and the presidential election, making for hard year-on-year comparisons. \u001d  A slowdown in growth of remittances from Mexicans living in the U.S. - attributed largely to the U.S. economic slowdown - and an overall slowdown in domestic consumption are also seen playing a part. \u001d  Deutsche Bank said in a report Friday that it expects Walmex to report a relatively weak quarter, saying \"the downturn in economic activity and remittances are having a larger negative effect on sales than previously anticipated.\" \u001d  Remittances fell in May for the first time in nearly eight years, according to the central bank. Remittances reached a record $23 billion in 2006. \u001d  Data to April published by the National Statistics Institute, or Inegi, showed retail sales up 1.9% from the like 2006 period, compared with 2.5% growth in the first four months of 2006. \u001d  The retail association Antad reported year-on-year declines in same-store sales at its member establishments in April and May. Walmex reported only modest same-store sales growth, up 0.8% in May and 0.5% in April. \u001d  Expected second-quarter weakness has already been reflected in some retailers' shares, which have underperformed the Mexican stock market this year. The market's IPC index closed Friday at a record 32,411 points, up 23% from the end of 2006. \u001d   Walmex V shares closed at 40.90 pesos ($1=MXN10.7640) Friday, down 14% year-to-date, while Comercial Mexicana UBD shares finished at MXN29.50, up 5.8% from the end of December. \u001d  Soriana B shares have been an exception, rising 48% year-to-date to MXN34.97 at the close Friday. \u001d  -By Anthony Harrup, Dow Jones Newswires; (5255) 5080 3450, anthony.harrup@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:59 ET (20:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4f156d965d7401bb7d3fcc436df045de","symR":["RMV.LN","GB00B0MFTM73","RMV.LN","GB00B0MFTM73"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Rightmove Sees FY Rev, Pretax Pft In Line With Views","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RMV.LN","GB00B0MFTM73"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","MED"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Rightmove said Friday it is confident profit before tax for the full year will be no less than the current consensus of analysts' forecasts. \u001d  The consensus of analysts' estimates for profit before tax, before share option (IFRS 2) charges, is GBP29.9 million. \u001d  The company said given the continued growth in new members, high retention rates and a strong uptake of Rightmove Choice differentiation products in the first half, the board is confident revenue and profit before tax will meet analysts' estimates. \u001d  It said key achievements for the half year have been: \b \b * Web site traffic up 58% on the first six months of 2006 at 24.3 million visits per month, with Rightmove now accounting for 82% of all pages served on the top four U.K. property websites, up from 80% a year ago \b \b * Overall year-on-year increase of 26% in customer numbers from 14,680 to 18,515.

The pair also have 26% and 18% stakes in Golden, valued at a combined $960 million. \u001d  Alfa's telecoms arm Altimo and Golden both declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Telenor said the company may consider an offer, although none has been received as yet. \u001d  \"The acquisition would transform VimpelCom into an integrated telecom operator offering a full range of fixed-line and mobile services,\" said Konstantin Chernyshev, joint head of research at investment bank UralSib. \u001d  VimpelCom is Russia's No. 2 cellular operator with almost 50 million subscribers in its home market at the end of May. Golden offers fixed-line telephony as well as high-speed and wireless Internet and is the largest player in the country's lucrative corporate segment. \u001d  Deutsche Bank analyst Alexei Yakovitsky said the tie-up would make strategic sense. \u001d  \"From a broader long-term perspective, adding a strong fixed-line component to VimpelCom's mobile business should be viewed positively.\" \u001d  Yakovitsky notes that VimpelCom's biggest rival OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) is already well-placed to begin offering converged fixed-to-mobile services, which are still in the early stages of development. \u001d  MTS' owner AFK Sistema (SSA.LN) controls another alternative player OAO Comstar United TeleSystems (CMST.LN) and also holds a blocking stake in the government's fixed-line holding OAO Svyazinvest. \u001d  Yakovitsky has a buy recommendation on VimpelCom, while UralSib's Chernyshev rates it a hold. \u001d  Both said they would expect VimpelCom - which had more than $700 million in cash on its balance sheet at the end of March - to pursue a controlling stake in Golden should they acquire the initial 44%. \u001d  However, analysts also agreed that it's tricky to assess the likelihood of any deal, as Altimo and Telenor remain locked in a long-running spat over VimpelCom's Ukrainian expansion strategy. \u001d  VimpelCom's American Depositary Receipts closed Thursday 0.4% higher at $110.6.

A 2.3% rise in imports also showed a strong rise in demand for capital goods. \u001d  Citigroup's Halmarick warned that next month's data mightn't prove as good, given that coal exports from the Port of Newcastle will have been disrupted by the June storms. \u001d  But it's the continued global demand for commodities that's expected to contribute to the Aussie's buoyancy. \u001d  In recent weeks, investors have been increasingly reassured that the slowdown that is emerging in the U.S. economy won't have a major influence elsewhere. \u001d  In other words, strong demand for commodities is likely to continue as other major economies, including China, are expected to expand at recent accelerated levels. \u001d  \"The continued rise of commodity prices will keep the Australian dollar supported,\" said Sharada Selvanathan, a currency strategist with BNP Paribas in Singapore. \u001d  Gibbs at ABN-Amro reckons this greater confidence in the global economy will help to boost underlying demand for high yielders in general. \u001d  \"While risk factors remain and are even more crystallized, the ability of the market to shrug these off over the last month makes one think the correction in asset prices has to be larger and more sustained to drive a meaningful correction in high yield currencies,\" Gibbs said, referring to the recent slide in global equities. \u001d  If all this isn't enough to justify a continued rally in the Aussie, analysts also point to evidence of continued strong appetite from Japanese investors keen to put their money in assets outside their country. With Japanese rates still down at only 0.50% and the Bank of Japan showing little inclination to signal an early hike, these flows are likely to continue. \u001d  Nevertheless, Gibbs reckons that $0.900 may prove to be a cap for the Aussie. The strength of the currency will eventually take its toll on the economy and on inflation and the global economy will eventually head into decline, taking commodity prices with it. \"The timing and extent of such a decline are impossible to know and may be several years yet in the making,\" Gibbs said. \"As such,\" he added, \"our forecast next year is simply that the Australian dollar is centered on $0.9000.\" \u001d  The Aussie ticked higher in early European trading, rising to $0.8561 by 0645 GMT from $0.8558 late Thursday in New York, according to EBS. \u001d  This came as a resumption in carry trades, alongside  some stronger U.S. data, helped to lift the dollar to Y123.28 from Y122.90. The euro was able to push ahead to a new record high of Y167.47 before slipping back to trade at Y167.41, compared with Y167.10 in New York. \u001d  The euro was down at $1.3582 from $1.3598 after the European Central Bank failed to be as hawkish as some hoped after its policy meeting Thursday. \b \u001d  Bloomberg TNI FRX POV \b   Reuters   USD/DJ \b   Thomson   P/1066 or P/1074 \u001d  (Nick Hastings has covered the foreign exchange markets and industry for over 15 years.

In a statement issued for its annual general meeting, the airline said it plans to raise its seat capacity by 14.6% during 2007 including a 19% rise in long-haul routes. \u001d  Also on Friday, Aer Lingus said it saw a 13.8% rise in passenger traffic measured in revenue passenger kilomters during June compared to a year earlier. It reported a slight drop in the monthly load factor - a measure of how full its planes are - to 80.1% from 81.2%. \u001d  By 1158 GMT, Aer Lingus shares were up 1.8%, or EUR0.03, at EUR2.571 in Dublin. \u001d  Aer Lingus added that it has good scope to boost its non-ticket revenues going forward. \u001d  The company was partially privatized by the Irish Government last autumn. Shortly after listing on the Dublin and London stock exchanges, rival Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY) launched a EUR1.48 billion hostile takeover bid that was recently blocked by the European Union Commission due to anti-trust concerns. \u001d  Ryanair holds a 25.2% stake in Aer Lingus and is appealing the E.U.'s decision. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.aerlingus.com \b \u001d  -By Rod Stone, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 9295; rod.stone@dowjones.com \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:07 ET (12:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"52c577a68b3560406b66a92b787b9a80","symR":["CUP.U.T","KYG1899E1465"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Caribbean Utils Started At Outperf, C$13.60: Natl Bk>CUP.U.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CUP.U.T","KYG1899E1465"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:57 ET (11:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5309ad225dadac4db0d834e2b1a3ddf8","symR":["WGNB"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"WGNB Corp.

Libby, an aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, had been convicted for obstructing the investigation in the leak of an intelligence agent's identity. \u001d  \"What nobody has focused on in the commutation is that Libby's appeals process continues,\" he said. \"This gives him the opportunity to use the Fifth (Amendment) in the (Valerie) Plame civil suit. This strengthens his position. The big thing is he's not going to jail.\" \u001d  The 64-year-old Pearlstine is now a senior adviser to the Carlyle Group, but is best known for his journalistic incarnations as editor in chief of Time Inc. (TWX) and managing editor of The Wall Street Journal. \u001d  But even Pearlstine, who also has studied law, wasn't prepared for the twists and turns that came his way at Time Inc., when the company gave prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald the notes of Time reporter Matt Cooper dealing with a \"confidential source.\" \u001d  Bush's act left convinced Pearlstine that \"I don't think there ever should've been an investigation,\" he commented in Carlyle's Midtown Manhattan offices. \b \b   Must-Read \b \u001d  Perhaps the only positive development to come from this mess was Pearlstine's book. \u001d  It doesn't matter whether you agree with his strategy and philosophy. \"Off the Record\" is a must-read for journalists, a cautionary tale straight out of Kafka. \u001d  Pearlstine explains how reporters and editors can make well-intentioned mistakes in protecting their sources - at a time when the government is doing its best to limit investigative reporting. \u001d  Something else struck me as I read Pearlstine's narrative. There weren't any genuine heroes among the key players: the administration, the prosecutor, the media organizations and their lawyers, the journalists, Time Inc., the New York Times or even Pearlstine himself. \u001d  \"God knows, I made my share of mistakes,\" he conceded. At one point, Pearlstine started to call this episode it a comedy of errors, but quickly clarified his view. \u001d  \"A tragedy of errors got us to where we ended up,\" he said. \"My biggest regret was that I came so late to all of this. I'd prided myself on delegating responsibility. But this case was so important, I should've jumped in earlier.\" \u001d  In retrospect, \"I didn't know what I didn't know.\" \u001d  Pearlstine doesn't condemn everyone. \"The jury is still out on Patrick Fitzgerald. I am sympathetic to him.\" \u001d  In \"Off the Record,\" published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Pearlstine is tough on the New York Times and famed First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams. Pearlstine depicts Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. as often appearing to be overly image-conscious. Times spokeswoman Catherine Mathis declined to comment. \b \b   Vindication \b \u001d  This saga affected Pearlstine in a profoundly personal way. \u001d  When he cooperated with the government, many media figures charged that Pearlstine had betrayed his profession. He was cast as the villain, especially when New York Times reporter Judith Miller went to prison for 85 days instead of identifying her source. \u001d  As it turned out, Miller lost her wings. She exited the Times in November 2005 following sharp criticism over her stories leading up to the invasion of Iraq. The New York Times itself had to address accusations that it had done a poor job of supervising Miller. \u001d  \"I found vindication in the fall of 2005,\" Pearlstine told me. \"Although there are still people who disagree with me, I had felt vindication from many journalists.\" \u001d  I'm not completely convinced, though. I think \"Off the Record\" contains a confessional tone. \u001d  Pearlstine learned many lessons. \"The 'e' in 'email' should stand for evidence,\" he said. \u001d  I laughed; it was a clever line. But Pearlstine wasn't smiling at all. \b \b   Murdoch And Dow Jones \b \u001d  Pearlstine is fascinated by the ongoing saga of News Corp.'s (NWS) attempted takeover of Dow Jones & Co. (DJ), the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and Dow Jones Newswires, the publisher of this column. \u001d  Many observers have portrayed News Corp. chief Rupert Murdoch as an utterly unwanted presence at Dow Jones. When I asked Pearlstine what he would advise Marcus Brauchli, the new managing editor of the Journal, about Murdoch, he thought for a moment and answered: \"Don't try to shut him out. But don't shy away from covering it.\" \u001d  Pearlstine flashed a small grin and added: \"He's a smart guy who might even give you scoops.\" \u001d  Above all, Pearlstine said: \"You work for your readers and your staff.\" \u001d  (Jon Friedman is Media Editor for MarketWatch in New York.) \u001d  -Jon Friedman; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:09 ET (12:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"53d1c377e5aef7fb6600088eca22a0ec","symR":["GET"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Gaylord Entertainment Company to Present at the CIBC World Markets 7th Annual Consumer Growth Conference on Thursday, July 12, 2007 at 3:30 p.m. ET","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GET"],"IndustryCodes":["LOD","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\bNASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \u001d  Gaylord Entertainment Company (NYSE: GET) announced today that it will present to investors attending the CIBC World Markets 7th Annual Consumer Growth Conference being held at the Four Season Hotel in Boston, MA, on Thursday, July 12 at 3:30 p.m. ET.

But there is still a gap in how both sides value the firm, which specializes in corporate buyouts, according to people familiar with the matter - and a deal is anything but certain. \u001d  Any possible deal would likely resemble Blackstone Group LP's sale of less than 10% of the firm to an arm of the Chinese government just before that company's initial public offering of shares. To avoid any potential backlash, the Chinese didn't want and didn't get any voting rights. If Apollo and Abu Dhabi were to reach agreement, the stake most probably would be nonvoting. \u001d  While little known in the U.S., the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is believed to be the wealthiest investment fund among the Persian Gulf countries, with estimates of its value ranging from $500 billion to as much as $1 trillion. It is considered one of the most sophisticated investors in the region. \u001d  Analysts believe it may well be the largest investor in emerging-market stocks, and it has a long history of investing in private-equity funds and investing alongside them in some of their larger purchases. The organization also invests in hedge funds and property. It already has a close relationship with Apollo, since it took up about $600 million, or almost half, of Apollo's offering of an investment fund, AP Alternative Assets LP, that listed in Europe last year. \u001d  Senior officials at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority declined to comment. A spokesman for Apollo also declined to comment. \u001d  Mr. Black, who founded Apollo in 1990 and owns about 50% of the firm, has been considering selling a stake in the company for several months. In one scenario under consideration, the firm would sell a 10% stake for $1.5 billion. Mr. Black, 56 years old, would get about half the proceeds. People close to the firm say it is considering several options, and might not do a deal at all. \u001d  While much of the world's attention has been focused on China, the coffers of the Gulf countries collectively hold greater sums. HSBC calculates that the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the members of the United Arab Emirates, hold a quarter of all U.S. Treasurys. The countries have $1.6 trillion to invest abroad, and that will swell to $2.5 trillion in just three years. \u001d  Apollo, which has specialized in buying companies that are too troubled or difficult to figure out for its rivals, has returned an average of 35% a year over the past 15 years through a combination of buyouts and investments in distressed securities. \u001d  Such a deal would burnish Mr. Black's reputation as a savvy operator, though it could be complicated by his tough negotiating tactics. And it would also allow Mr. Black to keep pace with Blackstone founder Stephen Schwarzman, who took his company public last month, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. founder Henry Kravis, who filed to take his firm public earlier this week. \u001d  The potential investment by the Abu Dhabi fund highlights the importance of so-called sovereign investment funds, which are charged with investing government savings. \u001d  Booming exports of oil and manufactured goods have boosted government savings in dozens of countries, and these funds are diversifying beyond their traditional favorite investment - U.S. Treasury bonds. That is in part to lower their exposure to the U.S., but mainly they want to boost their returns. \u001d  This shift has been controversial because of the role governments are playing in global markets. Recently, current and former Treasury officials have been voicing concern about the lack of disclosure, or \"transparency,\" of these huge pools of money. \u001d  For example, at a recent conference organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Edwin Truman, now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted that the \"lack of transparency and accountability governing these holdings poses risks to the global financial system.\" Clay Lowery, assistant secretary for international affairs at the Treasury, raised similar concerns at the conference. \u001d  The rise in reserves looking for higher returns is having an impact on world-wide asset prices and currency levels. For example, the decision of some governments to diversify away from the passive accumulation of U.S. Treasury debt has been one explanation for the weakness of the dollar and a partial explanation of the rise in interest rates in the U.S. \u001d  Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein was among the earliest and most frequent visitors to the Gulf to raise money. But recently, all the major private-equity firms and hedge funds have started to make the journey regularly. \u001d  Apollo has always been highly regarded in the Middle East. \u001d  \"They have a flexible style,\" says the head of private equity for another Gulf country's investment arm, who also praises the firm for getting good prices on deals and for going it alone rather than teaming up with other firms. \u001d  Mr. Black has been coy about when and whether he would take Apollo public, although bankers say he is likely to do so. At a conference in April in Los Angeles, he told his audience that the best thing about being private was being private. \u001d  The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, along with some of its counterparts in the region, has expressed mixed views about firms like Blackstone and KKR going public and the merits of taking stakes in their management companies. \u001d  Still, Abu Dhabi and the investment arm of the government of Qatar are believed to have approached Blackstone for significant stakes before its public debut, according to people familiar with the matter. \u001d  The last time the Gulf countries received windfall profits from surging oil prices much of the money was spent or wasted. This time, the governments of the region are taking a more professional approach to their gains. Abu Dhabi accounts for about 7% of all the world's oil reserves. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 00:00 ET (04:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"54fe14c41bd4f346396f5a3503606aa9","symR":["GENZ"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Genzyme Corp (GENZ) Block: 424,400 Shrs At 61.59","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GENZ"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bGENZYME CORP. \bLast trade NADF: -3.28 at 61.59 on zero tick \bTrade vol:       424,400 =    7.3% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   2,073,338 =   35.7% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:     394,411 =   16.6% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:       5,807,424 =  244.0% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol: 2,380,278 / Prev day -0.71 on 1,432,816 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:28 ET (14:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"552dfcad2d03b8a8dbd74e99e38c4358","symR":["RTH"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9974849],"ret5":[0.9922701],"Headline":"Retail HOLDRS (RTH) Block: 100,000 Shrs At 107.00","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RTH"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\bRETAIL HOLDRS TRUST DUE DEC 31 2041 \bLast trade  NMS: +1.37 at 107.00 on zero tick \bTrade vol:       100,000 =    4.3% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:     628,400 =   26.9% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:   1,148,265 =   33.2% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:       2,336,300 =   67.6% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol: 3,453,554 / Prev day +0.49 on 2,311,800 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:24 ET (15:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"55b435f909684155f2fabc1996883b1e","symR":["BRV.LN","BT","BT.A.LN","GB0030913577","GB0032784844","XS0097283096"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,1.011099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.028199,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"BT Group Acquires Brightview Group For GBP15.8M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BRV.LN","BT","BT.A.LN","GB0030913577","GB0032784844","XS0097283096"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","ISV","TLS","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:07 ET (06:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"55c27dbab34daa3e4d1451c8ba568ab2","symR":["BFTH"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Bally Total Fitness Hldrs Propose Alternate Restructure Plan","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BFTH"],"IndustryCodes":["RCS","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:05 ET (13:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"55ce78dceae753141e2c9086cc8f22c2","symR":["AGA.LN","GB00B1W2X453"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"2nd UPDATE: AGA To Sell Foodservice Operations, Shrs Up","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T07:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AGA.LN","GB00B1W2X453"],"IndustryCodes":["HPD","HPR","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \b   By Daniel Fromson \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--AGA Foodservice Group PLC (AGA.LN), a maker of cookers and refrigerators for the consumer, foodservice, and bakery markets, said Friday that it would sell its foodservice operations, sending its shares 7% higher at the market opening. \u001d  In its first-half trading update, AGA said it is working with Dresdner Kleinwort and CitiGroup to \"unlock the value\" of its foodservice businesses for shareholders by selling the operations, which last year, including a recent acquisition, accounted for revenue of about GBP270 million, just below half of the total. \u001d  At 0737 GMT, AGA shares were up 22 pence, or 5.8%, to 408 pence. \u001d  \"We have leading edge products, a good geographical spread and considerable momentum within our foodservice businesses,\" said Chief Executive William McGrath. \"As was the case with our Pipe Systems businesses in the run up to their disposal in 2001 we have now created pivotal market positions for these businesses and are again looking to unlock value for shareholders.\" \u001d  Should it divest its foodservice operations, AGA's business strategy would look much the same as it did after the sale of Pipe Systems for GBP800 million, McGrath said on a conference call. The group plans to continue expansion - as it did in 2001, leading to a firm that is nearly twice as large today - by refocusing on its core consumer holdings through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. \u001d  McGrath said that while plans for the foodservice sale have been in the works for several months, AGA has only recently begun searching for bidders. He said the group is \"ready to kick on\" with the process and doesn't want it to be \"too elongated,\" with a sale anticipated by the end of the current year. \u001d  In Friday's trading update, AGA also announced that it expects a 10% rise in first-half pretax profit and that full year trading in line with management's expectations. \u001d  The group estimates profit before tax for its continuing businesses of GBP22 million for the half year to June 30, up from GBP20 million in the comparative period. The results strip out \"a small overall loss\" from Domain, the struggling home fashions business that AGA sold just over two weeks ago for GBP3.5 million. \u001d  Strong performance in consumer and foodservice operations underpinned the first-half results, while the bakery sector was slower, the company said. \u001d  In March, AGA reported underlying pretax profits of GBP46 million for fiscal 2006, an increase of 7.7% against the previous year. The figure stripped out a GBP5.9 million loss posted by AGA's recently divested Domain business. \u001d  At the time, Group Finance Director Shaun Smith said the company was looking at acquisitions in the food-service side of its business, with a special focus on new technologies. He said accelerated food cooking, energy efficiency and healthy eating would be key themes in AGA's future growth strategy. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.agafoodservice.com \b \u001d  -By Daniel Fromson, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9463; daniel.fromson@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 03:40 ET (07:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"55d6ae865f65166677c60a7de426708b","symR":["AAPL","US0378331005"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9851111,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.049963,-0.00099],"Headline":"Apple (AAPL) Mkt On Open Buy Imbalance: Shrs 193522","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAPL","US0378331005"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:28 ET (13:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5607915be74ba2a7eb388f72b999c2ab","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","NL0000235190"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Dubai's Zabeel Investments Buys \"Strategic\" EADS Stake -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:53:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","NL0000235190"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XMDAX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Until now, Zabeel hasn't held a stake in EADS, a spokesman for the company told Dow Jones Newswires in Hamburg.

Based on information currently available, management believes the financial performance of 180 Connect for the second quarter of 2007 is in line with expectations,\" continued Mr. Giacalone. \"Also, in connection with the amendment agreement, Laurus has indicated that it intends to loan $10.0 million to a special purpose corporation for the purpose of purchasing shares of AVP common stock.\" \b \bPursuant to the terms of the agreement, Laurus agreed to provide an additional $8.0 million to the Corporation as an increase to the current $37.0 million revolving loan, for a total revolving loan of $45.0 million.

The special purpose corporation would be a third party that is not affiliated with either 180 Connect or AVP. Although 180 Connect anticipates that any shares purchased by the special purpose company would be purchased in privately negotiated transactions and would be voted in favor of the arrangement, neither the special purpose corporation nor Laurus have agreed to make any specific amount of purchases or to vote any shares purchased in any specific manner. \b \bIn connection with the completion of the amendment agreement, Laurus will receive warrants to purchase one million 180 Connect common shares with a 5-year term, exercisable at $2.61 per share, the market price at the time of issue, and subject to a 1 year lock-up. In addition, upon completion of the arrangement Laurus is entitled to receive warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of AVP with a 5-year term exercisable at the closing price on the date of the arrangement and subject to a 1 year lock-up. \b \bIn addition, 180 Connect and AVP agreed to an adjustment to the previously announced exchange ratio per AVP share of 0.627 to 0.6000 and to the elimination of a mechanism to adjust the exchange ratio based on relative transaction expenses of the parties. \b \bDetails of the Corporation's existing indebtedness are contained in 180 Connect's 2007 Annual Report, copies of which are available on the Corporation's website at www.180connect.net and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. \b \b180 Connect Inc. \b \b180 Connect Inc. is one of North America's largest providers of installation, integration and fulfillment services to the home entertainment, communications and home integration service industries.

Analysts and company executives say the outlook for the third quarter is bright as demand picks up especially for PC-use panels ahead of the back-to-school shopping season, and supply in the market remains tight. \u001d  \"LCD prices have risen sharply while companies have been working to lower manufacturing costs by moving production to more advanced facilities. That should enable most LCD makers to report a second quarter profit and the outlook for the third quarter is even better,\" said Hyun-Sik Moon, an analyst at Seoul-based Meritz Securities. \u001d  The price of a 17-inch LCD monitor panel rose to US$127 early July from US$122 late June, according to Taiwan-based market research firm WitsView Technology Corp. Meanwhile, the price of the mainstream 32-inch LCD TV panel rose to US$320 from US$315 in the same time frame. \u001d  U.S. market research firm iSuppli Corp. expects monitor panel prices to increase another 2% to 3% by September from now, while it forecasts a 5% to 6% increase in notebook panels over the same period. For TV panels below 37-inches, the research firm expects prices to increase up to 2%. \u001d  WitsView Chief Executive Henry Wang said panel prices are rising because manufacturers have been carefully monitoring their factory utilization rates and set makers are building up inventory anticipating strong demand for their products in the third quarter. \u001d  U.S. market research firm DisplaySearch this week revised up its 2007-2008 forecast for revenue in the global flat-panel-display industry by 6%, citing rising LCD prices. The firm now expects industry revenue to reach $92.7 billion this year and $102.0 billion in 2008. \u001d  LCD makers are upbeat about the outlook for the market in the second half, with Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE), the world's biggest maker of LCDs, expecting a shortage of panels to lead to a better pricing environment. \u001d  \"We aren't able to supply all of our orders at the moment. Demand is extremely strong for all applications including TV panels,\" said Yeongduk Cho, vice president of the company's LCD business. \"We were profitable in the second quarter and we expect to continue to be profitable throughout this year.\" \u001d  Cho said that he expects prices of LCD TV panels to remain stable in the second half, while he anticipates prices for notebook and monitor panels to continue to rise. He didn't provide specific figures. \u001d  Executives at AU Optronics Corp. (AUO), Taiwan's biggest maker of LCDs by revenue, said the LCD maker will post a profit in the second quarter, after reporting a record net loss of NT$5.11 billion in the first quarter. \u001d  On Thursday, AU Optronics reported that shipments of large-sized panels used in desktop monitors, notebook personal computers and LCD TVs, set a new record of 6.84 million units in June, up 5.1% from May. The company also said that preliminary shipments of large-sized panels rose 22% from the first quarter to reach 19.48 million in the second quarter. \u001d   \"There will be a slight shortage of LCD TV panels from this summer towards autumn,\" said Sharp Corp. (6753.TO) spokeswoman Miyuki Nakayama. \"Compared to last year, the supply-demand situation is tighter.\" Sharp makes the Aquos-brand LCD TVs.   Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp. (3009.TW) Chief Financial Officer Eddie Chen said the company's second quarter results were \"pretty good\" without providing specific figures and said the outlook for the third quarter \"looks promising.\" \u001d  \"Prices particularly in the monitor segment have been pretty stable and in certain cases we've been able to raise the prices. That was backed by pretty solid demand,\" said Chen. \"I think seasonal demand will propel the market in the third quarter with more orders leading up to the back-to-school shopping season.\" \u001d   However, some analysts warned that TV panel prices, especially those for 40-inches and above, may fall as more capacity comes online. Companies such as South Korea-based  LG.Philips LCD Co. (LPL), AU Optronics and Chi Mei are all boosting capacity from seventh-generation facilities. \u001d  \"Prices will likely only increase for PC-use panels. It will be difficult on the TV side because end product prices aren't going up,\" said Citigroup analyst George Chang. \u001d  iSuppli analyst Sweta Dash said 40-inch and above TV panel prices may continue to fall in the third quarter but at a slower rate. \u001d  \"Even though supply will increase, there has been a major slow down in capacity expansion plans in 2007 that will help to keep supply tight in the third quarter,\" which should prevent prices from falling too steeply. \b \b                Table of Average LCD Panel Prices \b                 July 5   June 20  June 5  May 21 \bLCD TV \b  42-inch          $550     $555     $555   $555 \b  40-inch          $510     $535     $535   $535 \b  37-inch          $450     $450     $450   $450 \b  32-inch          $320     $315     $315   $310 \bMonitor \b  19-inch          $147     $142     $142   $135 \b  17-inch          $127     $122     $122   $115 \bNotebook \b  15.4-inch wide   $101     $100     $100    $98 \b  14.1-inch wide   $103      $98      $98    $95 \b \b   Source: WitsView \b \u001d  -By Yun-Hee Kim, Dow Jones Newswires; 852-2832-2330; yun-hee.kim@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:49 ET (06:49 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"586fcdfaa6dfa9b0dc9cf0d35db566f3","symR":["ABB","ABB.SK","ABBN.VX","CH0012221716"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.008827,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.025221,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ABB Gets C$50M Power Order From Manitoba Hydro >ABB","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABB","ABB.SK","ABBN.VX","CH0012221716"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XSMI","XSXA"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  ABB Ltd.

The schedule for the flotation has been accelerated due to pressure from shareholders. \u001d  Floating 25% of Rusal would net the company around $7.5 billion, the person said.

But investors have shunned some offerings because they thought the deals were too expensive, or because they have been concerned about corporate governance standards. \u001d  Insurance company Reso-Garantia postponed its initial public offering June 21 because its owners couldn't get a sufficiently high valuation. The deal would have been the first offering from a Russian insurance company, following some major deals for Russian banks. \u001d  In an attempt to bring a higher level of disclosure, Rusal is set to conduct a primary listing of ordinary shares rather than offering global depository receipts. \u001d  Many Russian companies that have listed in London previously have opted for GDRs because the associated listing requirements are less strict. \b \u001d   -By Lisa Yuriko Thomas, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9410; lisa.thomas@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:47 ET (11:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"590fd9309908d3b88e8951c15a9e2b9a","symR":["WPT.T","CA9609081018"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Westport Innovations Hldr To Convert Debs, Sell Shrs >WPT.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WPT.T","CA9609081018"],"IndustryCodes":["TRQ","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Westport Innovations Inc.

EETC's are hybrid corporate - structured debt obligations in which payment on the notes is effectively supported by the underlying corporate entity, while structured elements of the transaction provide some protection to investors in the event of an issuer default.  As such, Fitch's ratings on EETC transactions begin with the underlying Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of the issuing entity and are adjusted upward depending on the structural enhancements in place.  Based on the foregoing, Fitch lowered its EETC ratings for NWA following their Sept. 14, 2005 bankruptcy filing.  As a result of NWA's re-emergence from bankruptcy protection, Fitch anticipates that, subject to the availability of certain information related to the collateral and any modifications of transaction structures, ratings on EETC tranches will improve due to the improvement in the implied credit-worthiness of the issuer.  The affected EETC classes are as follows: \u001d  NWA Trust No. 2 \u001d  --Class A rated 'BBB+'; \u001d  --Class B rated 'BB'; \u001d  --Class C rated 'B'; \u001d  --Class D rated 'CCC/DR1'. \u001d  Northwest Airlines Pass Through Certificates, Series 1996-1 \u001d  --Class A rated 'B-/DR2'; \u001d  --Class B rated 'CC/DR6'; \u001d  --Class C rated 'C/DR6'. \u001d  Northwest Airlines European Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates, Series 2001-2 \u001d  --Class A rated 'BBB+'; \u001d  --Class B rated 'B'. \u001d  Northwest Airlines Pass Through Certificates, Series 2002-1 \u001d  --Class C-1 rated 'B'; \u001d  --Class C-2 rated 'B'. \u001d  Northwest Airlines Pass Through Certificates, Series 2003-1 \u001d  --Class D rated 'C'. \u001d  Fitch's Distressed Recovery (DR) ratings, introduced in April 2006 across all sectors of structured finance, are designed to estimate recoveries on a forward-looking basis while taking into account the time value of money. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:43 ET (17:43 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5a195d83df42842afe9c090b4ee0602b","symR":["SIGM"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9809015],"ret5":[1.239114],"Headline":"Chmn TRAN Sells 24,843 Of SIGMA DESIGNS INC >SIGM","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SIGM"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: SIGMA DESIGNS INC \bSYMBOL: SIGM \b \bFILER: TRAN THINH Q \bTITLE: Chairman of the Board \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Sale                    24,843      $26.32         $653,975 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 290,000 (Direct)  251,293 (Indirect) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

(NYSE:PDE) today announced that the company will construct an advanced-capability, dual activity drillship for use in ultra-deepwater drilling locations. The new rig will be capable of drilling in water depths of up to 12,000 feet, with a total vertical drilling depth of up to 40,000 feet. The rig, to be constructed by Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (SHI) on a fixed-price basis, is expected to be delivered from the shipyard in the third quarter 2010, following construction, commissioning and system integrated testing. \u001d  Louis A. Raspino, president and chief executive officer of Pride International, stated, \"Customer requirements for deepwater drilling capacity continue to expand, as successful results in exploration drilling lead to prolonged field development programs around the world, placing deepwater assets in short supply beyond the end of the decade. As a result of activity levels, it has become increasingly difficult to match shipyard delivery dates with customer requirements. Our commitment to build this unit was initially driven by the need to protect the delivery date necessary to meet a specific customer requirement. While we have not reached an agreement with that customer, we do believe it is important to proceed given the long-term market outlook and attractive delivery date.\" \u001d  Raspino added, \"We are highly confident that the favorable conditions in the deepwater sector will persist, producing attractive contracting opportunities for deepwater drilling rigs. As a result, we are committing to the construction of this premium asset, demonstrating continued progress toward our strategic direction of expansion in the deepwater sector. \u001d  \"The addition of this premium, ultra-deepwater rig to our fleet, which currently ranks second in the industry for dynamically positioned, deepwater drilling units, improves our ability to prosper in the long-term strength of the deepwater market and better serve our customers' needs worldwide,\" Raspino said. \u001d  The new drillship, to be named at a later date, is based on an SHI proprietary hull design measuring 750 feet long, 140 feet wide and offering a variable deck load of 20,000 metric tons. The rig will feature dynamic positioning station-keeping with DPS-3 certification. In addition, the rig will have dual activity capabilities, designed to save customers time during the well construction process when compared to conventional single activity rigs. The company has obtained a license from the patent holder to utilize the dual activity technology. \u001d  The rig will also have expanded drilling fluids capacity, a 1,000 ton top drive and living quarters for up to 200 personnel. The drillship will be constructed at the SHI shipyard in Geoje, South Korea and will be initially equipped for drilling in water depths up to 8,000 feet. The expected fixed-price project cost of the rig, including commissioning and system integrated testing, is approximately $680 million, excluding capitalized interest. The company expects to fund the cost of the rig through available cash and borrowing against its revolving credit facility. \u001d  Pride International, Inc. will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET on Monday, July 9, 2007, to discuss in greater detail today's announcement.

(LMT) missile program that is in danger of termination, the Air Force's chief weapons buyer told Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  Assistant Air Force Secretary Sue Payton said the Air Force hopes to have a new plan for the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, or JASSM, by mid-July. The long-range, stealthy cruise missile is designed to hit hard-to-get-to, heavily defended targets. \u001d  But the $5.8 billion program has been in limbo since early June, when Kenneth Krieg, the Defense Department's top procurement official, declined to certify it was essential to national security after a major review triggered by cost overruns. \u001d  JASSM came up for another review on June 27. Again, Krieg decided the program wasn't ready. In a statement, the Pentagon said it was continuing to work the issue through the so-called Nunn-McCurdy process, which covers programs that are over budget enough to require congressional review. \u001d  Now the Air Force is working with Lockheed Martin to fix JASSM's problems, spotted through a series of test failures. \u001d  \"We want a proactive, preventative plan where things aren't going to break as much as they have been breaking,\" Payton said in a Thursday interview. \"Lockheed Martin is not happy with the reliability on this program, and neither are we.\" \u001d  Questions about the missile's guidance kits are the biggest reliability concern. So far, however, there are no indications the guidance problem affects other precision weapons in the Air Force inventory, Payton said. \u001d  The Pentagon already has about 600 of the JASSM missiles in its inventory, and program plans call for buying about 4,000 more. Last month, the Air Force said there are no restrictions on use of the weapon. For now, military officials say the reliability questions just mean that the Air Force would have to use more missiles if it needed them to attack an important target. \u001d  Lockheed Martin and the Air Force are due to meet Monday to work on the new plan, Payton said. She said the Air Force may be able to work within the company's existing contract, rather than seeking major modifications. \u001d  \"We want Lockheed Martin to make a fair and reasonable profit on this system,\" Payton said. \u001d  In a statement after the Defense Department's latest delay, Lockheed Martin said it understands the Pentagon's concerns. The company said it wants to find a plan to fix the missile and get the program off the Pentagon's endangered list. \u001d  \"We are confident that such a plan will evolve, and we look forward to proceeding with flight tests of the system as early as September of this year,\" Lockheed Martin said. \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; rebecca.christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:01 ET (13:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5a996b9bee4114440bb0a8bac8a61580","symR":["TK","MHY8564W1030"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.984905,-0.00099],"ret5":[0.9520014,-0.00099],"Headline":": S&P Removes Teekay Corp.

At the same time, Standard & Poor's removed the ratings from CreditWatch with negative implications, where they were placed Sept. 1, 2006. The outlook is negative. \u001d  \"The ratings on Teekay reflect its exposure to the competitive and price-taking spot tanker segment, which contributed to about half of its operating income; a weakened financial risk profile following recent debt-financed acquisitions of Petrojarl and OMI Corp.; and a generally shareholder-friendly distribution policy,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Greg Pau. \"Partially mitigating these risks are a number of positives, including Teekay's market-leading and defendable position in the shuttle tanker business, increasing revenue contribution from more stable liquefied gas and offshore segments, a strong customer base, and a young fleet,\" Mr. Pau added. \u001d  Teekay has realized its strategy to become a full-range service provider to the midstream oil and gas industry through acquisitions and newbuilding orders. The company has turned its offshore and liquefied gas segments into listed master limited partnerships and is in the process of incorporating its tanker business as a listed company, each to be governed by a different set of financial policies. Nevertheless, Standard & Poor's continues to assess Teekay's credit as an integrated group in accordance with our criteria, given the effective management control over, and strategic significance of, the operating subsidiaries by the parent company. Teekay's market position has also improved across the different segments with its operation of an extensive 159-vessel fleet and it has a leading market share in the shuttle tanker segment, which should be defendable given its capital intensity, protection from long-term contracts, strong track record, and customer relationships. \u001d  The outlook is negative. Despite Teekay's strengthened product offering and market positions, its weak leveraged financial risk profile and significant exposure to the spot tanker market remain significant limitations to any potential upside to the rating. The negative outlook also reflects that Teekay's effort to deleverage and improve its cash flow coverage measures remains subject to cash flow volatility and execution of planned equity issuances by its subsidiary entities. Whether or not this effort will be successful could be affected by spot tanker market volatility, the capital-intensive nature of the business, and unpredictable equity market conditions. The outlook could be revised to stable if the company demonstrates good progress in improving its financial measures to levels more consistent with its current rating level. Conversely, the rating or outlook could be revised downward if financial measures fail to improve in the next two years as a result of additional debt-funded acquisitions, substantial share repurchases, or a material downturn in spot crude freight rates. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:41 ET (17:41 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5a9c35879e73e624e484dd6da0c078f8","symR":["PHM"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9867958],"ret5":[0.9995599],"Headline":"Pulte Homes (PHM) No Mkt On Close Imbalance.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PHM"],"IndustryCodes":["HOM","HPR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:50 ET (19:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5b2a8e0df9793f1e13795e93b42ebc7c","symR":["AA","AL","AL.T","CA0137161059","US0138171014"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.016803,1.005435,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.118819,1.117137,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Justice Dept Seeks More Info On Alcoa Offer For Alcan","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AA","AL","AL.T","CA0137161059","US0138171014"],"IndustryCodes":["ALU","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:02 ET (13:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5b2bfb565e6984d24654aa0ee9dd538d","symR":["AKVER.OS","AKY.OS","NO0010215684","NO0010222995"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Aker Yards Shares Slump 28% As It Warns On FY","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T10:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AKVER.OS","AKY.OS","NO0010215684","NO0010222995"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","MAR","OIE","TRQ","XDJGI","XOBX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Elizabeth Cowley \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  OSLO (Dow Jones)--Aker Yards (AKY.OS) Friday warned that its full-year earnings would be lower than expected, sending its shares down more than 25%. \u001d  The company blamed the downturn on challenges at its three Finnish ship yards, and the consequent rise in ferry project cost estimates. \u001d  At 1010 GMT, Aker Yards shares were down NOK29.50, or 27.6%, at NOK77.50, their lowest level since July 2006. \u001d  Aker Yards said its full-year 2007 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, is expected to be between 1,000 million and 1,100 million Norwegian kroner ($171.9 million-$189.1 million), with net profit of around NOK800 million to NOK900 million. \u001d  The company had not previously guided on these figures, but analysts said the new figures would lead to drastic cuts in their estimates. Aker said it maintained its earlier announced long-term EBITDA margin target of 7%, which it had not expected to reach in 2007. \u001d  An Oslo-based analyst, who asked not to be named, said the warning would have a significant impact on his EBITDA estimates for Aker Yards, leading to a 50% cut in 2007 estimates, and a 24% cut in 2008 figures. \u001d  The increase in cost estimates at its Finnish yards is expected to result in a lower-than seen EBITDA margin of between 5%-6% in 2008, while the 2007 EBITDA margin in its cruise and ferries business area is seen at just 2.5%-3%, Aker Yards said. \u001d  Chief Executive Yrjo Julin told Dow Jones Newswires that the challenges in its Finnish ship yards have arisen \"recently.\" \u001d  \"We've seen in the past weeks, days, some deterioration of our project estimates. We've had both external and internal control groups going through the project and have received the information (prompting this profit warning) only a couple of days ago,\" Julin said. \u001d  \"It has come very fast and has had a knock on effect on the seven ferries\" on our order backlog, he added. Aker Yards said that of the seven ferries in its Finnish order backlog, five will be delivered in the next 12 months. \u001d  Julin said the problem there is two-fold. \u001d  \"We have a record high order book workload in Finland, especially affecting the ferries. So we're stretching our resources. In shipbuilding, if one ship is affected, there's a knock-on effect on the others,\" he said. \u001d  \"Secondly, the Finnish maritime cluster is stretched, prices are increasing because of the booming market\", affecting the cost of our projects, Julin added. \u001d  As a result of the ongoing evaluation of its Finnish operations, Aker Yards has postponed its second quarter results presentation to Aug. 24, \"to give us a little more time to look at the situation,\" Julin said. \u001d  \"Management will focus on improving the situation,\" he said. \u001d  The market's reaction to the surprise announcement was evident in the share price slide. \u001d  One Oslo-based analyst said the drop \"is warranted,\" saying \"this was very bad news,\" and adding that it's a worrying sign the company is unable to generate acceptable profit margin in this extremely good market. \u001d  \"It calls to question how they will handle a downturn in the economy,\" the analyst added. \u001d   Odin Europa SMB fund manager Truls Haugen said that, while the profit warning was severe, he sees the share price bouncing back, \"maybe today or next week.\" \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.akeryards.com \b \u001d  -By Elizabeth Cowley, Dow Jones Newswires; +47 22 20 10 58; elizabeth.cowley@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (Adam Ewing and Magnus Hansson in Stockholm also contributed to this story.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5b7b6257fda10103f645dd18719bc132","symR":["BOT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"CBOT Confirms No 'Ex-Dividend' Date","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BOT"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:24 ET (18:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5b863483ad82fba6bad6f05eb2c99d1d","symR":["ENTG"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9916388],"ret5":[0.9916388],"Headline":"CFO GRAVES Sells 2,000 Of ENTEGRIS INC >ENTG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ENTG"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: ENTEGRIS INC \bSYMBOL: ENTG \b \bFILER: GRAVES GREGORY B \bTITLE: Chief Financial Officer \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Sale                     2,000      $11.96          $23,920 \b(10b5-1 Plan Indicated)* \b \bOWNERSHIP: 70,530 (Direct) \b \b  * - A 10b5-1 plan enables an insider to establish a program to make trans- \b      actions according to an advance plan.

In line with the decline of the Mexico automotive industry during the second quarter, DaimlerChrysler Mexico sales fell 8 percent to 28,102 units.

A commission of union and oil-worker representatives wrote the report that was ordered by the energy ministry. \u001d  Petrobras produces about 35,000 barrels of oil a day in Ecuador. The company's plans to expand its output in the Andean country have been delayed by environmental snags. \u001d  Ecuador's Energy Minister Alban said that he could neither confirm nor exclude the possibility that his government will cancel Petrobras' contracts. \u001d  Ecuador last year canceled a contract with Occidental Petroleum Co. (OXY) after accusing the U.S. oil firm of wrongdoings, among them the unauthorized transfer of a 40% stake in its operations in Ecuador to Canadian oil firm Encana Corp. (ECA). Occidental Petroleum is seeking international arbitration regarding the decision. \u001d  The panel report makes similar charges against Petrobras, including that it tried to sell 40% of its stake in Ecuador's block 18 and Palu Azul oil fields to Japanese oil firm Teikoku Oil without the proper authorization. \u001d  In January 2005, Petrobras signed a preliminary contract over the sale and cooperation with the Japanese firm and a separate 40% stake in private heavy oil pipeline OCP. \u001d  Petrobras later communicated its intention to sell the stakes to the stock market regulator of the Buenos Aires stock exchange, although approval by Ecuadorian government was still pending. \u001d  In Ecuador, Petrobras is part of the company's Argentine subsidiary Petrobras Energia (PESA.BA), which is listed on the Buenos Aires stock exchange. \u001d  Petrobras Thursday said that it \"expects the Ecuadorian government will disregard the accusations...which may have been the justification for the investigation, as it (either) has or has requested all formal authorizations issued by the competent regulatory bodies.\" \u001d  Unions for Ecuador's state-owned oil firm Petroecuador and left-wing social groups have repeatedly demanded the government expel Petrobras from Ecuador. \b \u001d  -By Bernd Radowitz, Dow Jones Newswires; +5521-2553-7322; bernd.radowitz@dowjones.com; \u001d  (Mercedes Alvaro in Quito contributed to this report) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:39 ET (13:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5e77326a748a30aa32be1afef2914645","symR":["AKY.OS","NO0010222995","AKY.OS","NO0010222995"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Aker Yards Sees 2H Op Results Below Hopes","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AKY.OS","NO0010222995"],"IndustryCodes":["TRQ","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:36 ET (06:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5e7ab9444750b213fc32067e28cc2b95","symR":["WBSN"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Websense Acquisition of -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WBSN"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  The directors of Websense, Inc. accept responsibility for the information contained in this document, other than information relating to SurfControl plc.

people bought two or more iPhones last week in hopes of making a killing by selling them for a couple of hundred dollars or more above the $500-$600 list price? Some of these flyblown entrepreneurs had friends wait on line to buy iPhones that they hoped to resell at a premium. \u001d  More than a few of these people camped out on the sidewalk for as many as five days to ensure that they'd get the necessary iPhones for their get-rich-quick fantasies. \u001d  The obvious questions that come to mind are: Don't these people have jobs? Lives? Legitimate aspirations? When I was a bit younger and a bit more in shape than I am now, I could have picked up an extra $200 in a single day by mowing a few large lawns. \u001d  In a story in today's New York Times, here's how Katie Hafner encapsulates this tale of quiet desperation: \u001d  \"Last Friday, just after the first iPhones were sold, thousands of listings showed up on eBay and Craigslist, with prices of $1,000 for the 8-gigabyte phone, a $400 markup. Some bold sellers were asking $2,000. But as it became clear that supply was meeting demand, they found themselves stuck. Few of the phones have sold for more than $700, which after sales tax, is not a remarkable profit margin.\" \b \b   The Kids Are All Right \b \u001d  Benjamin Disraeli, prime minister of the U.K. from 1874 to 1880, said in a statement often credited to Mark Twain that there are three kinds of lies: \"Lies, damn lies, and statistics.\" \u001d  The most misleading statistics of all are percentages. Percentages are much beloved of reporters and news editors whose stories lack the punch to make a genuine splash. \u001d  For example, suppose that sniffing the fumes from burning bicycle tires were a nouveau form of drug abuse and that, last year, 10 people were treated for so doing, while this year 30 people were treated. Clearly, given the number of people in this country, sniffing the fumes from burning bicycle tires would be a bizarre rarity. \u001d  In order to make the story seem important, lead with the percentage of increase. Headline: \"Burning Bicycle-Tire Sniffing Skyrockets 300%\" \u001d  In that regard, Elizabeth Cohen of CNN filed a story with this headline: \"Experts: Pills Becoming the New Marijuana on Campus.\" \u001d  It's not a coincidence that the story appeared a day after Al Gore III was picked up in San Diego for alleged possession of prescription medicines that were not all his. \u001d  The way the minds of many news editors work is, \"Hey, Al Gore's kid got busted for prescription drugs. Maybe it's an epidemic. Let's do a story about it.\" \u001d  As any reporter knows, sources can always be found to give responses supportive of the presupposition upon which a story is built. \u001d  Are prescription drugs the new marijuana? \u001d  Joseph Califano, chairman and president of CASA, the National Center on Alcohol and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, told Ms. Cohen he wouldn't be at all surprised if that were so. \u001d  Now, for the lines from the story with the most eye-popping percentages: \"According to a CASA report, between 1993 and 2005 the proportion of college students abusing Vicodin and other opioids went up 343%, about 240,000 individuals. The numbers increased 450%, or by 170,000 students, for tranquilizers such as Xanax and Valium...\" \u001d  Since there are many millions of college students in the U.S., the fact that a couple of hundred thousand of them may be abusing prescription drugs is not a pandemic, nor is it any reason for parents to stop paying their kids' college tuition. \u001d  I have no doubt that the situation on campus is the same today as it was when I went to college in the 1960s: A minority of students abuse marijuana or prescription drugs. The substance of choice for abusers is alcohol. Most of these abusers outgrow this trait after graduation. In any case, while I was pouring down nickel drafties at the Polish American Club in Worcester, there were at least 10 Holy Cross students for every one of me who were clean and sober and hitting the books. \b \b   Killing Us Softee With His Song \b \u001d  There may not be Mr. Softee soft ice cream trucks where you live, but I'm sure that everywhere in the country there are ice cream trucks that blare out a jingle as they make their way around the neighborhood. \u001d  Here in the New York Metropolitan area, we have Mr. Softee trucks with their Mr. Softee jingle, which I can sing, but which Ruthie discourages. \u001d  In our neighborhood in Jersey City, we have a Mr. Softee truck come around every evening during the clement months. \u001d  In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has just toughened anti-noise regulations, after noting that the city's 311 helpline received more calls about excessive noise than about any other subject. \u001d  A ticketing blitz began this week. Fittingly, one of the first to receive a ticket was a Mr. Softee vendor. The Associated Press reported: \u001d  \"Costas 'Gus' Vamvakas received a citation while on his rounds in a Mr. Softee truck in Queens on Wednesday. The new rules require the popular ice cream chain to stop playing its signature jingle when trucks are stopped in residential areas. \u001d  \"Vamvakas was 'certainly one of the first' ice cream truck drivers cited under the new regulations, city Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Michael Saucier said. \u001d  \"Vamvakas, who was ticketed while stopped in a parking lot at Fort Totten Park, said he was aware of the rule but afraid he would lose business if he shut off the song.\" \u001d  The jingle, of course, is not aimed at parents, but at their children, who, more often than not, will respond, \"Maaaaa, Maaaaa, can we have Mister Softee? Please, please.\" \u001d  Mister Softee, which is headquartered in Runnemede, N.J., has 350 franchise dealers operating 600 trucks in 15 states. \u001d  For those of you who want to join me in singing the Mister Softee jingle, here are the words: \b   \"Here comes Mis-ter Sof-tee \b   \"The soft ice cream man \b   \"The creamiest dreamiest ice cream \b   \"You get from Mis-ter Sof-tee \b   \"For a refreshing delight supreme \b   \"Look for Mis-ter Sof-tee \b   \"My milk shakes and my sundaes and my cones are such a treat \b   \"Listen for my store on wheels ding-a-ling down the street \b   \"The creamiest dreamiest ice cream you get from Mis-ter Sof-tee \b   \"For a refreshing delight supreme \b   \"Look for Mis-ter Sof-tee \b   \"S-O-F-T-dubble-E Mis-ter Sof-tee!\" \b \u001d  (Jim Murphy, resident iconoclast at Dow Jones Newswires and veteran observer of global business trends, can be reached at (201) 938-2145 or by e-mail at Jim.Murphy@DowJones.Com) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:30 ET (17:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"602f2bf53de19bfe422efaea153b3cf7","symR":["AQNT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"aQuantive (AQNT) Block: 218,700 Shrs At 65.79","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AQNT"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","MED","XDJGI","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\bAQUANTIVE INC. \bLast trade NADF: +0.92 at 65.79 on zero tick \bTrade vol:       218,700 =    3.8% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   3,340,094 =   57.3% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:     830,815 =   24.5% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:       5,829,863 =  171.6% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol: 3,397,761 / Prev day -0.03 on 1,301,453 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:17 ET (15:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"603426834c55049dfb8270624ad00d7b","symR":["EK"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Kodak: Filed Form 8-K Contained Inaccurate '05 Segment Results","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EK"],"IndustryCodes":["ENT","REQ","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:50 ET (12:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"60544a0e7c28c675315430966a159fdc","symR":["WEN"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Wendy's 2Q Avg Same-Store Sales At US Co.

(LLL) says its C-27J cargo plane deserved to win a multibillion-dollar Pentagon contest, despite a challenge from Raytheon Co. (RTN) that contends the Defense Department ignored a cheaper and equally qualified alternative. \u001d  L-3 Communications was the prime contractor chosen last month for the Joint Cargo Aircraft program, a new battlefield transport for the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force. The winning team also included Finmeccanica SpA's (FNC.MI) Alenia unit, which makes the basic C-27J aircraft in Italy, and Boeing Co. (BA), selected to set up a U.S. production line. \u001d  Raytheon was the losing bidder, offering the C-295 in partnership with the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. (5730.FR). EADS currently makes aircraft in Spain but also promised to add U.S. production line in Alabama as needed. After a Pentagon debriefing, Raytheon protested the contest outcome and said its team's plane was 15% cheaper while also drawing equal ratings in the major areas of performance evaluation. \u001d  The C-295 is smaller and lighter than the C-27J, and the Raytheon team was widely expected to offer a less expensive proposal. But the C-295 also is considered a less rugged aircraft than its competitor, which uses the same engines as the Air Force's workhorse C-130J cargo plane. Both finalists in the competition offered two-engine aircraft, which are smaller than the four-engine C-130J. \u001d  Army and Air Force officials have said nothing about why, exactly, they picked one plane over the other. In a mid-June teleconference with reporters, the services cited \"a lot of analysis\" but declined to offer details. \u001d  This week, L-3 Communications spoke for the first time about why its plane deserved to win. The company said it couldn't discuss the results of its debriefing, out of deference to its customer, the military. But it did respond to comments from Raytheon, which said last week that the C-295 could have done the same job as the C-27J at a lower cost to the government. \u001d  \"The prevailing virtues of the C-27J are clearly recognizable by our customer,\" said Alison Hartley, vice president of business development at L-3's Integrated Systems division, in a Thursday telephone interview. \u001d  \"We carry heavier loads. We can cruise higher. We can cruise faster,\" Hartley said. \u001d  L-3 didn't dispute Raytheon's claim that the two planes received equal ratings in broad evaluation categories, or that Raytheon's bid was cheaper. But Hartley said this doesn't mean the two planes are equal. She said the C-27J's more powerful engines make it a better value for the government, because the plane can take evasive maneuvers while carrying heavier loads. \u001d  L-3 says its aircraft, while slightly shorter than the competition, can carry cargo the C-295 can't. Examples include a Kiowa helicopter, a fully assembled up-armored Humvee or large artillery equipment, L-3 said. \u001d  The Air Force and the Army have declined to discuss the Joint Cargo Aircraft program since Raytheon filed its protest. \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; rebecca.christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:16 ET (17:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"619ec28edd59df636ea757af0bbb5ad0","symR":["KAT.T","BMG5221G1096"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Katanga: CAMEC Intends To Make Offer To Buy Co >KAT.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KAT.T","BMG5221G1096"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:47 ET (18:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"61f75258883a29440f28bcd144638b91","symR":["BG.LN","BRG","RDSA","RDSA.LN","RDSB","RDSB.LN","GB0008762899","GB00B03MLX29","GB00B03MM408"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Oil Companies Rise As Oil Hits New High","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T10:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BG.LN","BRG","RDSA","RDSA.LN","RDSB","RDSB.LN","GB0008762899","GB00B03MLX29","GB00B03MM408"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XAEX","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\u001d  1018 GMT [Dow Jones] Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA.LN) leads the FTSE 100 risers with A shares +2.4% at 2105p followed closely by BG Group (BRG) +1.8% at 827.5p as oil prices stay above $71/bbl. \"Oil hit an eight month high today on the back of increasing demand and unrest in Nigeria,\" notes CMC trader Victoria Savage.

(ACL) is capitalizing by taking market share. \u001d  The gains have turned a normally slow-growing solutions business into a growth engine for Alcon, complementing the company's much larger and typically faster-expanding eye drug and surgical businesses. \u001d  Two major recalls have helped Alcon, including a Bausch & Lomb Inc. (BOL) lens solution recall a year ago due to links to an infection. Alcon picked up about 80% of the U.S. market share held by Bausch & Lomb's \"ReNu with MoistureLoc\" product, and Alcon spokesman Doug MacHatton said, \"We pretty much held it.\" \u001d  In late May, Advanced Medical Optics Inc. (EYE) pulled its \"Complete MoisturePlus\" solution after health authorities found links to a different serious infection. Complete MoisturePlus had about a tenth of the U.S. market. \u001d  \"It appears that we've gotten somewhere around 60% or 70% of the share,\" MacHatton said. \u001d  The gains should push Alcon's U.S. share of the brand-name lens solutions market into the low to mid 50% range. The company's chief competitors in the lens solution business are Bausch & Lomb, Advanced Medical and Novartis AG (NVS) unit Ciba Vision. \u001d  The competitive landscape could change if Advanced Medical and Bausch & Lomb join forces. Advanced Medical has proposed a $4.3 billion cash and stock takeover of Bausch & Lomb, competing with an existing $3.7 billion deal from Warburg Pincus LLC. \u001d  Though the solutions business typically grows in the low single-digit range, Alcon's solutions sales jumped 38.1% in the second quarter last year on the back of Bausch & Lomb's recall. Big gains were also seen in the following quarters. \u001d  Alcon's lens solutions are part of its consumer eye-care business, which comprised 14% of the company's $4.9 billion in sales last year. Pharmaceuticals represented 41% of sales, and surgical products were 45%. \u001d  The overall consumer eye-care business has grown near or above 20% in each quarter since the Bausch & Lomb recall through the first quarter this year. The latest industry recall \"should allow them to keep the growth rate north of 20%,\" said Mark Mullikin, a Piper Jaffray analyst who has a neutral rating on Alcon. \u001d  Advanced Medical plans to put an older multipurpose lens solution on retail shelves later this year, but it might find it tough to regain lost market share. When patients shift to a new product, \"they tend to stick\", said Joanne Wuensch, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets who rates Alcon at outperform. \u001d  Goldman Sachs analyst Lawrence Keusch boosted his rating on Alcon to buy last week due in part to Alcon's opportunity to bulk up in lens solutions while rival Advanced Medical founders. \b \b   Stock Off 52-Week High \b \u001d  Shares of Alcon closed at $135.62 on Thursday, up 35% so far this year but off from the 52-week high of $144.39 reached April 26. Alcon's stock can be volatile because it has a limited float due to Nestle S.A.'s (NSRGY) roughly 75% ownership stake. Alcon's official headquarters are in Switzerland, but the company has U.S. operations and top-level executives are in Fort Worth, Texas. \u001d  Analysts and investors compare Alcon with a broader group of big medical companies, such as Stryker Corp. (SYK), Allergan Inc. (AGN) and Abbott Laboratories Inc. (ABT), rather than its smaller eye-sector competitors. Alcon is valued at 22.5 times expected 2008 earnings, according to FactSet, compared with 23 times for Allergan, 22.2 times for Stryker and 16.8 times for Abbott. \u001d  Alcon has met stronger lens solution demand by relying on big inventories and wringing more capacity from existing production lines. That should suffice until a new line at Alcon's Forth Worth plant starts up this fall, spokesman MacHatton said. \u001d  Alcon's big lens solutions, like the products pulled from the market, are multipurpose products, which mean consumers use the same bottle to clean, disinfect and store their lenses. While Alcon has benefited so far from its competitors' misfortunes, the whole sector could be hurt if infection-related news becomes more dire or becomes linked to more products. \u001d  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to probe infections from Acanthamoeba keratitis, the type of bug linked to the Advanced Medical product, and has thus far released only preliminary data. \u001d  Though investigations continue, Alcon does not believe there is a \"class effect\" implicating multipurpose solutions across the board, MacHatton said. \u001d  Art Epstein, an optometrist on Long Island, said Alcon's solutions stand out for a disinfection system that \"is probably as good as it gets.\" Epstein has had consulting relationships with a host of companies including Alcon. \u001d  Another shadow over solutions companies comes from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a big contact lens maker that many believe could get into the solutions market. J&J hasn't announced plans, and a company spokesman declined to comment. But given the company's size and clout, it would be expected to make an impact. \u001d  Matt Loucks, portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis, which holds about 47,000 Alcon shares, called J&J's potential entry a risk, but nothing he's worried about. The eye-care business is brand-driven, and Alcon has a strong foothold. \u001d  Loucks said he thinks the company is fairly valued. The wild card is growth in its drug business, he said. \u001d  Analysts have based their Alcon optimism, in part, on expectations for expanding drug opportunities in Japan. Alcon received marketing approval in Japan last year for an antibiotic and a prescription eye drop for allergies, and Wall Street analysts are expecting approval there later this year for Travatan, a glaucoma treatment. \u001d  (Goldman Sachs has had an investment-banking relationship with Alcon. Goldman Sachs and Piper Jaffray make markets in Alcon securities.) \u001d  (Jon Kamp is deputy bureau chief of Dow Jones Newswires' Chicago bureau and covers medical-device companies.)   -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:00 ET (18:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6392362a2a65274708651561fa1d05e2","symR":["ACAS"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Amer Cap Strategies Ltd.

Edenor's shares were down 2.31% to ARS3.39. At 12:35 p.m. EDT in New York, Edenor's American Depository Receipts were down 2.94% to $21.78. \b \u001d  -By Serena Saitto, Dow Jones Newswires; 5411-4311-3125; serena.saitto@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:50 ET (16:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"64754af7e9f90eb00a010fefef0c5548","symR":["MRLBV.HE","FI0009000640","FI0009000665"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"M-real Has Also Signed Product Sales Deal With Antalis","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T05:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MRLBV.HE","FI0009000640","FI0009000665"],"IndustryCodes":["PAP","XDJGI","XHEX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 01:33 ET (05:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"64b6d2b5a3e936e513296a91d8e7caa9","symR":["DIS","US2546871060"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9991302,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.005509,-0.00099],"Headline":": Disney Interactive Studios Announces New Name for Its Racing Studio -- Black Rock Studio","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DIS","US2546871060"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   Award-Winning Climax Racing Re-Named Black Rock Studio Following \u001d         Acquisition by Disney Interactive Studios Last Year \bBURBANK, Calif. & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \u001d  Disney Interactive Studios today announced the re-naming of its award-winning development studio as Black Rock Studio from Climax Racing. \b \u001d  Black Rock is Disney Interactive Studios' first video game development studio in Europe, making it both strategically and geographically significant in accessing the deep pool of development talent throughout the UK and across Europe.

(NDAQ) also sealed a transatlantic stock market tie-up when it made an agreed $3.7 billion bid for Nordic stock exchange operator OMX AB (OMX.SK). \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.bnpparibas.com \b \u001d  -By Nicolas Parasie, Dow Jones Newswires; +33 4017 1770; nicolas.parasie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 04:18 ET (08:18 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6596ecf5ebc8324a42088d0e98a8dc5b","symR":["UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9996727,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[0.9998364,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UBS Chmn: Was And Is No Internal Disagreement On Strategy","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T05:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XDJGI","XGTI","XNYA","XSMI","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 01:38 ET (05:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"65adb4f3ea938cc73c445ac88e87331b","symR":["BRV.LN","BT","BT.A.LN","GB0030913577","GB0032784844","XS0097283096"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,1.011099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.028199,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"BT Group Acquires Brightview Group","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BRV.LN","BT","BT.A.LN","GB0030913577","GB0032784844","XS0097283096"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","ISV","TLS","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:02 ET (06:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"65b61ad25e933f3bf85b07d5d3bdb590","symR":["BP","BP.LN","GB0007980591"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.007891,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.00585,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"INTERVIEW:Chinese Coal Will Likely Continue Flowing To Japan","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BP","BP.LN","GB0007980591"],"IndustryCodes":["COA","ELC","OIL","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Dow Jones)--The changing dynamics of the Asian coal market, characterized now by tight supply, high prices and shifting trade flows, won't prevent Japan's utilities from continuing to import Chinese coal, thanks to rising global output and inter-regional sales, a senior official at U.K. energy giant BP PLC said. \u001d  \"I don't think they (Japanese utilities) have to give up\" importing coal at all from China, although \"it is true that China's coal demand is rising,\" BP's Group Deputy Chief Economist Christof Ruhl said. \u001d  China's rising coal demand is widely expected to result in higher prices and lower exports to Japan. \u001d  However, falling coal prices and increasing supplies in the global market will help adjust the supply-demand imbalance between Asia and other regions, Ruhl said. \u001d  Japanese utilities rely mostly on Australian coal imports, but China has been an important alternative source because its proximity to Japan enables a shorter delivery time and lower freight costs. \u001d  In fiscal year 2006 ended March, Japan imported 179.3 million tons of coal, up 16.8% from FY 2000, data from the Ministry of Finance show. \u001d  Of the total, about 58% originated from Australia, 17% from Indonesia and 12% from China, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. \u001d  China is the world's largest coal-producing country, with around two-thirds of its energy needs met by coal. It had been a net coal exporter until earlier this year, when it became a net coal importer due to surging domestic demand for the fuel following continued economic expansion. \u001d  As a result, Japanese utilities' coal imports from China under long-term contracts are likely to fall sharply in this fiscal year ending March 2008. \u001d  Late June, Japanese utilities and Chinese coal producers agreed to increase prices of coal exports to Japan that were signed under long term contracts by up to 40%, or up to $70/ton, The Nikkei reported last week. \u001d  In response, Japanese utilities have decided to lower their import volumes from China under the long term contracts by roughly half from last fiscal year to 4.3 million tons, The Nikkei said. \u001d  To exacerbate Japan's coal supply situation, congested port and railway infrastructure, and more recently, storms, have been disrupting coal shipments from major coal supplier Australia. \b \u001d  Supply-Demand Imbalance Won't Persist \b \u001d  However, because the extreme price surge and tight supplies are only occurring in Asia, they will be corrected in the global market over time, Ruhl said without providing a specific timeframe. \u001d  \"We have actually seen coal prices decrease in 2006 (globally). The average of most important coal prices were down 2.5%.\" \u001d  Currently, only 15% of the coal produced is traded across borders, but trade is expected to increase along with higher global production and increase in exports, which will eventually balance supplies and prices, he said. \u001d  Global coal consumption rose 4.5% on year to 3.1 billion tons of oil equivalent in 2006, compared with a 10-year average of 2.8%, BP's latest statistics showed. \u001d  However, in response to the rapid demand growth, global coal production also increased, rising 5.6% on year to 3.1 billion tons of oil equivalent, BP said. \u001d  \"We can say there's no shortage of coal, including coal delivery to Japan.\" \u001d  It has become \"profitable to ship coal from places like Russia\" into China, which is \"an indication that the market is balancing,\" he said. \u001d  China's target to reduce energy consumption will also help balance coal supply and demand, Ruhl said. \u001d  In its 11th Five-Year Plan from 2006 to 2010, China targets to reduce energy consumption per unit of Gross Domestic Product by 20%, or an average of 4 percentage points each year. \u001d  China will have to achieve this target mostly by cutting coal consumption, Ruhl said. \b \u001d  -By Mari Iwata, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; mari.iwata@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Tracy Gan \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:13 ET (06:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"65f2464059107a0834e608c834a66297","symR":["BNCC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"CFO FRANZ Buys 3,000 Of BNCCORP INC >BNCC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:59:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BNCC"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: BNCCORP INC \bSYMBOL: BNCC \b \bFILER: FRANZ TIMOTHY J \bTITLE: Chief Financial Officer \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Purchase                 3,000      $18.15          $54,450 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 8,000 (Direct) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

Aker said it maintained its earlier announced long-term Ebitda margin target of 7%, which it had not expected to reach in 2007. \u001d  An Oslo-based analyst, who asked not to be named, said the warning would have a significant impact on his Ebitda estimates for Aker Yards, leading to a 50% cut in 2007 estimates, and a 24% cut in 2008 figures. The profit warning \"is disappointing and wasn't anticipated at all,\" the analyst said. \u001d  He added: \"Aker Yards said something in their first quarter report about problems with suppliers, but there was no reason to believe the problem would be of this magnitude.\" \u001d  The increase in cost estimates at its Finnish yards is expected to result in a lower-than seen Ebitda margin of between 5%-6% in 2008, while the 2007 Ebitda margin in its cruise and ferries business area is seen at just 2.5% to 3%, Aker Yards said. \u001d  Chief Executive Yrjo Julin told Dow Jones Newswires that the challenges in its Finnish ship yards have arisen \"recently.\" \u001d  \"We've seen in the past weeks, days, some deterioration of our project estimates. We've had both external and internal control groups going through the project and have received the information (prompting this profit warning) only a couple of days ago,\" Julin said. \u001d  \"It has come very fast and has had a knock on effect on the seven ferries\" on our order backlog, he added. Aker Yards said that of the seven ferries in its Finnish order backlog, five will be delivered in the next 12 months. \u001d  Julin said the problem there is twofold. \u001d  \"We have a record high order book workload in Finland, especially affecting the ferries. So we're stretching our resources. In shipbuilding, if one ship is affected, there's a knock-on effect on the others,\" he said. \u001d  \"Secondly, the Finnish maritime cluster is stretched, prices are increasing because of the booming market\", affecting the cost of projects, Julin added. \u001d  As a result of the ongoing evaluation of its Finnish operations, Aker Yards has postponed its second quarter results presentation to Aug. 24, \"to give us a little more time to look at the situation,\" Julin said. \u001d  \"Management will focus on improving the situation,\" he said. \u001d  The market's reaction to the surprise announcement was evident in the share price slide. \u001d  One Oslo-based analyst said the drop \"is warranted,\" saying \"this was very bad news,\" and adding that it's a worrying sign that the company is unable to generate acceptable profit margins in this extremely good market. \u001d  \"It calls to question how they will handle a downturn in the economy,\" the analyst added. \u001d  Odin Europa SMB fund manager Truls Haugen said that, while the profit warning was severe, he sees the share price bouncing back, \"maybe today or next week.\" \u001d  Industrial ownership company Aker ASA (AKER.OS) sold down its total 40.1% stake in Aker Yards in March, pushing Aker Yards shares down around 10%. Aker said the sale was indicative of Aker Yard's rising profits and historically high shipyard order backlog, adding that the increase in share liquidity following its divestment would enhance the company's attractiveness to investors. Analysts said at the time that the move was related to Aker's need to free up capital for other projects. \u001d  Aker Yard's CEO Julin said the timing of Aker's sellout was \"purely a coincidence\" and unrelated to news emerging from the Finnish operations. \"These figures that we have received in the past few days were not on the table at that time,\" Julin said. \u001d  After Aker Yard's share-price slump Friday, Julin and three other Aker Yards primary insiders each purchased 4,000 shares in the company at NOK77.25 a share. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.akeryards.com \b \u001d  -By Elizabeth Cowley, Dow Jones Newswires; +47 22 20 10 58; elizabeth.cowley@dowjones.com \u001d  (Adam Ewing and Magnus Hansson in Stockholm contributed to this story.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:03 ET (12:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6739b5c7d59c368f5b3803112b63425f","symR":["BOL","US0717071031"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Bausch & Lomb (BOL) Ind: 71.0-74.0 Last 68.66","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BOL","US0717071031"],"IndustryCodes":["MDS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:17 ET (13:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"673bee7aaebd0803f063d999bb8e4836","symR":["NWA","US6672801015"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Northwest Air Distributes Cash From Sale Of $182M Claim","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NWA","US6672801015"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:09 ET (14:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"675b35eaaeb034c0a8f1defbe1a7c6bc","symR":["NII.T","NSATF","CA6565121002"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Norsat Announces Resignation of Chief Financial Officer","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NII.T","NSATF","CA6565121002"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT"],"Story":"\u001d  VANCOUVER, BC -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 07/06/07 -- \u001d   Norsat International Inc.

PolyOne will immediately use the proceeds to reduce debt, including the entire outstanding balance of $141.37 million in aggregate principal amount of its 10.625 percent Senior Notes due 2010.  As a result of these actions, the Company projects lower interest costs of approximately $25 million in 2008 compared to 2006. \b \u001d  PolyOne will retain the existing polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) supply agreements that it entered into when OxyVinyls was formed.  The terms of the supply agreements, including extensions, run through 2024.  These agreements ensure consistent, cost-effective raw material supplies that will enable PolyOne to maintain its competitiveness and pursue its strategy of providing value-creating material and service solutions to its customers. \b \u001d  In a related transaction, the Company will acquire OxyChem's 10 percent interest in PVC Powder Blends, LP for $11 million, which will bring PolyOne's ownership of this PVC compounding operation to 100 percent. \b \u001d  \"In one step, we have substantially strengthened our financial profile, eliminated a primary source of earnings volatility and reaffirmed our commitment to our strategy and our confidence in executing it effectively,\" said Stephen D. Newlin, chairman, president and chief executive officer. \"This transaction rebalances our business portfolio and ensures that our core businesses become the primary driver of sustainable earnings growth.\" \b \u001d  PolyOne announced in the fourth quarter of 2006 that it had embarked upon a transformational strategy based on four key components: specialization, which shifts the basis of competition to differentiation from cost/commodity, and provides customers with high value-added solutions; globalization, which positions the Company to benefit from its extensive geographic reach; operational excellence, which strengthens PolyOne's capabilities to answer the voice of the customer by enhancing productivity, profitability and efficiency in all phases of its business; and commercial excellence, which mobilizes sales, marketing and innovation expertise to bring to market value-added products and services that provide competitive advantage to customers. Successful execution of this strategy will drive margin improvements and sustainable earnings growth. \b \u001d  As a result of this transaction, the Company anticipates recording an impairment on its OxyVinyls investment in the second quarter, but recording a tax benefit from the reversal of associated deferred tax liabilities upon the confirmation of the sale in the third quarter.  The combination of these two factors, as well as the premium costs related to the redemption of the 2010 Senior Notes, is anticipated to result in an overall net book gain.  Because of the Company's net operating loss position, the transaction will result in no cash taxes. \b \u001d  \"I want to thank the management of OxyVinyls and OxyChem for this mutually beneficial relationship over the past eight years, and for their consistent focus on operating the business successfully,\" Newlin said.  \"We look forward to maintaining our significant commercial relationships with OxyVinyls and OxyChem.\" \b \u001d  OxyVinyls, which was formed on May 1, 1999, combined the PVC and VCM businesses of OxyChem and PolyOne to create one of North America's largest suppliers of PVC resin. \b \b    About PolyOne \b \u001d  PolyOne Corporation, with 2006 annual revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, is a leading global provider of specialized polymer materials, services and solutions.  Headquartered in northeast Ohio, PolyOne has operations in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia, and joint ventures in North America and South America.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: \b \b \b    -- The timing and amounts of any repurchases of outstanding senior notes \b       and debentures of the Company, including the amount of any premiums \b       paid; \b    -- any change that would affect the Company's ability to reverse \b       associated tax liabilities as a result of the sale to OxyVinyls; \b    -- the actual projected interest savings resulting from the reduction of \b       debt; \b    -- any changes in the current supply agreements and extensions with \b       OxyVinyls, and \b    -- other factors affecting our business beyond our control, including, \b       without limitation, changes in the general economy, changes in interest \b       rates and changes in the rate of inflation. \b \b \u001d  We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected.

(CMCSA,CMCSK) has fired off an angry letter to the Federal Communications Commission, accusing the agency of pursuing an \"arbitrary\" and \"capricious\" policy over its set-top box rules. \u001d  Like many other pay television companies, Comcast had been seeking a waiver from the rules, which were implemented as of July 1. \u001d  Several companies, ranging from fierce rival Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) to smaller operators like Guam Cablevision LLC, received last minute waivers last week, whereas large incumbent cable companies like Comcast were effectively denied them. \u001d  In a letter of protest filed at the FCC on Tuesday, Comcast called the fact that Verizon was given a waiver and not it \"preposterous\" and said it \"raises serious questions about the integrity of the waiver process.\" \u001d  The letter was written by Jonathan Friedman of the law firm Willkie, Farr & Gallagher, an external lawyer who has been handling much of Comcast's lobbying at the FCC over the set-top box issue. \u001d  The rules require that from July 1, all pay television operators provide new and upgrading customers with set-top boxes that have separate security features in the form of a so-called cable card. \u001d  It is the cable card that, depending on a customer's subscription package, determines what channels they receive. It slides into the back of the set-top box. \u001d  Until July 1, this function was built into the set-top box. \u001d  FCC Chairman Kevin Martin hopes that customers will start buying their own set-top box, which they can then take with them if they move home or change television providers. \u001d  The cable industry, mainly through the auspices of its lobby group the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, has vociferously argued that the cable cards will only add costs to consumers and will soon be a redundant technology. \u001d  It has said that downloadable security which will allow television providers to communicate directly with a set-top box or television set will soon be on the market and will replace cable cards. \u001d  The FCC offered waivers to companies that pledged to move entirely to a digital signal by early 2009, which meets another of its policy goals. \u001d  Comcast argues that for a company with as many subscribers as it, such a pledge would be impossible to fulfill as there inevitably would be a significant number of analog service subscribers who refused to make the switch. \u001d  \"The Commission has shown since January the significant impact of committing to go to an all digital signal in its consideration of whether or not to grant a waiver,\" said Mary Diamond, a spokeswoman for the FCC. \u001d  Diamond refused to respond to Comcast's argument in its letter that such a pledge was meaningless. She also said she didn't know what enforcement measures would be pursued against companies that failed to live up to their pledge. \u001d  Verizon, which made such a pledge, is on the receiving end of the bulk of Comcast's anger over the set-top box issue in the letter. \u001d  \"Verizon is an enormous competitor, began building its video services from scratch during the period when the separate security requirement was in effect, knew full well what its obligations were under the Commission's rules...and yet apparently did nothing over the past three years to get boxes with separate security developed,\" said Friedman in the letter. \u001d  Verizon had argued for several months that the technology underpinning its boxes was different than that for cable companies like Comcast and therefore it wouldn't be able to move to new-style set-top boxes. \u001d  This argument was ultimately unsuccessful with the Commission and instead it was forced to pledge that it would make the transition to a digital signal in order to get a waiver. \u001d  \"The FCC's interest in granting waivers based on commitments to going all-digital have been obvious since the first such waiver was granted on January 10, 2007,\" said Brian Blevins, a spokesman for Verizon. \"We have had an ongoing dialog since the May 4 granting of another waiver based on going all-digital.\" \u001d  The FCC also granted waivers for other reasons. In the case of Charter Communications (CHTR), the company pleaded successfully that it couldn't comply with the new rules for \"financial hardship\" reasons, while Guam Cablevision LLC was granted a waiver due to the fact that it is \"delivering cable service in a typhoon-prone, underdeveloped market far from the contiguous 48 states,\" according to the FCC's decision released on June 29. \u001d  Until this letter, Comcast had resisted criticizing the FCC, preferring to continue its lobbying efforts behind the scenes in order to win a waiver. \u001d  In theory, FCC Commissioners could still vote to overrule an initial decision to reject Comcast's waiver request, but the fact that they didn't in time to meet the July 1 deadline is a strong indicator that this is unlikely to happen. \u001d  \"The Commission is duty bound to explain no only why Comcast is being denied its waiver, but also how such a decision can be rationally justified while so many other waiver applicants are getting relief from the integration ban,\" said Friedman. \u001d  -By Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6637; corey.boles@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"69e44e715eaaddd05d0ad584b17207e5","symR":["SURG"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"CFO BOONE Buys 10,000 Of SYNERGETICS USA INC >SURG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T21:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SURG"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: SYNERGETICS USA INC \bSYMBOL: SURG \b \bFILER: BOONE PAMELA G \bTITLE: Chief Financial Officer \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/6/07             Purchase                10,000       $3.53          $35,254 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 36,387 (Direct) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

Newswires Column \b \u001d  (This article was originally published Thursday) \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Now that the 4th of July has passed, are the fireworks over for the stock market? \u001d  To a large extent that depends on whether the rebound from the late June swoon in prices is merely a dead-cat bounce or the continuation of a rally that was interrupted by overblown fears of a credit crunch. For many investors, though, the subprime mess is mere background noise to the historical rhythms of the market. For those who believe past is prologue, the rest of this month is an inauspicious time to be in stocks. \u001d  The past few sessions have seen a nice rebound, but seasonal patterns have been kind to stocks during the current week and less so the rest of the month. Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group noted that the shortened four-day Independence Day week has been positive for the Dow Jones Industrial Average 72% of the time for an average gain of 74 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point), nearly seven times the return of all other four-day periods in the market since 1901. To put 74 basis points in four days into perspective, a 10-year run of such returns would turn $10,000 into about $460,000. \u001d  Due to the upward trend of stock prices, typical days aren't a coin flip but are pretty close at 52%. By contrast, the normally light trading day before July 4th is positive 64% of the time and the day after some 56% of the time. \u001d  One often-surprising fact about stock-market data is that the lion's share of returns can be captured in a handful of days. Data from the Stock Traders Almanac covering the period since 1970 indicate that investors could have held stocks for the first trading day of July and captured nearly all of the gains for the Dow. The average gain on the first trading day has been roughly 47 basis points while the gain for the whole month has been just 49 basis points. \u001d  On that score, the first two days of July already have delivered 126 basis points in performance. Should traders quit while they're ahead? With June's negative performance, a down July would be the first time in 18 months that there were two consecutive down months for stocks, so a bad July would break a recent pattern. \u001d  Analysts at CXO Advisory Group say that even very bad months, with a performance of negative 4% or worse, have little to do with what happens the following month. The average performance after such bad months since 1950 for the S&P 500 is 0.27% versus 0.74% for all months but the degree of correlation is weak. On the other hand, it doesn't mean that a bounce can be relied upon either. \u001d  Even with the good performance at the beginning of the month, July has been one of the worst months to own stocks overall, reflecting part of the \"sell in May and go away\" trend that has often served investors well. Historically this had to do with the financial demands of an agricultural economy as farmers withdrew funds to plant crops and deposited them in the late autumn after the harvest, boosting the relative fortunes of the November-through-April period. \u001d  The seasonal pattern has held up well, even though this should no longer apply, given the diminished role of farming and the increased activity of hedge-fund managers who are always on the lookout for an opportunity, even in the lazy days of summer. Then again, July through September have been prone to external shocks in the past, most notably in energy prices - due both to natural disasters and geopolitical factors. \u001d  Even though few investment pros would admit to investing by the calendar as opposed to fundamentals, they might be well served to take some of their chips off the table this summer. They say the market loves to climb a wall of worry, but it's more like a speed bump of worry at current levels. \u001d  Major indexes are still within spitting distance of their all-time highs even after the recent subprime jitters, and the prospect of more nasty surprises at hedge funds following the woes at Bear Stearns (BSC) and elsewhere remain out there. Throw in $70 oil, the onset of hurricane season, tensions over Iran's nuclear-weapons program, recent terrorist activity and the potential for another leg down in housing, and the odds of a downside surprise seem to outweigh those of a summer rally. \u001d  (Spencer Jakab, a columnist who provides insightful and unique takes on financial markets, previously wrote about energy.) \u001d  -By Spencer Jakab, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2429; spencer.jakab@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6aaa1b9403ce2ea4364d5135a4083445","symR":["EQN.T","CA29445L2049"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Equinox Mnrls Tgt Raised To C$5 From C$4: R James >EQN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EQN.T","CA29445L2049"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:37 ET (11:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6b17a66485a3daf9466fc54d1ac413c3","symR":["VOLV","VOLV-B.SK","SE0000115420","SE0000115446","US9288564001"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Claes Nilsson Appointed New Head for Volvo Trucks Europe Division","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VOLV","VOLV-B.SK","SE0000115420","SE0000115446","US9288564001"],"IndustryCodes":["TRQ","XDJGI","XSXA"],"Story":"\bSTOCKHOLM, Sweden--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \b   Regulatory News: \b \u001d  Claes Nilsson has been appointed as the new President for the Europe Division at Volvo Trucks (Nasdaq:VOLV) (STO:VOLVA) (STO:VOLVB).

Dennis Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat, on Friday officially announced the July 11 hearing. \u001d  Hedge funds and private equity funds are typically off limits to ordinary investors. Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, an individual investor must have $1 million in net worth - including the value of a home - or $200,000 in annual income before investing in a hedge fund. Regulators have proposed raising that hurdle to require $2.5 million in financial investments. \u001d  Blackstone Group (BX), with more than half of its $88 billion in hedge funds and private-equity investments went public last month even after congressional demands that the stock sale be put on hold to allow for more time to study the offering. Lawmakers are concerned that the stock sale gives ordinary investors access to hedge funds and private equity funds that may not be suitable.   \"Under the Blackstone LP and related investment vehicles, for the first time the value of investments made by ordinary investors is directly dependent on the performance of the underlying hedge-fund portfolios,\" Kucinich's subcommittee said in a release. \u001d  America's biggest union federation, along with some lawmakers, had asked the SEC to require Blackstone to register as an investment company, a status that could require more rigorous disclosure, such as details about the makeup of their portfolios, and rules regarding limits on borrowing. \u001d  The SEC considered and rejected the request after concluding that Blackstone didn't qualify as an investment company. The House panel said that it tends to review whether that finding is likely to be accepted by the courts. \u001d  -By Siobhan Hughes, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6654; Siobhan.Hughes@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:50 ET (20:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6bf23fe1b5ffca400f694ac467dde727","symR":["MTH"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9827909],"ret5":[0.9311635],"Headline":"Meritage Homes Sees 2Q Home Orders Dow 28% >MTH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MTH"],"IndustryCodes":["HOM","HPR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Meritage Homes Corp.

(GS) \u001d  8:40 (Dow Jones) Before rounding the jobless rate was 4.529% compared to 4.464% in May, so in June the rate just barely held at 4.5%, whereas in May it was bumped up to that level. In either case, not much unemployment, still tight. (JJM) \u001d  8:38 (Dow Jones) Dollar up modestly after US payrolls data comes in slightly higher than expectations. Early Friday, the euro was at $1.3586 from $1.3601 just before the data was released and $1.3598 late Thursday, while the dollar was at Y123.41 from Y123.23 pre-data and Y122.90 late Thursday, according to EBS.

David Ader of RBS Greenwich Capital says the sheer amount of long positions in the Treasurys market - thanks in large part to the recent safe-haven buying - raises the potential for a negative reaction to the data, and even a very soft reading is unlikely to break the 10-year yield back below 5%. Two-year unchanged for 4.98%, 10-year down 1/32 for 5.15%. (ECB) \u001d  8:08 (Dow Jones) Dollar is slightly stronger but maintaining tight ranges ahead of 8:30 a.m. EDT jobs report.

Typical of the reaction, Lehman writes, \"With the launches of Halo 3 and Grand Theft Auto IV scheduled for launch in front of the 2007 holiday season, and with a potential console price cut within the next few months, we believe Xbox 360 still remains well-positioned to have a successful FY08.\" (GS) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:55 ET (12:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6bf672db604e80a34de1c368f173701d","symR":["CYM.T","CA23257A1093"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Cymat Sees Actual Revenue \"Substantially Higher\"","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CYM.T","CA23257A1093"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:36 ET (16:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6c167ada0addbe680911c5ad1feb48ce","symR":["HHC.XX"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Haights Cross, Investors In Recapitalization Pact","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HHC.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:15 ET (15:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6c27e922177ff2c4d510b259e35a6cf6","symR":["BMY","US1101221083"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9936609,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.0187,-0.00099],"Headline":"Bristol-Myers Says Study Shows Ixabepilone Demonstrated Clear Activity In Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Resistant To Anthracycline, Taxane, And Capecitabine","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T09:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BMY","US1101221083"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6c5e90c663356c311b5f323a8773515c","symR":["VTRU","US92534N1019"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Vertrue: Issuance Of Rights Won't Affect Reported EPS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T17:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VTRU","US92534N1019"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","MED","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:27 ET (17:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6c81405fab70d64bf78c2fc595f0e3a7","symR":["5730.FR","NL0000235190"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"THE SKEPTIC: Dangers In Shifting Global Capital Flows","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","NL0000235190"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XMDAX"],"Story":"\b \b   By Matthew Curtin \b   A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN \b \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--EADS has categorized Dubai International Capital as just another institutional investor after the fund bought a 3.1% stake in the aero-defense company. \u001d  How wrong EADS is, at least to the degree that this $802-million investment by the UAE fund reflects a major shift in global capital markets that isn't necessarily benign. \u001d  The shift is the function of soaring commodity prices, the industrialization of much of Asia, and the determination of Asian central banks to maintain weak currencies that have led to massive accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, from the Middle East to Russia and China. \u001d  What's changed is that the countries with the swelling coffers seem increasingly keen to get a better return on funds that they've until recently plowed into U.S. Treasurys and euro-denominated bonds. \u001d  The obvious solution is to invest in equities. \u001d  Apart from the merits of diversification, it would give them a bigger share of the profits being generated by globalization, visible in the years of robust earnings growth at U.S. and European multinational. \u001d  The risks are twofold. \u001d  Such are resources at these countries' disposal - China's foreign-exchange reserves stood at $1.2 trillion at end-March - that the sovereign wealth funds they're setting up can pretty much take their pick of what they want to buy, raising nationalist hackles in target markets. \u001d  If the investment is carried out transparently, and the criteria are financial or industrial, that's not necessarily a problem, as the British government convincingly argues. \u001d  The DIC's investment in EADS fits the bill. Dubai is a small country staking its future in part on the development of a soundly regulated, local financial market, and as a transport hub. State-owned airline Emirates is a key customer of EADS' Airbus unit. \u001d  But others' motives may be more sinister, which at least justifies caution on the part of the authorities in western countries when strategic assets are in play. \u001d  Take the 5% stake held in EADS by OAO Bank VTB, the state-owned Russian lender. EADS is a major supplier to the armies of NATO, whose eastward expansion has so unnerved the Russian government. It's hard to see VTB's interest in EADS as purely financial. \u001d  China is modeling its planned state-owned investment fund on the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. That's all very well, but Singapore's GIC has tended to play its cards close to its vest and tiny Singapore has used the fund to give it regional influence by investing in its bigger neighbors. Big China's intentions are more of a worry than tiny Singapore's. \u001d  But there's another danger, which you can't ascribe to the mysterious motives of foreign mandarins. \u001d  From the trouble Chinese and Dubai investors have already had in investing in the U.S. to the jettisoning of a commitment to open markets in the main text of the E.U.'s new treaty, the West is running the risk of becoming more protectionist - rather than simply protective of strategic assets - as a new flood of foreign investors arrive. \u001d  It's the wrong approach. \u001d  Reciprocity, with minimal obstacles to capital flows as the benchmark, is what the U.S. and Europe should be demanding of emerging-market countries, many of which, when it comes to trade, have proved only too eager to join the WTO. \u001d  But as the sovereign wealth funds of China, Russia and other countries flex their financial muscles, there's the dispiriting prospect of the world becoming a more protectionist place. \b \u001d  (Matthew Curtin has been a financial news reporter since 1990, and has written on international finance and business for Dow Jones Newswires - from South Africa, Singapore and France - since 1994.

The last week of June saw two public deals with a further two firms opting to put planned sales on ice. That contrasts with a lively pace of issuance just a couple of months ago. \u001d  Azgard Nine, a textile and fertilizer manufacturer, is looking to raise up to US$260 million in debt. The size and the structure will be fixed during a five-day roadshow, which kicked off Thursday. Bankers familiar with the deal are focussing on a seven-year offering, callable after four years. \u001d  The company is the first true Pakistan corporate to tap the offshore bond market although the government has been a regular issuer of U.S. dollar paper since 2004. \u001d  The only other Pakistan company to have sold bonds is Pakistan Mobile Communications Ltd., also known as Mobilink. Although that firm has operations in Pakistan, the firm is 100% directly or indirectly owned by Cairo's Orascom Telecom Holding SAE. \"So really it's an Egyptian credit,\" said one banker. \u001d  Since it is breaking relatively untrodden ground, it is tough to find pricing comparables for Azgard Nine's offering beyond the Pakistan sovereign bonds - with 2016 paper at a yield of around 7.1% - and Mobilink's 2013 bond, callable in 2010, at a 7.75% yield. \u001d  Other yardsticks include Eurochem Mineral and Chemical Company OJSC, a Russian fertilizer company, which in March priced a five-year bond at 7.875% and Asian commodity-related firms such as Titan Petrochemicals Group Ltd. and Arpeni Pratama Ocean Line. \u001d  The 2012 and 2013 bonds from those companies are now paying yields of 9.4% and 7.9% respectively. \u001d  Azgard is ranked in the bottom half of the ratings spectrum - at B2 by Moody's Investors Service and B+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Service. \u001d  In its favor is its diversified operations and its 100% ownership of a \"highly efficient fertilizer plant producing utility-like cash flows,\" said Moody's in its ratings report. \u001d  The proceeds from the bond offering will be used to refinance debt incurred in the July 2006 purchase by Azgard - then just a textile firm - of the Pak American Fertilizer Ltd. plant from the government. \u001d  On the other hand, Moody's points to potential damage on rising textile revenues from the vagaries of the fashion industry and the need to develop the fertilizer operations. \b \u001d  More China Property Paper \b \u001d  Neo-China, a China property developer, will continue to meet with investors next week to market a U.S. dollar-denominated offshore bond. \u001d  \"The structure of the offering of notes has not been finalized and may include one or multiple tranches of different maturities,\" the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange late Thursday. \u001d  A rating statement from Moody's Friday, however, referred to a planned seven-year offering. \u001d  The company said it may also offer warrants to note investors allowing the holders to subscribe to company shares. \u001d  Moody's Friday assigned the company a first-time B1 foreign currency senior unsecured grade. \u001d  The offering will mark the latest in a steady stream of issuance from the China property sector where companies have been ramping up construction to cash in on high property prices. \u001d  According to China's economic planning agency, property prices in the country's leading cities jumped 6.4% on year in May. \u001d  Neo-China has a land bank of 9.8 million square meters, which means it ranks in the middle of other Chinese property companies like Hopson Development Holdings Ltd. and Greentown China Holdings Ltd. that have already issued offshore bonds. \u001d  Hopson's 2012 bond, callable in 2009, and Greentown's 2013 bond, callable in 2010, are currently paying returns of around 7.6% and 8.9% respectively. \u001d  Neo-China's revenues - at HK$2.1 billion for the 11 months to end March - are, however, on a par with Shanghai Real Estate whose 2013 bond now offers a 8.5% yield, said a person familiar with the deal. The company said late Thursday that in that same period it made a gross profit of HK$204 million versus a loss of HK$23 million in the same period last year. \u001d  However, Moody's pointed to the company's \"aggressive growth and capital structure, short operating history and corporate governance risk\" as constraining the rating. \u001d  Despite some concerns about government efforts to cool overheating in the property sector in China, there is talk of more issuance from the sector. \u001d  Bankers have recently been whispering about a potential deal from Hong Kong-listed Coastal Greenland Ltd. \b \b   -By Karen Lane, Dow Jones Newswires; 65 6415-4043; karen.lane@dowjones.com \b   -Edited by Iain McDonald \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:04 ET (06:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6e35a63403075fea1af9889a70149e65","symR":["CRH","CRH.DB","HOLN.VX","CH0012214059","IE0001827041"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.011884,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[0.986199,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Holcim, CRH Cleared Of Cartel Chgs In Swiss Tunnel Case","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T08:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CRH","CRH.DB","HOLN.VX","CH0012214059","IE0001827041"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","XDJGI","XNYA","XSMI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BERN (Dow Jones)--The Swiss cartel watchdog cleared cement and building aggregates company Holcim Ltd.

(NYSE:LI) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended May 31, 2007. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $869 million, slightly higher than the prior year, and income from continuing operations was $61 million, a 40% increase, as compared to the previous year. Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations was $0.76 as compared to $0.44 for the prior year. \b \u001d  \"I am pleased with these results,\" said Kevin E. Benson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Laidlaw International. \"Our school bus operations continue to produce good revenue growth. In addition they have improved their EBITDA margin, as the benefits of their safety initiatives implemented over the past several years, have resulted in greatly reduced insurance expenses. Greyhound, while not matching the hurricane induced travel volumes of 2006, continued to refine and develop their network with the objective of growing their customer base. Our Transit operations have also performed well, replacing the revenue from a major contract lost in 2006, while improving EBITDA margins.\" \b \b   Quarter Results \b \u001d  Education Services revenue grew 7.5% offsetting the impact of the $28 million reduction in revenue at Greyhound. Contract growth and inflationary price increases were the driving forces for the very strong revenue performance at Education Services. Approximately $5 million of the revenue decline at Greyhound was due to the short strike in western Canada with the remainder due to lower passenger counts. \b \u001d  EBITDA of $166 million was up 14% from the prior year and EBITDA margin increased over 200 basis points to 19%. At Education Services, a major portion of the $17 million increase in their EBITDA was due to continued favorable safety trends which resulted in lower insurance costs. Greyhound's EBITDA increased $1 million as a result of lower compensation expense and insurance costs, which more than offset the effect of reduced revenue. Although Public Transit's revenue was flat, EBITDA and EBITDA margin improved due largely to lower insurance costs. \b \u001d  EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, representing operating income plus depreciation and amortization. Schedules reconciling EBITDA to income from continuing operations and EBITDA to cash used by operating activities are presented as a supplement to this release. \b \u001d  The results of the quarter include $9 million of additional interest expense associated with debt used to fund the Company's share repurchase program and an additional $5 million of costs related to the previously announced merger with FirstGroup plc. In addition, due to a higher Canadian exchange rate at May 31, we recognized $11 million of currency exchange gain on our US$ denominated debt in Canada this quarter. \b \b   Key Balance Sheet Items \b \u001d  As of May 31, 2007, Laidlaw had cash and cash equivalents of $191 million and debt outstanding of $769 million. Net capital expenditures for the nine month period were $207 million, as compared to $200 million in the prior year. Laidlaw will file its Form 10-Q which includes more complete information with the Securities Exchange Commission on July 6, 2007. \b \b   Outlook \b \u001d  The Company's outlook for revenue, EBITDA, earnings per share and capital expenditures is unchanged from previously provided guidance. Revenue for fiscal 2007 is expected to increase 1 to 3 percent, as compared to 2006. EBITDA for fiscal 2007 is projected to be in the range of $470 million to $500 million. Earnings per share from continuing operations is anticipated to be $1.35 to $1.55 per share. Net capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 are projected to be towards the upper end of our $230 million to $260 million guidance range. \b \u001d  The earnings guidance includes $11 million of merger related costs incurred through May 31, 2007, but does not take into account transaction costs that may be expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Additionally, while the capital expenditure forecast includes some amounts related to assets needed for new contract wins, a successful finish to the bid season could result in actual results modestly exceeding guidance. \b \b   Distributions \b \u001d  During the quarter, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of Laidlaw's common stock payable on August 3, 2007 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on July 18, 2007. \b \b   Merger Update \b \u001d  As previously announced, on February 8, 2007, Laidlaw entered into a merger agreement with FirstGroup plc under which FirstGroup will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Laidlaw for $35.25 per share in cash. Laidlaw held a special meeting of stockholders on April 20, 2007 to vote on the proposed merger with FirstGroup at which time the stockholders approved the merger. FirstGroup held an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders on the same day and their shareholders passed resolutions to approve, among other things, the acquisition of Laidlaw. \b \u001d  During the quarter, the Committee on Foreign Investment at the U.S. Department of Treasury, issued written clearance under the Exon-Florio amendment of Laidlaw's proposed merger with FirstGroup, the United States Surface Transportation Board approved the proposed merger and the Canadian Competition Bureau provided clearance of the proposed merger. \b \u001d  Regulatory review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (\"HSR Act\") is ongoing. On April 30, 2007, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice requested additional information from both FirstGroup and Laidlaw, primarily related to student transportation, which effectively extended the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act during which Laidlaw and FirstGroup may not consummate the proposed transaction. As of the close of business today, the parties will have certified their substantial compliance with this request for additional information. Under the HSR Act, the Antitrust Division must complete its review within 30 days of the day both firms certified their substantial compliance with the Antitrust Division's request. However, the Antitrust Division has asked Laidlaw and FirstGroup to enter into a timing agreement that would provide the Antitrust Division with additional time to complete its review, effectively extending the review period. Laidlaw and FirstGroup are discussing the terms of that agreement with the Antitrust Division and, if an agreement is finalized, will release further information about the agreement at that time. The Company and FirstGroup remain committed to working cooperatively with the Antitrust Division as it conducts its review of the merger. \b \b   Conference Call Details \b \u001d  The Company will hold a conference call hosted by senior management to discuss the financial results on Monday, July 9, 2007 at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern). A web cast of the conference call will be accessible at Laidlaw International's website www.laidlaw.com. \b \bTo participate in the call, please dial: \b       800-510-9836 - (US and Canada) \b       617-614-3670 - (International) \b       Passcode: 72961354 \b \u001d  A replay will be available shortly after the conference call through August 9, 2007.

(DB) to advise it on a range of options, including a bid for Alcan. \u001d  Another possibility is a bid for Alcoa, although this is thought less likely, the report says. \u001d  \"We don't comment on market speculation,\" Rio Tinto spokesman Nick Cobban said of the report. \u001d  Alcan spokeswoman Anik Michaud also declined to comment. \u001d  A London-based analyst at a major bank said that Rio Tinto could be looking to become an aluminum \"heavyweight,\" but retaining low electricity costs for aluminum production would be a major challenge. \u001d  Rio Tinto \"would have to be comfortable that there would be no renegotiation of power supply agreements by local governments,\" he said. \"You can see why they would be interested, but it's still a fairly hefty entry price, with (Alcan's) share price doubling over the last six months,\" he added. \u001d  Rio Tinto's shares in London lagged those of its peers Friday and at 1410 GMT were down 11 pence at 3,990 pence, 1.3% below its high for the day. \u001d  Meanwhile, Alcoa Inc. said Friday it received a second request for additional information from the antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice regarding its $28-billion hostile offer for Alcan Inc. (AL). \u001d  Alcoa said it will continue cooperating with the DoJ's review and will comply with the request as soon as possible. \u001d  \"We're confident that the deal will be approved,\" said spokesman Kevin Lowery of Alcoa Friday, declining to comment further. \u001d  In June, Alcan Chief Executive Richard Evans e-mailed Alcoa CEO Alain Belda rejecting the possibility of talks between the companies. \u001d  Alcan has indicated company executives and its board were standing by their opposition to the Alcoa hostile takeover bid. \"Alcoa chose to take their offer to our shareholders. Alcan's board rejected it,\"Alcan's Michaud said this week.\"We're continuing to pursue other alternatives.\" \u001d  The market has been rife with rumors that a white knight may assist Alcan in fending off Alcoa, with names such as BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP), Rio Tinto and Brazilian mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (RIO) mentioned. \u001d  Earlier this month, Rio Tinto announced what its new CEO Tom Albanese described as, \"one of the most significant investments made by Rio Tinto in recent years,\" a US$1.8 billion expansion of its Yarwun alumina refinery in the Australian state of Queensland. \u001d  The mining giant will boost annual output at its 100% owned plant in Gladstone to 3.4 million metric tons from 1.4 million tons by 2011. \u001d  -By Melanie Burton and Adam Smallman, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0) 20 7842 9412; melanie.burton@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:04 ET (15:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"747609215518d8bfb8ffdb7fc9f77f48","symR":["PRAI","US69353C1018"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Pharmaceutical Research To Pay Ex-CFO $264,000 Severance","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PRAI","US69353C1018"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:23 ET (14:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"748efe04e86152d102469ba95c9795a1","symR":["ENTG"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9916388],"ret5":[0.9916388],"Headline":"VP GOODMAN Sells 1,332 Of ENTEGRIS INC >ENTG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ENTG"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: ENTEGRIS INC \bSYMBOL: ENTG \b \bFILER: GOODMAN JOHN B \bTITLE: Vice President \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Sale                     1,332      $11.96          $15,931 \b(10b5-1 Plan Indicated)* \b \bOWNERSHIP: 178,826 (Direct)  151,739 (Indirect) \b \b  * - A 10b5-1 plan enables an insider to establish a program to make trans- \b      actions according to an advance plan.

Following news that CME raised the share exchange component of its bid for CBOT (BOT), CME's offer was valued higher than the competing bid for ICE, based on Thursday's closing share prices. However, after the open, with CME down and ICE shares trading higher, the ICE offer is again the more lucrative option, on a share exchange basis. Based on recent share prices, ICE's $11.45B bid compares with CME's offer of $11.28B. CME off 1.2% at $549, while ICE up 0.6% at $153. BOT up 3.9% at $214. (JLT) \u001d  9:40 (Dow Jones) The Economic Cycle Research Institute says its Future Inflation Gauge fell to 117.8 in June from an upward-revised 118.5 in May (had been 118.2). At the same time, a smoothed version of the annualized growth rate moved deeper into negative territory in June at a negative reading of 4.2% from an upward-revised negative reading of 3.5% in May (had been down 3.8%). \"Although U.S. economic growth is beginning to firm, the U.S. future inflation gauge is still in a cyclical downswing, suggesting that U.S. inflation pressures are still ebbing,\" says Lakshman Achuthan, managing director at ECRI. (JJM) \u001d  9:33 (Dow Jones) Long-end Treasury futures softened immediately after traders saw the stronger-than-expected payroll report, then technicals took over as the sell-off stalled at recent lows. Sept 10-year notes drop to a session low of 104-17+, off the June 22 bottom of 104-16. Recently trading at 104-23+, down 6+/32. Sept 30-year bonds hold above their June 22 low of 105-21. The low this session is 105-31. Recently at 106-09, down 9/32. (HLP) \u001d  9:22 (Dow Jones) Chicago Merc CEO Craig Donohue says he is \"extremely confident,\" about being able to secure a positive vote Monday in the proposed merger with Chicago Board of Trade (BOT), following news CME raised its share exchange component of its bid to .375 from .35. Caledonia Investments, CBOT's largest shareholder, which balked at earlier terms, confirmed Friday it plans to vote for the CME/CBOT deal, which would create the world's largest derivatives exchange. (JLT) \u001d  9:19 (Dow Jones) The September fed funds futures contract, at 94.75, prices in an implied funds rate of 5.25%. Sept had priced in a 5.245% implied yield just before the jobs report. Still, the market continues to reflect the widely held view the FOMC will be content to leave the funds rate at its current level at the Aug. 7 and Sept. 18 policy meetings. (HLP) \u001d  9:14 (Dow Jones) The 10-year yield, near 5.180%, if it clears the 5.144%-5.195% resistance band, which charts say is likely, will be the on the way up to 5.305%. The profit-taking point in that case would be 5.252%. The spot U.S. Dollar Index, near 81.60, if it breaks out on the intraday charts above 81.66, would be going for the upper end of its 81.95-81.31 intraday trading range. The euro, near $1.3600, is liable to dip to $1.3452. The signal for the move would be decisive trading below $1.3528. (SWC) \u001d  9:07 (Dow Jones) The dollar is reversing some its modest gains against its rivals on the back of a slightly-better-than-expected jobs report, and is now back to little changed versus the euro from day-earlier numbers. Analysts said the dollar's sharp, knee-jerk jump may have been a result a holiday-thinned trading. Early Friday, the euro was at $1.3596 from $1.3601 just before the data was released and $1.3598 late Thursday, while the dollar was at Y123.35 from Y123.23 pre-data and Y122.90 late Thursday, according to EBS. (DKM) \u001d  9:04 (Dow Jones) Comex gold and silver down after US jobs report. \"The dollar is rallying on the news,\" says Leonard Kaplan, president of Prospector Asset Management. \"People are beginning to believe the Fed is never going to cut rates. The economy is still strong. Jobs growth is still very strong.\" Comex gold down $1.80 to $648.80 an ounce for the day, compared to $651 two minutes ahead of the data. September silver down 5c to $12.53 compared to $12.56 before report. Much of the movement has been dictated by the Treasury market, Kaplan adds. (ALS) \u001d  9:01 (Dow Jones) There was a 12,000 increase in total construction jobs with no net change in residential construction, itself an improvement compared to past declines. (JJM) \u001d  9:00 (Dow Jones) Aggregate hours worked - combines the workweek with the employment gain - showed a 0.5% gain in June. That's a very solid increase in this important proxy for the input to production (was up 0.3% in manufacturing) suggesting good growth in June. (JJM) \u001d  8:55 (Dow Jones) For the first time, CME is offering more for CBOT (BOT) than the competing bid from ICE, based on Thursday's closing prices, following news that CME has raised the share exchange component of its bid to .375 from .35. Based on Thursday's closing share prices, CME's $11.48 billion bid is worth roughly $100 million more than the offer from ICE. (JLT) \u001d  8:52 (Dow Jones) Near-term supply concerns have forced the Brent crude forward curve into backwardation. Broker says concerns over Nigerian supply has seen buyers rush into the front months with the result that ICE Aug Brent is up 74c and Nov down 11c. \"This is typical of a market beginning to panic,\" says broker. But warns profit taking could pare the gains ahead of the weekend. ICE Aug Brent trades up 74c at $75.48/bbl while Nymex August WTI trades up 57c at $72.38/bbl. (DWE) \u001d  8:47 (Dow Jones) Lehman is sensing some deja vu. In battle for Bausch & Lomb (BOL), firm sees shades of the Guidant fight a couple years ago. Warburg Pincus and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are disciplined acquirers, while Boston Scientific (BSX) and Advanced Medical Optics (EYE) are less concerned about constructing strategically and financially sound deals. Finally, Guidant and BOL are assets with issues, all of which may not be known before a deal is done. As a result, Lehman sees the potential of back-and-forth bidding over the next several weeks, with the price tag going higher. (GS) \u001d  8:40 (Dow Jones) Before rounding the jobless rate was 4.529% compared to 4.464% in May, so in June the rate just barely held at 4.5%, whereas in May it was bumped up to that level. In either case, not much unemployment, still tight.

All told, a heavier than usual 44,000 call options and 19,000 put options on Macy's changed hands during the session. \u001d  A spokesman for Macy's said the company doesn't comment on speculation or trading. \u001d  The buyout speculators are likely inspired by the success of others in picking the next big acquisition, explained Jon Najarian, a trader who tracks unusual option activity at OptionsMonster.com. Evidence of that success came as recently as this week with the buyout of Hilton Hotels Corp. \u001d  \"All they've gotta do is get a taste of something like Hilton and they will follow the next 10 rumors in a row,\" Najarian said. \u001d  Najarian said he and his clients are sometimes drawn into the speculation, but that wasn't the case Friday. \u001d  That's because \"I see a split between buying and selling,\" he said, which he thinks is a clue that some traders were exploiting the rumor and selling back call options they bought two weeks earlier when buyout rumors about Macy's first emerged. \u001d  For example, with shares of Macy's rising as high as $43 during the session, contracts that convey the right to pay $42.50 for Macy's in the coming weeks surged in price to $2.20, from a close of 44 cents on Thursday. \u001d  That's also well above the highest price paid for these two weeks ago, when rumors about Macy's first inspired heavy trading in the contracts. On Friday, just over 8,000 of these contracts changed hands compared with 13,300 previously outstanding. \u001d  Recently, with Macy's shares up $1.90, or 4.8%, to $41.67, these July $42.50 calls were up 91 cents to $1.35. \u001d  But the notion that Macy's would make an appealing target for private-equity buyers is not unreasonable, many analysts think. \u001d  Bear Stearns analyst Christine Augustine, for example, recently wrote that she thinks the company could fetch as much as $50 in the event of a leveraged buyout though she noted that the she thinks the company's management \"would not be in favor of this type of transaction.\" \b \b   Target Also Draws Speculators \b \u001d  Shares and options on Target were also active Friday, though just what was driving the trading wasn't clear, with traders citing a number of rumors to explain the trading. \u001d  \"It seems that speculators might not be looking for a buyer for Target as much as they are for an increasing degree of gyrations for the shares,\" Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group said. Officials at Target weren't immediately available to comment. \u001d  Shares of Target rose $3.38, or 5.3%, to $67.59, and more than 72,000 call options and nearly 29,000 put options on the retailer changed hands. \u001d  Among the calls, interest was focused on contracts that convey the right to pay $67.50 for the stock in the coming weeks and months. For example, more than 18,800 of the July $67.50 calls traded, compared with 6,400 already outstanding. \u001d  -By Mohammed Hadi, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4049; mohammed.hadi@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:30 ET (19:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"76e427e222045074134e735c90801347","symR":["IRBT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.004695],"ret5":[1.025561],"Headline":"Dir CHWANG Sells 7,500 Of IROBOT CORP >IRBT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IRBT"],"IndustryCodes":["HPD","HPR","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: IROBOT CORP \bSYMBOL: IRBT \b \bFILER: CHWANG RONALD \bTITLE: Director \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/3/07-7/6/07      Sale                     7,500      $19.27         $144,525 \b(10b5-1 Plan Indicated)* \b \bOWNERSHIP: 8,000 (Direct)  1,543,177 (Indirect) \b \b  * - A 10b5-1 plan enables an insider to establish a program to make trans- \b      actions according to an advance plan.

This is because a REIT is structured so that 90% of income is distributed to shareholders, so a buyback would lower the dividend. \u001d  Land Securities is therefore amending the mandate and asking for fresh shareholder approval at the AGM. Greenslade says that the prospect of a buyback is \"something that comes across our radar screen on a regular basis.\" \u001d  He admits that the 19% discount to NAV at which the shares are currently trading is \"a noticeable gap,\" and says that most directors have bought shares at this level, signaling that they believe the market is undervaluing the company. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:46 ET (14:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7830337cedaad5a7582139003a66fd91","symR":["RMM.UN.T","CA7612981083"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Retrocom Mid-Market REIT Closes Sale Of Driftwood Mall In B.C.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RMM.UN.T","CA7612981083"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:01 ET (20:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"783d0b7dacee46215ca86d750ea95a71","symR":["GBL","US3614381040"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.009174,-0.00099],"ret5":[0.9859883,-0.00099],"Headline":"GAMCO Asset Mgmt To Vote Against Myers Industries Deal","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GBL","US3614381040"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:03 ET (14:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7842fe6477da6df49e52ac0f5c1e1cf6","symR":["000338.SZ","2338.HK","MAN.XE","CN000A0B9CD4","CN000A0MQ7K5","DE0005937007","000338.SZ","2338.HK","MAN.XE","CN000A0B9CD4","CN000A0MQ7K5","DE0005937007"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Germany's MAN, China's Weichai In Talks Over JV In China","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["000338.SZ","2338.HK","MAN.XE","CN000A0B9CD4","CN000A0MQ7K5","DE0005937007"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","TRQ","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:34 ET (12:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7866b02fee49d4db78605fd94b256432","symR":["XOM","US30231G1022"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.011335,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.030419,-0.00099],"Headline":"ExxonMobil (XOM) Block: 677,000 Shrs At 86.46","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["XOM","US30231G1022"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bEXXON MOBIL CORP. \bLast trade NYSE: +1.30 at 86.46 on zero tick \bTrade vol:       677,000 =    3.2% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   2,883,400 =   13.5% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:   4,555,136 =   20.7% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:      21,287,228 =   96.6% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:22,041,120 / Prev day -0.20 on 17,969,960 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:01 ET (20:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7870e5513fe034659de220d056c0c2d9","symR":["TROW"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9983221],"ret5":[1.029269],"Headline":"VP MILLER Acquires 44,000 Of PRICE (T ROWE) GROUP INC >TROW","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TROW"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","XDJGI","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: PRICE (T ROWE) GROUP INC \bSYMBOL: TROW \b \bFILER: MILLER MARY J \bTITLE: Vice President \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Exercise*               44,000      $16.68         $733,999 \b7/5/07             Surrender**             27,185      $53.04       $1,441,892 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 910,926 (Direct) \b \b  * - 24,000 shares exercised 4 months, 16 days before expiration. \b      20,000 shares exercised 1 year, 5 months before expiration. \b ** - Insiders can surrender shares back to the company to pay taxes or cover \b      the cost of an option exercise. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

If adequate supply becomes available, the U.S. rollout of the oils could be completed sooner than 2008, the company said. \u001d  Trans fats are listed on food labels as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. They can raise bad cholesterol and lower healthy cholesterol, increasing the risk of heart disease, doctors say. \u001d  Critics have said Burger King was taking too long to move toward the healthier oils. The Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest sued Burger King in May, saying the company was moving too slowly and had failed to set a definite timetable for removal of trans fats. \u001d  In response to the lawsuit, Burger King said in May it expected to begin the national rollout of its new zero-trans-fat oil by the end of this year. \u001d  Among Burger King's main competitors, McDonald's Corp. (MCD) said earlier this year it had selected a new trans-fat-free oil. Wendy's International Inc. (WEN) started using cooking oil with 0 grams of trans fat in August 2006. \u001d  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) announced in May that it will cut artificial trans fats out of food and drinks in its stores in the continental U.S., Alaska and Canada by the end of the year. \u001d  Yum Brands Inc. (YUM) said in April that all of its KFC restaurants are now serving fried chicken with 0 grams of trans fats. Yum Brands also said its Taco Bell restaurants switched to a trans-fat-free frying oil. \u001d  Burger King is owned by Burger King Holdings Inc. (BKC) and operates more than 11,200 restaurants worldwide. About 90% of its restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees. \u001d  Its shares fell 16 cents to $26.39 in recent trading. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:13 ET (16:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"79285b92d52721a370f6761ea9437f35","symR":["AA","AL","AL.T","CA0137161059","US0138171014"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.016803,1.005435,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.118819,1.117137,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Alcoa Says Will Comply With 2nd Request As Soon As Possible","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AA","AL","AL.T","CA0137161059","US0138171014"],"IndustryCodes":["ALU","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:02 ET (13:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"796fea424587af8ba8fa1d17470678fb","symR":["PBY"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP SMITH Sells 20,000 Of PEP BOYS-MANNY MOE & JACK >PBY","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PBY"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: PEP BOYS-MANNY MOE & JACK \bSYMBOL: PBY \b \bFILER: SMITH HAL \bTITLE: Vice President \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/6/07             Exercise*               20,000      $15.65         $313,000 \b7/6/07             Sale                    20,000      $20.83         $416,694 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 118,675 (Direct) \b \b  * - Exercised 6 years before expiration. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

Under his leadership, the agency will place more staff in its market oversight division because it thinks enhancing market transparency is needed to put Tokyo on a par with New York and London as an international financial center. \u001d  The FSA plans to increase the number of employees at the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) -- the backbone of the agency's market oversight function -- by 7.2% to 341 from 318 in fiscal 2007, while reducing the work force at the Inspection Bureau by three to 451. \u001d  The planned personnel reshuffle will result in the first net drop in the number of employees at the Inspection Bureau since the FSA was formed in 2000. \u001d  In the past, the FSA consistently increased the inspection staff every year to investigate the legitimacy of asset evaluations and other matters at banks and other financial firms. The proposed reduction is mainly due to the great progress banks have made in cleaning up their bad loans and restoring their balance sheets. \u001d  Recently, the bureau has been busy dealing with a string of consumer complaints about improper handling of investment trust sales by banks -- as shown by its punishment of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306.TO) in June for its defective internal control system. But the need for these inspections has begun to decline. \u001d  The SESC is in charge of monitoring whether market participants are complying with regulations properly by examining the financial statements filed by listed firms. It also checks for possible insider trading. \u001d  The FSA is already moving to expand the commission's staff in response to a series of erroneous financial statements issued by firms that have often been subject to agency penalties in the past. \u001d  In September, the FSA plans to launch a fact-finding survey regarding investment funds just prior to the full-scale implementation of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 00:32 ET (04:32 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"7a75f1de2473b69e47e1d6e08454d34c","symR":["CNH","F.MI","FIA","NHL.BE","IT0001976403","NL0000298933"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": CNH Financial Services Launches Private Label Finance Program With De Lage Landen in Poland","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CNH","F.MI","FIA","NHL.BE","IT0001976403","NL0000298933"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","TRQ","XDJGI","XMIB","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  HEILBRONN, POLAND -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 07/06/07 -- \u001d   CNH Financial Services, a fully owned subsidiary of CNH Global N.V. and market leader in the agricultural and construction equipment financing business, announced that it has entered into a private label program with De Lage Landen Leasing Polska SA, in order to provide financial solutions for CNH products in Poland. \u001d  This new private label program, branded CNH Capital, represents the first collaboration between the two companies and will service the agricultural and construction markets, two areas in which both companies excel. \u001d  De Lage Landen's specialist knowledge, partnership philosophy, technology and extensive experience in the leasing sector made them a logical partner for CNH Financial Services in the Polish market. \u001d  Under the brand name CNH Capital, the partners will be introducing De Lage Landen's innovative and market-leading mobile-to-web finance tool to the CNH distribution network in Poland, enabling CNH to provide the highest levels of quality and service to its customers. \u001d  CNH Global N.V. \u001d  Case New Holland (CNH) is a world leader in the agricultural and construction equipment businesses.

What separates today from the rest of the workweek is that, at 8:30 a.m. EDT, the jobs report for June will arrive. The report is widely considered to be perched atop the data heap. \u001d  The forecast range for the net growth in nonfarm jobs last month is 120,000 to 135,000 versus reported May growth of 157,000. \u001d  The stock market will welcome the expected easing in nonfarm jobs growth, but, if growth falls within the forecast range, it won't be enough to provoke a wild response. The range can be described, and has been described, as not too hot and not too cold. \u001d  If you're looking for action, you'll want nonfarm jobs growth of 80,000 or less or 180,000 or more. \u001d  A five-figure advance in nonfarm jobs in June may touch off a moderate rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It will be written that, \"Stocks were buoyed when a weaker-than-expected increase in nonfarm jobs in June seemed to rule out a rate increase at the August meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.\" \u001d  I do not have to tell you that the stock market is one of the few arenas that is said to react to a diminishment in the chances of something that wasn't going to happen anyway. One may as well write, \"Bond prices rose Thursday when Madison Square Garden wasn't leveled by a tornado.\" \b \b   One Nay, One Yea \b \u001d  Margaret, a financial planner in Tennessee, doesn't agree with me that I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby's prison sentence ought to have been commuted by President George W. Bush. Margaret e-mailed me: \u001d  \"Re the Libby Commutation: I've read any number of comments now by people eager to point out that President Bill Clinton pardoned people who may have not deserved it too. \u001d  \"Are these people all teenagers? 'But Billy got to do it. Why can't I?' \u001d  \"When Clinton pardoned Marc Rich, for example, I was angry. Being a Democrat didn't keep me from making judgment calls on Clinton's behavior. \u001d  \"What's next? Bush plays fast and loose with a cigar, gets caught and wails, 'Clinton did it!' \u001d  \"Unless someone can justify why Lewis Libby can lie to a grand jury and do no time for the offense, then they need to remain silent. Telling me that Clinton pardoned Rich is meaningless.\" \u001d  The excuse that \"Billy did it\" in no way ameliorates or erases the transgressions of others. I was thinking in terms of the Biblical injunction: \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.\" Hillary and Bill Clinton's scathing criticism of President Bush for the Libby commutation strikes me as laughable. \u001d  Another e-mailer, Peter at Raymond James, agrees with me. He e-mailed me: \u001d  \"Jim, I agree with your position on the Scooter Libby pardon. \u001d  \"It might not be right, but, for the Democrats, crying foul is just ridiculous. \u001d  \"Please see the attached list of the hundreds of pardons by Clinton.\" \u001d  For readers who are interested in confirming for themselves the information I am about to present, here's the link to the Office of the Pardon Attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice: http://www.usdoj.gov/pardon/clintonpardon_grants. \u001d  The site lists the number of pardons and commutations issued by all U.S. presidents since Harry S. Truman. Ruthie, who did the tallies because I don't have my enlarged computer screen up and running yet, reports that she could find only a partial listing of the pardons and commutations issued by George W. Bush since 2001, which totaled a paltry 39 pardons and three commutations (including Libby's). \u001d  Most of the other presidents listed on the Pardon Attorney's site, regardless of political party, make George W. Bush look like Ebenezer Scrooge. \u001d  Here's the breakdown: \u001d  -Bill Clinton: 396 pardons, 61 commutations \u001d  -George H.W. Bush: 74 pardons, three commutations \u001d  -Ronald Reagan: 393 pardons, 13 commutations \u001d  -Jimmy Carter: 534 pardons, 29 commutations \u001d  -Gerald Ford: 382 pardons, 22 commutations \u001d  -Richard Nixon: 863 pardons, 60 commutations \u001d  -Lyndon Johnson: 960 pardons, 226 commutations \u001d  -John F. Kennedy: 472 pardons, 100 commutations \u001d  -Dwight Eisenhower: 1,110 pardons, 47 commutations \u001d  And last, but not least, the King of Pardons, Harry Truman, with 1,913 pardons and 118 commutations. \u001d  Don't forget that HST set this record in less than two terms, having taken over in medias res when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt died in office. \b \b   Wiener Inflation \b \u001d  I would not characterize myself as lazy. I believe Ruthie disagrees with me, but I'm not going to ask her. \u001d  It occurred to me when I wrote that a hot dog from a pushcart in New York City costs $1.25 that I might be off by a quarter or two since it is about three years since I had my last pushcart hot dog in the city. \u001d  What I ought to have done was either return to New York City and buy a hot dog off a pushcart or call up somebody who recently had done so. Both options were closed to me, however, because one would have involved leaving the house and the other would have involved speaking to another human being. \u001d  Happily, I heard from Tom, who's in the business on Park Avenue in New York City and, so, is conversant with the current price of a pushcart frankfurter. Tom e-mailed me: \u001d  \"Jim, I believe the legendary New York City pushcart 'dirty water' dogs are now $1.50.\" \u001d  Funny you should call them \"dirty water dogs,\" Tom. I could say that habitues of New York City hot dog carts have trained themselves not to look at the water in which the wieners float. More likely, however, is that those of us who would buy hot dogs or knishes off a pushcart would buy them even if the franks were floating in industrial solvent. \b \b   Day Tripping \b \u001d  Come to think of it, I did leave the house on Thursday. Ruthie ferried me to a local Bank of America office, where, with her prompting, I did a bit of business. \u001d  Returning home, Ruthie dropped me off as she proceeded to drive to the Newport Mall in Jersey City where she picked up an anti-snoring pillow. (I'll leave it up in the air who the pillow is for.) \u001d  Imagine my surprise when, not long after I reentered our apartment, two technicians from Verizon came to the door. They had to test the telephone line for my work-at-home computer set-up, which is still not active. \u001d  I was able to speak to both of them as if I were a normal human being. I do believe, however, that the Verizon technicians were somewhat taken aback because I conversed with them with my teeth out. \b \u001d  (Jim Murphy, resident iconoclast at Dow Jones Newswires and veteran observer of global business trends, can be reached at (201) 938-2145 or by e-mail at Jim.Murphy@DowJones.Com) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:00 ET (12:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7bb53c9b5dfc24472366ec9154825b50","symR":["ADM"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.028742],"ret5":[1.026181],"Headline":"Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) Mkt On Close Buy Imbalance: Shrs 56900","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ADM"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:40 ET (19:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7c16ff94cc6f0f7d0b7a65ed9cd8dacb","symR":["CADAY"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Canada Morning: C$ Up Sharply After Strong June Jobs Data","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CADAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--The Canadian dollar is up sharply and pushing against its most recent 30-year highs early Friday, following a strong Canadian June employment report that revived expectations of Bank of Canada rate hikes beginning with the next scheduled rate announcement on Tuesday. \u001d  The U.S. dollar was trading at C$1.0480at 10:20 a.m. EDT (1420 GMT), from C$1.0518 at 8:00 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), and from C$1.0570 late Thursday. \u001d  The Canadian dollar was already drifting stronger on advance position-taking prior to the 7:00 a.m. EDT (1100 GMT) release of Canada's June employment report. \u001d  The currency then shot into the C$1.1525 region in the immediate wake of the news that the Canadian economy doubled consensus forecasts by creating nearly 35,000 jobs in June. \u001d  June's gains followed a period of sputtering employment growth in April and May, which together with other softer economic indicators had sown some doubt as to whether Tuesday's expected 25 basis point Bank of Canada rate increase would be anything more than a one-off event. \u001d  \"This should at least firm up some of the Bank of Canada waverers in the market,\" said chief currency strategist Shaun Osborne of TD Securities in Toronto. \"All in all, it's still looking very good for the Canadian dollar, especially with oil prices so robust.\" \u001d  The Canadian dollar following a brief period of narrow trading around the C$1.0525 region underwent a second wave of appreciation that has taken it to the C$1.0480 area, as profit-takers wiped out some of the U.S. dollar's global gains made in the wake of the U.S. June non-farm payrolls report. \u001d  U.S. job gains were close to forecasts at 132,000 in June, but there may have been some disappointment in the market given the suggestion of a larger tally from Thursday's report from payrolls processing firm Automatic Data Processing and consultancy Macroeconomic Advisors. \u001d  Osborne of TD Securities suggested that Friday's developments advance the Canadian dollar's chances of retesting its most recent 30-year highs in the C$1.0475 area from last week. \u001d  Further progress for the Canadian unit will likely depend on how hawkish the Bank of Canada proves to be in Tuesday's rate statement however, as the currency could be vulnerable to some degree of retracement if the central bank strikes a non-committal stance toward further rate hikes. \u001d  Canadian bonds are lower across the board in the aftermath of Friday's employment reports, with losses for longer-dated issues outpacing the rest of the market and the yield on the benchmark Canada 10-year bond standing at 4.69%, from 4.65% late Thursday. \u001d  These are the exchange rates at 10:20 a.m. EDT (1420 GMT), 8:00 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), and late Thursday. \u001d  USD/CAD 1.0480 1.0518 1.0570 \u001d  EUR/CAD 1.4289 1.4288 1.4373 \u001d  CAD/JPY 117.65 117.20 116.35 \u001d  -By Paul Evans;

(NASDAQ:DADE), the world's largest company solely dedicated to clinical diagnostics, introduced a next-generation D-dimer coagulation test, Innovance(TM) D-DIMER, in Europe, Canada, and the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. The Company also anticipates introducing a similar test in the United States in the future. \b \u001d  The Innovance(TM) D-DIMER test has a validated sensitivity for exclusion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), conditions associated with blood clots in the human circulatory system. The test benefits clinical laboratories of all types and sizes because it is a fully automated test that can be run on multiple coagulation systems offered through Dade Behring. \b \u001d  \"By using a simple blood test to help diagnose a patient with a possible blood clot, physicians are able to more quickly initiate proper treatment,\" said Jim Reid-Anderson, Chairman, President and CEO, Dade Behring. \"One of Dade Behring's priorities is to develop new tests such as this one, which assist health care providers around the world in offering differentiated care to their patients.\" \b \u001d  DVT and PE are serious medical conditions, affecting millions of people worldwide every year. DVT is caused by the formation of a blood clot in the deep veins of the legs, pelvis or upper extremities, leading to either partially or completely blocked circulation. PE occurs when a clot breaks loose and travels to pulmonary arteries. Both conditions could cause death if they are not diagnosed and treated properly. \b \u001d  Studies have shown that measurement of D-dimer may also be valuable in the evaluation of rethrombosis risk, to monitor potential coagulation disorders in pregnancy, and as an aid in the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Dade Behring continues to evaluate Innovance(TM) D-DIMER for these potential clinical indications. \b \u001d  About Dade Behring Hemostasis (coagulation and platelet function testing) \b \u001d  With more than 30 years of experience, Dade Behring is the largest provider of hemostasis analyzers and tests in the world. Under its own name and through a global alliance with Sysmex Corporation, Dade Behring offers a wide selection of analyzers to meet the needs of low-, medium-, and high-volume laboratories, including high-speed analyzers and cap piercing capability to improve operational efficiencies in the laboratory. The Company also offers an option to connect the high-volume Sysmex(R) CA-7000 Coagulation Analyzer to the StreamLAB(R) Workcell-- Dade Behring's scalable automation solution. \b \u001d  The Innovance(TM) brand name represents the company's commitment to the ongoing advancement and development of innovative coagulation assays to assess bleeding and thrombotic risk and disorders. Dade Behring has many \"firsts\" in the coagulation industry including pioneering the first recombinant tissue factor, Innovin(R), which is used in the routine prothrombin time (PT) coagulation test. The company also developed the first automated ristocetin cofactor activity test that detects Von Willebrand disease, which is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Dade Behring also has a leading position in automated platelet function analysis. \b \b   About Dade Behring \b \u001d  With 2006 revenue of more than $1.7 billion, Dade Behring is the world's largest company solely dedicated to clinical diagnostics. It offers a wide range of products, systems and services designed to meet the day-to-day needs of clinical laboratories, delivering innovative solutions to customers and enhancing the quality of life for patients.

The Seattle-area couple watched as doctors failed to revive their toddler when his lung collapsed and his heart stopped beating. An autopsy revealed that Kenny had swallowed powerful, aspirin-sized magnets that had become detached from Mega Brands Inc.'s ( MB.T) Magnetix toys. \u001d  At least 27 other children suffered life-threatening injuries after ingesting pieces of Magnetix, as the neodymium magnets blocked, or tore holes through, the children's intestines. \u001d  Since then, Mega Brands, a Montreal toy maker, has been in damage-control mode. There have been 14 legal settlements, and the company said Thursday it will sell shares to raise C$78.3 million to pay down debt incurred from charges related to its two product recalls. \u001d  Mega Brands Chief Executive Marc Bertrand told Dow Jones that the Magnetix woes are practically behind the company. Bertrand explained Mega Brands' plans for continued organic growth and international acquisitions. \u001d  \"We clearly have some great initiatives, we have to get this Magnetix behind us, and I think investors will start to see results and a promising future here,\" Bertrand said. \u001d  \"There is no more confusion in the marketplace\" since the second recall in April of Magnetix products without pre-printed ingestion labels, Bertrand said. This recall shows the company has taken \"very decisive action\" to \"assure safety of consumers worldwide,\" he said. \u001d  But the company that now aspires to a post-Magnetix recovery may find that its future performance and reputation will depend on how it juggles two narratives - a public-relations nightmare, and a more encouraging growth story. \u001d  Mega Brands has been profitable for many years and has been lauded by industry observers and consumers, who credit the company with introducing toys with popular appeal that stimulate children's imagination. \u001d  It has also been the subject of criticism for both recalls of its China-made Magnetix toys - a line the company acquired with its purchase of Rose Art two years ago. The March 2006 recall caused confusion among consumers and retailers - there was no way to distinguish the improved products from the old defective versions. As it was only a voluntary recall, not all retailers stopped selling the faulty product and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) lacked the power to enforce the recall. \u001d  In the 2007 recall, Mega Brands at first violated the terms of the recall agreement and relabeled older products to suggest they weren't the recalled versions, Julie Vallese, a CPSC spokesperson said. The company then complied fully with the recall agreement, she said. \u001d  When asked if the CPSC still has concerns about Magnetix toys, Vallese responded: \"The (Mega Brands) case is still open and CPSC is constantly monitoring the marketplace.\" \u001d  Due to these missteps, the hazard related to magnetic toys has attracted the attention of U.S. policy makers. A ban on magnetic toys is being talked about as an option. \u001d  Mega Brands stock price has suffered significantly. The stock is trading Friday in Toronto at C$20.38, down from a March high of C$26.55. Last year, it reached a high of C$29.75 then dropped to C$21 after the March 2006 recall. \b \b   Magnetix-Related Chgs Total US$75-US$80M \b \u001d  Through the duration of the Magnetix maelstrom, the company accrued charges of US$75-US$80 million, including US$35 million charged in the first quarter for the second recall. Mega Brands spent $13.5 million to settle four Magnetix lawsuits and 10 other claims. There are four lawsuits outstanding. Many analysts say there's a possibility for future Magnetix-related charges, for which the company may not be covered by insurance. Bertrand said he believes any further liability is limited. \u001d  If there is an upside in this, it is that the company is seeing an improvement in sales, with a 15% increase in the first quarter, to US$90 million. This includes, remarkably, an improvement in sales of Magnetix. \u001d  And while some specialty retailers aren't yet selling the redesigned and repackaged product, most major retailers are, even the previously reluctant Toys \"R\" Us Inc. (TOY.XX). Toys \"R\" Us is testing toys made in China from all manufacturers and has pulled various toys off the shelf. \u001d  At least two analysts say Mega Brands presents a good buying opportunity, citing strong revenue growth, new products, high insider ownership, and a cheap stock price. \u001d  Analyst Patricia Baker of Merrill Lynch said in a research note that Magnetix issues are \"transitory\" and the company is \"poised for strong growth in '07 from its other product categories.\" \u001d  Baker doesn't own the stock but it wasn't clear if Merrill has a banking relationship with Mega Brands. \u001d  Magnetix accounts for only about 13% of sales (or 30-40 cents a share), while its stackable bricks product, Mega Bloks, represents a larger portion of the business. \u001d  Bertrand said he is pleased that Mega Brands has strong proprietary products. However, its future business development depends on licensing partnerships, he said. Last year, licensed products from companies such as Disney, Marvel and Nickelodeon represented nearly 20% of sales, well below the industry average. He said current drivers of sales are \"Spider-Man 3\", \"Pirates of the Caribbean 3\", and Dora and Diego construction blocks. \u001d  Benoit Caron of Canaccord Adams said in a research report that the 2007 movie tie-in market is more competitive than anticipated. Caron indicated that Mega Brands will need to pick up slack to sustain solid growth in the boys 5+ segment, \"especially in the presence of a meaner and leaner Lego Group.\" \u001d  Caron owns the stock and Canaccord has an investment-banking relationship with Mega Brands. \u001d  Bertrand says the product pipeline is full of promise, with transforming robots called Neo Shifters, iCoaster - a Magnetix roller coaster that can play MP3s - and an \"interactive roommate\" toy called Brian the Brain. \u001d  Bertrand said acquisitions are an important part of the company's strategy, and is interested in preschool and stationary-activity companies. \u001d  \"We're always looking in the market at companies in North America, Europe or (elsewhere) that would help us strengthen our product portfolio, or that could actually make us enter new categories as we go forward,\" he said. \u001d  Now that the company will pay down its debt with proceeds from the share issue, it can \"use the flexibility of a de-leveraged balance sheet for a potential acquisition,\" according to Alain Tanguay, the company's chief financial officer. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.megabloks.com \b \u001d  -Mirella Christou, Dow Jones Newswires: 416-306-2025 mirella.christou@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:00 ET (14:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7f0b5afdc265716b909edeee8e44baa8","symR":["BRS"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.01336],"ret5":[1.021807],"Headline":"Bristow Group Sets Revenue Goal Of $1.5B By FY11 >BRS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BRS"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Bristow Group Inc.

Fiat shares are up more than 120% in the past year. \u001d  Fiat's strategy for the 500 ventures into new territory for the Italian company by marketing the small car at a premium price. \u001d  Analysts think Fiat could sell 200,000 Fiat 500s in 2008 at around EUR12,000 each. Pencil in a profit margin of about 5% - Fiat's making the cars in Poland - larger than the usual 2% or 3% for small cars, the resulting EUR120 million would have a significant impact on Fiat's bottom-line. Fiat earned EUR1.07 billion in 2006. \u001d  But with the 500 model, Fiat's gambling on consumers paying a premium price for a car that doesn't carry a premium brand. \u001d  VW knows that's not easy. The German auto maker cut the price of the Beetle last year to try to reverse declining sales. Initial sales of the retro car were also disappointing, though VW gained from the accompanying publicity. \u001d  The crowded European small-car market is also getting more so. Renault is soon to relaunch the Twingo that will retail at less than EUR8,000. Will the retro flavor of the Fiat 500 be worth the difference? \u001d  Overall market conditions are hardly favorable for new launches in Europe. Demand shrank by 1.1% in first quarter 2007. \u001d  Analysts are confident Fiat has done its homework. The average 2009 EPS forecast of EUR2 is only 15% below Fiat's own target, arguably more of a challenge for management than one the company thought it would reach. \u001d  Fiat is more efficient - the first-quarter operating margin widened to 4.4% - though that was mainly from cost cutting from which there will be diminishing returns. \u001d  And while strong sales in Brazil and at its truck unit Iveco are providing some extra momentum, much of the favorable investment sentiment surrounding Fiat stems from the unexpectedly strong turnaround it has already made. \u001d  Even if the 500 proves a big hit, maintaining the automaker's gains in market share are likely to become more difficult because some of Fiat's success reflects weakness among its main competitors in Europe.

(MTH) said its preliminary home orders fell 28% and its cancellations bumped up in another sign that builders continue to struggle with a slumping housing market with scant relief seen in the near future. \u001d  The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company Friday said its preliminary second-quarter home orders fell 28% from a year earlier to $502 million, while its cancellations rose to 37% of gross orders, up from 32% in the year-ago quarter and from 27% in the first quarter of 2007. \u001d  \"Weak demand and high inventory levels have increased competition among home builders, pressuring margins despite reductions in new home starts, lot supplies and operating costs,\" said Chief Executive Steven Hilton in a statement. \u001d  The company said it expects to book additional pre-tax charges of between $75 million and $80 million for the quarter as a result of inventory impairments and land-option write-offs. \u001d  In early June, Meritage warned that homes sales in April and May were weaker than expected, and backed away from its previous earnings outlook for 2007. On April 25, when the company reported first-quarter results, it had predicted full-year net income in the range of $2 to $2.50 a share, but the market has worsened since then. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial are looking for profit of $1.15 a share, on average. \u001d  The quarterly earnings season is off to an unpleasant start for home builders with some of the stocks setting new 52-week lows. \u001d  In late June, KB Home (KBH) said it swung to a loss as home deliveries dropped 36% from the previous year and home prices also fell. Another large builder, Lennar Corp. (LEN), also suffered a quarterly loss, blaming impairment charges and growing inventories of homes for sale, which pushed prices lower and further squeezed margins. \u001d  Many signs are pointing to a housing market that may worsen further before it improves. Economists say the market still needs to burn off excess inventory created when speculators fled the market when the mood shifted in 2005. Problems in the subprime-mortgage market and rising mortgage rates also continue to weigh. \b \b   Data Paint Bleak Picture \b \u001d  On June 25, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes in May were down 10.3% compared with a year earlier. Meanwhile, the resale inventory rose to an 8.9-month supply, the largest in roughly 15 years. The next day, the Commerce Department estimated U.S. new-home sales fell 1.6% in May, the 18th-consecutive month that sales fell from the previous year's levels. \u001d  Earlier this week, the NAR said pending home sales, which are seen as a leading indicator, fell 3.5% in May. Banc of America Securities analyst Daniel Oppenheim said the data indicate inventories could rise even more. He estimated inventories of existing homes for sale could approach 10 months of supply, \"likely at or above the peak in the late 1980s (and) early 1990s\" of the last housing downturn. \u001d  \"We think a lower level of construction activity is necessary to work off the inventory overhang and eventually lead to price stability, since demand is not expected to improve near-term as price declines and high inventory levels depress buyer confidence,\" Oppenheim wrote in a report to clients. \u001d  \"It seems that home builders' efforts to remove inventory have failed to ignite the market and, instead, the psychological factors of home buyers are playing a dominant role on the market,\" wrote Lili Zhang, an analyst at independent research firm Wall Street Strategies, in a report this week. \u001d  Buyer confidence has been further shaken by the trouble in subprime mortgages, which are designed for customers with weaker credit histories. Foreclosures are up and the subprime mess has spilled over into hedge funds that made bets in riskier mortgage-backed securities. \u001d  \"The home-building industry is in a severe recession, the subprime loans created a potentially major psychological problem for investors, and now the related hedge-fund debacle is in the news every day,\" wrote A.G. Edwards Chief Market Strategist Al Goldman in commentary earlier this week. \u001d  Additionally, the critical spring selling season has been a bust for home builders despite \"aggressive price reductions as a means to ignite the market,\" Zhang at Wall Street Strategies said. \u001d  \"Taking all these factors into account, we feel the housing market will not bottom out until the end of 2007, or early 2008,\" the analyst added. \"The housing market is cyclical in nature, and a housing downturn could easily last for over two years, and would not fully rebound (until) another two years later.\" \u001d  -By John Spence; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:16 ET (15:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"81d89f696b2ecd5a374cd642c42cd1e3","symR":["SLXP"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP FORBES Surrenders 1,113 Of SALIX PHARMACEUTICALS LTD >SLXP","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLXP"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: SALIX PHARMACEUTICALS LTD \bSYMBOL: SLXP \b \bFILER: FORBES WILLIAM P \bTITLE: Vice President \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/3/07             Surrender*               1,113      $12.33          $13,721 \b(10b5-1 Plan Indicated)** \b \bOWNERSHIP: 26,232 (Direct) \b \b  * - Insiders can surrender shares back to the company to pay taxes or cover \b      the cost of an option exercise. \b ** - A 10b5-1 plan enables an insider to establish a program to make trans- \b      actions according to an advance plan.

(OTCBB:CNOA), a growth-driven agricultural and products company leading China's organic foods revolution, has released revenue and earning guidance for calendar year 2007. The forecast released today projects record-setting revenues of approximately $16 million, representing an 80% increase over the $9 million for the comparable period of 2006. The Company, which reports on a calendar basis, also projects net income in excess of $6 million, representing an approximate 70% increase over the $3.43 million reported for 2006. \b \u001d  To view a multimedia presentation on China Organic Agriculture, please click here: http://www.trilogy-capital.com/content/cnoa/video/cnoa_intro.html. \b \u001d  The Company is firmly committed to expanding operations and increasing earnings and has already set in motion several initiatives to expand capacity and extend its reach into other fast-growing economies in Asia. The Company has posted approximately 100% growth for the trailing four years. \b \u001d  \"China Organic continues to experience significant quarterly and annual growth,\" said Jian Lin, Chief Executive Officer of China Organic Agriculture. \"We have expanded our core operations, adopted new technologies and improved business practices to substantially increase capacity as a means to accommodate escalating consumer demand.\" \b \u001d  China Organic's projected revenues reflect the Company's high-growth business model that continues to drive China's \"Organic Foods Revolution\" with a government-supported 40% share of all organic rice products sold. China Organic has set forth a solid, high-growth business model to continue making a significant impact in the growing market for organic foods, which has grown to $13 billion, equal to the U.S. market for organic foods. \b \u001d  The forecasted growth reflects the continued market penetration of China Organic Agriculture's ErMaPao organic rice products. Consumer awareness of ErMaPao has increased significantly over the past 12-months, which helped raise sales by 28%. The Company's production capacity reached a 92% utilization rate compared to 80% for the previous year. \b \u001d  Mr. Lin continued, \"China Organic is committed to significant growth organically and through strategic acquisitions, both vertical and horizontal, which will support our high-growth business strategy capitalizing on the increasing consumer demand for organic foods in the Chinese market. To that end, we are actively engaged in the identification, analysis and potential acquisition of a number of companies whose businesses are strategically appropriate for China Organic.\" \b \u001d  \"While there are no assurances, our publicly stated objective is to achieve a minimum of $100 million in annual revenues over the next twenty-four months with attendant earnings, facilitated by an experienced management team and a well-strategized acquisition program, coupled with substantial internal growth,\" Mr. Lin concluded. \b \u001d  In the first quarter of 2007, the Company reported revenues of $4.1 million, up 30 percent from the same period 2006. Gross margins increased to 43.9% with earnings of $1.72 million, or 42% of sales. In 2006 return on assets (ROA) was 59% while return on equity (ROE) was 73%. For 2006, the Company reported revenues of $9 million and earnings of $3.43 million. \b \b   About China Organic Agriculture \b \u001d  China Organic Agriculture is among the largest producers of organic rice in China commanding a 40 percent market share. COA controls all aspects of the process from seeds to planting and processing, R&D and sales. The proprietary processing factory is 20,000 square meters and has an annual production capacity of 30,000 tons. The Company also has an extensive sales network, located in the major cities in China. \b \u001d  COA, which follows GAAP accounting principles and is fully SEC compliant, has experienced significant growth since its inception in 2002, and has put solid plans in place to markedly expand revenues and increase shareholder value. The quality of COA's products results in the ability to command and receive prices 40% higher than comparables. In the first quarter of 2007 (as of March 31st) the company posted $4.1 million in revenue, up 30 percent from the same period 2006.

Cowan \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--Akzo Nobel NV (AKZOY) must either make an offer for Imperial Chemical Industries PLC (ICI.LN) or declare that it won't by August 9, the UK Takeover panel said Friday. \u001d  The UK Takeover Panel, which is Britain's takeover watchdog, issued the ultimatum after discussions with both parties' advisers. In a statement issued to the London Stock Exchange the regulators said the Dutch company must state its intentions regarding U.K. rival ICI by 5pm on 9 August. \u001d  In early June, Akzo Nobel, the world's largest coatings company by market share, made an indicative offer for ICI of 600p per share in cash, valued at GBP7.2 billion (EUR10.65 billion), an offer that ICI rejected on grounds that it \"significantly undervalues ICI.\" \u001d  The Takeover Panel said in its statement that each party has accepted the watchdog's ruling. Both Akzo Nobel and ICI declined to comment Friday on the matter. \u001d  A trader who asked not to be identified said the regulator's \"put up or shut up\" ruling places Akzo Nobel on the back foot and indicates that Akzo is still interested, otherwise the meeting with the panel would have resulted in Akzo walking away. The trader said he therefore expects a raised bid from Akzo. \u001d  Another trader, who also asked not to be identified, noted media reports Friday that ICI had requested the deadline be set. He said the move seems aimed at getting  Akzo to bid higher than its initial indication of 600p per share, and that price talk in the market is now over 650p. \u001d  Akzo Nobel is well cashed-up, after having agreed the sale of its OrganonBioSciences unit to Schering-Plough (SHP) for $11 billion cash. \u001d  Nonetheless, analysts were mixed as to what Akzo Nobel will do next. \u001d  Some, like Tom Muller at Gilissen and James Knight at Collins-Stewart, believe Akzo will raise it's offer. Knight reckons the next bid for ICI will be around 650p, while Muller says it could be as high as 700p. \u001d  Muller and Knight both said Akzo needs to make a significant acquisition, and that ICI seems the most logical and complementary target. If Akzo doesn't come back with a new offer, it risks becoming a takeover target itself, they added. \u001d  Rabo Securities analyst Mark van der Geest thinks Akzo should use the cash from the sale of its pharmaceuticals unit for smaller, less complicated acquisitions targets as well as return cash to shareholders. Van der Geest doesn't think Akzo Nobel will raise it's offer for ICI. \u001d  \"The indicative offer of 600p, made in early June, was more than enough for ICI and any higher bid, will destroy value for shareholders,\" said Van der Geest. \u001d  Akzo Nobel has long been seen as interested in ICI, which it has said in the past \"represent a highly attractive addition to its focused coatings and chemicals business.\" \u001d  After ICI rejected its indicative offer in June, Akzo said there was no certainty it would present a fresh proposal to ICI. \u001d  At 1335 GMT Akzo Nobel was trading up 0.9% at EUR64.38 while ICI was trading down 1.3% at 612 pence in a higher London market. \u001d  Akzo Nobel will report second-quarter earnings on July 24. \u001d  Company Web sites: http://www.akzonobel.com \u001d                      http://www.ici.com \b \u001d  By Roberta B.

The Certificates are collateralized by 133 loans ranging in size from less than 1.0% to 13.4% of the pool, with the top 10 loans representing 39.3% of the pool. The pool includes two investment grade shadow rated loans, representing 5.0% of the pool. \u001d  The pool has not realized any losses since securitization and currently there are no loans in special servicing. Twenty-nine loans, representing 13.1% of the pool, are on the master servicer's watchlist. \b \u001d  Moody's was provided with year-end 2005 and full- or partial-year 2006 operating results for 99.0% and 91.0%, respectively, of the pool. Moody's weighted average loan to value ratio (\"LTV\") for the conduit component is 100.1%, compared to 102.0% at securitization, resulting in an affirmation of all classes. \b \u001d  The largest shadow rated loan is the Plastipack Portfolio ($95.6 million -- 3.7%), which is secured by 14 industrial/warehouse buildings located in eight states. The portfolio totals 4.5 million square feet and is 100.0% leased to Plastipak Holdings under a lease which extends 10 years beyond the loan's maturity date. Property performance has improved due to increased revenues and loan amortization. The loan was structured with a 20-year amortization schedule and has amortized by approximately 4.4% since securitization. Moody's current shadow rating is Baa2, compared to Baa3 at securitization. \b \u001d  The second largest shadow rated loan is the Embassy Suites Loan ($36.0 million -- 1.4%), which is secured by a 318-room full service hotel located in Washington, D.C. Moody's current shadow rating is Baa2, the same as at securitization. \b \u001d  The top three conduit exposures represent 21.9% of the pool. The largest conduit exposure is the Regency Portfolio ($349.7 million -- 13.4%), which is secured by 20 retail properties located in six states with the highest concentrations in Virginia (36.8%), Pennsylvania (28.3%) and Maryland (12.9%). The portfolio contains approximately 2.3 million square feet and primarily consists of grocery or pharmacy anchored centers. The portfolio has maintained a stable occupancy level of approximately 95.4% since securitization. Moody's LTV is 103.7%, same as at securitization. \b \u001d  The second largest conduit exposure is the Silver City Loan ($134.0 million -- 5.1%), which is secured by the borrower's interest in a 971,000 square foot regional mall located in Taunton, Massachusetts. The mall is anchored by Macy's, Sears and J.C. Penney. Although collateral occupancy has remained relatively stable at approximately 89.0%, financial performance has been impacted by increased expenses. Moody's LTV is 104.6%, compared to 102.3% at securitization. \b \u001d  The third largest conduit exposure is the One World Trade Center Loan ($90.0 million -- 3.4%), which is secured by a 573,000 square foot Class A office building located in Long Beach, California. As of December 2006 the property was 76.0% occupied, compared to 85.5% at securitization. Financial performance has been impacted by the decreased occupancy as well as increased expenses.

In battle for Bausch & Lomb (BOL), firm sees shades of the Guidant fight a couple years ago. Warburg Pincus and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are disciplined acquirers, while Boston Scientific (BSX) and Advanced Medical Optics (EYE) are less concerned about constructing strategically and financially sound deals. Finally, Guidant and BOL are assets with issues, all of which may not be known before a deal is done. As a result, Lehman sees the potential of back-and-forth bidding over the next several weeks, with the price tag going higher. (GS) \u001d  8:40 (Dow Jones) Before rounding the jobless rate was 4.529% compared to 4.464% in May, so in June the rate just barely held at 4.5%, whereas in May it was bumped up to that level. In either case, not much unemployment, still tight. (JJM) \u001d  8:38 (Dow Jones) Dollar up modestly after US payrolls data comes in slightly higher than expectations. Early Friday, the euro was at $1.3586 from $1.3601 just before the data was released and $1.3598 late Thursday, while the dollar was at Y123.41 from Y123.23 pre-data and Y122.90 late Thursday, according to EBS. (DKM) \u001d  8:36 (Dow Jones) Treasurys losing ground after as-expected payrolls, and a strong upward revision to May's number. The two-year is down 2/32 for 5.01%, and 10-year down 13/32 for 5.20%. (ECB) \u001d  8:35 (Dow Jones) US stocks futures have dipped into negative territory after the jobs report comes in just about as expected. DJIA futures now down 10, S&P futures down 1.40. (PJV) \u001d  8:33 (Dow Jones) Jobs data is on the screws at a 132,000 gain and a 4.5% unemployment rate. But upward revisions to prior months' jobs gains show the labor market continues to grow robustly, and that's why the Fed can't do much to ease back on its inflation concerns. (MSD) \u001d  8:28 (Dow Jones) With the release of the monthly payrolls report only minutes away, nearby Eurodollar futures are about unchanged from Thursday. Dec prices in about a 20% chance for the FOMC to reduce the funds rate to 5%, from the current 5.25%. March 08 prices in about a 34% chance for a 5% funds rate in the 1Q of next year, while June 08 sees about a 42% chance for a 25 BP rate cut to occur in next year's 2Q. (HLP) \u001d  8:24 (Dow Jones) Heading into the June payroll report, the Aug and Sept fed funds futures contracts priced in an implied funds rate of 5.245%. Both contracts recently trading at 94.755, reflecting the widely held view that the FOMC will not reduce the funds rate from its current 5.25% level at the Aug. 7 and Sept. 18 meetings. (HLP) \u001d  8:20 (Dow Jones) The domestic travel and tourism industry is in boom mode right now, Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg says, judging by yesterday's ADP jobs report. \"There can be no doubt that if there is one industry that is in boom mode right now (outside of infrastructure spending, health care, credit bureaus and collection agencies), courtesy of the weak US dollar, it is travel & tourism and everything connected with it,\" he writes. (PJV) \u001d  8:12 (Dow Jones) Treasurys were left to wallow at the previous session's lows overnight, with few investors willing to step into the market prior to today's key jobs number. David Ader of RBS Greenwich Capital says the sheer amount of long positions in the Treasurys market - thanks in large part to the recent safe-haven buying - raises the potential for a negative reaction to the data, and even a very soft reading is unlikely to break the 10-year yield back below 5%. Two-year unchanged for 4.98%, 10-year down 1/32 for 5.15%. (ECB) \u001d  8:08 (Dow Jones) Dollar is slightly stronger but maintaining tight ranges ahead of 8:30 a.m. EDT jobs report. A non-governmental report yesterday on private-sector payrolls came in higher than expected, leading some analysts to think today's official number will also beat expectations. Economists surveyed are expecting a 128,000 gain in June payrolls and a steady 4.5% unemployment rate. Lately, euro at $1.3591 from $1.3598 late Thursday, while dollar's at Y123.31 from Y122.90, according to EBS. Euro at Y167.56 from Y167.10 late Thursday. Sterling at $2.0092 from $2.0118, while the dollar was at CHF1.2215 from CHF1.2173 late Thursday. (DKM) \u001d  8:05 (Dow Jones) Goldman Sachs downgrades Ruth's Chris Steak House (RUTH) to sell from neutral after the upscale eatery reports 2Q same-store sales slippage. \"We expect Ruth could see prolonged negative traffic,\" analyst Steven Kron tells clients, adding that \"potentially slowing capital gains and business spending will likely weigh\" on some of RUTH's key clientele. Goldman cuts EPS forecasts, target price falls to $18 from $23. RUTH down 5.2% premarket at $16.36. (RLG) \u001d  7:53 (Dow Jones) Microsoft's (MSFT) extension of its XBox warranty is a short-term earnings hit, analysts say, but the right thing to do to win over the gaming community. Few analysts seem perturbed by the $1B-plus costs or by the company saying it had shipped fewer Xbox 360 units than expected (11.6M vs 12M goal vs original 13M-15M estimate).

Sogecable's parent company, Promotora de Informaciones SA (PRS.MC) was also dragged down by the news, shedding 3.4%, or EUR0.54 to EUR15.48. \u001d  \"Everything points to a possible cancellation of the agreement signed last year, if things don't change,\" local brokerage Banesto said in a note to investors. \"Once again, there's a growing risk of inflation in soccer rights.\" \u001d  Banesto said the worst-case scenario - of a 100% increase in soccer rights costs for Sogecable - would result in a 46% downside for the company's valuation. The brokerage rates Sogecable stock at buy, with a EUR33.30 target. \u001d  Audiovisual Sport, 75%-owned by Sogecable, said Thursday it had already filed a EUR28 million lawsuit against Mediapro on Tuesday, seeking to uphold the 2006 agreement. \u001d  Audiovisual Sport also expressed doubts about how secure Mediapro's agreement was with the Spanish soccer teams. \u001d  \"This deal is still two years away, and this is a long time in the sports content business,\" an Audiovisual Sport spokesman said Friday. \u001d  \"We also have doubts about how solid Mediapro's model really is, and if they have the financial firepower to carry through their plan,\" he added. \u001d  Spanish press reported earlier this week that Mediapro had promised to distribute EUR500 million among top Spanish soccer clubs, in exchange for the rights. \u001d  On Thursday, Mediapro chairman Jaume Roures declined to disclose financial details of its agreements. He said the company was pursuing new platforms for the transmission of soccer matches and is considering agreements with Internet platforms, mobile telephone operators and high-definition wide screen cinemas. \u001d   Brokerage BPI said in a research note Friday that other companies in the past had reached agreements with Spanish soccer teams over broadcast rights, but later had to back down after failing to come up with the cash to fulfill the agreements. \u001d  In 2003, Santa Monica Sports agreed to buy Spanish soccer rights, but the Spanish league later was forced to reach an agreement directly with Sogecable when Santa Monica Sports couldn't pay for them. \u001d  Mediapro made waves last May after wrestling away broadcasting rights for Formula One car racing - between 2009 and 2013 - from Gestevision Telecinco SA (TL5.MC), Spain's top broadcaster by market value and audience share. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sogecable.es \b \u001d  -By Jason Sinclair and David Roman, Dow Jones Newswires, 34 913958127, jason.sinclair@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 06:53 ET (10:53 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"874dcd8a7b12053a1e40e8092df0ba19","symR":["ALGT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9743193],"ret5":[1.036819],"Headline":": Allegiant Reports June, Second Quarter 2007 Traffic","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T04:53:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ALGT"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LAS VEGAS, July 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Allegiant Air, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Allegiant Travel Company (Nasdaq: ALGT), today reported preliminary passenger traffic results for June and Second Quarter 2007. \b \b \b                                Scheduled Service \b \b                                   Jun. 2007       Jun. 2006       Change \b    Passengers                      281,977         178,988         57.5% \b    Revenue passenger miles (000)   263,091         183,590         43.3% \b    Available seat miles (000)      296,982         214,359         38.5% \b    Load factor                       88.6%           85.6%       3.0 pts \b \b                                    2Q 2007         2Q 2006        Change \b    Passengers                      753,716         476,174         58.3% \b    Revenue passenger miles (000)   708,616         504,635         40.4% \b    Available seat miles (000)      833,475         610,294         36.6% \b    Load factor                       85.0%           82.7%       2.3 pts \b \b                                  Total System* \b \b                                  Jun. 2007       Jun. 2006        Change \b    Passengers                      298,935         205,408         45.5% \b    Revenue passenger miles (000)   281,855         204,230         38.0% \b    Available seat miles (000)      324,308         247,940         30.8% \b    Load factor                       86.9%           82.4%       4.5 pts \b \b                                    2Q 2007         2Q 2006        Change \b    Passengers                      810,555         535,499         51.4% \b    Revenue passenger miles (000)   774,828         563,236         37.6% \b    Available seat miles (000)      928,177         703,336         32.0% \b    Load factor                       83.5%           80.1%       3.4 pts \b \b     *Total system includes scheduled service, fixed fee contract and non- \b      revenue flying. \b \b \b    About the Company \b \u001d  Las Vegas-based Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT), is focused on linking travelers in small cities to world-class leisure destinations such as Las Vegas, Nev., Orlando, Fla. and Tampa/St. Petersburg, Fla.

The former ICAP chief investment officer and chief executive officer had taken a leave of absence last week. \u001d  Besides his other roles, Lyon served as co-manager of three popular mutual funds. The Chicago-based investment shop was purchased last year by New York Life Investment Management. \u001d  \"Rob was a great investor with a very broad perspective of the markets,\" said Jerrold Senser, who served as Lyon's co-manager and longtime colleague. \"He was able to understand what was going on from a macro level. At the same time, he had a very keen sense of what was going on with companies in terms of valuations with stocks.\" \u001d  That sort of combination of macro and fundamental stock picking was unique in retail fund management, says Andrew Gogerty, a Morningstar Inc. analyst. \u001d  \"Lyon brought a unique approach to money management that not many of his peers have been able to replicate,\" he said. \"As a result, he has been one of the real standout large-cap value managers in the industry over the past 15 years.\" \u001d  Lyon is survived by his wife, Donna, and five children. \u001d  A former economist, Lyon joined ICAP in 1976 as an analyst. Five years lager, he joined Fred Alger Management as an analyst and executive vice president. In 1988, he returned to ICAP and initially served as director of research before becoming the company's president and chief investment officer in 1992. \u001d  Among his many awards, Lyon along with Senser was named as Morningstar's International Fund Manager of the Year in 2005. The pair served as co-managers for retail investors of MainStay ICAP International Fund (ICEUX). \u001d  In the past five years, the fund has been a consistent top-quartile performer. It had an average annualized return of more than 20% through Thursday. That was good enough to beat 88% of its foreign large value rivals, says Morningstar. \u001d  The firm's other marquee fund is MainStay ICAP Select Equity Fund (ICSLX). The team of Lyon and Sensor had guided it to an average annualized return of 15.76%, besting 95% of their large-cap value U.S. peers. \u001d  As an institutional money manager and analyst Gogerty said Lyon's longer-term record was also sterling. \u001d  \"The loss of his experience is definitely something that can't easily be replaced,\" Gogerty said. \"He carved out a very unique investment niche and did extremely well with it.\" \u001d  At the same time, he added that ICAP funds remain in capable hands. \"We wouldn't advise any investors to sell shares in their funds at this time,\" Gogerty said. \"The ICAP strategy is supported by a deep bench for their style and approach.\" \u001d  ICAP's investment team includes 14 sector analysts and members of the senior investment committee. That group is responsible for making portfolio decisions on the firm's mutual funds and institutional portfolios. \u001d  The firm's research director, Thomas Wenzel, will become Senser's co-manager on its mutual funds. \u001d  Senser says with more than two decades of industry experience, 15 of that at ICAP, Wenzel has been a valuable part of the firm's investment process. He added that Wenzel has been a key contributor in helping to whittle broader portfolios into more focused versions such as MainStay ICAP Select Equity Fund. \u001d  The third fund he'll co-manage is MainStay ICAP Equity Fund (ICAEX), which had 45 different stocks through May compared to Select Equity's 29 names. \u001d  \"Our team is unchanged in terms of the people who are here,\" Senser said. \u001d  The Chicago-based ICAP, which was founded in 1970, manages about $16.5 billion in institutional assets. The firm has another $3.6 billion in assets under management in its trio of mutual funds. \u001d  ICAP, which has its roots in managing large corporate and pension plan portfolios, credited New York Life Investment Management's much larger distribution channels and support staff as a major plus to future growth. While remaining independently managed, ICAP's portfolios are now part of the MainStay family of funds. \u001d  Senser will replace Lyon as ICAP's CEO and CIO, officials said. \u001d  -Murray Coleman; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:29 ET (18:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8982534685a0c4e643072267e0be8dd5","symR":["ROLL"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9980989],"ret5":[0.9895437],"Headline":"Chmn HARTNETT Sells 14,144 Of RBC BEARINGS INC >ROLL","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ROLL"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: RBC BEARINGS INC \bSYMBOL: ROLL \b \bFILER: HARTNETT MICHAEL J \bTITLE: Chairman of the Board \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Sale                    14,144      $41.02         $580,190 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 236,629 (Direct) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

Senior Centers to promote heat safety awareness and educate consumers on simple and low-cost ways to conserve energy inside their homes. \b \u001d  \"During the summer, senior citizens are among our most at-risk customers, and it is imperative that we educate them on ways to avoid heat-related emergencies,\" said Kelli Rod, director of community relations for TXU Energy. Some senior citizens may also be on fixed incomes, so we want to be sure to educate them on ways to save money on their monthly electric bills, as well.\" \b \u001d  TXU Energy Community Relations managers are demonstrating ways to conserve energy and avoid heat-related emergencies during the summer when consumers are most at risk. Each workshop participant will receive a compact fluorescent light bulb (energy efficient), a magnet and brochure with \"Beat the Heat\" tips, and an energy conservation booklet to get started on energy conservation and avoid heat-related emergencies. \b \u001d  \"TXU Energy is in our community promoting convenient and inexpensive ways for our clients to stay safe and save money this summer,\" said Marc Levinson, director of agency development for Neighborhood Centers Inc. \"Through workshops like these, we are able to educate our community on ways to avoid heat-related illnesses and conserve valuable energy.\" \b \b \b    Some of the recommended energy conservation tips include: \b \b    -- Temperature settings - Set thermostats at about 78 degrees during the \b       summer. Turn thermostats up or down automatically without sacrificing \b       comfort by installing a programmable thermostat. Use ceiling fans in \b       the \"down\" mode at the highest speed to push cooler air back down into \b       the room. \b \b    -- Window treatments - Install storm or thermal windows and doors or \b       double-paned glass. A less expensive alternative is plastic sheeting, \b       which can be temporarily fastened over doors and windows to prevent \b       drafts and retain cool air. \b \b    -- Air leaks - Check for air leaks in air ducts, windows, plumbing \b       utilities, fireplace flues, attic entrances and recessed light \b       fixtures. \b \b    -- Air Conditioning filters - Clean or replace your air conditioner's \b       filter monthly to help your air conditioner run more efficiently. \b \b    -- Light bulbs - Replace traditional incandescent light bulbs with compact \b       fluorescent light bulbs. You can run four compact fluorescent light \b       bulbs for the same cost as running just one incandescent bulb. \b \b    -- For more tips, please visit http://www.txu.com/energytips \b \b    Some of the recommended heat safety tips include: \b \b    -- Drink one glass of cool water for every 20 minutes of heat exposure. \b    -- Avoid eating hot foods and heavy meals. \b    -- Wear loose, light-colored absorbent cotton clothing. \b \b \u001d  TXU Energy is traveling the state this summer hosting \"Beat the Heat\" workshops in more than 30 communities state-wide. In total, TXU Energy will distribute approximately 30,000 compact fluorescent light bulbs and Beat the Heat materials to consumers through community partnerships and organizations. \b \b    About TXU Energy \b \u001d  TXU Energy is a subsidiary of TXU Corp.

UBS is no longer attributing a 20% holding-company discount to its net-asset-value calculation for Onex, reflecting the company's ongoing transition to a more active fund-management strategy. \u001d  Chamoun expects Onex to start marketing a third private-equity fund and real-estate fund in the second half of this year. The size of this fund could be around C$700 million to C$1.0 billion (US$662-US$946 million), with Onex potentially investing 25% to 30% of the monies, Chamoun said. The windfall to Onex's shareholders from increasing management and performance fees is \"substantial,\" he added. \u001d  Onex, Toronto, has global operations in the service, manufacturing and technology industries.

The Ex-date is July 12, 2007. The previous monthly dividend was $0.055 per share. \b \u001d  The current distribution rate represents a 5.62% annualized dividend yield based on the closing market price of $11.75 on July 5, 2007 and a 5.44% annualized dividend yield on a closing NAV of $12.14 on the same date. \b \u001d  Future earnings can not be guaranteed and the Fund's dividend policy is subject to change.

Annualized dividend yield is the latest monthly dividend shown as an annualized percentage of net asset value/market price at month end. Annualized dividend yield simply measures the level of dividends and is not a complete measure of performance. Market price, annualized dividend yield, net asset value are historical and will fluctuate and do not guarantee future results. \b \u001d  DWS Strategic Municipal Income Trust seeks a high level of current income exempt from federal income tax by investing in a diversified portfolio of investment-grade tax-exempt securities.

Additionally, although the fund seeks income that is federally tax-free, a portion of the fund's distributions may be subject to federal, state, local and alternative minimum tax. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate risk such that when interest rates rise, the prices of the bonds, and thus the value of the bond fund, can decline and the investor can lose principal value \b \u001d  Investments in closed-end funds involve risk. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering, and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the Fund's shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value. \b \u001d  This announcement is not an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell shares of the Fund or a prospectus, circular or representation intended for use in the purchase or sale of Fund shares. \b \bNOT FDIC/ NCUA INSURED MAY LOSE VALUE NO BANK GUARANTEE \bNOT A DEPOSIT NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY \b \u001d  DWS Scudder is part of Deutsche Asset Management, which is the marketing name in the US for the asset management activities of Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. and DWS Trust Company.

(AA) kicks off second-quarter earnings season Monday, with investors anxious for any new insight into the aluminum giant's $28 billion hostile bid for rival Alcan Inc. (AL). \u001d  Alcoa recently hinted that it might increase its offer, and the company could elaborate on its plans during a post-earnings conference call with Wall Street analysts after Monday's close. Alcoa's overtures have been consistently rebuffed by Alcan, but experts nonetheless are looking to industry consolidation as a major driver of aluminum prices. \u001d  As for the second quarter, Alcoa executives said in April that they expected global growth in aluminum consumption to hold steady at about 7.7% for the period. At the time, they said consumption appeared to be leveling in North America but remained solid in Europe and India and was tracking above expectations in China. \u001d  Wall Street expects Alcoa to earn 83 cents a share in the second quarter on about $8.34 billion in revenue, compared with 90 cents a share in the year-ago period on about $7.96 billion in revenue. Alcoa doesn't provide quarterly earnings guidance. \b \b   GE Seen Posting Solid 2Q Results \b \u001d  General Electric Co. (GE) reports second-quarter results Friday, just three weeks after the stock surged to a five-year high of $39.77 in a long-awaited breakout. \u001d  GE shares, trading recently around $38.45, have retrenched somewhat since then. But Wall Street continues to anticipate a solid quarter from the conglomerate, buoyed by strong results in its aerospace operations and demand for its power-plant turbines and locomotives. \u001d  The company is expected to earn 52 cents a share from continuing operations, up 11% from 47 cents a share in the year-ago period. Revenue is expected to climb 6%, to about $42.17 billion from $39.9 billion. In April, GE forecast its second-quarter earnings from continuing operations at 52 cents to 54 cents a share. \u001d  Among other things, Wall Street also will be scrutinizing GE's results for more evidence of an ongoing turnaround at its NBC Universal unit. \b \b   Gloomy June Retail Sales In The Cards \b \u001d  Retailers are slated to report June sales next Thursday, and the outlook is fairly downbeat. A calendar shift moved Memorial Day sales into May this year at June's expense, and big department stores felt the pain - Macy's Inc. (M), J.C. Penney Co. (JCP), Kohl's Corp. (KSS) and Saks Inc. (SKS) have all forecast a decline in June same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year. Last week, Target Corp. (TGT) said its June same-store sales were tracking at the low end of its plan for a 3% to 5% increase. \u001d  On top of the calendar shift, retailers are grappling with a swooning housing market that has spooked consumers. And while the employment picture remains healthy, gasoline prices continue to tax lower-income customers, putting a lid on sales at discounters including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT). Weakness in June isn't a good thing for the industry, as June frequently ranks as the second-biggest month of the year for retailers behind December. \b \b   Leaner 2Q Seen For Yum Brands, Ruby Tuesday \b \u001d  Restaurant operators begin reporting in earnest next week and Wall Street isn't expecting a bountiful buffet - more like warmed-up leftovers. Economic jitters, amplified by continued high gasoline prices, limit guest-traffic gains. Rising cheese prices could be a monkey wrench at several pizza and burger chains. \u001d  Ruby Tuesday Inc. (RT) and Yum Brands Inc. (YUM) report Wednesday. The consensus for Ruby is 47 cents, down from 53 cents a year ago. Fast-food giant Yum is expected to report per-share earnings of 36 cents, compared with 34 cents last year, with persistent weakness in Taco Bell's U.S. numbers muting strong performance abroad. \b \b   CBOT Holders Vote On Sweetened CME Offer \b \u001d  CBOT Holdings Inc. (BOT) shareholders vote Monday on whether to approve the merger agreement with Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME), which would create the world's largest derivatives exchange. \u001d  CME shook things up today by improving the terms of its offer. The latest version, the third CME has issued amid competing CBOT offers from IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE), won over CBOT's largest shareholder - Caledonia Investments - who had previously said it was voting against the deal. \b \b   Avastin Seen Driving 2Q EPS Growth For Genentech \b \u001d  Biotechnology heavyweight Genentech Inc. (DNA) is expected to report 27% growth in earnings-per-share when it releases second-quarter results after market close Wednesday, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Cancer drug Avastin is seen driving the solid growth, but investors will be on the lookout for any signs of a slowdown due to a recent patient trial showing that a low dose of the drug was equally as effective as a higher dose in treating lung cancer. The new eye-disease drug Lucentis also is expected to be a big contributor to Genentech's results. \b \b   Lear Holders Decide On Icahn Offer \b \u001d  Shareholders of Lear Corp. (LEA) are scheduled to decide the future of the company at its annual meeting Thursday in Wilmington, Del. The holders are set to vote on Carl Icahn's proposed $36-per-share offer to buy the auto supplier. The deal has faced opposition from some large shareholders who argue the price is too low, while Lear argues that the price is fair and that Lear still faces significant risks. \u001d  Two shareholder advisory firms, including Institutional Shareholder Services, have recommended shareholders reject the offer. But Egan-Jones recommends holders approve the deal. Pzena Investment Management, Lear's second-largest shareholder after Icahn, has criticized the deal, saying it undervalues Lear's long-term prospects. \b \b   Marriott To Post 2Q Results Amid Hotel Sector Speculation \b \u001d  Marriott International Inc. (MAR) plans to release its second-quarter earnings Thursday amid speculation that the hotel sector could be the next destination spot for private-equity money following news this week that Hilton Hotels Corp. (HLT) will be sold to the Blackstone Group (BX). Analysts expect the company to report a quarterly profit of 53 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial. \b \b   Pepsi Bottling Facing Another Tough Quarter \b \u001d  Analysts expect Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) to report earnings of 63 cents a share on revenue of $3.29 billion when the PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) bottler reports second-quarter results next week. JPMorgan analyst John Faucher notes that he doesn't expect earnings to come in much above analysts consensus estimate. \"PBG is facing another tough quarter from a comparison standpoint, with nearly double-digit topline growth and mid-single-digit volume growth in the year-ago period,\" Faucher writes. \b \b   Trade Balance, Retail Sales Data Released \b \u001d  On the economic front, the week ahead looks to be quiet, with just two reports of importance - the trade balance for May and the retail sales report for June - on the agenda, neither of which are expected to change expectations, cemented by the firm jobs report Friday, that the economy put in a strong performance in the second quarter, growing around 3%. That's a sharp recovery from the 0.7% pace seen in the first quarter - and bond markets have in recent weeks adjusted their monetary-policy bets accordingly. \b \b   Conferences On Tap \b \u001d  Among the significant broker-sponsored conferences next week are the Bank of New York Global Concepts - Cash Management Forum, Monday through Wednesday, Houston; Banc of America Securities 3rd Annual Funding Agreement Backed Conference, Tuesday and Wednesday, New York; Standard & Poors Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Hot Topics Conference, Tuesday, New York; BMO Capital Markets 2007 Media, Communications & Technology Conference, Wednesday through Friday, Kohler, Wis.; and Credit Suisse Group Media Conference, Thursday, Boston. \b \u001d  -By Danielle Le Grand, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2120; danielle.legrand@dowjones.com \u001d  (Dow Jones Newswires staff contributed to this report.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:30 ET (18:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8fc19d969697683de5178f1aff3330b4","symR":["0316.HK","AIG","DB","DBK.XE","BMG677491539","DE0005140008","US0268741073"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,1.00214,1.00027,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,0.9940068,0.9966223,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"New Jersey's Biggest Shipping Terminal Wins Approval For Sale","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0316.HK","AIG","DB","DBK.XE","BMG677491539","DE0005140008","US0268741073"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","INF","INS","MAR","XDAX","XDJGI","XDJI","XES","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\u001d  TRENTON, N.J. (AP)--Family-owned Maher Terminals LLC, the New Jersey's biggest shipping terminal, has won approval from a bistate agency for its planned sale to a Deutsche Bank (DB) unit. \u001d  The deal marks the third time this year that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has approved a lease transfer for one of the marine terminals it operates, authority spokesman Steven Sigmund said Friday. \u001d  Maher Terminals is in Elizabeth, N.J. \u001d  \"What we're really talking about here is a trend toward private-equity owners taking over terminal operations,\" Sigmund said. \u001d  As part of the transfer of long-term leases for those terminals, the Port Authority has been getting the new buyer or operator to commit millions of dollars to improve the facilities, Sigmund noted. \u001d  In the latest deal, which closed Thursday, Maher sold its terminal in Elizabeth to Deutsche Asset Management's RREEF Infrastructure, which agreed to invest a minimum of $114 million on capital improvements to the 600-acre facility. The sale price for the terminal was not disclosed. \u001d  \"As we understand it, the same people are going to be operating the terminal, which is important to us\" because of their experience and prior security clearance, Sigmund said. \u001d  Maher Terminals did not immediately return messages seeking comment Friday. \u001d  The Port Authority operates three terminals in New Jersey, in Newark and Elizabeth, as well as two in New York. The New York terminals are on Staten Island and in Brooklyn. \u001d  One of the prior deals involved the Port Newark Container Terminal, one of six terminals caught up in a furor last year when the Bush administration approved United Arab Emirates-based Dubai Ports World's purchase of terminals at major ports from a British company. \u001d  In February, the Port Authority reached an agreement to allow American International Group's (AIG) AIG Global Investments Group to acquire an interest in the Port Newark Container Terminal from Dubai Ports World, which also sold its five other U.S. terminals to AIG. \u001d  In May, the Port Authority wrapped up a deal for the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan to buy the Howland Hook Marine Terminal, on Staten Island, from Orient Oversees International Ltd.

Counterfeiting has traditionally been a problem that companies faced in Asian markets, and counterfeiters tended to set their sights on luxury products like designer handbags. But fake versions of everyday consumable products - ranging from toothpaste to cigarettes - have now begun to make their way to developed and other markets around the world. \u001d  A June report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that the global rise in counterfeiting has been accompanied by a notable divergence from high-value luxury items to common products that affect personal health and safety. Counterfeiters have begun targeting products like food and drink, medical equipment, personal-care items, toys, tobacco and automotive parts, the OECD found. \u001d  Government and anti-counterfeiting organizations estimate that counterfeit goods overall cost U.S. companies between $200 billion to $250 billion in revenue per year. Counterfeiting and piracy globally result in lost sales of $500 billion to $600 billion a year, which is about 5% to 7% of global trade, says Katie Wilson, a spokeswoman at the global anti-counterfeiting and piracy initiative of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u001d  Counterfeit products also cost governments lost revenue in taxes. And there are other fallouts. Consumers are often willing to buy a fake Louis Vuitton handbag if it saves them a few hundred dollars, but counterfeit goods that are consumed in some form can be far more dangerous - they can potentially harm both consumers and product brands. \u001d  \"Counterfeiting is no longer an issue about fake watches and handbags,\" says Bill Dobson, a spokesman for Bascap, or Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy, an organization started by the International Chamber of Commerce. \"This is now a problem on a global scale that is posing health and safety issues.\" \u001d  In recent weeks, one case highlighted the problem of counterfeiting in the U.S: Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) said in mid-June that counterfeit toothpaste falsely packaged as \"Colgate\" and possibly containing harmful ingredients was found in several discount stores in four U.S. states. \u001d  When consumer products that could have harmful side effects are counterfeited, consumers may become reluctant to buy the product, said Alan Siegel, chairman of strategic branding firm Siegel + Gale. \"It's a commodity market, there are 15 alternatives you can buy,\" he said. \u001d  The sheer scale of the problem has forced companies that are often competitors to cooperate to form international organizations to fight the problem and even hire experts to advise them. \u001d  Bascap's Dobson, a former Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) executive, was involved in P&G's anti-counterfeiting efforts in Asia in the 1990s. Dobson has worked on several anti-counterfeiting initiatives and says that over the last five years he has been seeing companies face a much bigger problem with counterfeit products being exported from Asia to other parts of the globe. \u001d  In its recent report, the OECD found that Asia is the largest source of counterfeit and pirated products, and China the single-largest source. \u001d  The tobacco industry is one that counterfeiters have found particularly profitable. Cigarettes tend to be highly taxed in many countries, and counterfeiters like selling fake cigarettes since they can walk away with higher margins as they don't pay taxes on the products they sell. Counterfeit cigarettes could contain lower-grade tobacco, or other cheap products, that would not be used in legitimate manufacturing. \u001d  Altria Group Inc. (MO) - whose Philip Morris unit sells the world's largest-selling cigarette brand Marlboro - has said in regulatory filings that it cannot quantify the amount of revenue it loses due to counterfeit cigarettes sold in international markets. \u001d  \"Over the last four to five years, you've seen a shift in manufacturing (of counterfeit cigarettes) closer to the intended markets,\" said Greg Prager, director of external communications at Philip Morris International. China continues to be the major source of counterfeit cigarettes, but in recent years European Union law-enforcement authorities have raided counterfeit operations in countries ranging from Latvia to Germany, he said. \u001d  Altria also has an in-house brand-integrity department that works with law-enforcement agencies, governments and customs. The company also hires external investigators who take any information they find on potential counterfeit operations to the law-enforcement agencies. (Philip Morris says that all its external investigators have to follow certain policies in the way they operate and must follow the law.) \u001d  Bascap's Dobson says that international crime organizations have been developing better distribution systems that allow them to ship fake products. Free-trade zones - areas where bureaucracy is lowered in order to encourage international trade - are playing an increasingly important role in the distribution systems of counterfeiters. Countries like Paraguay and Dubai that allow easy trade are becoming hubs for the distribution of counterfeit goods, Dobson said. \u001d  Mafias in Europe and the Americas, as well as Asian crime groups that are involved in heroin trafficking, gambling, extortion and human trafficking have been linked to counterfeiting, the OECD found. Counterfeiting can sometimes be more profitable than illegal drug trades, particularly because it can carry much lighter penalties. \u001d  \"It's an easy crime with a low risk,\" said Wilson of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u001d  Counterfeit products in general tend to be sold in discount stores, flea markets or on the Internet.

LeDoux, his wife, their family partnership and related children's trust. \b \b \u001d  SAN MARCOS, Calif, July 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Natural Alternatives International, Inc. (\"NAI\") (Nasdaq: NAII), a leading formulator, manufacturer and marketer of customized nutritional supplements, today announced the retirement of John A. Wise, Ph.D., 67, as Chief Scientific Officer effective June 30, 2007, and that Dr. Wise has agreed to continue with NAI as a consultant through December 31, 2009. \b \u001d  Dr. Wise stated, \"It has been personally rewarding and gratifying to participate in and contribute to the significant growth and success of NAI over the past 20 years.  NAI has been an industry leader in applying evidence-based science to establish the efficacy of our products for improving health.  Our science-based formulas have been widely distributed throughout the world, resulting in high consumer acceptance and positively affecting many peoples' lives.  I am proud to have been part of this and I look forward to my continuing relationship and contribution to NAI during this transition in my career.\" \b \u001d  CEO Mark Le Doux added, \"Dr. Wise has demonstrated true leadership in the area of nutritional science.  His advocacy for research, design and development of effective dietary supplements exemplifies his dedication to excellence.  Dr. Wise's long tenure at NAI has been the hallmark of our commitment to quality science underlying our nutritional supplements. We wish Dr. Wise well in this new phase of his career and are pleased he has agreed to continue working with NAI and help us continue that commitment.\" \b \u001d  NAI also announced it has agreed to repurchase 100,000 shares of its common stock held by its Chairman and CEO, Mark LeDoux, his wife, their family partnership and related children's trust (together, the \"LeDouxs\").  The purchase of the shares was approved by the independent members of NAI's board of directors at their meeting on June 29, 2007, provided NAI was able to purchase the shares at a 10% discount from the closing price on such date. The sale of the shares by the LeDouxs has been undertaken for estate tax reasons related to the death of Mr. LeDoux's mother, a co-founder of NAI.  Given the relatively thin trading market for NAI's stock, the board determined the repurchase of the shares from the LeDouxs was in the best interest of NAI and its stockholders, particularly in view of the discounted price and the potential negative impact of  repeated periodic sales on the open market.  The shares to be repurchased represent a relatively small percentage of the overall shares beneficially owned by Mr. LeDoux and, following the sale, he will continue to own approximately 18% of NAI's outstanding shares. \b \u001d  NAI, headquartered in San Marcos, California, is a leading formulator, manufacturer and marketer of nutritional supplements and provides strategic partnering services to its customers.  Our comprehensive partnership approach offers a wide range of innovative nutritional products and services to our clients including: scientific research, clinical studies, proprietary ingredients, customer-specific nutritional product formulation, product testing and evaluation, marketing management and support, packaging and delivery system design, regulatory review and international product registration assistance.

With smart, DaimlerChrysler is the only car manufacturer to support the \"Save Our Selves -- SOS\" initiative launched by Kevin Wall and Al Gore and is the official partner of all eight concerts. smart is accompanying the climate protection initiative with a range of activities and is providing the official shuttle service for the concerts. \b \u001d  \"We care\" -- this is the motto the automobile manufacturer is using in its support for the climate protection initiative. \"In environmental protection what matters most is what people do as individuals. It's about making conscious decisions and asking questions about specific matters. Initiating this movement is the fundamental idea of the smart brand. smart came about because we asked ourselves what the car of the future should look like -- how much space it can take up in our cities and how fast it should be able to drive, what kind of stress can it place on the environment. For this reason it is simply consistent that we are committing ourselves to an event such as Live Earth,\" said Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of DaimlerChrysler AG and head of the Mercedes Car Group. \b \b    Environmentally-friendly shuttle service \b \u001d  DaimlerChrysler is operating the official shuttle service for the artists and celebrity guests -- with the most environmentally friendly fleet which sets new benchmarks for CO2 emissions worldwide. At the concert in Hamburg, Germany, for example, smart fortwo cdi (diesel) and Mercedes-Benz E 320 BLUETEC vehicles will be used to bring the artists to their performances and back to their hotels in an environmental friendly manner. \b \u001d  At only 88 grams per kilometer, the smart fortwo cdi has the world's lowest CO2 emissions -- and is thus the CO2-World-champion. It is the only car produced in a large series which actually has fuel consumption of only three liters for 100 kilometers. The Mercedes-Benz E 320 BLUETEC is the world's cleanest diesel vehicle in the premium segment which was launched in the U.S. in October 2006. BLUETEC provides innovative modular emission technology which DaimlerChrysler has taken to production level, reducing the emissions of diesel drives down to the level of gasoline engines. \b \b    Global advertising campaign and special smart website \b \u001d  Since the end of June, smart's climate protection commitment has been accompanied by an international advertising campaign in TV and print media and a special, interactive website in seven languages. The objective of this measure is to create a new sense of awareness. \"We want to encourage thinking about one's own mobility behavior and to act more responsibly,\" explained Anders Jensen, Vice President for Marketing & Sales at smart. Thus the TV spots and print advertisements raise fundamental issues -- for example: Is size the measure of all things? Are 200 HP really necessary for a driver? Why use two liters of petrol to get a liter of milk? On the interactive website it is possible to publish one's own answers to these questions. In addition, the website offers extensive information on the Live Earth concerts, on the issue of \"Ecological driving\" and on the smart brand. The micro site address is www.smart.com/liveearth. \b \b    The concerts -- the launch of a global movement \b \u001d  Live Earth is a project of the \"Save Our Selves -- SOS\" initiative of Kevin Wall, who has already organized Live Aid concerts, and the former American Vice President, Al Gore. The objective is to start a global movement by mobilizing more than two billion people in the battle against climate change. The group event is the starting point for a campaign over many years headed by the Alliance for Climate Protection and other non-governmental organizations. \b \u001d  All eight Live Earth concerts will be broadcast via television, radio and internet in more than 120 countries. The only concert in the U.S. starts at 2:30 pm at New York's Giants Stadium. The following artists are to perform: AFI, Akon, Alicia Keys, Bon Jovi, Dave Matthews Band, Fall Out Boy, John Mayer, Kanye West, Kelly Clarkson, KT Tunstall, Ludacris, Melissa Etheridge, Roger Waters, Smashing Pumpkins and The Police. \b \b    smart comes to the USA in 2008 \b \u001d  Since its introduction in October 1998, nearly 800,000 people in 36 countries have made the smart fortwo the \"in\" car for fuel-efficient urban transportation. As a DaimlerChrysler brand, smart benefits from the parent company's engineering expertise and many years of experience in the automotive industry. The new smart fortwo was released in Europe in April 2007 and will become available in the U.S. for the first time in the first quarter of 2008. smart -- as one of the industry's youngest brands -- stands for innovation, functionality and lust for life. Drivers of smart vehicles can be categorized more in terms of their attitudes than their age, profession or gender. \b \u001d  On July 7th, pictures of the concerts and shuttle services will be continuously uploaded to our media site www.media.daimlerchrysler.com for you to download. \b \bSOURCE  DaimlerChrysler \b \u001d    /CONTACT: Jessica Gamarra of smart USA, +1-248-648-2445, jgamarra@smartusa.com; or Julia Engelhardt, DaimlerChrysler Corporate Communications, julia.engelhardt@daimlerchrysler.com, +1-212-909-9062 \b    /Web site: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com \b    /Web site: http://www.smart.com/liveearth \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:00 ET (13:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"959be6c3ab592b787e3ff82c672d0992","symR":["GSIEF"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Consultants Seek to Join the Growth and Remuneration Available Through the GSI & MediCredit Joint Venture Business Model","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GSIEF"],"IndustryCodes":["POL","SVC"],"Story":"\b \u001d  PRINCETON, N.J., July 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- MediCredit has announced to GSI (OTC: GSIEF) that it is in the process of securing a Representative Agreement with a healthcare consultant to bring interested medical groups or individuals to GSI for funding healthcare patient accounts receivables from third-party insurance rated payors, expanding the sale, marketing and servicing arm for the joint venture group. \b \u001d  Gunther Slaton, President of GSI states, \"This expansion of the MediCredit business into the New England region is a bonus for the growth of \"highly profitable\" business for GSI and MediCredit bottom line.

(Nasdaq: USEG) is pleased to provide the following update on its \"Lucky Jack\" molybdenum project located in west central Colorado. \b \b    Background \b \u001d  The Lucky Jack (formerly known as Mt. Emmons) molybdenum project was originally discovered by AMAX Inc. in the 1970s on mineral claims held by U.S. Energy Corp. and Crested Corp. (\"USECC\").  The mineral claims were subsequently sold to AMAX, which reportedly spent in excess of $150 million delineating and planning for the production of a \"world-class\" molybdenum deposit.  In 1980, AMAX was granted a permit for a 20,000 ton per day (tpd) block cave mining operation.  They did not sign the permit due to depressed molybdenum prices.  Historical records filed with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the 1990s for the application of patented mineral claims identify resources of some 220 million tons of having a grade of 0.366% MoS2. A high grade section of the mineralization containing some 22.5 million tons at a grade of 0.701% MoS2 was also reported. \b \u001d  In 2002, water rights for the property were granted, and in 2004 additional patents were granted by the BLM.  In 2006, the property was contractually returned to USECC by Phelps Dodge Corporation, the successor to AMAX.  In 2007, USECC and Kobex Resources, Ltd. (TSX Venture Exchange: \"KBX.V\") entered into an agreement whereby Kobex has a right to earn up to a 65% interest in the project and reduce USECC's gross royalty to 2%, if certain terms and conditions are met (see April 3, 2007 8-K filing). \b \b    Project Status \b \u001d  Currently, USECC and Kobex (\"the companies\") are evaluating historical data and engineering studies ranging from a 6,000 tpd to a 20,000 tpd operation for drafting a Plan of Operations (POO) to be submitted to the U.S. Forest Service in the fourth quarter of 2007.  The companies have retained consultants to prepare hydrological, geotechnical, electrical, transportation and socioeconomic studies.  Additionally, several upgrades have been made at the water treatment plant and more are planned to optimize operations. \b \u001d  The companies initiated a community relations program with the hiring of Clyde Gillespie in October 2006.  Mr. Gillespie is a former Kinross Gold employee who moved to Gunnison, Colorado after spearheading the effort to obtain a permit for the Buckhorn Gold Project in north-central Washington State.  While with Kinross, Clyde also permitted mines in Alaska and Nevada. Once the POO has been filed, the companies plan to work with the local communities concerning mine plan options. \b \u001d  In addition, a comprehensive underground rehabilitation program will be started to enhance the existing underground mine workings.  The program is scheduled to begin later this month and should be completed in nine to ten months.  This work will pave the way for drilling crews to enter existing drill stations in the high-grade section of the mine for the commencement of a close-spaced drilling program to further delineate the deposit.  Diamond drill results will facilitate further resource analyses and a full feasibility study to be initiated in early 2008. \b \u001d  In addition to Mr. Gillespie and numerous consultants now working on the project, Kobex has hired project management, engineering, geology, resource and administrative personnel that are collectively assigned to the project at Kobex's corporate offices in Vancouver, British Columbia, and at field offices in both Gunnison and at the Lucky Jack Project site near Crested Butte, Colorado.  The USECC joint venture (between U. S. Energy and its majority- owned subsidiary Crested Corp.) contributes management and accounting resources from its Riverton, Wyoming headquarters. \b \u001d  Last week Kobex management approved a $14 million (May 1, 2007 through April 30, 2008) budget for the project.  To date (since December 2006), approximately $5 million in expenditures have been authorized for work presently underway.  Kobex is contractually required to spend only $4.2 million this year but any amounts spent in excess of $4.2 million will be credited towards future years' expenditure commitments. \b \u001d  The companies will further evaluate the geological model of the mine, the mine production schedule, the tailings and plant design, infrastructure and manpower requirements.  The full feasibility study should be completed by 2010, and an Environmental Impact Statement decision should also be issued during that year.  If these timelines are met, the companies expect construction of the mine to begin in 2011, with first production anticipated in 2013. \b \b \b \b \b    The Market \b \b \b \u001d  The market for molybdenum remains robust.  Since 2005, annual global demand has risen from 380 million pounds (lbs.) to an estimated 426 million lbs. in 2007, with demand projected to reach 461 million lbs. by 2009.  With demand being fueled by economic and industrial growth in China, India, the U.S. and the global energy sector, some economists forecast growth at a 4.5% compound annual growth rate for the foreseeable future.  If such forecasts prove realistic, worldwide demand for molybdenum could reach or exceed 700 million pounds annually by 2020.  Today molybdic oxide (Mo) is trading in the $33-35/lb. range in a tight supply/demand market environment. \b \b    Kobex Funding \b \u001d  On May 11, 2007, Kobex announced the completion of an approximate $25 million equity financing, with the proceeds of the capital raise dedicated to the Lucky Jack project.  On May 23, 2007, Kobex paid the first $750,000 option payments with shares of Kobex common stock. For more information please see the Form 8-K filed on June 4, 2007 \b \u001d  \"We are very pleased with the progress that has been made since signing our Letter Agreement on October 10, 2006 with Kobex,\" stated Mark J. Larsen, President and Chief Operating Officer of U.S. Energy Corp.  \"Kobex's experienced management team has recognized the 'world-class' nature of this molybdenum deposit and has immediately set out to advance the project towards further resource delineation in an effort to commence a full feasibility study as soon as possible.  They are putting their recently raised capital to work in an accelerated fashion and we couldn't be more delighted with their efforts and management team.  The market for molybdenum is projected to remain robust, and I firmly believe that Lucky Jack is a mine whose time has come.  With technological advances, sound planning and strong management, I am very confident that our collective efforts will allow Lucky Jack to become the world's next major primary molybdenum mine.\" \b \u001d  \"As the Lucky Jack project moves forward, we will continue to engage the local communities in the permitting process with the goal of making this project a win/win situation for all stakeholders to the maximum extent possible,\"  stated Keith Larsen, Chairman of U. S. Energy Corp.  \"Kobex and USECC are fully committed to minimizing environmental impacts and to also work with the public at large about the significant economic benefits that will be realized when the mine is brought into production.\" \b \b \b \b                  ABOUT U.S. ENERGY CORP.

They are not criminal charges,\" the bank said in an emailed statement. Bank of America also said it believes that \"the evidence will show that the charges against the bank are completely unfounded\" noting it believed it had in place all appropriate governance policies and procedures. \u001d  Bank of America said in the statement that \"it had no knowledge of the fraud perpetrated by Parmalat and its senior management.\" \u001d  In June, the same Milan court ordered four other international banks - Citigroup Inc. (C), UBS AG (UBS), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK.XE) and Morgan Stanley (MS) - to face trial. \u001d  The trial is scheduled to start Jan. 23 in Milan, in one of several legal cases tied to Parmalat's collapse. \u001d  If convicted in this case, the banks may incurr administrative fines. Bank of America lawyers said the bank could face a fine up to a maximum of EUR5 million. \u001d  A conviction would also allow more than 40,000 bondholders, who have joined the Milan case as civil parties, to seek millions of dollars in damages on top of the provisions for restitution contained in the charge against the banks themselves. \u001d  Parmalat shares resumed trading on the Italian stock exchange in October 2005. At 1420 GMT, Parmalat shares were down EUR0.01, or 0.5%, at EUR2.95 unchanged at EUR2.97, in an overall positive market. \u001d  -By Alessandro Mocenni with MF-Dow Jones and Sabrina Cohen, Dow Jones Newswires; +39 02 5821 9906; sabrina.cohen@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:27 ET (14:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"96dc24b3e718311f2544a1bab232a9a2","symR":["KYN"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9907568],"ret5":[1.005777],"Headline":"Chmn MCCARTHY Buys 3,000 Of KAYNE ANDERSON MLP INVESTMENT CO >KYN","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KYN"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: KAYNE ANDERSON MLP INVESTMENT CO \bSYMBOL: KYN \b \bFILER: MCCARTHY KEVIN S \bTITLE: Chairman of the Board \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Purchase                 3,000      $34.00         $102,000 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 28,000 (Direct)  5,000 (Indirect) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

Grace & Co. (GRA) to speed up its bankruptcy restructuring. \u001d  The Columbia, Md., producer of specialty chemicals filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2001, inundated with lawsuits over asbestos products it once made. \u001d  Grace has asked a court to push back the deadline for it to file a Chapter 11 plan until 90 days after proceedings to estimate its asbestos liabilities are wrapped up. \u001d  Those proceedings won't begin until January 2008. \u001d  The asbestos-damage figure will be a key one for Grace's reorganization plan, since it must set aside enough cash or equity to cover asbestos claims before it can get out of bankruptcy. \u001d  Asbestos creditors said Friday that coming up with the asbestos-damage estimate could take until 2010, and they don't want to wait that long. \u001d  Chapter 11 has been tougher on asbestos claimants than it has been on the company, lawyers said in papers Friday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. \u001d  Grace \"has prospered as a result of these bankruptcy cases. They have bought and sold business components, granted rich compensation and benefit packages to all levels of those in their employ,\" the asbestos lawyers said. \u001d  The company has accumulated so much cash while in bankruptcy that it hasn't even needed to tap debtor-in-possession financing, according to the asbestos creditors. \u001d  Grace has aligned itself with shareholders and financial creditors, and insists a true estimate of asbestos damages will leave value in the hands of shareholders. \u001d  In asking for more time to come up with a Chapter 11 plan, Grace said it has worked hard to come up with a reasonable resolution to its asbestos troubles. \u001d  Asbestos lawyers disagree. They say there are no talks ongoing between the company and its asbestos creditors. They accuse Grace of being \"eager to delay,\" and say the company has no incentive to enter into any negotiation. \u001d  Lawyers for the asbestos camp are asking for hearings in the fall to test whether the Chapter 11 plan Grace now has on file can be confirmed. \u001d  They say the Chapter 11 plan has fatal legal flaws, and should not be used to block others with rival reorganization strategies from coming forward. \u001d  They are also asking that Chapter 11 confirmation hearings be slated to begin as soon as asbestos-estimation proceedings end, to head off years of potential delay. \b \u001d  -By Peg Brickley, Dow Jones Newswires; 302-521-2266; peg.brickley@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:30 ET (17:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9795024f8bec9a849cf24356092c4e63","symR":["PSD.AU","PSDV","AU000000PSD7"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,0.96,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,0.904,-0.00099],"Headline":"PSivida Gets $10.7M Net Proceeds From First Tranche Of Offer","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PSD.AU","PSDV","AU000000PSD7"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:51 ET (12:51 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"97b85229e1ce5a58f02126b800daa445","symR":["WEN"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Wendy's International, Inc.

At El Penon, for the second consecutive quarter, production exceeded the Company's internal budgets. For the quarter production was 13% better than forecasted and year-to-date, production was 14% greater than forecasted. During the second quarter, the mine experienced its highest quarterly silver production since the commissioning of El Penon, reaching a record amount of 2.1 million ounces. During the second quarter, the Rossi/Storm mine poured its first gold, recorded approximately 8,200 ounces of gold (100% basis), and is on track to commence full production during the third quarter as planned. Minera Florida continued production on budget, producing 16,700 ounces of gold, 118,200 ounces of silver and 870 tonnes of zinc. \b \u001d  In addition to the strong production results, further operational developments at El Penon were made during the second quarter. The mine received two key environmental permits for the planned expansion projects, including the authorization to increase mill processing up to 3,500 tonnes per day, and the authorization for full mining production at Fortuna. Also, during the month of June, 5,000 tonnes of ore were mined from the Fortuna vein. The processing plant operated at a record 2,845 tonnes per day, and the underground mine produced at a record 2,588 tonnes of ore per day. At the Amancaya deposit, which is located 120 kilometers south of the core El Penon area, the Company initiated a pre-feasibility study in order to evaluate the economical extraction methods for this deposit. Finally at El Penon, the exploration team drilled 13 holes into a potential vein system, Esmarelda. \b \u001d  At Minera Florida, the expansion is on track, the environmental permits were submitted to the governmental agencies during the second quarter, and the new grinding mill and flotation cells were ordered and are expected to arrive on site in October. \b \u001d  At Jeronimo, metallurgical testing commenced in full force in order to advance this project on a faster than planned schedule. Management is expecting to have indication results available for release during the third quarter. \b \u001d  Edgar Smith, Meridian's Vice President of Operations, commented, \"I am pleased to report that during the second quarter, the teams in Chile continued to make progress with the operational excellence initiatives at both El Penon and Minera Florida. It is extremely satisfying to see the initiatives underway and new production records being met. I am pleased with the progress on the expansion plans and am looking forward to an active remainder of the year.\" \b \u001d  During the second quarter, the Company also entered into a fully underwritten Revolving Credit Facility with UniCredit Group for US 300,000,000. The facility term is set for 5 years and carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus an interest margin ranging from 120 basis points up to a maximum of 170 basis points. The facility will be used for general corporate purposes and additional liquidity as the Company continues to grow annual production to one million ounces per annum. \b \u001d  \"The second quarter was another quarter of operational success, as we continued our efforts towards operational efficiency and expansion at the operating mines. I am particularly pleased with the results from El Penon,\" commented Ed Dowling, Meridian's President and CEO. \"We continue to work diligently towards creating the Premier Value Gold Company.\" \b \b   Second Quarter Conference Call \b \u001d  Meridian Gold is hosting a simultaneous live webcast of its conference call on Wednesday, July 25, 2007, at 9:00 a.m. EDT through Thomson/CCBN.

This PIK noteis the most expensive in the market, yielding 16%, one of the people said. \u001d  The person said the sponsors are hoping to move quickly on any recapitalization or refinancing, but there is \"still a lot of work to be done before any deal can be done,\" they said. \u001d  Permira and Apax Partners have already received a dividend from a recapitalization of New Look. The company sold a GBP359 million paid-in-kind loan last May to finance a dividend payment for its owners and management. Management underwrote GBP20 million of the loan. \u001d  A further dividend recapitalization, which involves refinancing the company and increasing the portion of debt to equity in the asset, would enable the private-equity firms to take more equity off the table even if they can't exit the investment completely. \u001d  Permira and Apax Partners have been forced to rethink their options for the business after an extended auction failed to produce any formal offers. \u001d  The company received just two verbal indications from bidders in the closing stages of the sale and neither came close to the GBP1.8 billion price-tag, other people close to the situation have told Dow Jones Newswires previously. \u001d  New Look hired Merrill Lynch (MER) to run the auction, but early indications of interest stalled because of the original GBP2 billion price-tag sought by its private-equity owners. \u001d  Final bids were originally due at the beginning of last month, but the few which were received were nearer the GBP1.7 billion mark, people close to the situation said earlier this week. \u001d  A spokesman for Permira declined to comment and a spokesman for Apax had no immediate comment. \b \u001d  -By Kate Haywood and Anousha Sakoui, Dow Jones Newswires, +44 (0) 7842 9315, kathryn.haywood@dowjones.com \u001d  (Marietta Cauchi in London contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:52 ET (16:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"98e612c7aade25327b28a89ddcb71640","symR":["BAC","US0605051046"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9930824,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.013225,-0.00099],"Headline":"Bank Of America (BAC) Block: 331,100 Shrs At 49.15","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BAC","US0605051046"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bBANK OF AMERICA CORP \bLast trade NYSE: -0.22 at 49.15 on zero tick \bTrade vol:       331,100 =    2.3% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   1,890,900 =   12.9% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:   3,462,820 =   21.3% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:      14,647,100 =   90.2% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:16,242,146 / Prev day -0.18 on 12,644,512 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:01 ET (20:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"992bcfa2f1997ee0cbcf9f8adf5d9058","symR":["MXC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.033962],"ret5":[1],"Headline":"Mexco Energy March 31 Proved Reserves 220,000 Barrels Of Oil","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MXC"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:29 ET (16:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9979b02aae05fdf1683e31dc245b5110","symR":["DCN","DCNAQ","US2358111068","DCN","DCNAQ","US2358111068"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Dana Corp.

The IFC said the total project cost is estimated at $115 million. \u001d  \"Alterra will sell its stake in LAP to Fraport,\" S&P said. \"In turn, Fraport will sell 39.99% to the International Finance Corp., the Fondo de Inversion en Infraestructura, or Fondo, and possibly to other persons or entities, S&P said. \u001d  After the transaction, Fraport will own 60.01% of LAP, IFC 19.99%, Fondo 10%, and other persons or entities the remaining 10%, it said. \b \u001d  -By Matthew Cowley, Dow Jones Newswires; 201 938 5692; matthew.cowley@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:57 ET (19:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9a98f73206b9691b2c55a744225bdb60","symR":["MDT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9964386],"ret5":[0.9773196],"Headline":"Medtronic Inc (MDT) Block: 216,500 Shrs At 53.34","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MDT"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bMEDTRONIC INC. \bLast trade NYSE: +0.43 at 53.34 on zero tick \bTrade vol:       216,500 =    5.1% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:     627,200 =   14.6% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:   1,787,648 =   27.7% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:       4,285,308 =   66.4% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol: 6,453,990 / Prev day +0.08 on 4,193,826 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:01 ET (20:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9abc86d23cf2a7dd78a3cc8d91a7a2cf","symR":["3112.FR","AKH","FR0000031122"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Air France-KLM Offers Good Entry Point - Kepler","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["3112.FR","AKH","FR0000031122"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  1130 GMT [Dow Jones] Air France-KLM's (3112.FR) recent share price decline offers an attractive entry point, as the company announced good June passenger traffic figures, says Kepler.

Also named in the suit were Illinois-based logistics firm Supply Chain Resources Inc. and its president, Joseph Sorrentino. \u001d  According to the suit, Sorrentino directed the warehouses and shippers not to release or deliver Ronco's products until the company paid its pre-bankruptcy bills. Ronco said it owes the warehouses $250,000. \u001d  Ronco wants a bankruptcy judge to force the warehouses and Sorrentino to immediately hand over the inventory. The company is also seeking damages for lost business plus punitive damages against Sorrentino and the storage companies for violating the so-called automatic stay provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. \u001d  Under bankruptcy law, the automatic stay effectively shields companies operating under Chapter 11 protection from actions by creditors such as withholding goods because of nonpayment. \u001d  A hearing date hasn't been scheduled to consider Ronco's request. Sorrentino couldn't be reached to comment. \u001d  Ronco, which filed for Chapter 11 last month, wants to sell its business and is looking for a quick sale. \u001d  Private-equity firm Marlin Equity Partners LLC has tentatively agreed to buy Ronco's assets at a bankruptcy auction for $10 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. \u001d  Judge Geraldine Mund of Woodland Hills bankruptcy court has scheduled a hearing for Monday to set the ground rules for the auction of Ronco's  assets. \u001d  Ronco filed for bankruptcy protection on June 14, listing $13.9 million in assets and $32.7 million in debt. \u001d  Ronco, marketer of the Veg-O-Matic and the Pocket Fisherman, is also battling with former chief executive Richard F. Allen, who has alleged that a Houston investment bank didn't properly look into the company's dire financial situation before lining up a group of investors in 2005 to buy Ronco from founder Ron Popeil. \u001d  Popeil, the pitchman who appeared in many of the company's ubiquitous TV infomercials, sold the company he founded in 1958 for about $56 million two years ago. \b \u001d  -Patrick Fitzgerald, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-3544; patrick.fitzgerald@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:20 ET (17:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9b539a5e2e85051c395a699f7da6adc9","symR":["IRC.T","ROY","CA4602771061"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Intl Royalty Raised To Strong Buy From Outperf: R James>IRC.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IRC.T","ROY","CA4602771061"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:40 ET (11:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9be846abd2844ea355fc87b29e9d2ce1","symR":["DD","US2635341090"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"DuPont (DD) Mkt On Close Sell Imbalance: Shrs 54000","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DD","US2635341090"],"IndustryCodes":["CHC","CHM","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:40 ET (19:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9c731fb84c5da78bf38ce93e0500f338","symR":["LSI"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9847522],"ret5":[1.048285],"Headline":": LSI Hosts July 31 Analyst Meeting","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LSI"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MILPITAS, Calif., July 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI) will host a half day meeting for analysts from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. EDT, Tuesday, July 31 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City.

Traders seemed to be expecting the June jobs report to be strong, negating some of the impact. Nearby Dec contract prices in only about a 16% chance for the FOMC to reduce the funds rate 25 BP to 5% in the 4Q, down from about 20% as priced in at yesterday's close.

Kevin Reilly, recently canned amid a ratings slump at NBC, may jump to #1 network Fox, according to trade publication Variety. Reilly is expected to head programming at the News Corp. network, the ratings king thanks largely to \"American Idol.\" Current Fox programming exec Peter Liguori is expected to be bumped to a \"broader role overseeing the network,\" said Variety, which cautioned that negotiations are in early stages.

CEO Perry Sook may collect twice his salary and bonus if his job is axed in a takeover, according to an SEC filing today. In a twist on the \"change in control\" payment, COO Duane Lammers is due a bonus tied to the buyout price. If NXST is sold, he is guaranteed $100,000 \"to encourage the continued provision\" of his services. The higher a sale price, the higher Lammers' bonus will go, with a maximum $400,000 extra if NXST shares are above $26 on the the day of a completed deal. NXST up 0.9% to $15.07. (SO) \u001d  2:58 (Dow Jones) What do the imploded Amaranth Advisors and a troubled Bear Stearns hedge fund have in common? Both have been big disappointments to the same Swedish pensioners, AP Fonden 7, MarketBeat reports. The Swedish state pension fund - with about nine billion euros in assets ($12.25 billion) - has been an investor in both the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund and Amaranth. It lost about 1.8M euros on the Bear Stearns investment, but the fund isn't soured on hedge funds in general. It continues to hold investments in hedge funds, and many have done well, it says.

Stoll \b    OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  DETROIT (Dow Jones)--Auto supplier Dana Corp. (DCNAQ) has reached a settlement with its top two unions and received a planned investment commitment for up to $750 million from a group led by private equity firm Centerbridge Partners L.P., according to papers filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. \u001d  The moves are key hurdles in forming Dana's exit from Chapter 11. Dana is one of a number of auto-parts companies that have tumbled into bankruptcy proceedings amid production cutbacks by U.S. vehicle manufacturers. Dana began its Chapter 11 reorganization in March 2006. \u001d  The deal with the unions also lessens the possibility of a strike that could disrupt production. \u001d  Toledo, Ohio,-based Dana sought to cut wages and benefits and filed a motion with the court to cancel its labor contracts, a move the United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers unions said would lead to a strike if granted. \u001d  The unions collectively represent about 8,000 Dana workers - more than half of the company's hourly U.S. work force. \u001d  But the sides negotiated, with Centerbridge an active party, and reached a deal that allows Dana to cease providing non-pension retiree benefits, such as health care. \u001d  Instead, Dana will contribute up to $704 million plus $80 million in stock to trusts known as voluntary employer benefit associations, or VEBA, that would be established by the unions to manage those benefits. \u001d  Dana also plans a two-tier wage system in all union plants, according to the motion. \u001d  In return for concessions Dana is offering buyouts, clauses that maintain buyers of plants it sells take on union contracts, and is offering job opportunities for union plants. \u001d  Dana also agreed to reserve new shares of a reorganized company for a bonus to be paid to \"certain union employees\" after emerging from Chapter 11. \u001d  Dana said in the motion seeking approval of the agreement that the changes to the various union contracts, and the agreement to close two union plants, will save it more than $100 million a year. \u001d  The VEBA would allow Dana to remove a liability of about $1 billion from its balance sheet, according to the motion. \b \b   VEBA Could Be Trend \b \u001d  Dana's proposal for a VEBA for non-pension retiree benefit obligations follows a similar move made by Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) in 2006. Goodyear's deal was struck with the USW. \u001d  Dana's VEBA is significant because of the inclusion of the UAW, which begins contract negotiations with the Big Three Detroit auto makers. General Motors Corp., (GM) Ford Motor Co., (F) and DaimlerChrysler AG's (DCX) Chrysler Group are set to lobby to form much larger VEBAs that would be managed by the UAW, according to people at each of the auto makers. \u001d  While the VEBA monetizes Dana's health-care obligations and protects medical benefits for retirees, the move is considered risky for the union because it takes on management of the obligation. \u001d  The UAW is seen as far more averse to risk than some other unions, including the USW. The UAW, however, had years ago forged a similar VEBA deal for truck maker Navistar International Corp. (NAVZ) and now the ground could be more fertile for the U.S. auto makers in their quest to create a VEBA for more than $100 billion in UAW retiree health-care obligations. \u001d  But Dana's deal is unique because it was won under protection of U.S. bankruptcy court, where unions often have their backs against the wall because of the potential for labor contracts being thrown out. The UAW has considerable clout with the Big Three and a VEBA arrangement is anything but a done deal. \b \b   Centerbridge Played Key Role \b \u001d  Meanwhile, Centerbridge is proposing to lead an investment of between $500 million to $750 million in a re-organized Dana. Centerbridge has been working with Dana's unions. In bankruptcy reorganizations, private-equity firms sometimes align themselves with labor unions in a bid for control of a company. \u001d  Other investors could join the equity agreement. \u001d  Centerbridge has committed to purchase $300 million of 4% Series A convertible preferred stock and provide a firm commitment to purchase $200 million in 4% Series B-1 convertible preferred stock that is not purchased by a qualified creditor. \u001d  The emergence of Centerbridge as Dana's financial backer represents the latest salvo by deep-pocketed investors to control distressed auto companies. \u001d  Some firms have been combing the industry in hopes of taking advantage to massive revenue streams and the ability to shake out costs from North American operations via bankruptcy or other means. \u001d  Centerbridge's partnership with Dana, if successful, represents a victory for the New York firm after it had shown interest in other companies recently sold, including GM's Allison Transmission and Daimler's Chrysler unit. \u001d  Dana can terminate the agreement with Centerbridge if it receives a superior proposal. Centerbridge would be entitled to a breakup fee of up to $22.5 million and an expense reimbursement of $4 million, according to the motion. \u001d  Under the investment proposal, Centerbridge initially would nominate two members of a seven-member board, and choose an independent director. Two would be chosen by the creditors' committee, both of which would be independent. Another director would be chosen by the creditors' committee from a list prepared by Centerbridge and containing at least three independent candidates. The other member would be the chief executive officer. \u001d  To get the Centerbridge investment, Dana must file a reorganization plan and disclosure statement by Sept. 3 and get confirmation of the plan by Feb. 28, 2008. The investment also is subject to court approval of the new union deals. \b \u001d  -By Terry Kosdrosky of Dow Jones Newswires; 313-226-1251; terry.kosdrosky@dowjones.com, and \u001d  John D.

Oi management hasn't commented on the possibility of a change in the price. \u001d  Preferred shareholders have already rejected one restructuring proposal. Back in December, they said no to swapping their nonvoting shares for ordinary shares at a 2.63-to-1 ratio. \u001d  \"The controlling group has been trying to restructure for about a year.

Its ultra-compact square footprint and low power consumption makes the LIS244AL motion-sensing device ideally suited for battery-powered portable applications, such as mobile phones, portable multimedia players or remote controls. \b \u001d  The new accelerometer incorporates in a single package both a robust, dual-axis MEMS sensor and a CMOS interface chip that provides two simultaneous, real-time analog outputs: one for side-to-side (lateral) and one for forward-backward (longitudinal) directions. \b \u001d  The LIS244AL provides acceleration values at a very low noise level with minimized power consumption, which is especially critical in battery-operated portable systems.  The new accelerometer is housed in an inexpensive 4 x 4 x 1.5 mm3 plastic package to fit in a variety of space-constrained applications and its ultra-compact robust design provides shock survivability up to 10,000g. \b \u001d  ST's new accelerometer offers a full-scale output range of +/-2.0g. The built-in self-test facility allows the user to verify both the mechanical and electrical parts of the device. The accelerometer uses ST's ECOPACK(R) lead-free technology for RoHS-compliance (the EU's Restriction on Use of Hazardous Substances Directive). \b \u001d  The LIS244AL addresses a wide range of applications sensitive to package size and power consumption, including data-integrity protection; user interface; anti-theft system; remote device control; intelligent motion-based power management; sport and health monitoring devices. \b \u001d  ST's LIS244AL is now in volume production. Unit pricing is $2.3 for quantities of 10,000 pieces.

The division, which sells to restaurants and large institutions, last year posted revenues of about GBP270 million, the company said. \u001d  At 1018 GMT, AGA was the top riser in a broadly higher FTSE 250 market, with shares up 25.25 pence, or 6.6%, at 410.75 pence. \u001d  \"We have leading edge products, a good geographical spread and considerable momentum within our foodservice businesses,\" said Chief Executive William McGrath. \"As was the case with our Pipe Systems businesses in the run up to their disposal in 2001 we have now created pivotal market positions for these businesses and are again looking to unlock value for shareholders.\" \u001d  Should it divest its foodservice operations, AGA's business strategy would look much the same as it did after the sale of Pipe Systems for GBP800 million, McGrath said on a conference call. The group plans to continue expansion - as it did in 2001, leading to a firm that is nearly twice as large today - by refocusing on its core consumer brands, which include Aga, Rangemaster, and Marvel. \u001d  McGrath said that while plans for the foodservice sale have been in the works for several months, AGA has only recently begun searching for bidders. He said the group is \"ready to kick on\" with the process and doesn't want it to be \"too elongated,\" with a sale anticipated by the end of the current year. \u001d  Analysts clashed over how to interpret the potential divestment. \u001d  Following Friday's update, AGA house broker Dresdner Kleinwort upgraded the company to buy from add and boosted its target price to 450 pence from 400 pence. The firm said a sale of the foodservice business could be worth between 240 and 265 pence per share, with much of that being distributed to shareholders. \u001d  However, Credit Suisse maintained an underperform rating on AGA following the news, with a target price of 350 pence. It said the divestment talks \"should be well received by investors and should support the shares in the short-term,\" but added that the potential sale could hurt AGA in the long run. \u001d  The firm noted that foodservice operations is arguably AGA's strongest division with regards to long-term growth. \"We question the longer-term value of the consumer operations given its highest quality brand, Aga-Rayburn, accounts for only 20 per cent of its consumer operations and the demand outlook for consumer remains uncertain,\" it said.    In Friday's trading update, AGA also announced that it estimates first-half profit before tax for its continuing businesses of GBP22 million, up 10% from GBP20 million in the comparative period. The results strip out \"a small overall loss\" from Domain, the struggling home fashions business that AGA sold just over two weeks ago for GBP3.5 million. \u001d  Credit Suisse called the GBP22 million estimate \"disappointing,\" noting that it was about 5% below its consensus figures. \u001d  Numis Securities, however, said it was not revising its full year profit forecasts even though AGA's estimate fell short of the brokerage's first-half forecast of GBP24.8 million. \"Given that we are looking for PBT of GBP50.3M for the full year compared (to) consensus of GBP48M-53M, we believe this is more likely a result of timing issues rather than a downgrade to numbers,\" it said. \u001d  Numis maintained a buy rating on AGA and a target price of 470 pence for the shares. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.agafoodservice.com \b \u001d  -By Daniel Fromson, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9463; daniel.fromson@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 06:34 ET (10:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a00df15df5858ed52c1e43ab0d5b71ff","symR":["12027.FR","TOT","FR0000120271","12027.FR","TOT","FR0000120271"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,1.009727,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.009727,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.000356,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.000356,-0.00099],"Headline":"Total Gabon Renews Concession Agreement With Gabon","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T09:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12027.FR","TOT","FR0000120271"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 05:32 ET (09:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a07b155c54704776d360337b6fc575b7","symR":["INFS"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"InFocus To Pay Interim CFO Nearly $14,000 Every 2 Weeks >INFS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["INFS"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \b   DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  InFocus Corp.

June's tally was accompanied by an upward revision to 190,000 jobs for the month of May, from the originally reported total of 157,000 jobs. \u001d  However, Dong suggested that market illiquidity throughout the week from the lingering effects of holidays Monday in Canada and Wednesday in the U.S. may have contributed to exaggerated price movements over the last two sessions, posing the risk of a corrective bounce in yields next week if the Bank of Canada statement on Tuesday proves less hawkish or non-committal as to the bank's future course. \u001d  \"I wouldn't read too much into the price action this week,\" Dong said. \"What little trading there was just wasn't all that meaningful in terms of the low volumes.\" \b \u001d  -By Paul Evans; Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2022; paulr.evans@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:14 ET (19:14 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a12e131f5272ec95442d26bee2cea9f1","symR":["MOH"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.004786],"ret5":[1.009893],"Headline":"Chmn MOLINA Sells 9,000 Of MOLINA HEALTHCARE INC >MOH","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MOH"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: MOLINA HEALTHCARE INC \bSYMBOL: MOH \b \bFILER: MOLINA J MARIO \bTITLE: Chairman of the Board \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Sale                     9,000      $31.02         $279,174 \b(10b5-1 Plan Indicated)* \b \bOWNERSHIP: 352,542 (Direct)  302,700 (Indirect) \b \b  * - A 10b5-1 plan enables an insider to establish a program to make trans- \b      actions according to an advance plan.

(Bovespa: MMXM3) (TSX: XMM) (\"MMX\" or the \"Company), pursuant to Article 157 of Law 6,404/76 and CVM Instruction 358/02, hereby makes the following announcement: \b \u001d  The Company has entered into an agreement with the shareholders of AVG Mineracao S.A. (\"AVG\") to purchase 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of AVG. AVG owns (i) a producing mine, in the area known as Serra Azul, Minas Gerais, and additional mining rights and leases in the Serra Azul area (collectively the \"Serra Azul Mines\"), (iii) railroad transportation and port services agreements, and (iv) existing supply contracts related to the sale and export of iron ore. According to information supplied by AVG, the Serra Azul Mines produced approximately 1.6 million tons of iron ore in 2006 and approximately 1 million tons of iron ore in the first 5 months of 2007. Based on estimates made by the current management of AVG, annual throughput of the Serra Azul Mines may reach 2.5 million tons of iron ore products this calendar year. \b \u001d  Consummation of the purchase of AVG by MMX, which is expected to occur in 60 days, is conditional upon completion of satisfactory due diligence by MMX, the agreement of certain transaction documents and the conclusion of pre-closing steps. Upon closing of the transaction, MMX will pay as consideration for 100% of the shares of AVG a purchase price of US$224,000,000, payable in 5 installments, over a period of 4 years. Upon AVG concluding the environmental licensing of an additional mining right to which it has a purchase option, MMX will make an additional contingent payment of up to US$50,000,000 to AVG shareholders. AVG also owns further unexplored mining rights for iron ore in the Minas Gerais State. \b \u001d  Subject to satisfactory completion of the due diligence and a detailed mine plan, MMX intends to invest in upgrading the Serra Azul Mines, to ramp up current mine production to its fullest reasonable capacity. The Serra Azul Mines produces a product mix of lump ore, sinter feed and pellet feed, all of which would be complementary and synergistic with MMX products from the Integrated MMX Systems. MMX intends to provide logistics for the Serra Azul Mines production by means of AVG's existing logistics contracts and, potentially, in the future, through the Port of Acu, upon confirmation of logistics and economic feasibility studies that the MMX Minas-Rio subsidiaries intend to conduct. The Port of Acu is owned by MMX's subsidiary LLX Minas-Rio Logistica S.A., which may be connected to Brazil's public-service railroad grid by means of the construction of a 45km railroad spur. \b \u001d  According to the Share Purchase Agreement entered into among MMX, Centennial Asset Mining Fund LLC and Anglo American, dated May 14, 2007, MMX will offer its subsidiary MMX Minas-Rio Mineracao Ltda., the option to exercise the purchase of AVG, at cost, on its behalf. \b \u001d  According to Eike Batista, Chairman and CEO of MMX, \"upon completion, the acquisition of AVG will enable MMX to achieve significant short term production in the MMX Minas-Rio System. MMX intends to leverage its future logistics assets to increase margins of the current AVG business, which will also benefit from the economies of scale that MMX business plan for AVG is expected to enjoy.\" \b \b   For additional information please contact ri@mmx.com.br. \b \bRio de Janeiro, July 5, 2007 \bLuiz Rodolfo Landim Machado \bExecutive President and Investor Relations Officer \bMMX Mineracao e Metalicos S.A. \b \u001d  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This news release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" under applicable Canadian securities laws concerning the proposed acquisition transaction and the business, operations and financial performance and condition of MMX, and estimated production and mine life of the acquired mineral project. Except for statements of historical fact relating to MMX, certain information contained herein constitutes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are frequently characterized by words such as \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate\", \"estimate\" and other similar words, or statements that certain events or conditions \"may\" or \"will\" occur. Forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the date the statements are made, and are based on a number of assumptions and subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Assumptions upon which such forward-looking statements are based include MMX being successful in acquiring 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of AVG, any necessary third party, regulatory or governmental approvals for the acquisition transaction being obtained, all required environmental and other licenses being obtained and all other conditions to the completion of the acquisition transaction will be satisfied or waived. Many of these assumptions are based on factors and events that are not within the control of MMX and there is no assurance they will prove to be correct. Factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from results anticipated by such forward-looking statements include changes in market conditions, variations in ore grade or recovery rates, risks relating to international operations, fluctuating metal prices and currency exchange rates, changes in project parameters, the possibility of unanticipated costs and expenses, failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated, the failure to obtain necessary licenses or permitting, the acquired mineral project not being integrated successfully or such integration proving more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected, and other risks of the mining industry. Although MMX has attempted to identify the important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be anticipated, estimated or intended.

(AAPL) device, a handful are demanding a much faster Internet experience than what they now get from using AT&T's (T) wireless network. \u001d  As the complaints suggest, the iPhone has increased the focus on the wireless networks that connect mobile devices to the Internet, highlighting a painful truth: The U.S. remains behind other parts of the world in deploying and using third-generation mobile data technology. Only about 8% of U.S. subscribers use so-called 3G services, which costs more than basic cellular service but offers faster Internet connections. \u001d  Now, though, thanks to iPhone's popularity, the time may be right for attracting more 3G customers. The telecom companies are ready, for the most part, having spent billions in recent years to build up their 3G networks; the question recently has been if there was ever going to be a phone that could prime consumer interest in 3G services. With iPhone showing the potential of powerful mobile devices, the answer may be now. \u001d  \"Apple, with iPhone, may well succeed in pushing the envelope further down the mobile Internet road and change the way we consume mobile data,\" said Shiv Bakhshi, an IDC analyst who has written extensively about high-speed cell phones and networks. \u001d  \"A culture of mobile data consumption in the U.S. is only beginning to set in.\" \u001d  With only 8% penetration, enormous 3G growth is possible. As a result, U.S. cell phone operators have made a big bet on the technology. In 2005 and 2006, major wireless operators spent more than $16 billion building up 3G networks. AT&T's is now into 160 U.S. markets and is pushing out its EDGE network to 270 million potential U.S. users. \u001d  The \"halo effect\" from broader wireless Internet adoption promises to help others - such as AT&T's competitors who could cash in on the zeal for 3G the iPhone creates, or providers of niche wireless services, such as mobile messaging whose fortunes are tied to the quality of the wireless network. \u001d  \"Can the iPhone jump start 3G? It's very possible,\" Bhakshi said. \u001d  Nonetheless, it's going to be an uphill battle. Use of 3G services have been hampered by higher prices, a limited number of products and competing technologies. While prices have come down in receent years, 3G services still carry a premium starting at about $10 per month, and consumers typically will spend $50 more for a 3G handset. \u001d  Handset demand also remains a big question. It's estimated that between 6% and 8% of U.S. handsets sold are 3G compatible, which lags behind the at least 15% and higher penetration rates in Europe and Asia. The iPhone isn't 3G compatible yet, but a 3G version is expected when it's released in Europe later this year. \u001d  Finally, the cell phone industry is also divided in the technology it uses, which has helped to confuse consumers with multiple choices. \u001d  AT&T's 3G network is based on GSM technology, which is the world's most popular. But in the U.S., CDMA technology, championed by Qualcomm (QCOM) is more popular. A 3G version of CDMA is used by Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) and Verizon Wireless, which are both aggressively ugrading to an even faster technology \u001d  To be sure, AT&T has heard the criticisms about its 2G network, which uses the EDGE technology. It already poured $50 million into its EDGE cell phone network that's backing up the iPhone, in order to beef it up for iPhone use. \u001d  A 3G version of the iPhone could arrive as early as this autumn when the iPhone is released in Europe. In theory, the same phone could be used in the United States. \u001d  But for now, though, AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said iPhone owners looking for a faster and better Internet experience have no other cellular alternative. The iPhone does offer the option of connecting to the Web at Wi-Fi hotspots, which are quickly multiplying but remain limited in number and coverage area. \b \u001d  -By Ben Charny; Dow Jones Newswires; 415-765-8230; ben.charny@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:18 ET (20:18 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a16b1d43c268b12c5cb95f71d7d93ab1","symR":["DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","AU000000NWS2","DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","AU000000NWS2"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Dow Jones: Report On Completed News Corp Deal 'False'","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","AU000000NWS2"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","PUB","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XORD","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:32 ET (13:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a1b7973c97855d31dd405fcd45cedca2","symR":["SPY"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.000131],"ret5":[1.01157],"Headline":"SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) Block: 250,000 Shrs At 152.75","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SPY"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\bSPDR S&P 500 ETF \bLast trade  NMS: +0.57 at 152.75 on 0.02 downtick \bTrade vol:       250,000 =    0.4% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   8,211,400 =   14.5% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:  32,225,600 =   26.2% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:      56,785,844 =   46.2% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:122,936,17 / Prev day -0.16 on 89,278,640 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:24 ET (18:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a1baedb327f5d12a220948f048afb5c7","symR":["UTHR"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.013426],"ret5":[1.064815],"Headline":"VP MAHON Sells 2,000 Of UNITED THERAPEUTICS CORP >UTHR","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UTHR"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: UNITED THERAPEUTICS CORP \bSYMBOL: UTHR \b \bFILER: MAHON PAUL A \bTITLE: Vice President \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Exercise*                2,000      $22.95          $45,900 \b7/5/07             Sale                     2,000      $64.10         $128,205 \b(10b5-1 Plan Indicated)** \b \bOWNERSHIP: 13,000 (Direct) \b \b  * - Exercised 3 years, 6 months after vesting and 6 years, 5 months before \b      expiration. \b ** - A 10b5-1 plan enables an insider to establish a program to make trans- \b      actions according to an advance plan.

Canetic's foreign ownership level has increased to 61% from 44% in March and 33% in October 2006. \u001d  He added that he is encouraged by a renewed focus on internal development opportunities, especially after Canetic's \"acquisition spree\" in 2006, during which it acquired StarPoint Energy Trust and assets from Samson Canada. He anticipates that the trust's capital development program, which is forecast to be C$375 million in 2007 and which will include the drilling of around 100 net wells, will lead to greater stability in overall production volumes. \u001d  For 2007 and 2008, he is forecasting average production rates of 78,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day and 76,500 barrels of oil equivalent a day, respectively.

Candover's offer will become unconditional if at least 80% of Stork shares are tendered. \u001d  Petercam Bank analyst Luuk van Beek said, \"it is now a lot more difficult for Candover to take over Stork as the Marel led consortium, owning about 20% of the company, can block the proposed deal almost on its own.\" \u001d  He expects Candover will now talk to Marel but said raising the bid price may not be its chief issue. He said Marel is primarily interested in Stork's Food Systems division rather than simply making a bigger gain on its stake. \u001d  LME said there is more room for value creation within Stork and that it has shared its opinion with other large shareholders of Stork. \u001d  Aviva PLC (AV.LN), which holds a 5.14% Stork stake, has already said that it wouldn't tender its shares to Candover. \u001d  \"The offer is simply too low,\" asset manager Alex Otto of Dutch Aviva-subsidiary Delta Lloyd told Dow Jones Newswires, adding that Aviva wouldn't tender its shares unless a bid would come in \"at least 10% higher.\" \u001d  Stork management has been under pressure for more than a year from hedge funds U.K.-based Centaurus Capital Ltd. and U.S.-based Paulson & Co., which have sought a breakup of the company.

EETC's are hybrid corporate - structured debt obligations in which payment on the notes is effectively supported by the underlying corporate entity, while structured elements of the transaction provide protection to investors in the event of issuer default.  As such, Fitch's ratings on EETC transactions begin with the underlying Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of the issuing entity and are adjusted upward depending on the structural enhancements in place.  Based on the foregoing, Fitch lowered its EETC ratings for Delta following their Sept. 14, 2005 bankruptcy filing.  As a result of Delta's re-emergence from bankruptcy protection, Fitch anticipates that, subject to the availability of certain information related to the collateral and any modifications to transaction structures, ratings on EETC tranches will improve due to the improvement in the implied credit-worthiness of the issuer.  The affected EETC classes are as follows: \u001d  Delta Air Lines Pass Through Certificates, Series 1992 --Class B2 rated 'CC/DR4'. \u001d  Delta Air Lines Pass Through Certificates, Series 1993 --Class A2 rated 'CC/DR4'. \u001d  Delta Air Lines Pass Through Certificates, Series 2000-1 --Class A1 rated 'B'; --Class A2 rated 'B'; --Class B rated 'CCC / DR1'. \u001d  Delta Air Lines Pass Through Certificates, Series 2001-1 --Class A1 rated 'B'; --Class A2 rated 'B'; --Class B rated 'CCC/DR1'. \u001d  Delta Air Lines European Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates, Series 2001-2 --Class A rated 'BBB-'; --Class B rated 'CCC/DR1'. \u001d  Delta Air Lines Pass Through Certificates, Series 2002-1 --Class C rated 'CC/DR5'. \u001d  Fitch's Distressed Recovery (DR) ratings, introduced in April 2006 across all sectors of structured finance, are designed to estimate recoveries on a forward-looking basis while taking into account the time value of money. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:36 ET (17:36 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a6e8a6eb6e5d1d8e1e1a215d3534eabd","symR":["GMCR","US3931221069"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Declares Three-For-One Stk Split","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GMCR","US3931221069"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:01 ET (11:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a6f0fea5d32ea9e491fc153b454d4f8f","symR":["MT","MT.AE","NL0000361947"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.029003,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.021135,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Arcelor Mittal's Junck To Retire On 'Successful' Integration","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MT","MT.AE","NL0000361947"],"IndustryCodes":["STL","XAEX","XCA4","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Arcelor Mittal said Roland Junck is retiring from his executive role on July 31, though he'll become a board member of Arcelor China.

(Nasdaq: SINT), an information technology and network solutions (IT) company, today announced that it has achieved a Level 3 rating in software and system engineering using Capability Maturity Model Integration version 1.1.  The rating was announced by the Systems and Software Consortium (SSCI). \b \u001d  The rating was based on extensive reviews of SI International's work for several of its Federal government customers, most notably the Department of State for whom the company has designed and operates an immigrant visa information processing system.  SSCI reviewed the framework of SI International's software development, design and engineering processes to rate their standardization and scalability across large projects. \b \u001d  \"Achieving CMMI Level 3 maturity confirms that our software design teams consistently provide the highest quality and reliability on time and within budget,\" said Brad Antle, President & CEO of SI International.  \"This achievement was only possible because of the diligent efforts of our engineers, and their professional dedication to process improvement.\" \b \u001d  SI International is a member of the SSCI, and Brad Antle is a former Chairman of the Board for SSCI.  CMMI was developed through the collaboration effort of industry, government, and the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) as a means to objectively appraise an organization's software and systems development capability.  Level 3 indicates that an organization's processes are institutionalized, consistent across the organization, and measurable. Companies who attain a Level 3 maturity rating continually meet or exceed customer expectations by delivering high quality products within budget and on time. \b \u001d  About SI International: SI International, a member of the Russell 2000 and S&P SmallCap 600 indices, is a provider of information technology and network solutions (IT) primarily to the federal government.

The walkout also affected the steel mills owned by Arcelor Mittal (MT) in the Pacific port of Lazaro Cardenas. \u001d  The country's two largest copper mines, Cananea and La Caridad, weren't affected. \u001d  The union said Thursday that workers at almost all of its 73 chapters reported \"adhering to the movement in support of union autonomy and the prompt return of its national leader,\" but didn't say how many workers went on strike. \u001d  Union boss Napoleon Gomez Urrutia, who is currently in Canada, has spent the past 15 months locked in a leadership struggle. He has also been accused of misappropriating $55 million in funds that Grupo Mexico paid to the union in 2004 for distribution among workers, related to the 1990 privatization of the Cananea and La Caridad copper mines. Gomez Urrutia left Mexico last year when several warrants were issued for his arrest. \u001d  Gomez Urrutia has long been at odds with Grupo Mexico, accusing the company of trying to oust him, and the union has made most of its safety complaints against the company. \u001d  Grupo Mexico rejects the union charges about safety, saying the company is meeting standards at all of its facilities and exceeding them in some. \u001d  According to the mining chamber, industry production last year totaled $6.8 billion, and it employed 279,000 workers directly, while supporting 1.5 million indirect jobs. \b \u001d  -By Anthony Harrup, Dow Jones Newswires; (5255) 5080 3450, anthony.harrup@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:20 ET (15:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"aa495170d23ea55c8665b190de402a07","symR":["GUR.T","CA3794621043"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Global Uranium Fund Inc.

This time, the unconfirmed speculation is that hedge-fund magnate and Sears Holdings (SHLD) chairman Eddie Lampert is looking to merge Macy's with Sears and Kmart. Credit default swaps for both M and SHLD have widened this morning. M officials weren't immediately available for comment, and SHLD declines to comment. A couple of weeks ago, the rumor had been that Macy's was to be taken private for $52 a share by Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts, Goldman Sachs and Providence. The latter, a firm focusing on media companies, denied any dealings with Macy's. (JMC) \u001d  11:23 (Dow Jones) Centerbridge Capital Partners says Dana's (DCNAQ) two big unions, the UAW and the United Steelworkers, approached the firm to help broker and fund a deal. DCNAQ reached a settlement with the unions that includes putting retiree healthcare obligations into a separate fund run by the unions. Centerbridge is helping fund the deal with a $500M investment in DCNAQ. \"We believe that our partnership with, and investment in, Dana will create significant upside for all of the company's constituents,\" Stephen J. Girsky, president of Centerbridge Industrial Partners, says in statement. Girsky is a former Morgan Stanley auto analyst and was an advisor at GM. (TAK) \u001d  11:17 (Dow Jones) UBS believes Argentina's true inflation is running at approximately 1% per month, against the reported 0.4% official June CPI, equivalent to a 8.8% annual inflation rate. The data is \"consistent with the trend that each month's inflation has come in slightly below that of the year-ago month, and do little to dispel speculation that INDEC's statistics are not entirely accurate,\" says UBS. Argentina's Chief of Cabinet Alberto Fernandez dismissed this speculation Fri saying the CPI methodology hasn't changed. (SEN) \u001d  10:59 (Dow Jones) Genzyme (GENZ) off 5.2% to $61.50 after biotech's drug pipeline goes 0-for-2 this week. Today GENZ says patient trial of tolevamer, an experimental treatment for an intestinal bug, missed its primary endpoint and did worse than an antibiotic. Just yesterday, company said a trial showed its experimental treatment for arthritic knees, hylastan, was no better than a steroid. Street expectations had been modest for both drugs - Deutsche Bank noted last month results were mixed for an earlier study of tolevamer, and Baird said yesterday hylastan is less important than another arthritis product from GENZ, Synvisc One. (PDL) \u001d  10:50 (Dow Jones) After opening lower following the jobs report, US stocks have tacked to the upside, with the DJIA mainly held aloft by Caterpillar and IBM. Stocks fell at the open, after jobs report comes in on target, but with big revisions to prior months. That sends Treasury yields up. Also, crude futures are hovering around $73. Energy, materials higher; utilities, telecom lower. Declining shares on Big Board slightly outnumbering advancers; volume's light. DJIA up 23, S&P 500 up 1, Nasdaq Comp up 1.

Wachovia maintains market perform rating on stock, saying continued buybacks should partially offset pressure on earnings and returns for its insurance companies. The company said increased volatile pricing environment for its commercial insurance segment drove renewal premiums below expectations. SIGI down 8.2% at $24.65. (HJE) \u001d  10:36 (Dow Jones) Treasurys seem to have found a perch for today's session, slightly worse off than where they began thanks to the strong payrolls number. The selling following the Labor Department's release took the 10-year yield as high as 5.20%, but it's since settled back to 5.17%. The two-year popped above 5%, but looks more stable now around 4.97%. This 20bps gap leaves the curve steeper than it has been all week. (ECB) \u001d  10:34 (Dow Jones) After becoming a national symbol of everthing that's wrong with American law, Roy Pearson actually had the gall to appeal the verdict in his $54M lawsuit against his dry cleaner, WSJ.com's Law Blog reports. Pearson wrote to the Chungs' lawyer Christopher Manning informing him he intends to file a motion arguing the judge failed to address Pearson's legal claims and requesting she reverse her verdict. Manning says he pleaded with Pearson to consider ending the madness, to no avail. Meanwhile, Manning says he intends to file a motion requesting the court require Pearson pay the Chungs' attorneys fees, which have reportedly grown to $100,000.

(HLP) \u001d  9:58 (Dow Jones) It's early, but eBay's (EBAY) Kijiji classified site has \"significant potential,\" UBS writes. \"The classified model works online, although the existing classified leader, craigslist, does not seek to maximize the monetization opportunity.\" EBay can do so, UBS says, by charging fees for certain listings categories, getting ad support, increasing usage of Skype and PayPal and driving more auctions to eBay's core engine. Another potential winner is Yahoo (YHOO), which provides search and display ads on the eBay site. Besides extending that relationship, UBS says, \"we could even envision YHOO acting as a distribution partner and traffic provider to Kijiji.\" (GS) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:31 ET (15:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"aaefe1505628fe4328aefdb0349463a7","symR":["HC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"VP YORK Sells 7,841 Of HANOVER COMPRESSOR CO >HC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:59:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HC"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: HANOVER COMPRESSOR CO \bSYMBOL: HC \b \bFILER: YORK STEPHEN P \bTITLE: Vice President \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Exercise*                7,841       $9.95          $78,025 \b7/5/07             Sale                     7,841      $27.00         $211,707 \b(10b5-1 Plan Indicated)** \b \bOWNERSHIP: 42,133 (Direct)  102 (Indirect) \b \b  * - 7,159 shares exercised 5 years, 5 months before expiration. \b      682 shares exercised 6 years before expiration. \b ** - A 10b5-1 plan enables an insider to establish a program to make trans- \b      actions according to an advance plan.

The auction will offer more than 550 lots -- everything from equipment to medals to programs (www.bonhams.com). \u001d  Sotheby's in New York on Sept. 27-28 will auction Jeffrey B. Ellis's collection of around 800 antique clubs dating from 1600 into the 1930s (www.sothebys.com). Mr. Ellis, who has written a number of popular books on golf clubs, including \"The Clubmaker's Art: Antique Golf Clubs and Their History,\" spent the last 30 years traveling the world in search of unique pieces. \"In the world of sport,\" he says, \"there is really no more creative implement.\" \u001d  Here's a look at key items in the sales: \b \u001d  Medals awarded to winners of The Open Championship (the British Open's official name) rarely come up at auction, says Kevin McGimpsey, the expert in charge of the Bonhams sale. This one will feature the gold 1937 Open Championship medal won by one of England's greatest 20th-century golfers, Henry Cotton (estimate: GBP 25,000- GBP 30,000). Mr. Cotton won the tournament three times and twice captained British Ryder Cup teams. \u001d  (The medal still has the clasps with which it was attached to a bracelet worn by Mr. Cotton's wife, known as \"Toots.\" Mr. Cotton is quoted as saying that having it as a bracelet on Toots' arm was \"better than lying in a drawer somewhere.\") \u001d  In the sale is also a painting by contemporary artist Craig Campbell of Mr. Cotton's approach to the 7th hole at Carnoustie in the 1937 Open (estimate: GBP 600- GBP 800). \u001d  London auctioneer Graham Budd, a Sotheby's consultant, says the market for historic golf clubs has suffered because of limited supply. He expects a revitalization from the Ellis sale. \"It's just what the market needs,\" Mr. Budd says. \"Good material, which is required to boost the market, will be available again.\" \u001d  Two examples from the Ellis auction: a very early light iron from circa 1600 (estimate: $150,000-$250,000) and a long-nose putter by famed maker Andrew Dickson from circa 1750 ($200,000-$300,000). \u001d  In Bonhams's sale is a putter made by the Stradivarius of club makers, Hugh Philp, and used by Scotland's \"Young\" Tom Morris when winning his last Open Championship in 1872 ( GBP 50,000- GBP 80,000). \"Young\" Tom Morris, son of another great Scottish golfer, \"Old\" Tom Morris, won four consecutive Open titles before his death at the age of 24. \u001d  A fine feather golf ball from 1842 stamped \"Allan\" is expected to fetch GBP 6,000- GBP 9,000 in Bonhams's sale. (Leather golf balls stuffed with feathers are the oldest and the most collectible of balls; and they are particularly desirable when marked with a famous producer's name.) This ball was made by Allan Robertson, one of the best golfers of his time. The sale will include a range of balls from various points in the game's history. \u001d  In January, Bonhams sold a painting of an intense-looking Tiger Woods winning the Masters in 2005 by Craig Campbell for GBP 13,200, well above its estimate of GBP 7,000-9,000. This time around, Bonhams will be offering a relaxed portrait of Mr. Woods by Mr. Campbell from 2007, estimated at GBP 3,000- GBP 4,000. \u001d  Bonhams's sale features a complete program of the 1933 Ryder Cup, in which the best of American golfers competed against the best British golfers (the British won). The item is estimated at GBP 800- GBP 1,200. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 00:30 ET (04:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ac6a990a8855693564ccae371f5e8072","symR":["DCX","DCX.XE","DE0007100000"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"DaimlerChrysler: Chrysler 2Q Sales Outside US 159,993 >DCX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DCX","DCX.XE","DE0007100000"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI","XES","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:54 ET (18:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ac7090121756989ac4f52087ca25e8d3","symR":["MS"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9941168],"ret5":[0.9967164],"Headline":": Moody's Affirms Morgan Stanley Series 2005-HQ7","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T17:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MS"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Moody's Investors Service: \b \bMoody's Affirms Morgan Stanley Capital I Inc., Series 2005-HQ7 \bApproximately $1.9 Billion of Structured Securities Affected \b \u001d  New York, July 06, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service affirmed the ratings of twenty-four classes of Morgan Stanley Capital I Inc., Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-HQ7 as follows: \b \u001d  -Class A-1, $102,727,963, affirmed at Aaa \u001d  -Class A-2, $180,030,000, affirmed at Aaa \u001d  -Class A-AB, $100,000,000, affirmed at Aaa \u001d  -Class A-3, $25,000,000, affirmed at Aaa \u001d  -Class A-4, $722,379,000, affirmed at Aaa \u001d  -Class A-1A, $211,433,735, affirmed at Aaa \u001d  -Class A-M, $195,662,000, affirmed at Aaa \u001d  -Class A-J, $139,408,000, Affirmed at Aaa \u001d  -Class X, Notional, affirmed at Aaa \u001d  -Class B, $14,675,000, affirmed at Aa1 \u001d  -Class C, $26,903,000, affirmed at Aa2 \u001d  -Class D, $17,121,000, affirmed at Aa3 \u001d  -Class E, $17,120,000, affirmed at A1 \u001d  -Class F, $19,566,000, affirmed at A2 \u001d  -Class G, $19,566,000, affirmed at A3 \u001d  -Class H, $26,904,000, affirmed at Baa1 \u001d  -Class J, $19,566,000, affirmed at Baa2 \u001d  -Class K, $19,566,000, affirmed at Baa3 \u001d  -Class L, $7,337,000, affirmed at Ba1 \u001d  -Class M, $9,783,000, affirmed at Ba2 \u001d  -Class N, $4,892,000, affirmed at Ba3 \u001d  -Class O, $4,891,000, affirmed at B1 \u001d  -Class P, $4,892,000, affirmed at B2 \u001d  -Class Q, $9,783,000, affirmed at B3 \b \u001d  As of the June 14, 2007 distribution date, the transaction's aggregate certificate balance has decreased by approximately 1.4% to $1.93 billion from $1.96 billion at securitization.

The company recorded a net loss of $0.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share, compared with net income of $2.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. \b \u001d  \"Production cuts at the three largest North American automobile manufacturers stretched into calendar year 2007 and hurt Materials Sciences' first quarter sales, as did weakness in the residential and commercial construction markets,\" said Clifford D. Nastas, chief executive officer for Material Sciences. \"We expect this slowdown in the U.S. auto market will continue throughout this fiscal year. \b \u001d  \"Our progress in winning new customers and developing new markets in the United States and abroad has helped to balance continued weakness in the domestic auto sector. For example, European brake sales increased approximately 47 percent, partially offsetting the weakness in domestic and other acoustical sales. \b \u001d  \"We closed MSC's first contract with a transplant manufacturer this quarter, a milestone in our efforts to diversify our customer base. Our two research centers in Michigan and Germany will further spur sales by showing customers how our products and expertise can solve their noise and vibration problems,\" Nastas added. \b \b    Results of Operations -- First Quarter Sales, Gross Profit and Income \b \u001d  In the first quarter, acoustical sales decreased 20.3 percent to $31.2 million from $39.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, mainly due to weakness in the domestic automotive industry. The decline in sales of body panel laminate, which decreased 21.0 percent during the quarter to $17.4 million from $22.0 million in the comparable period, is due to continued production cuts at domestic automakers and the timing of orders related to a product launch planned for July at one of the company's largest customers. \b \u001d  Sales in the brake market during the quarter decreased 27.9 percent to $6.7 million in the first quarter from $9.3 million in the comparable period, primarily due to softness in the auto industry and an overall reduction in the quantity of inventory carried by customers. These declines were partially offset by the previously mentioned growth in the European brake market. Disk drive sales declined 93.3 percent to $0.1 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2007 due to a change in disk drive design methodology at the company's largest customer in this sector. \b \u001d  Coated sales declined 19.5 percent in the first quarter to $29.5 million from $36.6 million in the prior period. Sales of automotive gas tanks were impacted by the previously mentioned softness in the automotive sector, decreasing 17.1 percent to $10.8 million from $13.0 million. Clutch plate sales for the quarter declined 98.5 percent to less than $0.1 million from $1.1 million, as the company's largest customer in this segment transitioned to a new in-house process, eliminating the need for coated products. Sales of building products for the quarter decreased 33.6 percent to $4.0 million from $6.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as weakness in the housing market continued to negatively impact sales. \b \u001d  Gross profit in the first quarter was $9.7 million compared with $13.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. Gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to 16.0 percent of sales versus 17.3 percent of sales in the comparable period. The decline in net sales, particularly the decline of higher margin acoustical products, contributed to the majority of the decrease in gross profit and gross margin percentage. Additionally, secondary sales in the quarter were $0.2 million lower than the comparable period and the company experienced quality issues related to inventory, which reduced gross profit by $0.2 million. These factors were partially offset by $0.5 million in favorable fixed production spending, mainly due to contract negotiation and health care costs in last year's quarter, and $0.4 million in improved raw material costs, as lower steel costs helped to offset the rising cost of zinc and nickel compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2007. \b \u001d  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $10.3 million in the first quarter, an increase of 19.5 percent from $8.6 million in last year's quarter. The increase is primarily due to investment in human resources, marketing and product development to expand the company's product and customer base and increase its market share, along with higher outside professional fees relating to audit and legal services. \b \u001d  Material Sciences recorded a loss from operations for the first quarter of $0.6 million compared with a profit of $3.9 million in the last year, due to the factors listed above. \b \b    Conference Call \b \u001d  Material Sciences will host a conference call to review the first quarter fiscal 2008 results on Friday, July 6, 2007, at 9:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time. Clifford D. Nastas, chief executive officer, and James M. Froisland, senior vice president, chief financial officer, chief information officer and corporate secretary, will discuss the company's recent financial performance and respond to questions from the financial community. \b \u001d  The company invites interested investors to listen to the presentation, which will be carried live on the Internet at the company's Web site: http://www.matsci.com.

The company's lead product, the TAP vaccine, performs a key step in moving characteristic markers called antigens to the surfaces of cells. Without TAP, there are no cancer markers, so the immune system fails to spot the rogue cells and the cancerous cells can grow undetected. The effective restoration of TAP restores and augments antigen presentation and subsequent recognition and killing of cancer cells by the immune system. The TAP molecule also works as an adjuvant or 'accelerant' to enhance vaccines against infectious diseases. The company is currently developing AdhTAP for the commencement of toxicology studies leading to the initiation of Phase I clinical trials. The global vaccine market is expected to grow from $13 billion in 2007 to $21 billion in 2010. \b \u001d  For more information about this company, please visit http://www.tapimmune.com. \b \b    About WallSt.net: \b \u001d  www.wallst.net is owned and operated by WallStreet Direct, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Financial Media Group, Inc.

The review was prompted by the company's announcement that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with funds managed and advised by CVC Capital Partners (\"CVC\") in an all-cash transaction valued at about $1.7 billion, including the assumption of debt ($482 million outstanding as of April 30, 2007). The transaction remains subject to regulatory approval in both the U.S. and Europe, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2007. LGD assessments are also subject to change. \b \u001d  Moody's review will consider the impact of the transaction on Samsonite's capital structure and credit metrics, particularly since post-transaction debt levels could potentially increase. The review will also focus on management's ongoing strategy for growth, profitability improvement, and cash flow generation. Since Samsonite's operating performance and credit metrics have shown significant improvement over the last several years, Moody's will assess whether the company will be able to sustain metrics that are consistent with a B1 rating going forward given changes which may occur to its capital structure. \b \u001d  Ratings placed under review for possible downgrade are: \b \u001d  Samsonite Corporation \u001d  $80 million senior secured revolving credit facility at Ba3 \u001d  $450 million senior secured term loan at Ba3 \u001d  Corporate Family Rating at B1 \u001d  Probability of Default rating at B2 \b \u001d  Samsonite is a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of luggage and travel-related products.

(LMT) for electronic counter measures components for up to 1,000 Symphony units. It expects to ship half of these orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the balance in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. \u001d  Analyst Doug Cooper said in a report he believes the Lockheed Martin business will translate to about C$40 million in orders for the company. Allen-Vanguard has indicated that this program could be \"much deeper\" than the 1,000 units, and has the potential to evolve into a \"strong, long-term opportunity.\" \u001d  Allen-Vanguard continues to anticipate a strong second half of 2007, with the majority of deliveries taking place in the fourth quarter. As such, third-quarter results will be a little weak, Cooper said, simply because of the timing of deliveries. Allen-Vanguard expects revenue to be about C$50 million in the second half of the year, while Paradigm sees revenue of C$53 million, comprising C$18 million in the third quarter and C$35 million in the fourth quarter. \u001d  Over fiscal 2007 and 2008, Paradigm is forecasting a combined C$150 million in revenue from ECM. While the timing is difficult to predict, Cooper said, he believes the firm's forecast will ultimately prove to be \"very conservative\" given the potential follow-on order for the Symphony program and the CREW 3 program, which is the U.S. Department of Defense's Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfar program. \u001d  Paradigm continues to rate Allen-Vanguard at buy on the belief that the stock exhibits \"excellent\" risk-return characteristics given the company's strong balance sheet, growth opportunities and its acquisition strategy. \u001d  Allen-Vanguard, Ottawa, provides technologies, tools and training for defeating and minimizing the effects of hazardous devices and materials. It's trading down 2.0% at C$8.15 in Toronto Friday. \u001d  Paradigm has provided investment-banking services to Allen-Vanguard in the last 12 months, but Cooper doesn't own the stock. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.allenvanguard.com \b \u001d  -Wendy Tsau; 416-306-2100; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:52 ET (17:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b4887ce3ec44965c91035b95d66a6b13","symR":["IBM","US4592001014"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9994497,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.015959,-0.00099],"Headline":"Intl Business Ma (IBM) Block: 150,000 Shrs At 108.75","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IBM","US4592001014"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\bINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES \bLast trade  NMS: +0.70 at 108.75 on 0.05 uptick \bTrade vol:       150,000 =    4.7% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:     513,200 =   16.1% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:   1,459,074 =   19.2% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:       3,196,243 =   42.1% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol: 7,584,608 / Prev day +1.47 on 6,671,400 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:44 ET (15:44 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b4899a4df886700340f1cc4993c878c0","symR":["COP","US20825C1045"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.037142,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.060958,-0.00099],"Headline":"ConocoPhillips (COP) Mkt On Close Sell Imbalance: Shrs 50600","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["COP","US20825C1045"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:50 ET (19:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b491d3db9992da18d86e91b3fbab9e4c","symR":["RR.LN","RYCEY","GB0032836487"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,1.033036,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.014464,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Citigroup Raises Rolls Royce Price Target","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RR.LN","RYCEY","GB0032836487"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\u001d  0624 GMT [Dow Jones] Citigroup raises Rolls Royce's (RR.LN) price target to 480p from 435p saying strong recent aircraft orders have led to increased estimates. \"2007 cash flow should improve on the back of higher orders as Rolls Royce receives significant prepayments,\" says analyst David Perry.

By 2005, the level of poverty among ultra-Orthodox Jews hit 63%, up from 39% ten years earlier. \u001d  But that trend may now be set for a reversal. \u001d  When Rachel Nesbach, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish mother of two finished her associates degree in software design six years ago, she couldn't find a job in her chosen field that accommodated religious beliefs that include segregation from males who aren't relatives, eating kosher food, and having time to devote to raising a large family. Working for one of the many high-tech companies in Tel Aviv was out of the question, she says. \u001d  So she worked as a secretary in a Jewish organization until three years ago when the information technology company Matrix IT Ltd (MTRX.TV) opened an office tailored to the needs of ultra-Orthodox women within walking distance of her home in Modi'in Ilit, an ultra-Orthodox municipality. \u001d  \"It's amazing,\" says Nesbach, 26, dressed in a long skirt and wearing a wig to cover her hair. \"This is a good opportunity for me. I really enjoy this place, and they understand me here.\" \u001d  Almost all of the 350 employees in the office are ultra-orthodox women; the few men are in a separate area. The women have a kosher kitchen, a mothers' room, and work is limited to eight hours a day so they have time for their children. Occasionally a rabbi visits to make sure the office complies with ultra-Orthodox customs. \u001d  Now, Nesbach and the approximately 900 other women working at Matrix and the eight other recently-opened IT and outsourcing firms here, can support their families. Since these firms opened, the town of around 30,000 people has moved up one socio-economic level, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics. \u001d  These job opportunities have opened up in part because    several years ago ultra-Orthodox rabbis, who oversee a  gender-segregated education system, approved fields such as software design for women, says Libi Affen, the ultra-Orthodox chief operations officer of Talpiot, Matrix's outsourcing division that is headquartered in Modi'in Ilit. \u001d  Jobs are abundant in a sector that is a cornerstone of Israel's economic growth. The high-tech industry contributed 12.1% to total Gross Domestic Product in 2005, and 17.2% to GDP in the business sector alone in the same year, according to government figures. \u001d  But the employment of ultra-Orthodox women is only possible because companies have created special working conditions, Affen says. In addition, the government funds on-the-job training for ultra-Orthodox women and pays companies that hire more than 15 ultra-Orthodox staff about $250 a month per employee, according to the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor. \u001d  \"That is a large incentive,\" which covers almost one fourth of the average salary of about $1,000 a month, says Eli Kazhdan, who oversees 200 ultra-Orthodox women employees at CityBook, a company that provides outsourcing services for summarizing corporate leases and for title insurance in the real estate sector. \u001d  Matrix, meanwhile, hopes by the end of the year to open another branch in the northern city of Haifa, also for ultra-Orthodox women, bringing the total number to 500 from a total of about 3,000 staff, Affen says. \u001d  Matrix, the first publicly-traded company to open in Modi'in Ilit, has a market capitalization of 844 million shekels ($198 million) and is 50%-owned by Formula Systems Ltd (FORTY) a global IT company. \u001d  Dozens of other companies are hiring small groups of ultra-Orthodox women graduates from the growing number of religious colleges that offer degrees in computer and software engineering. The Jerusalem College of Technology's Lustig Institute, which opened in 1999 offering ultra-orthodox women degrees in computer engineering, currently has agreements with ECI Telecom, IBM, Retalix, Israeli IT company Yael Software and Systems Ltd and 15 other companies, to hire ultra-Orthodox graduates in groups, says Tzvi Ilani, director of the Lustig Institute. \u001d  \"The demand for our graduates is more and more,\" Ilani says, and even where companies don't qualify for government training subsidies, they value the dedication and reliability of their ultra-Orthodox employees. \u001d  Before Matrix set up in Modi'in Ilit, its mayor, ultra-Orthodox rabbi Yaakov Guterman, says he confronted a \"ticking bomb\" of economic depravation, with 45 new babies  born each week and 70% of its men studying Torah full time. In 2003, only 30% of residents paid property tax, as the remainder were exempt due to their low income, he says. \u001d  So Guterman encouraged companies to open offices in Modi'in Ilit, where there were many educated women without places to work. In the last three years, it has experienced a \"revolution,\" due to the number of companies locating there, he says. Now, 85% of the residents pay property tax. \u001d  Still, critics of the new work schemes say the ultra-Orthodox women are exploited. Describing the women as \"captive workers,\" Amiram Gonen, head of the The Floersheimer Institute for Policy Studies at the Hebrew University, says they earn little above the minimum wage  because they have no alternatives. \u001d  \"Perhaps my salary is a bit lower than what they give outside (of this community),\" says Nesbach, the Matrix employee, \"But we only have to work eight hours a day.\" \u001d  Already a few of the ultra-Orthodox women who work at Matrix have become team leaders and have offices outside those catering to ultra-Orthodox, says Affen of Matrix, and despite the rabbinical ban on driving, some now have  company cars. \u001d  -By Sara Toth , Dow Jones Newswires; +972-50-420-8903; saratoth@yahoo.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 04:18 ET (08:18 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b52c277034ecdafed83b415e69faf894","symR":["EIL1.DB","IE00B1CMPN86"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Aer Lingus: Outlook Has Not Changed","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EIL1.DB","IE00B1CMPN86"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:20 ET (11:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b52d6eeb72c8fdceb4aeeb3d8049e77e","symR":["SHY"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"ISHRSLehTBnd (SHY) Block: 169,000 Shrs At 79.76","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SHY"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\bISHARES TRUST LEHMAN 1-3 YEAR TREASURY BOND FUND \bLast trade  NMS: -0.01 at 79.76 on 0.02 uptick \bTrade vol:       169,000 =   92.9% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:     169,000 =   92.9% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:     327,831 =   46.7% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:         181,900 =   25.9% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:   701,768 / Prev day -0.11 on 820,300 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:43 ET (13:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b56e9b4dabc3aa7649dff3cec3d90013","symR":["EXBD"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Corp Exec Bd Records $1.3M Expense From Archer's Departure","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EXBD"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:30 ET (20:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b57e7aaa7012f5a95a9be85e25f689eb","symR":["BK","GLNG","GOL.OS","BMG9456A1009"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9973451,1.03021,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.033628,1.039939,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Stock Rating Reiterations Closing Update: GLNG BK","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BK","GLNG","GOL.OS","BMG9456A1009"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","MAR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\bRatings reiterations for July 6  from Briefing.com: \b \bCompany                     Symbol    Brokerage Firm        Reiterations \bGolar LNG                   GLNG      Stanford Research     Buy \bBank of NY                  BK        Punk, Ziegel & Co     Mkt Perform \b \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:38 ET (20:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b58db0645e09445df2b1ee7029fe2427","symR":["BARC.LN","BCS","FTH.XX","MCO","SDP.XX","GB0031348658"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,1.005536,-0.00099,0.9873174,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.033564,-0.00099,0.9757585,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barclays Global Fund Advisors To Launch Municipal-Bond ETF","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BARC.LN","BCS","FTH.XX","MCO","SDP.XX","GB0031348658"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","EXT","FIS","ICS","SVC","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b \b   DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Barclays Global Fund Advisors plans to launch the iShares S&P National Municipal Bond Fund as part of its iShares Trust series. \u001d  The proposed exchange-traded fund, or ETF, will seek investment results that generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Standard & Poor's National Municipal Bond Index, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Tuesday. \u001d  An ETF, like many other funds, tracks an index, but is traded like a stock.

Twenty-four of the new properties are in the Walker Lane and are expected to add to Gryphon's volcanic hosted gold resources. Seven of the properties are in the Cortez trend; seven in the Austin-Lovelock, two in the Carlin trend and the balance are unique situations throughout Nevada with a few in contiguous states. \b \bSeveral of the properties, such as the Golden Arrow, Monte Cristo, Regent, Red Rock and Rosebud have had recommended work programs completed on them which will form the basis of future CIM compliant NI 43-101 technical reports. The principal properties have cumulative historical(1) gold mineralization aggregating in excess of 900,000 ounces based on reports prepared by previous operators. Twenty-six of the properties are 'farmed-out' through lease and option agreements that generate a positive cash flow net of carryings costs for the entire suite of properties. Upon closing Nevada Eagle will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Gryphon Gold Corporation. \b \b\"The addition of these properties to our premier asset, the 1.8 million ounce(2) Borealis gold resource, together with our excellent team of geologists, will transform Gryphon Gold from a single property exploration company to one of the top diversified exploration companies in Nevada under favorable terms,\" says Gryphon Gold CEO Tony Ker. \"On closing, Jerry Baughman, the principal shareholder of Nevada Eagle, will join the Gryphon Gold management team as Vice President of Corporate Development. Jerry is a well-known and respected Nevada geologist who has demonstrated his skill at acquiring quality prospects in a timely and cost effective manner. The Nevada Eagle properties represent significant additional growth potential and will enable Gryphon Gold to fully utilize the strengths of its highly regarded exploration team. We anticipate making further accretive acquisitions to add to our current platform in Nevada.\" \b \bUnder the purchase agreement, Gryphon Gold has agreed to pay Nevada Eagle equity holders US$12.0 million by making a US$2.5 million cash payment at Closing, issuing 4.5 million restricted shares of Gryphon Gold common stock and issuing a US$5.0 million convertible note due March 30, 2010, convertible into common shares of Gryphon Gold at US$1.00 during the first 12 months, US$1.25 during the next 12 months; US$1.50 thereafter and US$1.75 if converted on March 30, 2010. Gryphon has granted the Nevada Eagle equity holders registration rights. The closing of this transaction is scheduled for September 15, 2007, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. Westwind Partners Inc. acted as financial advisor to Gryphon Gold in connection with the Nevada Eagle acquisition. \b \bThis acquisition should add significantly to Gryphon Gold's highly prospective gold resources in the politically favorable environment and prolific gold bearing trends of Nevada. The acquisition is expected to provide Gryphon Gold shareholders with immediate diversification to our premier 1.8 million(2) ounce Borealis gold resource, which, with its significant resource expansion potential, will continue to be the focus of Gryphon's immediate exploration efforts. At present the Company has 47.4 million shares outstanding with a cash balance of approximately US$5.0 million as at June 30, 2007. \b \bON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF GRYPHON GOLD CORPORATION \b \bAlbert J. Matter, Chairman \b \b(1) The historical estimates are based on internal reports prepared by prior owners. As such they have not been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 thus their reliability has not been verified. The estimates did not use resource or reserve categories accepted by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\"). \b \b(2) CIM-compliant 0.5 million Measured, 0.7 million Indicated and 0.6 million Inferred ounces of gold resource \b \bFull financial statements and securities filings are available on our website: www.gryphongold.com and www.sec.gov or www.sedar.com. \b \bThe Borealis property is described in the technical report dated August 15, 2006 and revised January 11, 2007 titled Technical Report on the Mineral Resources of the Borealis Gold Project Located in Mineral County, Nevada, U.S.A. and prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators. The technical report describes the exploration history, geology and style of gold mineralization at the Borealis property. Sample preparation, analytical techniques, laboratories used and quality assurance-quality control protocols used during the drilling programs at the Borealis property site are the same as, or similar to, those described in the technical report. \b \bThis press release was reviewed by Dr. R. Steininger of Gryphon Gold, a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators. This press release contains \"forward-looking information\" which may include, but is not limited to, statements with respect to the acquisition of Nevada Eagle Resources LLC, the significance of the Nevada Eagle properties; the Nevada Eagle prospects, including resource estimates, projections, exploration and value; our planned exploration and drilling programs; our expectations with respect to future property acquisition, diversification of our property base and Mr. Baughman's addition to the Gryphon Gold management team; the availability of future financing for exploration and other plans, projections, estimates and expectations. There can be no assurance that our acquisition of Nevada Eagle will close as anticipated or that we will successfully integrate the Nevada Eagle properties into our portfolio or operations. We cannot assure you that our diversification strategy will be successful or result in any material appreciation in the value of our securities. In addition, such forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, the risks and uncertainties outlined in our most recent financial statements and reports and registration statement filed with the SEC (available at www.sec.gov) and with Canadian securities administrators (available at www.sedar.com). Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. \b \bAll mineral resources have been estimated in accordance with the definition standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum referred to in National Instrument 43-101, commonly referred to as NI 43-101. U.S. reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Industry Guide 7. Canadian and Guide 7 standards are substantially different. This press release uses the terms \"measured\", \"indicated\" and \"inferred resources\".

The dividend will be payable in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement. \b \u001d  The Rights Agreement was adopted to deter abusive takeover tactics that can be used to deprive Vertrue's stockholders of the full value of their investment in Vertrue. \b \u001d  Until the earlier of (i) Vertrue's announcing that a person or group has acquired 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Vertrue's Common Stock (an \"Acquiring Person\") or the date and time on which any Acquiring Person has acquired more than 25% of the outstanding shares of Vertrue's Common Stock (in either case, the \"Flip-in Date\") or (ii) the tenth business day (or such earlier or later date as Vertrue's Board of Directors may decide) after any person or group commences a tender offer that will result in such person or group owning 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Vertrue's Common Stock, the Rights will be evidenced by the Common Stock certificates, will automatically trade with the Common Stock and will not be exercisable. Thereafter, separate Rights certificates will be distributed and each Right will entitle its holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Vertrue's Participating Preferred Stock having economic and voting terms similar to those of one share of Vertrue's Common Stock for an exercise price of $240.00. \b \u001d  Any stockholder beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Vertrue's Common Stock at the time of adoption (including Brencourt) is grandfathered under the terms of the Rights Agreement, until such time as such stockholder acquires any additional shares of Vertrue's Common Stock. \b \u001d  Upon 10 business days after (or such earlier or later date as Vertrue's Board of Directors may decide) the occurrence of the Flip-in Date, each Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person or transferees thereof, which Rights become void) will entitle its holder to purchase, for the exercise price, a number of shares of Vertrue's Common Stock having a market value of twice the exercise price. Also, if after an Acquiring Person controls Vertrue's Board of Directors or is the owner of 90% or more of Vertrue's Common Stock, Vertrue is involved in a consolidation, merger or statutory share exchange or sells more than 50% of its assets or earning power (or has entered an agreement to do any of the foregoing) and, in the case of a consolidation, merger or statutory share exchange, the Acquiring Person will receive different treatment than all other stockholders, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, for the exercise price, a number of shares of capital stock of the Acquiring Person having a market value of twice the exercise price. If any person or group acquires between 15% and 50% of Vertrue's Common Stock, Vertrue's Board of Directors may, at its option, exchange one share of Vertrue's Common Stock for each Right. \b \u001d  The Rights may be redeemed by Vertrue's Board of Directors for $0.001 per Right prior to the Flip-in Date. \b \u001d  The Rights Agreement is not intended to and will not prevent a takeover of Vertrue at a full and fair price. However, the Rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 15% or more of the shares of Vertrue's Common Stock unless the Rights are first redeemed by Vertrue's Board of Directors. Nevertheless, the Rights should not interfere with a transaction that is in the best interests of Vertrue and its stockholders because the Rights can be redeemed prior to a triggering event. The Rights Agreement does not in any way weaken Vertrue's financial strength or interfere with its business plans. The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, is not taxable to Vertrue or its stockholders and will not change the way in which Vertrue shares are traded. \b \u001d  A letter to stockholders regarding the Rights Agreement and a summary of certain terms of the Rights Agreement will be mailed to Vertrue's stockholders. \b \b   ABOUT VERTRUE \b \u001d  Vertrue is a publicly held company whose shares are listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol VTRU. Vertrue is a premier Internet direct marketing services company.

The builder typically closes 5 to 10 residential lots and homes each week. \u001d  In early June, Meyer-Sutton asked the court if it could continue selling residential lots and homes free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances. \u001d  Meyer-Sutton said it was willing to pay banks with valid liens and security interests in the properties adequate protection, which would be an amount equal to \"direct secured debt.\" Meyer-Sutton didn't say in court documents what that amount would be. \u001d  According to the company, once the banks were paid, it would use the rest of the sale proceeds for expenses needed to keep its operations going. \u001d  At the time, Meyer-Sutton warned the court that \"failure to continue with standard home closings and to have this liquidity and financing available will require (the company) to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, which would severely impair (its) ability to maximize the value\" of its bankruptcy estate. \u001d  The bankruptcy court gave Meyer-Sutton interim approval to continue selling its homes and lots, but soon after, a number of banks that had helped the company finance its projects objected to its receiving final approval. The loans from the banks were secured by some of the residential lots and homes Meyer-Sutton wanted to put up for sale. \u001d  Meyer-Sutton said in documents filed June 27 with the court that a number of the banks are contending that the loan agreements entitle them to all of the proceeds of any closing - not just the amount equal to the so-called direct secured debt. \u001d  While some banks have expressed a willingness to refrain from enforcing their rights under the loan agreements in return for minor changes to the sale request, Meyer-Sutton said it hasn't been able to broker any consensus with the banks on the matter. \u001d  As a result, Meyer-Sutton said it has to follow through with its warning and request that the court convert its Chapter 11 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 liquidation. \u001d  \"The unwillingness of the objecting banks to consent uniformly to the procedures leaves the debtors with no alternative but to seek a conversion of their cases,\" Meyer-Sutton said. \u001d  Among the banks that have filed objections are SunTrust, Wachovia, Colonial Bank and Bank of Cowetta. \u001d  Meyer-Sutton Homes said its Chapter 11 filing on June 4 was the result of a \"sudden and dramatic\" fall-off in business. The Fayetteville, Ga., company listed total assets of about $44 million and debts of $40 million in its bankruptcy petition. \b \u001d  -Kristina Doss, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1344; kristina.doss@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:08 ET (18:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b72031d7348416fb8707b729ee98028f","symR":["QQQQ"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"PwrShr QQQ TrSer (QQQQ) Block: 1,000,000 Shrs At 48.66","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["QQQQ"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\bPOWERSHARES QQQ TRUST SERIES 1 \bLast trade NADF: Unch at 48.66 on 0.01 uptick \bTrade vol:     1,000,000 =    2.5% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   8,396,752 =   20.6% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:  25,561,550 =   22.6% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:      40,777,648 =   36.1% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:112,998,84 / Prev day +0.35 on 73,588,496 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:28 ET (16:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b72d4176360361af6242addbc172ec5f","symR":["9401.TO","JP3588600001"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Rakuten Files Suit Seeking TBS Acctg Book Disclosure-Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T07:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["9401.TO","JP3588600001"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 03:22 ET (07:22 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b7336a70ff1781b95887a44feae8f057","symR":["MRLBV.HE","FI0009000665"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": S&P: M-real, Sequana Unaffected By Acquisition","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MRLBV.HE","FI0009000665"],"IndustryCodes":["PAP","XDJGI","XHEX"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's: \b \u001d  STOCKHOLM (Standard & Poor's) July 6, 2007--Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said today that its ratings on Finland-based M-real Corp.

In addition, we revised the recovery rating on the company's bank loan to '3' from '2'. The '3' recovery rating indicates an expectation of meaningful (50%-70%) recovery of principal in the event of a payment default, in contrast to a '2' recovery rating, which indicates the expectation of substantial (70%-90%) recovery of principal. The revision to the recovery rating is due to the recent change in Standard & Poor's recovery scale, as well as the use of a lower EBITDA amount and EBITDA multiple in the event of default. \u001d  At the same time, Standard & Poor's removed the ratings from CreditWatch with negative implications, where they were placed April 20, 2007. The outlook is stable. \u001d  \"The rating affirmation and stable outlook follow our review of MEGA Brands' operating and financial strategies, in the context of the challenges it has faced with the Magnetix product, other litigation, and an intensely competitive environment,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Lori Harris. \"Furthermore, the company has announced a C$78 million offering of common shares, net proceeds of which are expected to repay debt, which will positively affect MEGA Brands' financial risk profile,\" Ms. Harris added. Into the affirmation, we incorporated an expectation that MEGA Brands will have no additional material Magnetix-related, one-time expenses and that financial performance will show improvement in the medium term. \u001d  The ratings on MEGA Brands reflect its weak financial profile; customer concentration; seasonal sales; litigation risk; and challenging toy industry fundamentals, including a very competitive operating environment and ongoing reliance on successful new product introductions. These factors are partially offset by the company's good market position within its categories and brand equity. \u001d  The stable outlook reflects the expectation that MEGA Brands will maintain its leading position in its core markets and that credit measures will remain in line with Standard & Poor's expectations. Furthermore, the stable outlook incorporates the expectation that any material problems related to the Magnetix brand are behind the company. The ratings could be revised upward if the company strengthens its business risk profile through building its market position or if MEGA Brands improves its financial risk profile. Should MEGA Brands experience future material Magnetix-related, one-time expenses or the company's financial performance is not in line with Standard & Poor's expectations in the next several quarters, the outlook or ratings could face pressure. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:52 ET (15:52 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b7a44dfa9e376f60719ddfd198a12b7c","symR":["CRWN"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Crown Media To Reimburse Parent Hallmark $33.1M For Taxes>CRWN","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CRWN"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \b   DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Crown Media Holdings Inc.

Hedge ineffectiveness is an accounting charge to show the effectiveness of currency, interest rate and other hedging, the company said. \u001d  Revenue will be up 26% at more than GBP1.07 billion from GBP850 million the previous year, with like-for-like sales growth of at least 10%. \u001d  SIG Chief Executive David Williams said \"demand has risen pretty comprehensively across all trading areas,\" and that the outlook for the next six months was \"quite bright.\" \u001d  Bridgewell Securities analyst Howard Seymour said the trading update was \"very strong\" and noted the profit figure was \"very good\" even though the market was anticipating a strong performance. He expects forecasts to increase but retains a neutral rating on the stock. \u001d  The U.K. and Ireland saw \"reasonably good overall levels of construction activity\" during the period, but the company said building activity was now cooling in Ireland. Revenue increased by 18% in U.K. and Ireland, and like-for-like sales growth was more than 9%. \u001d  Williams said the anticipated slowdown in Ireland, which accounts for less than 10% of the company's revenue, was a result of a correction after unsustainable growth of 10% to 15% in the housing market over the past six or seven years. He said he expects growth \"to settle back down\" to 2% or 3%. \u001d  Mainland Europe performed best, reflecting \"a general strengthening of market demand\" as well as several acquisitions, which led to revenues increasing by 50%, or 53% in local currency, and like-for-like sales growth of more than 20%. \u001d  SIG completed 14 acquisitions during the period, for GBP261 million. \u001d  The company said that the second half of 2006 \"benefited from a sharp uplift in demand in Germany, and from the positive impact of acquisitions made in that period,\" and therefore comparators for the second half would be more demanding than the first half. \u001d  But it said the board was confident \"that further progress will be made.\" \u001d  SIG's shares have risen 17% since it reported full-year results in March, boosted by the EUR297 million acquisition of French roofing products distributor Lariviere in May. SIG's shares closed Thursday at 1345 pence, valuing the company at GBP1.8 billion. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sigplc.co.uk \b \u001d  -By Molly Dover, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-207-842-9358; molly.dover@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 03:50 ET (07:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b836d1842e62b26194171d1b40114bd0","symR":["BVF","BVF.T","DDS.T","DDSS","ENCY","JNJ","CA09067J1093","CA5049051009","US4781601046"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.009496,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.009818,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Labopharm's FDA Troubles May Not Be All Its Doing >DDSS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BVF","BVF.T","DDS.T","DDSS","ENCY","JNJ","CA09067J1093","CA5049051009","US4781601046"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","MDV","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \b   By Andy Georgiades \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Labopharm Inc.'s (DDSS) failure to get its once-daily formulation of painkiller tramadol approved in the U.S. by now, while frustrating for investors, may not be entirely its fault. \u001d  Labopharm has said it has submitted two positive Phase III trials to the U.S. Food and Drug Administraion, one of which had a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. The company described an SPA as a \"binding agreement between the FDA and the sponsor of a clinical trial stating that the study design meets the scientific and regulatory requirements of the FDA to support a new drug application.\" \u001d  When Labopharm received its second approvable letter from the FDA in late May - which led to a 50% drop in the stock price - it revealed that the agency took issue with Labopharm's analysis of missing data related to subjects that dropped out of the trials. A follow-up meeting with the FDA late last month provided few answers, except that the company finally had a clear understanding of the statistical analysis demanded by the FDA and that an additional trial could be necessary if the existing data can't satisfy those requirements. \u001d  Following discussions with management and having completed other research, National Bank Financial analyst Prakash Gowd suggested in a report Friday that Labopharm may have been a \"victim\" of a moving statistical target. \u001d  \"It appears that the statistical analysis required for approval was not one that was previously requested by the FDA either at the time of regulatory filing, or as part of the SPA,\" he wrote. \"While this seems unfair to the company and to outside observers, unfortunately it is the FDA's prerogative to change its mind and to adjust its approval requirements, and is part of regulatory risk in drug development.\" \u001d  Gowd believes that the FDA is treating dropouts differently from Labopharm. Specifically, the FDA's analysis treats all dropouts as a negative outcome, which makes it harder to achieve statistical significance. Using Labopharm's methods, the dropouts can actually make a positive contribution to the analysis, he wrote. \u001d  If the FDA had a change of heart, this could help explain why Labopharm used the Formal Dispute Resolution Process in December, when it submitted a complete response to its first approvable letter. The attempt proved unsuccessful. \b \b   Encysive Has Similar FDA Problems \b \u001d  Labopharm wouldn't be the only company that feels the FDA changed the rules of the game during the game. On a recent conference call, executives of Encysive Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ENCY) complained that the FDA had \"moved the goalposts\" regarding the statistical analysis of one of its trials. Encysive had an SPA agreement with the FDA for its lung cancer drug, Thelin, which has been approved in such markets as Europe, Australia and Canada. But after three approvable letters from the FDA, the drug still hasn't been given the green light for a U.S. launch. \u001d  One biotech watcher said Labopharm has demonstrated elsewhere that the drug can get approved, as it's received the okay from 23 countries so far. But the pain division at the FDA has proven \"tough to gauge\" at times. \u001d  \"The market cap has come down pretty dramatically. That's not pricing in a lot of success for the U.S. market,\" he said. \"They'll get through. It's a question of when and what they'll need to get there,\" he said. \u001d  The stock was trading around C$7 at the end of May as investors bet U.S. approval of tramadol was coming. In Toronto Friday, the stock is at C$3, valuing the company at C$160 million. \u001d  Another biotech observer said a new trial appears highly likely at this point. \"Most analysts seem to be satisfied it's just a question of running an additional study, but there may be other scenarios which are far worse,\" the observer said. While the drug's rapid onset of action has been considered a chief strength, it could also be a negative factor if it's contributing to unwanted side effects and patient dropouts, which may have precluded the FDA from approving the drug, the observer said. \u001d  In addition, the observer said that, if another trial is performed and results still aren't good enough for the FDA, Labopharm may need to go back and rework its formulation. \"That would be the worst-case scenario,\" the observer said. \u001d  If a new trial is needed, Gowd said that would equate to a two-year delay, with a possible launch and approval pushed to the second half of 2009. \"A late 2009 launch leaves little time for (marketing partner) Purdue to launch prior to potential genericization of the once-daily tramadol market by the Ultram ER generic,\" Gowd wrote. \"It is also worth noting that Labopharm's initiation of an additional trial does not guarantee that it will be successful.\" \u001d  He rates the stock sector perform with a C$3.75 target.

NA had said it would offer EUR30 per share, or EUR777 million, for Cumerio, but also conditioned the offer on acquiring more than 80% of the share capital. \u001d  A-Tec Industries is also Norddeutsche Affinerie's largest shareholder, holding a recently purchased stake of 15.1%. \u001d  A-Tec majority shareholder and Chief Executive Mirko Kovats said Thursday in a statement that he believes Cumerio can play a major role in the consolidation of the copper industry and that A-Tec wants to be closely involved in the creation of a newly consolidated European copper conglomerate. \u001d  However, whether Kovats intends for both A-Tec and NA to be part of this conglomerate, and on what terms, are still open questions. \u001d  A-Tec is already active in the copper-industry through its subsidiary, Montanwerke Brixlegg AG, and analysts believe it's likely that Kovats will seek to merge Montanwerke Brixlegg with Cumerio, possibly with NA as a third partner. \u001d  Erste Bank analyst Guenther Artner told Dow Jones Newswires that while a combination of Cumerio and Brixlegg would make sense, the inclusion of NA would be much preferable. \"This combination would create a really big international player - it would look really good. There could be some cartel issues, but they would be surmountable,\" Artner said, adding that \"what Kovats is really planning, only he knows.\" \u001d  Artner believes Kovats is staying quiet to keep Cumerio's stock price from rising, which would work against A-Tec's consolidation plan. But he also warned that too much uncertainty will unsettle A-Tec's own investors. \u001d  According to Cumerio spokesman Vandenborre, the company's chief executive, Luc Delagaye, is ready to consider a merger of three if this should come in question. But \"we still need to know what Mr. Kovats has in mind,\" Vandenborre said. \u001d  Also waiting on Kovats is NA Chief Executive Werner Marnette. The two were to meet in Vienna on Thursday to resolve the situation, but Kovats canceled at the last minute without giving a reason. \u001d  An NA spokesman said Friday that Marnette is still hoping for a talk with Kovats to clear matters and that he has now written a letter to the A-Tec CEO asking him for a new meeting. \u001d  A-Tec spokeswoman Claudia Mueller-Stralz told Dow Jones Newswires that Kovats does intend to meet Marnette. \u001d  \"No meeting has been planned, but we are assuming that a meeting will take place. This was just not the right time,\" she said. \b \b   Company Web sites: http://www.a-tecindustries.at; http://www.norddeutsche-affinerie.de; http://www.cumerio.com \b \u001d  -By Flemming E.

At that time, he said, management referred to zoning that could allow for as much as 5,000 to 10,000 additional rental units to be constructed at existing properties in Calgary and Edmonton. Boardwalk also seemed to have its sights set on a program encompassing about 500 new rental units, which could include a development budget in the range of about C$125 million. \u001d  He said, however, that he believes Boardwalk has made recent efforts to quantify the potential excess density within the existing portfolio. He believes this could potentially include density for as much as 10,000 to 20,000 residential suites within its Calgary and Edmonton properties alone, resulting in \"much grander\" development plans than envisioned only a few months ago. \u001d  He said that the REIT's C$45-50 million loss-to-lease and new rental development potential mean that Boardwalk REIT will probably be \"one of the best real estate earnings growth stories\" in North America over the next several years. \u001d  Boardwalk, Calgary, owns and operates rental communities. \u001d  RBC has an investment-banking relationship with Boardwalk, but the analyst doesn't own units of the REIT. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.boardwalkreit.com \b \u001d  -Tara Zachariah, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2100 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:07 ET (16:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b8d74dc5d04829927cfdcf18894d5de1","symR":["UFYC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Unify to Present to Investors at the C.E.

Last weekend, BCE Inc. (BCE), the country's biggest telecommunications company, agreed to be bought out by the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan and U.S.-based Providence Equity Partners Inc. and Madison Dearborn Partners in a transaction worth C$51.7 billion, also the biggest corporate takeover in Canadian history. \u001d  Some 65% of professional managers surveyed don't think private-equity deals are creating good trading opportunities. Overall, those with bearish views outnumbered the optimistic ones by a ratio of about two to one. \u001d  But they are split right down the middle on the question of whether these deals encourage positive corporate restructuring. \u001d  By and large, survey respondents, who include fund managers, chief investment officers, investment strategists and research analysts, are just as bullish on Canadian equities as they were in the first quarter. \u001d  But their views on the bond market and the Canadian dollar have undergone a dramatic shift, reflecting strong hints of rate hikes by the Bank of Canada to curb inflationary pressures, and continued strength in the Canadian economy, Timothy Hicks, Russell Investments Canada Ltd.'s chief investment officer, writes in a report. \u001d  Optimistic About C$, Pessimistic On Bonds \u001d  Just three months ago, only one-quarter of managers were bullish about the Canadian dollar. That figure has now jumped to 50% after the currency recently scaled new 30-year highs and some economists predicted it would reach parity with the U.S. dollar, perhaps as early as the end of 2007. \u001d  The central bank is widely expected to raise its benchmark overnight rate by 25 basis points to 4.50% on July 10, after it signaled in May that increases are in the cards in the \"near term.\" The only remaining question as far as economists are concerned is how many rate hikes the Bank will deliver when it begins to tighten monetary policy again after a year-long hiatus. \u001d  The softer tone of recent economic data, capped by the unexpected stalling of the economy in April as reported by Statistics Canada June 29, led some economists to predict that the degree of tightening will be modest. \u001d  The proportion of managers who professed to be bullish about the bond market plunged to 6% from 24% in March and those in the bear camp swelled to 77% from 38%. \u001d  \"This abrupt shift was somewhat prescient, as many of the managers were surveyed prior to the sharp bond market sell-off that took place in the early days of June,\" Hicks says. \u001d  Another asset class that managers are bearish about is real estate. Higher borrowing costs together with the glut of supply and high-risk-mortgage lending problems in the U.S. led fully two-thirds of managers holding a bearish view on real estate, up from 46% previously. \u001d  Outside Canada, managers remain optimistic about EAFE (Europe, Australasia and the Far East) equities, with the proportion of those in the bullish camp up four points to 68%. This asset class remains the \"darling\" of Canadian managers even through several European central banks have either raised rates or appear poised to do so, Hicks says. \u001d  Sentiment towards U.S. equities has cooled, with the percentage who are bullish dropping to 41% from 58% and the bears up to 27% from 14%, reversing the trend from the last quarter. \u001d  Managers are a bit less optimistic about emerging market equities, probably reflecting concerns about valuations and lingering uncertainty after the sharp correction in the Chinese market in the first quarter. Some 41% are bullish, down from 49%, while the proportion of bears jumped to 47% from 29%. \u001d  Web Site: http://www.russell.com/ca \u001d  -Nirmala Menon, Dow Jones Newswires; 613-237-0668; nirmala.menon@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:00 ET (16:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bb71c5c9284470ca0db12d0a0cb1cc40","symR":["12150.FR","PEUGY","FR0000121501"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Peugeot 1H Europe Sales Holding Up Well -BNPP","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T08:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12150.FR","PEUGY","FR0000121501"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XCA4","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  0849 GMT [Dow Jones] Peugeot-Citroen's (12150.FR) first-half sales in Europe \"are holding up well,\" according to Exane BNP Paribas analyst Thierry Huon.

The withdrawal is expected to take place in the course of 2007. \u001d  To carry out the delisting, the current ADR programme in USD is to be converted from Level 3 to Level 1 for over-the-counter trading. Current holders of ADRs will be able to retain their shares or exchange them for ordinary Swisscom AG shares in Swiss francs. Swisscom will be maintaining its listing on the SWX Swiss Exchange in Zurich, with trading on the virt-x in London. \u001d  Once the programme has been modified, Swisscom will apply for the deregistration of securities in accordance with the US Securities Exchange Act using Form 15F.

Retail demand was 15 to 50 times the size of the local offering, according to Stella's listing prospectus. \u001d  Analysts said shares of Stella were trading higher than those of its larger competitor, Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd. (0551.HK). \u001d  \"The upside for the stock is very limited. It's quite expensive relative to Yue Yuen, a blue-chip shoe manufacturer,\" said Castor Pang, a strategist at Sun Hung Kai Research. \u001d  Stella is trading around 17.4 times its forecast 2007 net profit, while Yue Yuen is trading at 13.7 times. \u001d  Yue Yuen closed down 1.2% at HK$23.8 Friday. \u001d  Stella International launched its retail business last year and now has 40 stores in Thailand and China, where strong economic growth is driving retail sales. \u001d  It plans to use over half of the IPO proceeds for acquisitions of footwear and related accessories brands and businesses, and the expansion of its store network, including opening stores in Hong Kong and Macau. \u001d  It also plans to expand its manufacturing capacity in Vietnam and set up a new factory in the southern Chinese city of Huizhou. \b \u001d  -By Jonathan Li, Dow Jones Newswires; 852-2802-7002; jonathan.li@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 05:55 ET (09:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf652ca3e8308283a6df042774109b18","symR":["BVF","BVF.T","DDS.T","DDSS","ENCY","JNJ","CA09067J1093","CA5049051009","US4781601046"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.009496,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.009818,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Labopharm's FDA Troubles May Not Be All Its Doing","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BVF","BVF.T","DDS.T","DDSS","ENCY","JNJ","CA09067J1093","CA5049051009","US4781601046"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","MDV","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  (Adds information from FDA in paragraph eight.) \b \b   By Andy Georgiades \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Labopharm Inc.'s (DDSS) failure to get its once-daily formulation of painkiller tramadol approved in the U.S. by now, while frustrating for investors, may not be entirely its fault. \u001d  Labopharm has said it has submitted two positive Phase III trials to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, one of which had a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. The company described an SPA as a \"binding agreement between the FDA and the sponsor of a clinical trial stating that the study design meets the scientific and regulatory requirements of the FDA to support a new drug application.\" \u001d  When Labopharm received its second approvable letter from the FDA in late May - which led to a 50% drop in the stock price - it revealed that the agency took issue with Labopharm's analysis of missing data related to subjects that dropped out of the trials. A follow-up meeting with the FDA late last month provided few answers, except that the company finally had a clear understanding of the statistical analysis demanded by the FDA and that an additional trial could be necessary if the existing data can't satisfy those requirements. \u001d  Following discussions with management and having completed other research, National Bank Financial analyst Prakash Gowd suggested in a report Friday that Labopharm may have been a \"victim\" of a moving statistical target. \u001d  \"It appears that the statistical analysis required for approval was not one that was previously requested by the FDA either at the time of regulatory filing, or as part of the SPA,\" he wrote. \"While this seems unfair to the company and to outside observers, unfortunately it is the FDA's prerogative to change its mind and to adjust its approval requirements, and is part of regulatory risk in drug development.\" \u001d  Gowd believes that the FDA is treating dropouts differently from Labopharm. Specifically, the FDA's analysis treats all dropouts as a negative outcome, which makes it harder to achieve statistical significance. Using Labopharm's methods, the dropouts can actually make a positive contribution to the analysis, he wrote. \u001d  If the FDA had a change of heart, this could help explain why Labopharm used the Formal Dispute Resolution Process in December, when it submitted a complete response to its first approvable letter. The attempt proved unsuccessful. \u001d  An FDA spokeswoman said in an e-mail message that, in general, neither a trial's sponsor nor the agency can change a SPA agreement, except under the following circumstances: the sponsor doesn't follow the agreed protocol; the data, assumptions, and information provided by the sponsor in the SPA request are found false or to have omitted relevant facts; or a new scientific issue essential to determinining the safety and efficacy of the drug is identified later by the division director. \b \b   Encysive Has Similar FDA Problems \b \u001d  Labopharm wouldn't be the only company that feels the FDA changed the rules of the game during the game. On a recent conference call, executives of Encysive Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ENCY) complained that the FDA had \"moved the goalposts\" regarding the statistical analysis of one of its trials. Encysive had an SPA agreement with the FDA for its lung cancer drug, Thelin, which has been approved in such markets as Europe, Australia and Canada. But after three approvable letters from the FDA, the drug still hasn't been given the green light for a U.S. launch. \u001d  One biotech watcher said Labopharm has demonstrated elsewhere that the drug can get approved, as it's received the okay from 23 countries so far. But the pain division at the FDA has proven \"tough to gauge\" at times. \u001d  \"The market cap has come down pretty dramatically. That's not pricing in a lot of success for the U.S. market,\" he said. \"They'll get through. It's a question of when and what they'll need to get there,\" he said. \u001d  The stock was trading around C$7 at the end of May as investors bet U.S. approval of tramadol was coming. In Toronto Friday, the stock is at C$3, valuing the company at C$160 million. \u001d  Another biotech observer said a new trial appears highly likely at this point. \"Most analysts seem to be satisfied it's just a question of running an additional study, but there may be other scenarios which are far worse,\" the observer said. While the drug's rapid onset of action has been considered a chief strength, it could also be a negative factor if it's contributing to unwanted side effects and patient dropouts, which may have precluded the FDA from approving the drug, the observer said. \u001d  In addition, the observer said that, if another trial is performed and results still aren't good enough for the FDA, Labopharm may need to go back and rework its formulation. \"That would be the worst-case scenario,\" the observer said. \u001d  If a new trial is needed, Gowd said that would equate to a two-year delay, with a possible launch and approval pushed to the second half of 2009. \"A late 2009 launch leaves little time for (marketing partner) Purdue to launch prior to potential genericization of the once-daily tramadol market by the Ultram ER generic,\" Gowd wrote. \"It is also worth noting that Labopharm's initiation of an additional trial does not guarantee that it will be successful.\" \u001d  He rates the stock sector perform with a C$3.75 target. Gowd doesn't own Labopharm stock; his firm hasn't had an investment-banking relationship with the company in the past 12 months. \u001d  To date, only one formulation of once-daily tramadol has been approved by the FDA, and it was developed by Canada's Biovail Corp. (BVF). It's marketed by a unit of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). \u001d  Officials from Labopharm weren't immediately available to comment. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.labopharm.com \b \u001d  -Andy Georgiades, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2031; andy.georgiades@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:38 ET (20:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf843239d39fe62b0f6ad2ee9aa2fb6a","symR":["RSC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"CFO BRUGGEMAN Sells 6,800 Of REX STORES CORP >RSC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RSC"],"IndustryCodes":["HIM","RTS","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: REX STORES CORP \bSYMBOL: RSC \b \bFILER: BRUGGEMAN DOUGLAS L \bTITLE: Chief Financial Officer \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Exercise*                6,800       $5.11          $34,748 \b7/5/07             Sale                     6,800      $20.33         $138,273 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 0 (Direct) \b \b  * - Exercised 11 months, 9 days before expiration. \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

(BUD), the world's largest brewer, introduced an Indian-brewed Budweiser on Friday as part of the company's plan to tap into the country's booming economy, a top official said. \u001d  While India is one of the world's largest markets for spirits, it ranks near the bottom among beer guzzling nations. \u001d  But Anheuser-Busch sees great potential in the country. \u001d  \"India has strong and consistent economic growth,\" said Stephen J. Burrows, chief executive of Anheuser-Busch Asia-Pacific operations. \"It represents a major entry point for Anheuser-Busch.\" \u001d  Budweiser, the flagship brand of St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch, will initially be on sale only in southern and western India. \u001d  \"The first step is to get the beer established, then we will look at expansion,\" said Burrows. \u001d  India's beer industry posted 20% annual growth for the past two years, up from 10% per year over the past decade. The growth has been fueled by India's growing middle class and its huge population of young people. Roughly 60% of the nation's 1.2 billion are people under the age of 30. \u001d  \"The emerging strong middle class has historically been good for the beer industry,\" Burrows said. \u001d  The brewer announced a joint venture in February with Crown Beers India Ltd. to brew, market and distribute Budweiser and other brands in India and set up a new brewery in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad. \u001d  With a flat U.S. beer market, Anheuser-Busch has sought overseas growth. It began brewing in China in 1995 and that country's beer market pushed ahead of the U.S. in 2002 as the world's biggest. \u001d  Anheuser-Busch has a 27% share in the China brewer Tsingtao Brewery Co. (600600.SH), China's biggest brewer, and a 50% ownership in Grupo Modelo SA (GPMCY), Mexico's leading beer maker. \u001d  The company faces tough competition in India with Bangalore-based United Breweries Ltd. (507458.BY), which has a beer market share of about 45% in India, followed by London-based SABMiller SA (SBMRY) with some 36%. \u001d  The Crown Group operates businesses in India's agriculture industry through seed production and export businesses. The group also deals with industrial exports and real estate. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:56 ET (12:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bfea1649a28c677fef028639914fb496","symR":["CCL.AU","CCLAY","KO","AU000000CCL2","US1912161007"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,1.028125,1.001901,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.01875,1.010837,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Coca-Cola Amatil: Deal Expected Within 3 Months","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T05:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CCL.AU","CCLAY","KO","AU000000CCL2","US1912161007"],"IndustryCodes":["BVG","SFT","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XORD","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 01:21 ET (05:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bff726383dc0be48cbb2a0a33ccfddf9","symR":["ISLE"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": 'the isle' casino at Coventry Opens in the United Kingdom","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ISLE"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  ST.

With the appointment of Camporeale, however, the \"situation normalized,\" he said. \u001d  De Vido's comments came shortly after Metrogas said in a statement that its decision to cut the gas supply was taken in accordance with the law, amid worsening energy crunches. \u001d  Previous reports said the intervention in the company had occurred because of its breach of Argentina's so-called Supply Law, a 1974 statute that imposes penalties on companies that fail to maintain supply in certain markets. \u001d  At 3:45 p.m. Buenos Aires time (1845 GMT), Metrogas shares were down 2.65% at ARS2.184. Twenty minutes earlier, its ADRs were quoted down 5.0% at $5.89. Earlier in the day, the local shares had been down by as much as 7.4% and the ADRs by 8.4%. \b \u001d  -By Serena Saitto and Michael Casey, Dow Jones Newswires; serena.saitto@dowjone.com; 54-11-4311 3125 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:14 ET (20:14 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c060b4654bc7b65a5de22cea281d3017","symR":["1030781.FR","MF.FR","FR0000121204","FR0010307819"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: BNPP Lifts Wendel Target Price To EUR163","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1030781.FR","MF.FR","FR0000121204","FR0010307819"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","FIS","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  1140 GMT [Dow Jones] Exane BNP Paribas raises Wendel Investissement's (MF.FR) price target to EUR163 from EUR156, as the bank has recently upgraded the price target of Legrand (1030781.FR), which is part of Wendel's portfolio.

Employers in the trade sector led the hiring spree, but the beleaguered manufacturing sector shed the most jobs since February. \u001d  Employers hired a net 34,800 workers, the most since March and up from 9,300 in May, bringing total gains for the first half of the year to 196,900, or 1.2%, Statistics Canada said Friday. The market had expected 17,000 new jobs to be created. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.1%, in line with expectations. \u001d  Average hourly wages for permanent workers rose 3.2% year-on-year, up from 2.8% in May, the fastest pace since September 2006. Overall wage growth accelerated to 3.5% from 3.0%, the fastest since last August. \u001d  StatsCan said average hourly wage was up 3.2% in the second quarter over the year-ago period, speeding up from 2.4% in the first three months of 2007. \u001d  The labor force increased by 37,700 to 17,923,800 in June. The participation rate, which is the proportion of the population that is in the labor force, climbed to 67.6% from 67.5% in May. The employment rate, the share of the population aged 15 years and over that is employed, edged up to 63.5% from 63.4%. \u001d  The Canadian dollar firmed immediately after the data were issued at 7 a.m. EDT (1100 GMT). The U.S. dollar was quoted around C$1.0530, down from C$1.0560 just before the release. \u001d  The employment data are the last key figures ahead of Tuesday's interest rate decision by the Bank of Canada. The central bank in May said it was prepared to raise interest rates in the near term to curb inflationary pressures, and is widely expected to hike the benchmark overnight rate by 25 basis points to 4.50% next week. \u001d  \"...The report shores up expectations for a rate hike next Tuesday for any of those who had become week kneed on the back of the softer data that had been dribbling in over the course of June,\" HSBC Securities (Canada) market strategist Stewart Hall wrote in an e-mail report. \u001d  BMO Capital Markets deputy chief economist Doug Porter said the jobs boom hands the central bank license to hike interest rates. \u001d  \"The labor market remains drum tight, as clearly displayed by the continued low jobless rate and now some bubbling upward pressure on wages,\" Porter wrote in an e-mail report. \"Against this backdrop, the Bank of Canada appears fully primed to hike rates next week, despite the ongoing and deepening woes in manufacturing.\" \u001d  Employers filled 62,600 full-time positions, with adult women accounting for most of the increase. But 27,800 part-time jobs were shed. \u001d  Quebec led employment growth nationwide with the province's jobless rate falling to a 33-year low of 6.9% and its employment rate at an all-time high of 6.1%. The province was one of five where employment growth exceeded the national average in the first half of the year. \u001d  But job growth in Ontario, which accounts for almost 40% of total employment in Canada, was just 0.4% in the first six months dragged by losses in the manufacturing sector as exporters struggle with the impact of the strong Canadian dollar and stiff competition from Asia. Ontario Finance Minister Greg Sorbara last month urged central bank governor David Dodge not to raise interest rates. \u001d  Ontario's manufacturing sector shed 18,700 jobs in June and 50,300 in the first half of the year. Nationally, the manufacturing sector lost 31,100 jobs last month, bringing total losses in the first six months to 91,700 or 4.3%, and 103,300 over the last 12 months. \u001d  Employers in retail and wholesale trade added 30,800 workers to the payrolls last month, predominantly in Quebec. \u001d  Other notable increases were in business, building and other support services, which added 14,600 workers, mostly in Ontario and Alberta, and educational services, which filled 14,400 positions with the biggest gain in Quebec. \u001d  Employment in natural resources fell by 6,800, mostly in Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador. \u001d  Overall, the services-producing sector added 72,300 jobs but the goods-producing sector shed 37,600 in June. \u001d  After two months of strong gains, the number of self-employed rose by a more modest 11,500. StatsCan said this category has shown a strong upward trend since last October with gains totaling 174,000 or 7.0% over eight months. \u001d  Over the same period, the number of employees grew a slower 99,000 or 0.7%, with 62,000 in the private sector and 37,000 in the public sector. Industries where the number of self-employed has increased includes hotels and restaurants, schools, and finance, insurance and real estate. \u001d  By province, seasonally adjusted unemployment rates in June compared with May include: \u001d  -Newfoundland 13.1% vs 12.9%; \u001d  -Prince Edward Island 10.5% vs 10.0%; \u001d  -Nova Scotia 8.1% vs 8.0%; \u001d  -New Brunswick 6.8% vs 7.8%; \u001d  -Quebec 6.9% vs 7.2%; \u001d  -Ontario 6.5% vs 6.3%; \u001d  -Manitoba 4.6% vs 5.2%; \u001d  -Saskatchewan 4.4% vs 4.5%; \u001d  -Alberta 3.8%, unchanged; \u001d  -British Columbia 4.4% vs 4.2%. \b \u001d  Web site: http://www.statcan.ca \u001d  -Nirmala Menon, Dow Jones Newswires; 613-237-0668; .menon@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:15 ET (12:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c26d1e2c5211b87f4166c1e527e18d27","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,1.010316,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,1.032059,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Airbus Received 680 Plane Orders In 1H, Delivered 231 Jets","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XCA4","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XISL","XMDAX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--European aircraft maker Airbus said Friday it received orders for a total of 680 airplanes up until June 30, putting it ahead of arch-rival Boeing Co.

Boeing overtook Airbus during 2006 on airplane sales for the first time in a number of years, helped by strong sales of its fuel-efficient 787 and the narrow body 737 models. \u001d  The A350 is Airbus' response to the 787, which Boeing is due to roll out this weekend. However, the Airbus model isn't due to go into service until 2013. \u001d  Over the first six months, Airbus delivered 231 aircraft, compared with the 220 supplied by Boeing.

(0656.HK) raised US$1.48 billion from its Hong Kong initial public offering, after pricing the shares at the top of the indicative range, a fund manager said Friday. \u001d  The company priced the 1.25 billion shares in the IPO, accounting for 20% of its enlarged share capital, at the top of the indicative range of HK$6.98 to HK$9.23, said the fund manager, who declined to be named. \u001d  The shares are valued at 18.75 times forecast 2008 earnings, higher than Hong Kong-listed peer Citic Pacific Ltd.'s price-earnings ratio of 17.8 times. \u001d  The IPO's indicative price range had been raised from an earlier range of HK$6.48 to HK$8.68 because of heavy interest. \u001d  Analysts said the offering is attractive to investors who want exposure to China as all of Fosun International's businesses are located there. \u001d  But a recent CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets report said the conglomerate model is outdated, with listed conglomerates such as China Resources Enterprise Ltd. and Beijing Enterprises Holdings Ltd. opting to focus on core activities by shedding non-core assets. \u001d  \"At the high end of the range we see limited fundamental value as the stock will be trading at approximately net asset value,\" it said. \u001d  The company's businesses span property development, retailing, steel production and pharmaceuticals. \u001d  Fosun International is the parent of Fosun Group, which holds stakes in Hong Kong-listed developer Shanghai Forte Land Co. (2337.HK) and gold miner Zhaojin Mining Industry Co. (1818.HK). \u001d  Fosun International said in its listing prospectus that its net profit fell 25% last year to CNY1.01 billion, but that it expects earnings to rebound to CNY2.15 billion this year. \u001d  The company also said in the document it plans to use about half of the proceeds from the IPO for investments and potential acquisitions in the steel, pharmaceutical, retail and financial services industries.

The sale price represents a multiple of 1.9 x 2006 revenues. \u001d  Citigroup analysts said if the same multiple were to be applied to the total package of newspapers up for sale, the total consideration of the regional assets would fall to GBP377 million, from Citigroup's previous estimate of a total proceeds of GBP640 million. \u001d  ABN Amro said in an early research note the market would likely mark down expectations of the total disposal proceeds, which includes two other portfolios, to around GBP500 million from a previous expectation of around GBP600 million. \u001d  \"They have fallen short,\" analyst Paul Gooden said. He said ABN Amro would reiterate its sell rating on the business, on the basis that the remaining business would be more dependent on Trinity's \"troubled\" national newspapers, which include the Mirror and the People. \u001d  Lorna Tilbian, at Numis Securities, said, however, that the transaction was \"sensible for both sides\", adding that Trinity had secured a \"reasonable price.\" \u001d  Numis, which rates both companies hold, said that the acquisition was attractive for DMGT as it \"bolsters\" that company's presence in the South East, currently its smallest region, and should be earnings-enhancing. \u001d  However, the downgrade in expectations underlines falling confidence in the U.K. regional newspapers market. \u001d  The Racing Post, which in 2005 attracted a bid from a consortium including a former member of the U.K. government, Robin Cook, valuing it at GBP210 million, is expected to be sold shortly for around GBP190 million, according to press reports. Trinity Mirror has consistently declined to comment on the ongoing sale process. \u001d  Trinity in late 2006 said it planned to sell the Southern newspapers, alongside a portfolio in the English midlands including the Birmingham Evening Mail, and the Racing Post, a horse-racing specialist newspaper. \u001d  Charles Stanley stockbrokers said in a note that while the acquisitions were positive for Daily Mail & General Trust and the regional press market appeared to be stabilizing, the outlook for consumer related advertising was \"very uncertain\" due to rising U.K. interest rates and structural changes in the newspaper market - fueled by the shift of advertising budgets into the Internet - looked set to continue. \u001d  At 1017 GMT shares in Trinity Mirror were trading flat at 5.45 pence, after initially rising in early trading. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.trinitymirror.com \b \u001d  -By Jessica Hodgson, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 92 93; jessica.hodgson@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 06:33 ET (10:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c4dc7f5206980eaab7182a82b270c08b","symR":["CIPH"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Ciphergen Biosystems Announces Results of Annual Meeting","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CIPH"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  FREMONT, Calif., July 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc.

(6753.TO) said Friday it aims by March of next year to double its production capacity of microchips that let portable electronic gadgets receive digital television broadcasts. \u001d  The Osaka-based electronics maker said it will increase its capacity of the chip modules to 2 million a month. This includes production of a new chip, aimed at overseas markets, which can handle digital broadcasts in two different standards. \u001d  Electronic makers like Sharp and rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.SE) are ramping up production of such products, as digital television services aimed at mobile devices go live globally. Digital broadcasts offer better reception and pack more information into less bandwidth than traditional analog television. \u001d  Mobile digital television broadcasts began in Japan last year and reception has become a standard feature on many Japanese mobile phones, including Sharp's top-selling Aquos mobile phones, named after its popular line of liquid crystal display TVs. \u001d  A Sharp spokeswoman said the company is in talks with dozens of European mobile phone companies over its new dual-band chip, which allows one device to receive broadcasts on two competing European standards. \u001d  Sharp began shipping samples this month and will eventually have a monthly capacity of 300,000 such chips. \u001d  The company doesn't release financial data for the chips, but its electronic component division brings over half of its profit. The division had an operating profit of Y105.52 billion, or 56% of the total, last fiscal year through March, despite bringing in just 43% of revenue. \b \b   -By Jay Alabaster, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; jay.alabaster@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 04:33 ET (08:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c59c2e88bfbeb24ae1c43df390f91cc3","symR":["MEO.XE","DE0007257503"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Metro: Non-Cash Tax Expense To Occur In 3Q","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T09:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MEO.XE","DE0007257503"],"IndustryCodes":["RTB","RTS","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 05:51 ET (09:51 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c5c0f7ef3c39e8894f96e508c9323be0","symR":["CEN"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9940426],"ret5":[0.9900709],"Headline":"Ceridian (CEN) Block: 497,800 Shrs At 34.95","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CEN"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\bCERIDIAN CORP. \bLast trade  NMS: -0.13 at 34.95 on 0.05 downtick \bTrade vol:       497,800 =   83.6% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:     497,800 =   83.6% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:     642,902 =   36.8% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:         595,700 =   34.1% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol: 1,748,503 / Prev day +0.11 on 587,900 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:25 ET (14:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c5e1fdecc274b1d36d546b803c1e0496","symR":["AMGN","DJDAY","OAKF.XX","OAL.XX","TEVA","TEVA.TV","UNH","LOGSX","IL0006290147","US0311621009","US91324P1021"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9950748,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9983108,-0.00099,0.9801962,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.014046,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.058156,-0.00099,0.9996228,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"TIP SHEET: Live Oak Health Fund Cites Patience In Turnaround","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMGN","DJDAY","OAKF.XX","OAL.XX","TEVA","TEVA.TV","UNH","LOGSX","IL0006290147","US0311621009","US91324P1021"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","FIS","HEA","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","ZFU"],"Story":"\b \b   By Peter Loftus \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Patience has its ups and downs, as investors in the Live Oak Health Sciences Fund have experienced firsthand. \u001d  In 2006, it was one of the worst-performing specialty health funds, as ranked by Morningstar Inc., with negative returns of 9.3%. But so far this year, the $22 million fund is up 11.3%, according to Morningstar, compared with a category average of 6.5% through Thursday, and is among the top 10-performing specialty health funds. Over the past three years through Thursday, Morningstar shows the fund's annualized return to be 6.2%, versus 8.4% for the category average. \u001d  Portfolio manager Mark Oelschlager said he made some minor changes to the fund's holdings after a co-manager left his firm, Oak Associates Ltd. of Akron, Ohio, nearly a year ago. But for the most part, he has left the fund intact and didn't change its investment strategy. Oelschlager said he looks for shares of health-care companies that are out of favor with the broader market, and he tries not to be overly concerned with short-term performance. \u001d  \"Why have we bounced back this year? Easily, the No. 1 thing you'd point to is patience,\" said Oelschlager, who typically holds about 25 stocks across a range of market capitalizations in the fund. \"A lot of these stocks that have done well this year were not doing well last year, and they were hurting the fund. I evaluated the long-term outlook and in many cases decided to hold onto the stocks.\" \u001d  One example has been Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) of Israel, the world's largest maker of generic drugs by sales. Its shares fell nearly 28% last year amid expectations of an earnings slowdown in 2007 due to fewer opportunities to sell generic versions of popular branded drugs that lose patent protection. \u001d  But Oelschlager believed Teva's long-term prospects remained bright, and he held onto the fund's large position in Teva shares. Now, Teva shares are up about 33% year-to-date at about $41.39, as investors expect earnings growth to resume in 2008, with the company capitalizing on the expiration of patents for brand-name drugs. Also, legislation is working its way through Congress that would clear the way for generic-drug makers to sell copies of lucrative biotechnology drugs. If enacted, the legislation would open a new avenue of revenue and profit growth. \u001d  \"I thought the market was being overly concerned about one year's earnings growth rate instead of focusing on the long-term opportunity for a company like Teva,\" Oelschlager said. \"There's going to be a huge number of patent expirations in coming years.\" \u001d  Oelschlager also owns UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH), a large managed-care company. Last year, UnitedHealth shares tumbled about 14% amid scrutiny of the company's stock-option compensation practices, which led to the departure of its chief executive. The stock is off by an additional 1.9% year-to-date, recently trading at $52.72 a share. \u001d  Oelschlager said UnitedHealth and other managed-care stocks also have been hurt by investor concern that the government might make changes in Medicare that could hurt the companies' financial results. But Oelschlager believes UnitedHealth is well-positioned because it's one of the largest managed-care companies and can take market shares from smaller insurers. Also, he thinks the shares are relatively cheap at about 12 times free cash flow. \u001d  One holding that hasn't done as well as others for the Live Oak fund this year is Amgen Inc. (AMGN), the biotechnology giant whose anti-anemia drugs are under pressure due to safety concerns. The shares are off almost 20% year-to-date, trading recently at about $54.85. More bad news could be on the way if Medicare follows through on a proposal to limit reimbursement for the drugs. But Oelschlager pointed to the stock's relatively cheap valuation, trading at about 13 times estimated 2007 earnings. He said the stock might begin performing better as Amgen's experimental drug for osteoporosis gets closer to market. \u001d  (Peter Loftus covers the pharmaceutical and biotech industries for Dow Jones Newswires.) \u001d  -By Peter Loftus, Dow Jones Newswires; 215-656-8289; peter.loftus@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:00 ET (19:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c629f0625c39693643c23da8ec72269c","symR":["LNC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9902872],"ret5":[0.9733953],"Headline":": Lincoln Financial Group Announces Jon A.

Stocks in those countries may not be as cheap as they were three or four years ago, but the potential for profit still outweighs the risk and justifies the climbing price, said Do. \u001d  \"Although Asia markets are trading at or above U.S. valuation levels, we think that valuation is deserved because the Asia balance sheet is stronger than the U.S.'s, given more savings, the current account surplus, a very high foreign exchange reserve, low inflation and low interest rates,\" Do said. \"Asia growth will be sustainable for the next several years to come.\" \u001d  The Asia Pacific Fund has a three-star ranking at Morningstar Inc. and over $240 million in assets. Year-to-date, the fund has a market return of 14.5% through Tuesday, compared with a 12.2% return for its benchmark MSCI Europe,  Australasia and Far East index, according to Morningstar. Over the past three years through Tuesday, the fund has had a 37.5% market return, compared with 22.8% for the benchmark, Morningstar shows. \u001d  Asia in general is benefiting from infrastructure building in China, driving growth for companies in transportation logistics, ship building, chemicals, commodities and construction, according to Do. \u001d  \"We believe in the super-cycle growth phase of China,\" Do said. \u001d  Engineering and construction companies based in South Korea could be particularly well-positioned to benefit from China's growth. Those same companies are also seeing greater demand for their products and services in Middle Eastern countries such as Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are experiencing faster infrastructure growth for energy and construction, Do said. \u001d  Currently, the fund invests in Korea construction companies GS Engineering & Construction Corp. (LGCOF), Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. (000720.SE), and Doosan Infracore Co. Ltd. (042670.SE). \u001d  The Philippines also has benefited from the growth in East Asia and the Middle East as its overseas workers, primarily in the domestic help industry, send part of their wages to their families in the Pacific island nation, Do said. \u001d  Family members have used the cash to build small businesses, buy property, send their children to school and purchase consumer goods, he added. That has led to higher tax revenue for the government in Manila, which benefited from a budget surplus that helped the country pay down its overseas debt and lower its interest rate. \u001d  From that country, the Asia Pacific Fund is invested in Ayala Corp. (AC.PH), which has businesses in real estate, financial services, telecommunications, and water infrastructure management. \u001d  And as wealth expands across Asia, a growing consumer class will seek out fashion, staples and entertainment, Do said. \u001d  In China, the fund invests in Hengan International Group Co. Ltd. (HEGIF), which makes sanitary napkins, diapers and tissues, while real estate services and management group Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. Ltd. (GZUHF) appears poised to benefit from the increasing numbers of property owners. Hong Kong-based Ports Design Ltd. (0589.HK) is benefiting from the popularity of its clothing design. \u001d  \"We like consumer companies and think consumption growth will be the big story in the next years,\" Do said. \"Currencies and housing prices have gone up, and (Asians) feel richer and wealthier as a result.\" \u001d  -By Christopher Hinton, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5285; christopher.hinton@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c7a0a8b5eabf28f8e9e3fb90b17e3f62","symR":["CHS.LN","GCAP.LN","GB0001742393","GB0003118097"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"OFCOM Awards Derbyshire Licence To Now Digital","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CHS.LN","GCAP.LN","GB0001742393","GB0003118097"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","MOV","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Office of Communications, or Ofcom, said Friday that it has awarded Now Digital (East Midlands) the new local Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) radio multiplex licence to cover Derbyshire. \u001d  The watchdog said the licence is one of a number of new local radio multiplex licences planned to develop DAB coverage for services in those parts of the country not already served.

(Banco Continental), Peru. The outlook is stable. \u001d  \"The rating on Banco Continental reflects the bank's strong competitive position within the Peruvian financial system, a sound management team, a committed group of shareholders, and the bank's solid financial profile,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Federico Rey-Marino. The bank's financial strength is evidenced by adequate capitalization, healthy asset quality indicators, good profitability and operating efficiencies, and ample liquidity (including a lack of significant debt maturities in the next few years). These strengths are counterbalanced by the bank's exposure to Peruvian country risks, and the challenge to increase revenue diversification and maintain its market position in the context of increased competition. \u001d  \"Our rating on Banco Continental is one notch above our 'BB+' sovereign foreign currency rating on Peru. Although the bank is exposed to Peruvian country risk, we believe that it is likely to survive the economic chaos of a sovereign stress scenario because of its good liquidity, traditional stability of its deposit base, benefits from a strong retail franchise, adequate asset diversification, and very solid financial performance,\" added Mr. Rey-Marino. \u001d  We view the economic and industry environment for Peruvian banks as improving, given favorable developments in the structure of the banking industry in recent years (including the further consolidation of the banking system with the strengthening of the largest institutions). Banks' enhanced profitability levels and revenue mix and regulators' ongoing commitment to improve the quality and transparency of banking supervision have also improved the environment. However, system risks remain significant, as indicated by our Banking Industry Country Risk Assessment for Peru of '6', on the scale of 1 (least risky) to 10 (most risky). \u001d  With consolidated assets of Peruvian new soles 18.6 billion (or $5.8 billion) as of Dec. 31, 2006, Banco Continental is the second-largest universal bank and leading supplier of integrated financial services in Peru, representing approximately 25% of the local banking system's loans and deposits. It operates in a wide range of universal banking businesses, including retail, wholesale, and investment banking products and services. Holding Continental S.A., a joint venture between Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A. (AA-/Positive/A-1+) and the Peruvian conglomerate Grupo Brescia, controls the bank. \u001d  The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Banco Continental will maintain its competitive position in the Peruvian financial system, while taking advantage of its strong franchise and economies of scale to sustain its present credit metrics, despite the low interest rate environment and high competition. The ratings could be raised if the bank maintains good credit fundamentals amid continued reduction in the dollarization of Peru's financial system. On the other hand, the ratings on Banco Continental could be lowered if the economic and industry risk environment for Peruvian banks deteriorates or if the bank's liquidity position and credit standing weaken. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:39 ET (19:39 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c91cc623f1c08f06ce1d55d3ba306625","symR":["NII.T","NSATF","CA6565121002"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Norsat Announces Resignation Of Chief Fincl Officer","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NII.T","NSATF","CA6565121002"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:00 ET (11:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c9454bfae3908a92cb5b9d3797e6e407","symR":["GOL","GOLL4.BR","BRGOLLACNPR4"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9661071,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[0.9632563,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"GOL Revises Fleet Plan And Announces Preliminary Figures For 2Q07","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T10:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GOL","GOLL4.BR","BRGOLLACNPR4"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 06:00 ET (10:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c955227ad435a33157afb0ec8976f94f","symR":["TWTC","US8873191014"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"COO BLOUNT Sells 10,000 Of TIME WARNER TELECOM INC >TWTC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T21:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TWTC","US8873191014"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: TIME WARNER TELECOM INC \bSYMBOL: TWTC \b \bFILER: BLOUNT JOHN \bTITLE: Chief Operating Officer \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/6/07             Sale                    10,000      $21.14         $211,400 \b(10b5-1 Plan Indicated)* \b \bOWNERSHIP: 21,875 (Direct) \b \b  * - A 10b5-1 plan enables an insider to establish a program to make trans- \b      actions according to an advance plan.

The schedule for the flotation has been accelerated due to pressure from shareholders. \u001d  Floating 25% of Rusal would net the company around $7.5 billion, the person said. But another person added that the company hadn't yet decided on the size of the stake to be floated. \u001d  Russian IPOs have been a major driver of the London market this year as company founders have rushed to liquidate their stakes ahead of the country's presidential elections in 2008. But investors have shunned some offerings because they thought the deals were too expensive, or because they have been concerned about corporate governance standards. \u001d  Insurance company Reso-Garantia postponed its initial public offering June 21 because its owners couldn't get a sufficiently high valuation. The deal would have been the first offering from a Russian insurance company, following some major deals for Russian banks. \u001d  In an attempt to bring a higher level of disclosure, Rusal is set to conduct a primary listing of ordinary shares rather than offering global depository receipts. \u001d  Many Russian companies that have listed in London previously have opted for GDRs because the associated listing requirements are less strict. \u001d  A listing in London might be the first of several steps Rusal takes to establish itself as a major mining heavyweight in line with such companies as BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) or Rio Tinto PLC (RTP), analysts said. \u001d  The IPO will provide Rusal with \"a platform from which to embark into other commodities or geographies,\" said a mining equities analyst, who declined to be named. \u001d  \"Rusal doesn't want to be primarily a Russian-based company thereby limiting itself to an emerging market stock,\" as it wants to compete with other large mining companies such as Xstrata PLC (XTA.LN) or BHP Billiton, which hold assets in a number of regions, said the analyst. \u001d  And Rusal has \"longer term ambitions\" that may see the company diversify away from aluminum into other London Metal Exchange-traded metals over the next five years, said one of the people familiar with Rusal's IPO situation. \b \u001d   -By Lisa Yuriko Thomas, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9410; lisa.thomas@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 09:04 ET (13:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c9b448871e47f338002d5e6618483bfa","symR":["AGA.LN","GB00B1W2X453"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: AGA Sees 1H Pft +10%, FY Trading In Line","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AGA.LN","GB00B1W2X453"],"IndustryCodes":["HPD","HPR","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \b   By Daniel Fromson \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--AGA Foodservice Group PLC (AGA.LN), a maker of cookers and refrigerators for the consumer, foodservice, and bakery markets, said Friday that it expected a 10% rise in first-half pretax profit and that full-year trading would be in line with management expectations. \u001d  The group estimates profit before tax for its continuing businesses of GBP22 million for the half year to June 30, up from GBP20 million in the comparative period. The results strip out \"a small overall loss\" from Domain, the struggling home fashions business that AGA sold just over two weeks ago for GBP3.5 million. \u001d  A strong performance in consumer and foodservice operations underpinned the first-half results, while the bakery sector was slower, the company said. \u001d  \"We have leading edge products, a good geographical spread and considerable momentum within our foodservice businesses,\" said Chief Executive William McGrath. \"As was the case with our Pipe Systems businesses in the run up to their disposal in 2001 we have now created pivotal market positions for these businesses and are again looking to unlock value for shareholders.\" \u001d  AGA said the company is \"working on a plan to separate the foodservice operations from the consumer operations as it believes this can unlock value for shareholders\" - a move which may mean the sale of the foodservice business. \u001d  The company also said it intends to grow more aggressively in the future, both organically and through acquisitions. \u001d  In March, AGA reported underlying pretax profits of GBP46 million for fiscal 2006, an increase of 7.7% against the previous year. The figure stripped out a GBP5.9 million loss posted by AGA's recently divested Domain business. \u001d  At the time, Group Finance Director Shaun Smith said the company was looking at acquisitions in the food-service side of its business, with a special focus on new technologies. He said accelerated food cooking, energy efficiency and healthy eating would be key themes in AGA's future growth strategy. } \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.agafoodservice.com \b \u001d  -By Daniel Fromson, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9463; daniel.fromson@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c9cf1376bc8ec001089e78aae57cacfa","symR":["GY"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Aerojet Names Matthew Hawes Director Of Business Development For Missile Defense","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GY"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","DFN","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:14 ET (20:14 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ca2fc35041618a67325f6b310dcb9f8b","symR":["39067.AE","NL0000390672","39067.AE","CDI.LN","MARL.IC","GB0001713154","IS0000000388","NL0000390672"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Marel Consortium Rejects Bid From Candover For Dutch Stork","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T09:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["39067.AE","NL0000390672"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 05:47 ET (09:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ca6c904f8f2192dede0c973a0d37a33e","symR":["BAC","PLT.MI","IT0003826473","US0605051046"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9930824,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.013225,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Bank Of America To Face Trial In Milan Parmalat Case","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BAC","PLT.MI","IT0003826473","US0605051046"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FOD","OFP","SCR","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XMIB","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  (This item updates story published at 1115 GMT with Bank of America confirmation and comments, updated share price.) \u001d  MILAN (Dow Jones)--U.S. banking giant Bank Of America (BAC) will face trial for alleged market rigging in Milan in one of the proceedings stemming from Parmalat SpA's (PLT.MI) multibillion euro collapse in 2003, one of the first cases seeking to assign banks part of the responsibility for Europe's largest corporate failure, Bank of America said Friday confirming earlier reports. \u001d  Bank of America has been charged by Milan-based judge Cesare Tacconi with failing to have procedures in place that would have prevented alleged crimes that contributed to the Italian food company's collapse. \u001d  \"These charges against Bank of America are purely administrative in nature. They are not criminal charges,\" the bank said in an emailed statement. Bank of America also said it believes that \"the evidence will show that the charges against the bank are completely unfounded\" noting it believed it had in place all appropriate governance policies and procedures. \u001d  Bank of America said in the statement \"it had no knowledge of the fraud perpetrated by Parmalat and its senior management.\" \u001d     In June, the same Milan court ordered four other international banks - Citigroup Inc. (C), UBS AG (UBS), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK.XE) and Morgan Stanley (MS) - to face trial. \u001d  The trial is scheduled to start Jan. 23 in Milan, in one of several legal cases tied to Parmalat's collapse. \u001d  If convicted, the banks could potentially be barred from operating in Italy and could have profits seized. \u001d  A conviction would also allow more than 40,000 bondholders, who have joined the Milan case as civil parties, to seek millions of dollars in damages on top of the provisions for restitution contained in the charge against the banks themselves. \u001d  Shares of Parmalat resumed trading on the Italian stock exchange in October 2005. At 1100 GMT, shares were unchanged at EUR2.97, in an overall positive market. \u001d  -By Alessandro Mocenni with MF-Dow Jones and Sabrina Cohen, Dow Jones Newswires; +39 02 5821 9906; sabrina.cohen@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:09 ET (12:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ca8bd76fd7a1dfb7300be417af360cb6","symR":["NWA","US6672801015"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Northwest Air Closes Sale Of All Unsecured Claims Negotiated","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NWA","US6672801015"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:09 ET (14:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ca99c45a0c46e1315c6c49c2b821b4d2","symR":["JNJ","OMRI","US4781601046"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.009496,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.009818,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Omrix Expects To Ship Substantial Evicel Quantities To J&J","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JNJ","OMRI","US4781601046"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","MDV","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:33 ET (11:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"cabe2a59afb85d5845832e4a5093069f","symR":["MPI.LN","GB0030232317"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Evolution Raises Michael Page Target Price","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T10:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MPI.LN","GB0030232317"],"IndustryCodes":["EAG","SVC","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  1005 GMT [Dow Jones] Evolution increases Michael Page (MPI.LN) target price to 680p from 635p, and maintains its buy rating following the company's trading update. \"Michael Page is grabbing the opportunity to grow organically, offered by its supply constrained markets.

(CME). \b \u001d  As previously announced, CBOT Holdings has declared a one-time, conditional special cash dividend in the amount of $9.14 per share.  The payment of such dividend will be conditioned upon, and such dividend shall only become payable upon, the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the proposed merger between CBOT Holdings and CME set forth in their merger agreement.  CBOT Holdings will pay the dividend immediately prior to the closing of the merger. \b \u001d  Although July 5, 2007 was set as the record date for the special dividend, CBOT Holdings has been advised by the NYSE that, since the payment of the special dividend is conditional, the NYSE will not establish an \"ex-dividend\" date.  As a result, stockholders that sell their shares of CBOT Holdings Class A common stock on the NYSE prior to the completion of the merger with CME will lose the benefit of the special dividend.  Holders of CBOT Holdings Class A common stock must hold the stock at the close of trading on the date of the closing of the merger with CME in order to receive the benefit of the special dividend. \b \u001d  Stockholders are encouraged to consult with their brokers or financial advisors for more information regarding these procedures. \b \b    About the CBOT \b \u001d  As one of the leading global derivative exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade provides a diverse mix of financial, equity and commodity futures and options-on-futures products.

(BOT), Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME) has changed the minds of some CBOT shareholders who had been against the deal. \u001d  Early Friday, CME again raised its bid for CBOT in an effort to secure approval from shareholders who will vote on the deal Monday. Caledonia Investments, CBOT's largest shareholder with a 6.5% stake according to Thomson Financial, responded by shifting gears and saying it now supports the CME/CBOT combination. \u001d  Other CBOT shareholders also said Friday they will now support the merger with CME, which would create the world's largest derivatives exchange. A number of CBOT stakeholders had felt that CME's prior offers didn't represent fair value, especially since Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) has consistently offered more in a competing bid to buy CBOT. \u001d  Ray Cahnman, a former CBOT board member and owner of several CBOT memberships, said Friday that when CBOT Chief Executive Bernard Dan called him following the announcement of CME's new offer, Cahnman told him, \"I'm changing my vote.\" Cahnman earlier had voted against the CME/CBOT merger. \u001d  \"It's a no-brainer right now,\" Cahnman said. \"I think it's going to pass by a substantial majority.\" \u001d  Brian Hynes, an associate CBOT member who holds about 10,000 shares, said he also plans to vote for the deal, after voting against it earlier. Richard Friedman, a full CBOT member with more than 27,000 shares, said he's likely to switch to a supporting vote later Friday. \u001d  The revised CME offer now stands to provide CBOT shareholders with 0.375 share of CME stock for each CBOT share. That compares with 0.35 share in CME's most recent offer, and 0.3006 share as part of its original proposal, announced last October. Friday's announcement represented the third revision from CME amid the bidding war with ICE. CME said that this is its final revision and that it won't change again. \u001d  Shares of CBOT were recently up 5.7% at $218, after hitting a record high of $218.29. \u001d  Shares of CME were down 0.2% at $554.54, while ICE shares were up 1.9% at $154.73. Based on recent share prices, ICE's $11.6 billion bid is valued slightly higher than CME's $11.4 billion offer. \u001d  CME officials expressed confidence Friday that they'll have enough support from CBOT shareholders to close the deal, which has been approved by regulators. In an interview Friday, CME Chairman Terrence Duffy said he, along with CME Chief Executive Craig Donohue, has received numerous phone calls from CBOT shareholders who had vocally opposed the transaction, but are now \"very supportive.\" \u001d  Donohue added that he was receiving emails - during the interview - from CBOT stakeholders who said they supported the deal, including one holder who was hoping for more but still planned to back CME and CBOT. \u001d  Some other CBOT shareholders interviewed Friday were also looking for a bigger boost from CME, including Lawrence Dorf, a full CBOT member with more than 27,000 shares. He still plans to reject CME's offer and noted that many shareholders are \"still angry\" that CME didn't raise the share-exchange part of its offer to 0.40. \u001d  Leonard Goldstein, on the other hand, who owns several partial memberships at CBOT and roughly 20,000 shares, said he could not imagine \"how anyone would be against this deal\" given the CME's latest revision. Goldstein added that he felt CME would not have garnered enough votes with its prior offer. \u001d  An ICE spokeswoman wasn't available for immediate comment Friday on CME's revised offer. The primarily electronic energy exchange has been soliciting votes against the CME deal via proxy materials sent to CBOT shareholders. \u001d  Earlier this week, ICE said it would consider enhancing parts of its merger proposal, including the value assigned to CBOT holders' exercise rights at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. However, the CBOT board said it still felt its existing agreement with CME was the superior deal. \u001d  -By Jesse Thomas, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4117; Jesse.Thomas@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:31 ET (17:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"cc01869f3a739869906c2e62453556ac","symR":["SCM","SCMN.VX","CH0008742519"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.018737,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.039781,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Swisscom To Withdraw From NY Stock Exchange","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T05:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SCM","SCMN.VX","CH0008742519"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XSMI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 01:31 ET (05:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"cc7f15d4d9edb85e2aa5646d608f8ba4","symR":["TMWD"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Tumbleweed Enters India, China and Australia With Premier Channel Alliances","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TMWD"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b      Premiere Channel Partners Facilitate Adoption of Messaging \u001d     Security Products, Add Hundreds of Sales Representatives in \u001d                         Asia-Pacific Region \bREDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \u001d  Tumbleweed(R) Communications Corp.

Rowe Price Latin America fund (PRLAX), sat in a black leather chair at the front of a large meeting room waiting to participate in an emerging markets panel discussion at the annual Morningstar investment conference. \u001d  Despite the start time, the room was packed with more than 150 curious financial professionals. With good reason: Over the last three years Pangaro's fund has averaged an annual return of 63%, and a lot of money - probably some managed by the folks staring at him - has flooded into it. When Pangaro took over T. Rowe Price Latin America in 2004 it held around $250 million. There's now $3.2 billion in its coffers. \u001d  It's been six months since we last wroteabout funds like T. Rowe Price Latin America and other emerging market offerings that focus on developing parts of the world. But in that short time period the thinking on them has changed. Back then many advisors were comfortable building small positions in these risky products. That's not such a no-brainer anymore. Indeed, last week international and emerging markets panels were some of the most widely attended at Morningstar. The question on everyone's mind: Will the high-flying returns of this category continue? The answer: Probably not. Regardless, we still recommend that 5% of your international holdings be devoted to emerging markets. It's how you get that exposure going forward that's the key. Hence the reason we focus in on this category once again. \u001d  The cycle in emerging markets tends to last about five years. This particular rally is nearing year four. What has many experts perplexed, though, is the resilience this category has despite seemingly being near the end of its run. Indeed, even after enduring an abrupt downturn in the first quarter of this year (and one in the spring of 2006) emerging-market funds returned 16.9% in the first half of 2007, trailing only the foreign offerings that specialize in Latin America, China and parts of Asia outside of Japan. \u001d  Emerging-markets funds have benefited from growing economies around the world, good earnings at the companies that call those areas home, low inflation, the falling dollar and high commodity prices. (Many developing economies are heavily influenced by the price of oil, for example.) The stock markets in many parts of the world have also become transparent, with publicly traded companies following U.S. accounting standards and issuing all kinds of financial documents that analysts here in the States can study. \u001d  There are some concerns on the horizon, though, like rising interest rates, softening oil prices and the subprime mortgage crisis that started here in the U.S. spreading to other parts of the world. Political turmoil is always a protest away. And while emerging economies continue to grow at a clip far ahead of the U.S., there are signs some of their most popular stocks might not have much more room to go. Indeed, the shares of America Movil (AMX), a cellphone outfit in Mexico that shows up in many portfolios, have jumped over 50% this year and now trade at $65 a share, near a 52-week high. \u001d  \"Emerging markets are looking expensive,\" says Shigeki Makino, manager of Putnam Global Equity (PEQUX). Instead Makino prefers to find companies that do business in those countries in addition to other regions. \u001d  Regardless of whether you fall into the bull camp or the bear camp on emerging markets, that fuzzy picture leaves many experts thinking the same thing: This is the time for a seasoned stock picker. That thinking - paying an annual fee and using a manager - breaks away from some of the sentiments we heard earlier this year. We've always thought that because of the inefficiencies of the global market place the best bet when investing there was to give your money to a manager who could exploit those pitfalls to his advantage. In other words, if he had two feet on the ground he could uncover companies nobody else was paying attention to. However, the advent of the exchange-traded-fund industry changed all that for many advisors. \u001d  For example, after just two short years on the market Vanguard's Emerging Markets Stock ETF (VWO) has attracted $17 billion. The iShares country-specific funds have also become a powerful tool for advisors who are trying to avoid single-stock risk in their portfolios. We still like the Vanguard ETF, especially in combination with the iShares EAFE Index ETF (EFA), a product that tracks stocks in Europe, Australasia and parts of the Far East. However, index funds won't take profits off the table for you when a stock pops, and we think a novice that jumps in and out of country funds is just setting himself up for a big disappointment. \"You need somebody with prudence who is picking his spots,\" says Michael Breen, a senior analyst at Morningstar who moderated the panel Pangaro sat on. \"You can't expect this gravy train to keep going forever.\" \u001d  If, indeed, emerging markets are becoming harder to read you may want to pull back, take some profits, and put your new money earmarked for international in a more diversified, actively managed offering that invests a smaller portion of its portfolio in emerging markets or uses regional companies as a back door to these areas. We favor funds like Fidelity International Discovery (FIGRX), Polaris Global Value (PGVFX) and Oakmark International (OAKGX). Those funds have some common traits: low fees, long-term track records and management teams that have been around the globe a time or two. \u001d  If you don't get sick to your stomach over up-and-down returns, then consider T. Rowe Price Latin America - a part of the world coming into its own - Fidelity Emerging Markets (FEMKX) or Matthews China (MCHFX). The Matthews fund has had a great ride lately, returning 28% over the last five years, nine percentage points ahead of its benchmark. And even though one of its managers, Mark Headley, thinks many Chinese stocks are fully priced, we still like it because the firm has been investing in that part of the world for longer than most of its competitors, a comfort to us over the long term. \"If you have a 10-year focus [China] is low risk,\" said Headley, who also participated in the Morningstar panel. \"But if it's only 12 months it is extremely risky.\" \u001d  For more information and analysis of companies and mutual funds, visit SmartMoney.com at http://www.smartmoney.com/ \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:32 ET (11:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"cd2aee780db773b3d1253ba46155ecf7","symR":["EIL1.DB","IE00B1CMPN86"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Aer Lingus: 2006 Significant Year","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EIL1.DB","IE00B1CMPN86"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:19 ET (11:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"cdc1b6bd37a07967ad90b25dae6892c0","symR":["CADAY"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Canada News Highlights:Pacific North West Plans Pvt Placements","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CADAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b \b                      Latest News \bPacific North West Plans 2 Non-Brokered Pvt Placements>PFN.T \bGryphon Gold To Buy Nevada Eagle Resources LLC >GGN.T \bKatanga: Central African Mining Plans Bid For Co. >KAT.T \bTembec Curtails Production At Huntsville, Ont.

Receives Nasdaq Notification","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RVEP"],"IndustryCodes":["PIP","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \u001d  Rio Vista Energy Partners L.P. (\"Rio Vista\") (NASDAQ: RVEP), an energy services master limited partnership, announced today that the Company received, on July 2, 2007, an acknowledgment (the \"Acknowledgment\") from the Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq\") regarding Rio Vista's notification to Nasdaq dated June 18, 2007 of a vacancy on the audit committee of the board of managers of Rio Vista GP LLC (the \"General Partner\"), the general partner of Rio Vista. This vacancy arose on June 15, 2007. Nasdaq Rules 4360(d) and 4350(d)(2)(A) require the General Partner to have an audit committee of at least three members. The General Partner currently has two members of its audit committee. As set forth in the Acknowledgment, pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 4350(d)(4)(B), Rio Vista has until June 15, 2008 to regain compliance with Nasdaq's audit committee requirements. The General Partner intends to fill the vacancy on the audit committee on the earliest practicable date. \b \b   About Rio Vista Energy Partners L.P. \b \u001d  Rio Vista is an energy services master limited partnership that owns certain liquefied petroleum gas assets, including pipelines running from a terminal facility in Brownsville, Texas owned by TransMontaigne Product Services, Inc. (\"TransMontaigne\") to a terminal facility in Matamoros, Mexico owned by Rio Vista. Pursuant to an LPG Transportation Agreement with TransMontaigne, Rio Vista uses its assets to transport LPG exclusively for TransMontaigne on a fee-for-services basis. Rio Vista seeks to grow through the acquisition of qualified oil and gas assets and other assets. All of Rio Vista's common units were distributed to the stockholders of Penn Octane Corporation (\"Penn Octane\") on September 30, 2004. \b \b   Forward-Looking Statements \b \u001d  Certain of the statements in this news release are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the intention of the General Partner of Rio Vista to fill a vacancy on the audit committee of the General Partner, the prospects for the LPG transportation business and the possible acquisition of qualified oil and gas assets and other assets. Although these statements reflect Rio Vista's beliefs, they are subject to uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Rio Vista may experience unanticipated difficulty in attracting qualified candidates to serve on the board of managers and audit committee of its General Partner. If Rio Vista is not able to obtain adequate financing and does not receive sufficient revenues from the use of its retained LPG assets, Rio Vista would suffer material adverse consequences to its business and will not have sufficient available cash to pay minimum quarterly distributions. If Rio Vista does not have sufficient capital resources for acquisitions or opportunities for expansion, Rio Vista's growth will be limited. Rio Vista may be unable to complete future acquisitions of qualified oil and gas assets or other transactions and, even if completed, acquisitions may not prove successful. The tax consequences of ownership of common units are dependent on the specific tax circumstances of each unitholder, and Rio Vista may not distribute sufficient cash to meet the tax obligations of unitholders. Additional information regarding risks affecting Rio Vista's business may be found in Rio Vista's registration statement on Form 10 and its reports on Form 8-K, Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and Penn Octane's reports on Form 8-K, Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \b \b    CONTACT: Rio Vista Energy Partners L.P. \b             Ian T.

Prepackaged plans usually are approved by creditors before they're filed with the court. But the federal official responsible for monitoring the case contends InSight changed the plan after the votes were in. \u001d  Kelly Beaudin Stapleton, the U.S. Trustee, said those changes hurt the interests of InSight's shareholders and subordinated debtholders. \u001d  Shareholders would get only 10% of the reorganized company, instead of the 13% they were originally promised. Subordinated debtholders would see their stake diluted by the addition of $15 million in new debt, although that loss would be offset by an increased equity stake in the company. \u001d  But a group of subordinated debtholders - mainly hedge funds - said in court papers Thursday they don't mind the changes and asked a judge to confirm the Chapter 11 plan. \u001d  InSight and its creditors \"have traveled a long and difficult road to achieve the settlement incorporated in the prepackaged plan,\" the debtholders said. \u001d  The debtholders group, as of early June, included Aslan Advisors LP, Catalyst Investment Management Co. LLC, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. of New York; Guardian Capital LP of Toronto, Morgan Asset Management Inc. of Memphis, Tenn. and Tejas Securities Group Inc. of Austin, Texas. \u001d  Under the revised plan, holders of $194.5 million worth of senior subordinated debt will get 90% of InSight once it's out of bankruptcy -- up from 87% under the original plan. In court papers filed Thursday, the debtholders group say they own the majority of the debt and support InSight's changed plan. \u001d  Trading in InSight's subordinated debt indicates investors are optimistic about prospects for a successful reorganization. Since the start of the year, InSight's 9 7/8% notes due 2011 have gained as much as 15 points. The high point came May 29, the day Insight filed for bankruptcy with its pre-packaged plan in hand. The senior subordinated notes traded recently around 36 cents on the dollar, up from 25 cents on the dollar in January. \u001d  Hedge funds that gain control of companies in Chapter 11 often do so by swapping debt purchased at a discount for equity. Their profit comes when a reorganized company is sold, usually not long after it's out of Chapter 11. \u001d  InSight, based in Lake Forest, Calif., provides diagnostic imaging services. The company's lawyers say that a delay in getting confirmation could hurt the business. Important government contracts are up for renewal, but officials have told InSight they're puting the contracts on hold to await the outcome of the restructuring. \u001d  The changes that triggered an objection from the U.S. Trustee were made after Insight collected votes on its original plan, but before its May 29 bankruptcy filing. \u001d  Insight piled on $15 million in additional debt, and reshuffled equity so the hedge fund holders of subordinated notes would get 3% more than they were getting in the original plan. The extra 3% would come at the expense of Insight's common shareholders, J.W. Childs Associates Inc. and the Halifax Group LLC. \u001d  -By Peg Brickley, Dow Jones Newswires; 302-521-2266; peg.brickley@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:10 ET (16:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d050a34cc14388d585502f92311a65e5","symR":["SPY"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.000131],"ret5":[1.01157],"Headline":"SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) Block: 83,900 Shrs At 152.54","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T14:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SPY"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\bSPDR S&P 500 ETF \bLast trade  PSE: +0.36 at 152.54 on zero tick \bTrade vol:        83,900 =    0.3% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   3,348,300 =   13.9% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:  32,225,600 =   26.2% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:      24,095,660 =   19.6% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:122,936,17 / Prev day -0.16 on 89,278,640 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:31 ET (14:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d08548b350a0bd6720268796c57a709a","symR":["IWM"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.011085],"ret5":[0.9972877],"Headline":"iShrRu2000 (IWM) Block: 680,000 Shrs At 84.38","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IWM"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\bISHARES TRUST RUSSELL 2000 INDEX FUND \bLast trade CHIC: -0.09 at 84.38 on 0.25 downtick \bTrade vol:       680,000 =    4.9% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:   2,406,000 =   17.4% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:  19,733,336 =   27.9% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:      13,788,245 =   19.5% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:70,785,728 / Prev day +0.11 on 47,328,804 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:07 ET (15:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d0c0f10e7737872f55ca797f47dd5b33","symR":["SAI"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"SAIC Signs Pact To Buy Benham Investment Holdings, LLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SAI"],"IndustryCodes":["TSX","XDJGI","XNYA","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:50 ET (11:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d10118e44b0d2992977d7a9eb471d69b","symR":["FITB"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.992016],"ret5":[1.014222],"Headline":": Walgreen Co.

(TWRAQ), Collins & Aikman Corp. (CKCRQ) and Federal-Mogul Corp. (FDMLQ). \u001d  The milestone will be particularly sweet for Federal-Mogul, which has been stuck in Chapter 11 since October 2001, the longest of three suppliers. \b \b   Monday \b \u001d  Unlike other auto-parts makers that were driven into bankruptcy because of cutbacks by the U.S. auto industry, Federal-Mogul was staring at billions of dollars in asbestos-related personal injury claims when it filed for Chapter 11. \u001d  Under its reorganization plan, the Southfield, Mich., company will emerge from Chapter 11 under the control of billionaire investor Carl Icahn. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., will resume its hearing on the proposal on Monday. \u001d  Icahn, who has also made a buyout offer for auto-parts maker Lear Corp. (LEA), is Federal-Mogul's largest commercial creditor. The plan calls for splitting ownership of the company between asbestos creditors and commercial creditors. Icahn would then buy out the asbestos creditors once the company emerges from Chapter 11. The asbestos claims will be covered by a trust and pushed off the company's balance sheet. \u001d  Also Monday, Collins & Aikman will be in the Detroit bankruptcy court to ask for approval of its plan, which comes more than two years after filing for Chapter 11 protection. Collins is selling its assets and winding down the business, abandoning any attempt to emerge as a stand-alone company. \u001d  It has been in the process of selling its plants, and in June won court approval to its sell soft-trim business to Wilbur Ross' International Automotive Components Group North America Inc. for $126.2 million. \b \b   Wednesday \b \u001d  Tower Automotive, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in February 2005, will be in court to get approval for its plan. It has a deal with private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which has offered $1 billion for Tower's assets. \u001d  Cerberus has become a major restructuring player in the auto industry. The company may help finance auto-parts maker Delphi Corp.'s (DPHIQ) exit from bankruptcy, and earlier this year it reached a deal to purchase an 80.1% stake in the Chrysler Group for more than $7 billion. \u001d  Tower finally struck a final deal with Cerberus, but it was also talking to a group of hedge funds about financing its exit from bankruptcy. Now those funds - Stark Investments LP, Strategic Value Partners LLC and Wayzata Investment Partners LLC - are demanding $2 million in fees and expenses from Tower. \u001d  The funds say Tower promised to pay those fees as they negotiated a possible investment. The Manhattan bankruptcy court will consider their request on Wednesday, the same day as the plan confirmation hearing. \u001d  Tower's plan calls for the company to use the sale proceeds to pay off its secured debt, including $154.2 million owed to second-lien lenders. \u001d  But unsecured creditors and a group of noteholders are poised to recover virtually nothing - less than 0.1% on their claims. \b \b   Tuesday \b \u001d  Chemical company Solutia Inc. (SOLUQ) will be in the Manhattan bankruptcy court for a hearing on its disclosure statement, a key document that outlines how creditors in a Chapter 11 case will be paid when the company emerges from bankruptcy protection. \u001d  Solutia, based in St. Louis, filed for Chapter 11 2003. It is proposing that unsecured creditors and bondholders, owed about $800 million, will be paid about 85 cents on the dollar for their claims. Solutia's unsecured creditors, bondholders and former parent Monsanto Co. (MON) will also receive shares in the reorganized company. \u001d  Once the court approves the disclosure statement, the creditors can vote on the plan. After the vote, the bankruptcy court will hold a plan confirmation hearing. \u001d  (This item appears in Dow Jones' Daily Bankruptcy Review newsletter.) \u001d  -David McLaughlin; Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-3542; david.mclaughlin@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:50 ET (16:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d1467f973e3545dd1a0b1e6c6ead32a8","symR":["KAT.T","BMG5221G1096"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Katanga: Central African Mining Plans To Make Formal Bid For Co.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KAT.T","BMG5221G1096"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM--(CCNMatthews - July 6, 2007) - The Board of Katanga Mining Limited (TSX:KAT) (\"Katanga\" or the \"Company\") announced today that it has been advised by Central African Mining & Exploration Company plc (\"CAMEC\") that it intends to make a formal take-over bid for all of Katanga's outstanding common shares.

(MSFT), Healthways Inc. (HWAY) and Parametric Technology Corp. (PMTC). \b \u001d  After Thursday's closing bell, Microsoft Corp. ($29.99, -$0.03, -0.10%) said it will take a charge of up to $1.15 billion, due to an expanded warranty program for what it called an \"unacceptable\" number of repairs required for its Xbox video-game system. \b \u001d  Applied Micro Circuit Corp. (AMCC, $2.44, -$0.02, -0.81%) cut its fiscal first-quarter revenue estimate to $50 million from $59.6 million, citing a weak telecommunications market, lower processor sales from product delays and continued inventory corrections. The Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of networking equipment chips said revenue for the quarter ended June 30 fell in all business lines except in its storage unit. Applied Micro said it now expects second-quarter revenue to be $55 million to $60 million and sees continued growth through the remainder of the fiscal year ending March 31. \b \u001d  Healthways Inc. ($49.64, $1.04, 2.14%) reported fiscal third-quarter net earnings of $10.8 million, or 29 cents a share, up 15.6% from $9.34 million, or 26 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial were expecting, on average, a per-share profit of 29 cents. Healthways cut it fiscal 2007 earnings forecast to a range of $1.21 to $1.22 a share from its previous view of $1.44 to $1.61 share, and cut its revenue outlook to a range of $618 million to $630 million from its earlier forecast of $640 million to $659 million. \b \u001d  Hilton Hotels Corp. (HLT, $45.39, $9.34, 25.91%) was downgraded by several banks, including Bear Stearns and Citigroup, most citing the unlikelihood of a rival bid. \b \u001d  Interactive Brokers Group Inc. (IBKR, $27.11, -$0.12, -0.44%) said it expects to report second-quarter net income of $153 million to $163 million. The Greenwich, Conn., electronic marketplace operator puts pro forma earnings at 26 cents to 28 cents a share for the quarter ended June 30, compared with earnings of 24 cents a share in the prior-year period. Interactive Brokers projects net revenue of $281 million to $299 million, compared with $291 million a year earlier. Excluding certain items, the company expects adjusted pro forma earnings of 32 cents a share to 34 cents a share and adjusted net income of $175 million to $185 million. \b \u001d  Longs Drug Stores Corp.'s (LDG, $53.40, $0.23, 0.43%) preliminary June retail drugstore sales from continuing operations rose 3.5% to $464 million from $448 million a year earlier. Same-store sales at the Walnut Creek, Calif., chain rose 1.3%, reflecting a 1.5% increase in pharmacy and a 1.1% increase in front-end sales. \b \u001d  Motorola Inc. (MOT, $17.80, -$0.08, -0.45%) said in a regulatory filing it will take a $101 million charge in its recently completed second quarter. The charge is related to cost-cutting initiatives that involve laying off 7,500 workers at the wireless-device maker. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the cost-reduction program has affected about 2,100 workers in the second quarter. The company said all three of its business segments have been affected by the actions. \b \u001d  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM, $39.58, $0.05, 0.13%) said it's eliminating its entire 1.85 million-ounce gold hedge position and plans to discontinue its merchant banking segment. The Denver based gold producer said that during June it spent $578 million to eliminate its entire price-capped forward sales contracts, and it will report a pre-tax loss of roughly $531 million on the early settlement of the contracts, after a $47 million reversal of previously recognized deferred revenue. In addition, as a result of its decision to discontinue its merchant banking segment, Newmont said it will take a non-cash impairment charge of roughly $1.7 billion in the second quarter. The company said it is considering alternatives for the unit, including a possible sale or initial public offering. \b \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:18 ET (12:18 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d18aafb0d2a43a1d0f6b4124342229a5","symR":["PAWEF","PFN.T","CA6949161070"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Pacific North West To Issue 4.3M Stk-Wt Units At C$0.70 Each","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PAWEF","PFN.T","CA6949161070"],"IndustryCodes":["PCS","PPM"],"Story":"\u001d  VANCOUVER, July 6 /CNW/ - Pacific North West Capital Corp.

The foregoing is subject to regulatory approval. \b \bAbout Pacific North West Capital Corp. \b \bPacific North West Capital Corp. (TSX.PFN OTCBB.PAWEF Frankfurt.P7J) is a North American industry leader in the search for Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) and Nickel. \b \bManagement's corporate philosophy is to be Project Generator, Explorer and Project Operator with the objective of option/joint venturing projects with major mining companies through to production. To that end, Pacific North West Capital's current option/joint ventures agreements are with Anglo Platinum, Stillwater Mining Company, Xstrata Nickel and Soquem. \b \bThe company has approximately $8 million in working capital and securities. \b \bIn late 2004 PFN established a Nickel Division that is expanding and to date has an Option/Joint Venture in the Timmins Mining District with Xstrata. An extensive geophysical and ground proofing exploration program has been completed. PFN has expended approximately $1.69 million on the project to date. In May, a diamond drill program commenced to evaluate EM conductors to depths of 200 meters south of the Montcalm Mine claims, Timmins, Ontario. The targets are within the strike extension of the interpreted mine stratigraphy of the Montcalm Intrusive Complex (MIC). The program was expanded to 4000 meters in June 2007. \b \bStillwater Mining Company (NYSE: SWC), the largest producer of palladium and platinum in the Western hemisphere, recently purchased an initial 11% of PFN and has followed its position in two recent financings and currently has approximately 10% of the PFN. \b \bPFN and Stillwater have entered into a non-binding Letter Agreement pertaining to ongoing exploration of the Goodnews Bay Platinum Project. The Letter Agreement also provides for Stillwater to fund reconnaissance on other Alaskan PFN exploration projects with the provision for Stillwater to enter into an option/joint venture agreements on the Goodnews Bay Project and 1 or more of the reconnaissance projects in Alaska. \b \bUnder the terms of the Letter Agreement, Stillwater will spend $4 million to earn 50% of GBPP by December 31, 2010. Stillwater may elect to increase its interest to 60% by incurring an additional $8 million in exploration expenditures within an additional two year period or upon completion of a Feasibility Study, whichever occurs first. Stillwater may increase its interest to 65% by arranging for 100% of the project financing required to place the Property into Commercial Production within an additional three years. \b \bUnder the Reconnaissance portion of the Letter Agreement, Stillwater will expend $500,000 in 2007 which will allow it to inspect several of PFN's proposed projects. In event Stillwater elects to continue participating in one or more projects, they will automatically be able to enter into one or more agreements identical to the Goodnews Bay. Pacific North West Capital is the project operator. \b \bIn addition, PFN is exploring the River Valley Project, located near Sudbury, Ontario, joint ventured 50/50 with Anglo Platinum Limited (\"Anglo Platinum\"), the world's largest primary producer of platinum. Anglo Platinum has committed over $19 million to the River Valley Project to date and may earn a 60% interest in the project by completing a feasibility study and a 65% interest by funding it through to production. \b \bCurrent measured resource is 8.53 million tonnes containing 353,200 ounces of palladium (1.29 g/t), 116,800 ounces of platinum (0.43 g/t) and 20,400 ounces of gold (0.07 g/t) and an indicated resources of 22.02 million tonnes containing 600,700 ounces of palladium (0.85 g/t), 212,800 ounces of platinum (0.30 g/t) and 39,000 ounces of gold (0.06 g/t) with an additional inferred resource of 2.39 million tonnes containing 67,000 ounces of palladium (0.87g/t), 23,800 ounces of platinum (0.31g/t) and 4,000 ounces of gold (0.05 g/t) using a 0.7 g/t cut off (pt/pd) (PFN press release March 22, 2007). The objective of the 2006 $1.1 million Phase 9A budget was to extend the new Platinum Group Metal mineralized horizons discovered during the 2005 fieldwork and to better understand the structural controls on the mineralization. Management recently presented Anglo Platinum with the 2008 work program and budget. \b \bIn 2006, PFN signed a Cooperation Agreement with SOQUEM Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale de Financement du Qu&#233;bec (\"SGF\"), mandated to put new mines into production. Under the terms of the Agreement, PFN and SOQUEM are participating in a 50/50 joint venture with the objective of identifying viable PGM and base metal properties for further exploration.

The current rate of the distribution roughly corresponds to the Fund's projected performance. However, you should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate or from the terms of the Fund's level distribution policy. Moreover, the Funds' investment distribution rate should not be confused with pure income or yield. The level monthly distribution rate may be modified by the Board of Directors from time to time. \b \u001d  It is anticipated that a portion of the aggregate distributions made by the Funds may constitute a return of capital. In addition, it is anticipated that any realized capital gains for a Fund's fiscal year will be paid to shareholders in a separate distribution at the end of such year. If the total distributions made in any calendar year exceed investment company taxable income, net tax-exempt income and net capital gain, such excess distributed amount would be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent of each Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits. Distributions in excess of the earnings and profits would first be a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the adjusted tax basis in the shares. After such adjusted tax basis is reduced to zero, the distribution would constitute capital gain (assuming the shares are held as capital assets). A return of capital is not reflective of the Funds' investment performance and should not be confused with income or yield. \b \u001d  Estimated information on the Funds' net investment income and other distribution information for each monthly period and the preceding three monthly periods will be available on the Funds' website (www.cef.dws.scudder.com) no later than the end of each month. The level monthly distribution described above would result in the payment of approximately the same amount to the Funds' common shareholders each month. Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"), and Rule 19a-1 thereunder require the Funds to provide a written statement accompanying any payment that adequately discloses the source of such payments if not solely from investment income or capital gains. Shareholders should read any written disclosure provided by the Funds pursuant to Section 19(a) and Rule 19a-1 carefully and/or view the Funds' website, and should not assume that the source of any distribution from the Funds is net income. The amounts and sources of distribution included in such written disclosures are estimates only and should not be reported for tax purposes. The actual amount and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Funds' investment experience during the remainder of their fiscal years and may be subject to changes. The Funds will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell shareholders how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. \b \u001d  SRQ and SRO are non-diversified funds, which means they can invest in securities of relatively few issues. This presents greater risk of loss of principal as the financial conditions or market assessments of such securities change. REIT investments can be affected by interest rate moves, economic cycles, and tax and regulatory requirements. \b \u001d  Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Annualized dividend yield is the latest monthly dividend shown as an annualized percentage of net asset value/market price at month end. Annualized dividend yield simply measures the level of dividends and is not a complete measure of performance. Market price, annualized dividend yield, net asset value and returns are historical and will fluctuate and do not guarantee future results. Investments in funds involve risk. Some funds have more risk than others. These include funds that allow exposure to or otherwise concentrate investments in certain sectors, geographic regions, security types, market capitalization or foreign securities (e.g., political or economic instability, which can be accentuated in emerging market countries). \b \u001d  This announcement is not an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell shares of the Fund or a prospectus, circular or representation intended for use in the purchase or sale of Fund shares. \b \b---------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    NOT FDIC/ NCUA INSURED -- MAY LOSE VALUE -- NO BANK GUARANTEE \b    NOT A DEPOSIT -- NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY \b---------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \u001d  DWS Scudder is part of Deutsche Asset Management, which is the marketing name in the US for the asset management activities of Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Deutsche Asset Management Inc., Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. and DWS Trust Company.

Dana has rebuffed Appaloosa, and its embrace of Centerbridge is a further blow to the hedge fund. \u001d  David Tepper, the billionaire investor who runs Appaloosa in Chatham, N.J., wasn't available Friday to comment. His fund owns 15% of Dana's stock, more than any other shareholder. Last week it complained to Dana's board that the company had taken inappropriate steps to block the development of a rival Chapter 11 plan. \u001d  Dana, in papers filed Thursday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, called Centerbridge an \"integral part\" of a settlement reached with its two biggest labor unions. That pact allows Dana to cut wages and benefits by more than $100 million a year without the risk of a labor strike. It also eliminates a $1 billion liability for the company involving non-retiree pension benefits. \u001d  The settlement, Dana said, \"represents the last hurdle\" in its bankruptcy restructuring efforts and \"clears the way\" for it to propose a Chapter 11 plan before a Sept. 3 court deadline. But it also warned the deal could unravel if Centerbridge were displaced as lead investor, leaving the unions free to strike. \u001d  According to court documents, the settlement could be invalidated if Dana were to \"pursue a transaction or other means of reorganization different than the transaction contemplated with Centerbridge.\" \u001d  If that occurred, the unions would gain a \"right to strike.\" They also would gain a general unsecured claim of nearly $1 billion against Dana. Centerbridge, under those circumstances, would be eligible to collect breakup fees ranging from $15 million to $22.5 million. \u001d  Those terms, legal analysts said, could impair Appaloosa's ability to make headway with an alternative Chapter 11 plan. Appaloosa is precluded by law from filing an alternative plan before Sept. 3, when Dana's \"exclusive\" right to file a plan expires. \u001d  Appaloosa has been a big player in the restructuring of the U.S. auto industry. It's the lead investor in proposed $3.4 billion capital infusion for Delphi Corp. (DPHIQ), although it faces challenges in that bid as well. Delphi recently began talks with Highland Capital Management, a Texas hedge fund that wants to displace Appaloosa as lead investor. \u001d  In bankruptcy reorganizations, private-equity firms sometimes align themselves with labor unions in a bid for control of a company. Buyout firm Yucaipa Cos., for example, struck a deal this year with the union representing employees of Allied Holdings Inc. (AHIZQ) that allowed it to gain control of the company upon its emergence from bankruptcy. \u001d  Centerbridge, which was formed in 2006 by Jeffrey Aronson, manages about $3 billion in assets and makes both traditional buyout investments and investments in distressed companies. Under the terms of its agreement with Dana, it intends to buy $300 million of Dana's Series A preferred stock. It also has pledged to buy $200 million in Series B-1 convertible stock. \u001d  If a judge approves the settlement, Centerbridge would play a key role in overseeing Dana's exit from bankruptcy. It would would effectively get to choose four of the seven members of Dana's board, according to court documents. Dana also would be obligated to obtain Centerbridge's consent for any financing it needs to get out of bankruptcy. \b \u001d  -Joseph Rebello, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9279; joseph.rebello@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:03 ET (19:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d202151543ee509568a74d69c0e870e5","symR":["LMT","US5398301094"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.003415,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.019973,-0.00099],"Headline":"US Air Force Wants To Keep, Fix Lockheed Missile Program","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T12:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LMT","US5398301094"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:52 ET (12:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d21661c4ae032f9841cde89d78dc4540","symR":["INTC","US4581401001"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.011345,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.066856,-0.00099],"Headline":"Intel (INTC) Block: 891,285 Shrs At 24.68","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["INTC","US4581401001"],"IndustryCodes":["SEM","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\bINTEL CORP. \bLast trade  NMS: +0.08 at 24.68 on 0.02 downtick \bTrade vol:       891,285 =    2.0% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:  11,261,102 =   25.3% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:  14,648,091 =   22.9% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:      44,471,516 =   69.5% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:64,024,652 / Prev day +0.01 on 36,687,536 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d21fd9609d63bd5d6021100970d77b07","symR":["CFDAY","UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,0.9996727,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,0.9998364,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"People's Choice Seeks To Sell Platform Assets To UBS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:33:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CFDAY","UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XGTI","XNYA","XSMI","XST5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Carol McCleary \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Liquidating subprime lender People's Choice Home Loan Inc. is seeking bankruptcy court permission to sell certain assets to Swiss bank UBS AG for $2.5 million. \u001d  The sale will bring in millions of dollars and eliminate thousands in potential priority claims, People's Choice said in a court filing Tuesday. \u001d  It also will mitigate any damages from the company's rejection of a lease for its Irvine, Calif., headquarters because UBS has agreed to sign a new lease for the building. \u001d  The assets - platforms for originating and servicing loans - were initially offered up as part of the company's April auction, but People's Choice didn't accept any bids for the platforms.

(OTCBB:TLBT), a biofuels company supplying the nation's growing need for energy independence, announced today that it has completed the acquisition of Biodiesel Solutions, Inc. (BSI). BSI manufactures the BiodieselMaster(R), a factory-built biodiesel processing plant that is appropriately scaled for a variety of customers, including small communities, farms, farm co-ops and trucking fleets. \b \u001d  The landmark acquisition furthers Tech Laboratories' stated mission to augment core operations and assets through opportunistic acquisitions of green technologies and products. \b \u001d  The BiodieselMaster is a community-scale biodiesel processing unit that is designed to produce 350,000 gallons of biodiesel per year. The design provides a biodiesel production system that is continuous, flexible, efficient, affordable, and fully-automated. The automated control system minimizes labor costs and facilitates remote diagnostics. Because the BiodieselMaster is small and self-contained, it is easy to set up with minimal infrastructure. \b \u001d  \"The acquisition of Biodiesel Solutions is a milestone event that we believe will serve to build shareholder value for many years to come,\" said John King, Chief Executive Officer of Tech Laboratories. \"Tech Laboratories continues to diversify its intellectual property and product line portfolio. Our shareholders can expect us to continue rolling up green technologies that allow us to offer the best and most sustainable biofuel products as we establish a leading role in the next-generation biofuels sector.\" \b \u001d  BSI has spent more than two years developing the BiodieselMaster after identifying a compelling market niche. The BiodieselMaster uses exclusively-licensed technology as well as internally-developed intellectual property to produce 1,000 gallons per day of ASTM quality biodiesel. \b \u001d  Based on Tech Laboratories' assessment of targeted customers, it is expected that feedstocks can be grown on set-aside land, thereby enabling energy independence without disrupting the food chain. BSI has concluded six months of field trials which has demonstrated the unit's ability to meet ASTM fuel quality standards. \b \b   About Tech Laboratories \b \u001d  Tech Laboratories is an emerging greentech company monetizing waste from modern consumerism to feed America's demand for energy. The Company is establishing its position in what many believe to be the largest economic opportunity of the 21st Century -- a sustainable solution to the world's $5 trillion addiction to oil consumption. \b \u001d  A key component of Tech Laboratories' high-growth business model is the augmentation of core operations and assets through strategic partnerships and opportunistic acquisitions in the burgeoning biofuels industry. The Company's management team and Board of Directors believe that increasing political and social responsiveness, combined with exciting developments in biofuel technology, has created an unprecedented environment for organic growth as well as growth through acquisitions. \b \u001d  The management of Tech Laboratories is establishing relationships with various biofuel entities with projects, products, and technologies at various stages of development.

Caledonia Investments, CBOT's largest shareholder, which balked at earlier terms, confirmed Friday it plans to vote for the CME/CBOT deal, which would create the world's largest derivatives exchange. (JLT) \u001d  9:19 (Dow Jones) The September fed funds futures contract, at 94.75, prices in an implied funds rate of 5.25%. Sept had priced in a 5.245% implied yield just before the jobs report. Still, the market continues to reflect the widely held view the FOMC will be content to leave the funds rate at its current level at the Aug. 7 and Sept. 18 policy meetings. (HLP) \u001d  9:14 (Dow Jones) The 10-year yield, near 5.180%, if it clears the 5.144%-5.195% resistance band, which charts say is likely, will be the on the way up to 5.305%. The profit-taking point in that case would be 5.252%. The spot U.S. Dollar Index, near 81.60, if it breaks out on the intraday charts above 81.66, would be going for the upper end of its 81.95-81.31 intraday trading range. The euro, near $1.3600, is liable to dip to $1.3452. The signal for the move would be decisive trading below $1.3528. (SWC) \u001d  9:07 (Dow Jones) The dollar is reversing some its modest gains against its rivals on the back of a slightly-better-than-expected jobs report, and is now back to little changed versus the euro from day-earlier numbers. Analysts said the dollar's sharp, knee-jerk jump may have been a result a holiday-thinned trading. Early Friday, the euro was at $1.3596 from $1.3601 just before the data was released and $1.3598 late Thursday, while the dollar was at Y123.35 from Y123.23 pre-data and Y122.90 late Thursday, according to EBS. (DKM) \u001d  9:04 (Dow Jones) Comex gold and silver down after US jobs report. \"The dollar is rallying on the news,\" says Leonard Kaplan, president of Prospector Asset Management. \"People are beginning to believe the Fed is never going to cut rates. The economy is still strong. Jobs growth is still very strong.\" Comex gold down $1.80 to $648.80 an ounce for the day, compared to $651 two minutes ahead of the data. September silver down 5c to $12.53 compared to $12.56 before report. Much of the movement has been dictated by the Treasury market, Kaplan adds. (ALS) \u001d  9:01 (Dow Jones) There was a 12,000 increase in total construction jobs with no net change in residential construction, itself an improvement compared to past declines. (JJM) \u001d  9:00 (Dow Jones) Aggregate hours worked - combines the workweek with the employment gain - showed a 0.5% gain in June. That's a very solid increase in this important proxy for the input to production (was up 0.3% in manufacturing) suggesting good growth in June. (JJM) \u001d  8:55 (Dow Jones) For the first time, CME is offering more for CBOT (BOT) than the competing bid from ICE, based on Thursday's closing prices, following news that CME has raised the share exchange component of its bid to .375 from .35. Based on Thursday's closing share prices, CME's $11.48 billion bid is worth roughly $100 million more than the offer from ICE. (JLT) \u001d  8:52 (Dow Jones) Near-term supply concerns have forced the Brent crude forward curve into backwardation. Broker says concerns over Nigerian supply has seen buyers rush into the front months with the result that ICE Aug Brent is up 74c and Nov down 11c. \"This is typical of a market beginning to panic,\" says broker. But warns profit taking could pare the gains ahead of the weekend. ICE Aug Brent trades up 74c at $75.48/bbl while Nymex August WTI trades up 57c at $72.38/bbl. (DWE) \u001d  8:47 (Dow Jones) Lehman is sensing some deja vu. In battle for Bausch & Lomb (BOL), firm sees shades of the Guidant fight a couple years ago. Warburg Pincus and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are disciplined acquirers, while Boston Scientific (BSX) and Advanced Medical Optics (EYE) are less concerned about constructing strategically and financially sound deals. Finally, Guidant and BOL are assets with issues, all of which may not be known before a deal is done. As a result, Lehman sees the potential of back-and-forth bidding over the next several weeks, with the price tag going higher. (GS) \u001d  8:40 (Dow Jones) Before rounding the jobless rate was 4.529% compared to 4.464% in May, so in June the rate just barely held at 4.5%, whereas in May it was bumped up to that level. In either case, not much unemployment, still tight. (JJM) \u001d  8:38 (Dow Jones) Dollar up modestly after US payrolls data comes in slightly higher than expectations. Early Friday, the euro was at $1.3586 from $1.3601 just before the data was released and $1.3598 late Thursday, while the dollar was at Y123.41 from Y123.23 pre-data and Y122.90 late Thursday, according to EBS. (DKM) \u001d  8:36 (Dow Jones) Treasurys losing ground after as-expected payrolls, and a strong upward revision to May's number. The two-year is down 2/32 for 5.01%, and 10-year down 13/32 for 5.20%. (ECB) \u001d  8:35 (Dow Jones) US stocks futures have dipped into negative territory after the jobs report comes in just about as expected. DJIA futures now down 10, S&P futures down 1.40. (PJV) \u001d  8:33 (Dow Jones) Jobs data is on the screws at a 132,000 gain and a 4.5% unemployment rate. But upward revisions to prior months' jobs gains show the labor market continues to grow robustly, and that's why the Fed can't do much to ease back on its inflation concerns. (MSD) \u001d  8:28 (Dow Jones) With the release of the monthly payrolls report only minutes away, nearby Eurodollar futures are about unchanged from Thursday. Dec prices in about a 20% chance for the FOMC to reduce the funds rate to 5%, from the current 5.25%. March 08 prices in about a 34% chance for a 5% funds rate in the 1Q of next year, while June 08 sees about a 42% chance for a 25 BP rate cut to occur in next year's 2Q.

The agreements consist of: \b \b    - A settlement agreement with each of the United Steel Workers (USW) and \b      the United Auto Workers (UAW), which will lower Dana's labor costs and \b      replace the company's health care and long-term disability obligations \b      for retirees and employees represented by these unions with Voluntary \b      Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts to which Dana will \b      contribute in aggregate approximately $700 million in cash (less certain \b      benefit payments made prior to the effective date of the company's plan \b      of reorganization) and approximately $80 million in common stock of the \b      reorganized Dana; \b    - An agreement with Centerbridge Capital Partners, L.P., and its \b      affiliates on the terms under which the firm will invest up to $500 \b      million in cash for convertible preferred stock in the reorganized Dana \b      and facilitate an additional investment by other investors of up to $250 \b      million in convertible preferred stock; and \b    - A plan support agreement with the USW, the UAW, and Centerbridge, under \b      which these parties will support a plan of reorganization filed by Dana \b      that includes both the labor settlements and the Centerbridge investment \b      agreement. \b \b \b    (LOGO http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/19990903/DANA ) \b \u001d  These agreements are subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, where the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding is pending.  The union settlement agreements are also subject to ratification by Dana's USW and UAW employees, which the unions will seek in the near term. \b \u001d  \"Through our negotiations with the USW and the UAW, and negotiations with Centerbridge for the investment that will contribute to our ability to fund the VEBAs, we have reached what we believe are fair and constructive agreements,\" said Mike Burns, Dana's chairman and chief executive officer.  \"I am particularly pleased that these agreements were reached as a result of a shared commitment - from all of the involved parties - to the long-term success and viability of Dana Corporation.\" \b \u001d  \"We welcome the investment by Centerbridge, a private equity investor with considerable expertise in the automotive industry and complex restructurings. Centerbridge brings a long-term perspective and a strong commitment to assisting us in building a solid future for Dana,\" Burns added.  \"While there is a good deal of work yet to be done, we are on track to file a reorganization plan by the beginning of September and to emerge from bankruptcy by year end.\" \b \b    Settlements with USW and UAW \b \u001d  Encompassed in the settlements with the USW and UAW are four-year extensions of Dana's collective bargaining agreements with all of its USW- and UAW-organized facilities in the United States and new agreements with several recently organized facilities.  Among other items, the extended and new bargaining agreements will provide for the establishment of a two-tier wage structure at certain affected U.S. operations, changes in disability benefits, and a freeze on credited service and benefit accruals under the pension plans for active employees represented by the USW and UAW. \b \u001d  \"These agreements will resolve significant ongoing cost issues when implemented and they provide important momentum toward our completion of a reorganization plan that will position us to operate as a competitive, sustainable business after emergence,\" Burns said. \b \u001d  Each of the union settlement agreements also calls for the establishment of a VEBA to replace the company's current retiree health care plans and long- term disability obligations for employees covered by USW and UAW collective bargaining agreements.  A VEBA is a special, tax-deductible trust that can be used to provide certain benefits, such as medical reimbursement, to participants and their beneficiaries. \b \u001d  The settlement agreements provide that upon Dana's emergence from bankruptcy, the company will contribute, in aggregate, approximately $700 million in cash (less certain benefit payments made prior to the effective date of the company's plan of reorganization) and approximately $80 million in common stock of reorganized Dana to the VEBAs in exchange for the termination of Dana's obligation to provide non-pension retiree welfare benefits for USW- and UAW-represented retirees and long-term disability benefits to USW- and UAW-represented employees.  The company will continue to provide benefits for these retirees and employees under its existing plans until emergence.  Dana currently has an aggregate of approximately $1.1 billion in unfunded non- pension benefit and long-term disability obligations under its U.S. post- retirement health care plans for USW- and UAW-represented retirees and employees. \b \u001d  Dana estimates that the modifications to the USW and UAW collective bargaining agreements and other provisions of the union settlement agreements will collectively result in annual savings of more than $100 million. \b \b    Agreement for Issuance of New Equity \b \u001d  Under terms of the investment agreement, Centerbridge will purchase up to $500 million of convertible preferred stock of the reorganized Dana and facilitate an additional investment of up to $250 million in convertible preferred stock. \b \u001d  The conversion price will be based on trading prices of common stock of the reorganized Dana during a short period after emergence.  Using preliminary forecasts and a preliminary valuation as an estimate of future market trading prices for the reorganized Dana's common stock, the company estimates that the $500 million of convertible preferred shares would represent less than 25 percent of the fully diluted common stock of the reorganized Dana on an as- converted basis. \b \u001d  Proceeds from the investment will be deployed in part to fund the VEBA trusts that will be established under the settlement agreements with the USW and UAW. \b \u001d  The closing of the Centerbridge investment will be subject to Dana's filing of a plan of reorganization and a disclosure statement by September 3, 2007, as well as other customary conditions, but will not be subject to further due diligence. \b \u001d  Dana will be able to terminate its arrangements with Centerbridge to accept an alternative transaction or plan under certain circumstances, with the reasonable consent of the USW and UAW. \b \b    Agreements Keep Company on Track to Achieve Fundamental Changes \b \u001d  \"Last November, to address the harsh reality that Dana had generated more than $2 billion in losses over the past five years, we announced a series of interdependent restructuring initiatives,\" Burns added.  \"These initiatives, affecting all of the company's constituencies - our customers, suppliers, both union and non-union employees and retirees - were designed to result in an aggregate pre-tax annual income improvement of $405 million to $540 million.\" \b \b \b    The Dana initiatives call for savings in five interrelated areas: \b    1.  Achieving substantial price recovery from customers; \b    2.  Optimizing Dana's U.S. manufacturing footprint, including the moving \b        of certain operations to lower-cost sites; \b    3.  Reducing labor costs by creating a more industry-competitive cost \b        structure; \b    4.  Eliminating retiree health and welfare costs; and \b    5.  Reducing administrative costs. \b \b \u001d  \"Without the settlements with the USW and UAW, essential savings in other areas could be jeopardized,\" Burns said.  \"With these settlements, we will be solidly within the range of savings we need to move forward with our plan of reorganization and emerge as a competitive, sustainable business.\" \b \b    About Centerbridge Capital Partners L.P. \b \u001d  Centerbridge is a $3.2 billion multi-strategy private investment firm.

Information about the bankruptcy proceedings can be found at: http://www.dana.com/reorganization. While Dana continues its reorganization under Chapter 11, investments in its securities are highly speculative.  Although shares of Dana common stock continue to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTC Bulletin Board) under the symbol \"DCNAQ,\" the trading prices of the shares may have little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders under any eventual court-approved reorganization plan.  The opportunity for any recovery by holders of Dana common stock under such reorganization plan is uncertain and shares of Dana common stock may be cancelled without any compensation pursuant to such plan. \b \b    Forward-Looking Statements \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d416e654af16b0af051d24bffd5280a9","symR":["AA","AL","AL.T","CA0137161059","US0138171014"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.016803,1.005435,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.118819,1.117137,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: US Antitrust Officials Seek Info About Alcoa bid >AL","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AA","AL","AL.T","CA0137161059","US0138171014"],"IndustryCodes":["ALU","STL","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  PITTSBURGH (AP)--Federal antitrust authorities have asked Alcoa Inc. (AA) for further information about its unsolicited offer to buy Canadian aluminum rival Alcan Inc. (AL) for $27.5 billion. \u001d  The Justice Department request was issued under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act and effectively extends a waiting period until 30 days after Alcoa fulfills the request. Pittsburgh-based Alcoa said Friday that it plans to comply \"as soon as possible.\" \u001d  Alain J.P. Belda, Alcoa's chairman and chief executive, said the follow-up was expected and the company is \"confident\" of meeting all regulatory approvals. \u001d  The proposed deal also faces review by antitrust authorities in Canada, the European Union, Australia and Brazil, as well as foreign investment clearance in Canada, France and Australia. \u001d  Alcoa announced its cash-and-stock offer for the Montreal-based firm on May 7 after nearly two years of private talks failed to produce a negotiated deal. The offer expires at 5 p.m. on July 10, but may be extended. \u001d  Alcan's board unanimously rejected the bid, saying it undervalued the company's assets. It also said it had turned away two unsolicited Alcoa offers in 2005 as inadequate. But Alcan has said it would consider a sweetened offer or perhaps even try to buy Alcoa. \u001d  Last week, Alcan's top executive, Richard B. Evans, ended an exchange of letters with Belda, who was seeking further talks on the proposed takeover, with an email message that said Alcan saw no reason for further discussions or correspondence. \u001d  \"For Alcan, the situation hasn't changed,\" said Anik Michaud, an Alcan spokeswoman. \"We feel that from the beginning, Alcoa has underestimated the impediments to achieving their regulatory clearances.\" \u001d  A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. \u001d  Alcoa founded Alcan in 1902 before establishing it as a separate company in 1928. The companies retained largely common ownership until 1951, when major shareholdings were divested for antitrust reasons under a U.S. court order. \u001d  Until recently, the companies were the world's top two aluminum makers, but the newly formed United Company Rusal surpassed Alcoa as the world's largest in March. \u001d  Shares of Alcoa rose 28 cents, or 0.7%, to $41.63 in midday trading. Alcan was up 98 cents, or 1.2%, to $86.08. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:43 ET (16:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d431bf638b339c476e83763f0e352fb1","symR":["MXC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.033962],"ret5":[1],"Headline":"Mexco Energy FY07 Oil Reserves Up 20%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MXC"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:30 ET (16:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d438c401fe851aa4c3f4ab22f92c782a","symR":["JBLU"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9983221],"ret5":[0.9513423],"Headline":"JetBlue Airways June Load Factor 83.8% Vs 82.1%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JBLU"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:39 ET (16:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d45b434253b10df77c5cba49156476ba","symR":["12150.FR","PEUGY","FR0000121501"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Peugeot-Citroen Forecasts European Mkt Share Increase","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12150.FR","PEUGY","FR0000121501"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XCA4","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:30 ET (06:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d4828f1156b41af1532b2e5532252153","symR":["12197.FR","FR0000121972"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Goldman Sachs Cuts Schneider Target Price","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12197.FR","FR0000121972"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  1132 GMT [Dow Jones] Goldman Sachs cuts Schneider Electric (12197.FR) target price to EUR115 from EUR120, as the group lacks catalysts in the near term and faces raw material risks.

(Nasdaq: GENZ) announced top-line data today from the first of two Phase 3 clinical studies to assess the safety and efficacy of tolevamer liquid, an investigational, non-antibiotic, polymer therapy for patients with Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD).  The second Phase 3 study of tolevamer liquid is fully enrolled and results are expected later this year. \b \u001d  In this first Phase 3 study known as the Polymer Alternative for CDAD Treatment (PACT) study, tolevamer liquid did not meet its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to the standard prescribed oral dose of the antibiotic vancomycin, as measured by the percent of patients with resolution of CDAD. This result contrasts with the findings from Genzyme's earlier Phase 2 study of a solid oral dosage formulation of tolevamer that met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority compared to vancomycin. \b \u001d  Consistent with recent published studies, high rates of CDAD recurrences were observed in patients treated with either vancomycin or metronidazole. High CDAD recurrence rates were not observed in patients treated with tolevamer liquid.  Tolevamer liquid was generally well tolerated with no unanticipated safety concerns.  Data from this first Phase 3 study is expected to be presented at a future medical conference. \b \u001d  \"These are disappointing results that alter our expectations about the potential for commercializing tolevamer in the near future,\" stated Henri A. Termeer, chairman and chief executive officer of Genzyme Corp.  \"The results of our second Phase 3 study will be available later this year and will help us determine what contribution tolevamer might be able to make in addressing this serious unmet medical need.\" \b \u001d  C. difficile has become one of the most significant infection control concerns in healthcare today.  Physicians worldwide are confronting a worsening epidemic, with an alarming rise in the incidence of disease, higher numbers of patients with complications and more frequent failures of standard antibiotic therapy. \b \u001d  Tolevamer is designed to bind and neutralize the toxins released by C. difficile that damage the intestine.  A non-antibiotic approach has the potential to treat CDAD and reduce the number of disease recurrences, resulting in improved quality of life for the patient and significant savings to the healthcare system. \b \b    About the PACT Study \b \u001d  The PACT study, which involved more than 1,100 patients at approximately 300 sites in North America, Europe, and Australia, is the largest of its kind ever to be conducted for CDAD.  In this trial, tolevamer was compared to metronidazole and vancomycin.  Aside from testing tolevamer's efficacy, this was also the first large, rigorously designed, multi-center clinical study that will compare the efficacy of the current standards of care. \b \b    About Clostridium difficile \b \u001d  C. difficile proliferates in the setting of altered normal colonic bacterial flora, most commonly due to the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.  Once established in the colon, C. difficile produces toxins that disrupt the intestinal lining, causing cell death and inflammation that result in diarrhea and colitis. \b \u001d  Earlier studies have shown that even after successful treatment with the current standard of care, approximately 20 percent of patients experience a recurrence of CDAD potentially requiring repeat hospitalization.  In addition, a subset of patients with CDAD develop multiple recurrences of the disease, with symptoms that may persist for years. \b \u001d  About Genzyme One of the world's leading biotechnology companies, Genzyme is dedicated to making a major positive impact on the lives of people with serious diseases. Since 1981, the company has grown from a small start-up to a diversified enterprise with more than 9,000 employees in locations spanning the globe and 2006 revenues of $3.2 billion.  Genzyme has been selected by FORTUNE as one of the \"100 Best Companies to Work for\" in the United States. \b \u001d  With many established products and services helping patients in nearly 90 countries, Genzyme is a leader in the effort to develop and apply the most advanced technologies in the life sciences. The company's products and services are focused on rare inherited disorders, kidney disease, orthopaedics, cancer, transplant, and diagnostic testing. Genzyme's commitment to innovation continues today with a substantial development program focused on these fields, as well as immune disease, infectious disease, and other areas of unmet medical need. \b \u001d  This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the potential for commercializing tolevamer in the future, when data from this Phase 3 study of tolevamer will be presented and when the results of the second Phase 3 study of tolevamer will be available.

(OTCBB:CLSC), a pharmaceutical development company specializing in anti-allergy medications, today reported preliminary top-line results from two Phase III clinical trials for its drug PreHistin(TM) in patients with moderate to moderately severe seasonal allergic rhinitis, commonly known as hay fever. The trials showed very low symptom levels in both placebo and PreHistin-treated patient groups, thereby leaving no room to demonstrate a meaningful drug effect. \b \u001d  In the randomized, six week, placebo-controlled trials involving a total of 1,551 subjects, PreHistin did not achieve statistically significant differences from placebo in the primary measure of efficacy, the reduction in total nasal symptom score (TNSS). However, the TNSS data for placebo-treated patients was far lower than would be expected for the moderate to moderately severe patient population called for in the protocol. Low pollen counts in many of the regions during the time PreHistin was being tested may have resulted in low mean placebo symptom scores for the overall study population. \b \u001d  The trials showed that PreHistin was well tolerated and thus contributed positively to the safety record of PreHistin's active ingredient, cyanocobalamin. \b \u001d  A comparison of pre- and post-treatment blood levels of cobalamin demonstrated for the first time in a large study population that delivery of cyanocobalamin via sublingual lozenges resulted in significant increases in cobalamin blood levels. \b \u001d  Cobalis' Chief Scientific Officer Ernest Armstrong commented: \"Showing a meaningful reduction in allergy symptoms when the symptoms never increased throughout the pollen season to the desired moderate to moderately severe level is next to impossible. It's like trying to prove that a pump can pump water out of a swimming pool when there is almost no water in the pool to begin with. Other pharmaceutical companies studying allergy drugs have reported problems with their clinical trials because of low symptom scores in an allergy season, with at least one report in an analogous situation occurring in the 2006 ragweed season when we conducted our trials.\" \b \u001d  The Company's chief executive officer, Gerald Yakatan, Ph.D., said, \"It is unfortunate that nature did not provide the level of allergy symptoms we needed for our studies, but we continue to believe in PreHistin as a product. Cobalis remains committed to a corporate strategy based on bringing PreHistin to the consumer market. Going forward, we will continue pursuing FDA approval of PreHistin as an OTC drug if we assess the prospects for such approval to be favorable, but we will also investigate other potential marketing channels.\" \b \b   Details of the Study \b \u001d  The parallel, randomized, double-blind Phase III clinical trials for PreHistin involved 1,551 patients at 23 sites across the central, southern and eastern U.S. The patients received either a placebo or a 3.3-mg sublingual dosage of PreHistin twice daily for three weeks prior to the onset of the ragweed allergy season and for an additional three weeks into the allergy season. The primary efficacy parameter for each trial was the difference in the mean reduction in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) observed between the placebo and PreHistin over the fourth, fifth and sixth weeks of the studies. TNSS is a 12-point scale derived by summing and averaging all a.m. and p.m. scores for four symptoms: sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion and nasal itch. Each symptom is given a score - 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) - resulting in a maximum recorded daily mean TNSS of 12. Patients maintained electronic diaries twice daily, self-rating their average symptoms over the previous 12 hours. \b \u001d  The Company delayed reporting preliminary top-line analyses from the two Phase III trials due to diary data entry inconsistencies. To evaluate whether these inconsistencies were sufficient to represent a systematic error that could affect the outcome of the analyses, the Company engaged an expert external consultant to conduct an audit of the electronic diary database. The study audit found that the electronic diary system functioned correctly and the diary data entered by the patients were correct. The inconsistencies noted earlier were primarily human errors that were corrected and did not alter the study outcomes. \b \b   About Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis \b \u001d  Seasonal allergic rhinitis, otherwise known as hay fever, is an allergic reaction to airborne substances such as pollen that get into the upper respiratory passages and cause the body to produce antibodies and release histamine. Histamine makes the upper respiratory membranes swell and produce typical allergy symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and nasal congestion. In the U.S., approximately 50 million people suffer from seasonal allergic rhinitis, with related healthcare costs exceeding $7 billion annually. Ragweed is the single most common seasonal allergen, affecting up to 75% of those with seasonal allergic rhinitis, or 30 million Americans. Current treatment options are mainly limited to symptomatic therapies to provide temporary relief and conventional allergy immunotherapy by injection. \b \b   About PreHistin \b \u001d  PreHistin is a sublingual lozenge that delivers its active ingredient through the buccal membrane directly into the bloodstream. The active ingredient, cyanocobalamin, has a well-known safety profile and has been shown in studies to relieve symptoms related to seasonal allergies, asthma and other atopic allergic diseases. PreHistin may represent a novel approach to treatment by rectifying imbalances in the immune system that trigger the over-production of allergy symptom-causing substances including histamines. By preventing or reducing the over-production of these substances before they are released from cells, the need to block the symptom-causing effects of histamine may be eliminated, or minimized. PreHistin is patented for the treatment of atopic allergic diseases such as seasonal and perennial allergies, dermatitis, migraine, food allergies and asthma. \b \b   About Cobalis Corp. \b \u001d  Cobalis Corp. is a specialty pharmaceutical development company specializing in medications to prevent and treat atopic disease, including allergies, migraine headache, atopic asthma and dermatitis. Its flagship drug candidate PreHistin is an allergy medication in Phase III clinical development.

Across the Goodrich enterprise we have a sense of pride and accomplishment for the contributions we've made to the Dreamliner and our global team is genuinely excited to be associated with the milestone taking place on Sunday.\" \b \u001d  Goodrich recently shipped the first thrust reversers for the Dreamliner from its Chula Vista, Calif. site, which also performed final assembly, to a Rolls-Royce engine facility in Derby, UK. Goodrich's team in Chula Vista is building the thrust reversers and nacelle systems for both engine options offered on the 787, the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 and the General Electric GEnx. Goodrich will manufacture nacelles and thrust reversers for six flight test airplanes -- three for each engine type -- as well as a spare set for each engine variant. \b \u001d  Several additional Goodrich sites across the U.S. were also involved in the delivery milestone of the first thrust reversers. The company's Riverside, Calif. facility manufactures the thrust reverser inner fixed structures, the engine system exhaust nozzles are manufactured by Goodrich's San Marcos, Texas facility and final assembly of the nacelle's inlet cowl will occur at the company's newest facility -- Goodrich Aerostructures Integration Services -- located near the Boeing 787 final assembly plant in Everett, Wash. \b \u001d  Goodrich Corporation, headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., has a broad range of technology which will fly on this innovative aircraft.  Goodrich Corporation supplies the flight deck lighting system and cabin attendant seating as well as: the cargo system; wheels and electric braking system; exterior lighting; nacelles and thrust reversers; proximity sensing system; as well as the fuel quantity indicating system and fuel management software. In addition, Goodrich has been selected by Rolls-Royce to provide the engine control system and sensor suite for the Trent 1000 engine, an engine option for the 787. \b \u001d  Furthermore, as the Dreamliner enters service, Goodrich's global component support network and maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities are being equipped to provide the aftermarket services necessary to keep the aircraft in the skies. \b \u001d  Goodrich Corporation, a Fortune 500 company, is a global supplier of systems and services to aerospace, defense and homeland security markets. With one of the most strategically diversified portfolios of products in the industry, Goodrich serves a global customer base with significant worldwide manufacturing and service facilities.

Now that PPR is paying the piper, the tune it's calling is likely to dampen Puma share price. \u001d  Many minority shareholders are already disgruntled at what they think is an undervalued PPR takeover offer of EUR330 per share for their company. Many have held out for a better deal, even hoping for a counter bid for the German sportswear maker. But none has emerged. \u001d  Shares in Puma are currently trading at EUR330, having come off a high of EUR350 on news of the PPR takeover. \u001d  Despite owning barely a third of Puma, PPR has stated that EUR330 is all it will offer. Come August, it won't even have to stick to that price and can snap up any shares it wants at the market value. \u001d  Puma's management is in the uncomfortable position of serving two masters - PPR, the majority shareholder that wants to acquire more shares at the cheapest possible price, and the other shareholders who want to see the share price soar. \u001d  But it's PPR that management is answering to. PPR has three seats on Puma's supervisory board - CEO Francois-Henri Pinault has one of them - and is sure to bring its influence to bear. \u001d  Puma is latest phase of long-running corporate development plan. As part of this, management's priorities include investing in logistics and preparing for the 2008 Olympic games, rather than short-term action to boost Puma's share price. This must sound good to PPR. \u001d  Pouring salt on the minority shareholders' wounds is PPR's CFO, Jean-Francois Palus, who's said Puma's capacity to raise its dividend would be limited by the company's investment program. \u001d  Puma's minority shareholders will have been further disheartened by the company's recent poor performance, which looks set to continue. Troubles with order backlogs at retailer Footlocker have dented hopes Puma might get a major U.S. sales boost. Analysts have revised sales and earnings forecasts lower. \u001d  So Puma's minority shareholders are right to be pessimistic about the value of their stock.

Employers in the trade sector led the hiring spree, but the beleaguered manufacturing sector shed the most jobs since February. \u001d  Employers hired a net 34,800 workers, the most since March and up from 9,300 in May, bringing total gains for the first half of the year to 196,900, or 1.2%, Statistics Canada said Friday. The market had expected 17,000 new jobs to be created.

The primary role of the Independent Review Committee will be to review and make recommendations in the event that there are any conflicts of interest matters that involve EnerVest or its Manager; \b \b3. update the Declaration of Trust so that the existing provisions relating to unitholder communications and deliveries conform with the guidelines for such items set out in National Instrument 54-101 - \"Communications with Beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer;\" and \b \b4. changing the quorum requirements for a meeting of Unitholders to be consistent with that of most Canadian companies, to two or more Unitholders present in person or by proxy and representing not less than 5% of the outstanding Units. This was a change from the previous quorum requirement of having Unitholders representing not less than 10%. \b \bEnerVest and the Manager continue to look for ways of operating more efficiently and competitively.

The commission launched a probe June 13 to determine whether French-regulated tariffs constitute improper state aid for French businesses, thereby creating an unfair playing field for other European businesses that operate outside France. \u001d   The French Senate defended its reasons for keeping regulated electricity tariffs in an energy security report published Thursday, saying such tariffs were preferable to volatile energy prices in order to help underpin the heavy investment in emission-free nuclear power stations. It also said, among other things, that energy-intensive consumers benefited from regulated tariffs by gaining long-term clarity on energy prices. \u001d  The important thing is not whether tariffs are regulated but at what level they're set, Gadonneix said on the sidelines of an economic forum here in Aix-en-Provence, France. \u001d  He added \"regulated tariffs are a decision by the French government,\" not EDF, and EDF will abide by them. \u001d  \"It allows the consumers to have long term visibility on pricing,\" he said. \u001d  Gadonneix wouldn't comment on whether he thought regulated tariffs are good for EDF or whether regulated tariffs would help underpin investments in nuclear power generation. He said, however, he expects France's regulated tariffs to increase in line with inflation. \u001d  The European directives on energy market liberalization require all European Union member states open their energy markets to competition from July 1, 2007.  Small power company Direct Energie said last month it can't compete against EDF's rates and filed a complaint with French competition authorities. Direct Energie argues that government controls keep EDF's prices too low and protects EDF's dominant market position. EDF's fleet of 58 nuclear power plants covers 70% of France's annual power needs. \u001d  Gadonneix also said it was up to the government to decide when or if it would sell down its stake in EDF. The French state owns an 87% stake in EDF, but is allowed by law to reduce it to a minimum of 78%. \b \u001d  -By Alex MacDonald, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-20-7842-9327; alex.macdonald@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:31 ET (18:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"dd23445bc7bf0f353b769157df84458e","symR":["GRIL"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Grill Concepts Raises $14.1 Million in Private Offering","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GRIL"],"IndustryCodes":["RES","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Grill Concepts Raises $14.1 Million in Private Offering \u001d  Majority of Funds to be Used for Accelerated Restaurant Expansion Program \u001d  LOS ANGELES, July 6, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Grill Concepts, Inc.

As a result, additional capacities of butyl rubber are necessary in this region. \u001d  \"We estimate that this endeavor will require an investment of approximately EUR400 million,\" commented the company's Chief Executive Axel Heitmann on plans to build a new butyl rubber facility in Asia. \u001d  \"This would be the largest investment in the history of our company.\" In the next few months Lanxess will hold talks with possible host locations to determine the feasibility of the construction of a new plant. Should a decision be reached upon a location, Lanxess will be able to bring the facility on stream in 2010. \u001d  At its Canadian Sarnia site the company has completed the first phase of a plant expansion that will increase its butyl rubber capacity there by 42%. Lanxess has already started a second phase of expansion at the Sarnia plant, increasing annual capacity by another 10% in 2009. \u001d  In order to satisfy the growing global demand for butyl rubber the company is also accelerating its expansion in Europe and Asia. \u001d  At the Zwijndrecht, Belgium facility Lanxess already increased capacity by 10% in 2006. In addition, Lanxess announced plans last week to build a new butyl rubber facility in Asia. \u001d  Lanxess' butyl rubber is predominantly used in inner liners which keep the air in tires thus maintaining them inflated. This makes vehicles safer, more fuel efficient and reduces emissions. Other uses for butyl rubber include ball bladders to keep the air in and pharmaceutical stoppers to keep the air and moisture out of the medicine. \u001d  The Butyl Rubber Business Unit is a leading manufacturer in its field and belongs to the Performance Rubber segment, which achieved total sales in 2006 of EUR1.776 billion. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 10:43 ET (14:43 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"ddf4006740234c5faa9691abf8e505aa","symR":["RTSX"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": S&P Affirms Radiation Therapy Svcs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T21:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RTSX"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's: \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Standard & Poor's) July 6, 2007-Standard & Poor's Ratings Services today affirmed its bank loan and recovery ratings on Radiation Therapy Services Inc.'s senior secured bank facilities, following the company's exercising the Term B accordion feature to expand the facility by $50 million.

Expansion of that business worldwide is now a priority for Dexia, as it will offer the bank strong long-term growth prospects, Miller said. At this moment, Dexia is looking at India and China, but in a \"modest\" way, Miller said. Both China and India are still considered tough markets, he said. \u001d  He also said Canada, Mexico and Japan are countries where Dexia seeks a larger market share. \u001d  The Brussels- and Paris-based bank in 2006 outlined a 10-year strategy plan that aims to bring the cost/income ratio down and for 10% annual growth in underlying net profit. Since then, Dexia has outperformed those goals, but Miller quickly added there was no reason to update the company's plans. \u001d  In addition, Dexia in the past three years carried out a strategic review across the board and offloaded a number of units that either lacked scale or weren't profitable enough, such as its private bank in France and its activities in the Netherlands. \u001d  \"We're touching the end of that process,\" Miller said. \"We're now focusing on the commercial development,\" he said. \u001d  Dexia, which has a market value of about EUR27 billion, is considered by many market observers to feature high on the takeover list of Europe's largest banking groups. \u001d  In recent years, Dexia has been close to a merger with Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISNPY) of Italy and rebuffed an offer from Belgian-Dutch group Fortis NV (FORSY). \u001d  But the group's shareholder structure, with 52% in hands of French and Belgian government-linked investors, is likely to render a hostile bid problematic. \u001d  Miller acknowledged this, but said the shareholder base brings stability to the company and will \"say no\" to any offer that doesn't offer superior value. \u001d  He said he didn't want to exclude a large merger or takeover, but only on the condition it made strategic sense and brought industrial value to the company's shareholders. He also said Dexia itself is the product of a European cross-border merger. \u001d  Dexia was created 10 years ago through the merger of Credit Locale de France and Credit Communal de Belgique. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.dexia.com \b \u001d  -By Nicolas Parasie, Dow Jones Newswires; +33 1 40 17 1770; nicolas.parasie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:00 ET (18:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"debb6bb50bae1d9465acf0441dc2a3ab","symR":["CNI","CNR.T","CA1363751027"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.009672,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.040584,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Cdn Transportation Agency Orders Canadian Natl To Improve Grain Shipper's Access To Rail Cars","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CNI","CNR.T","CA1363751027"],"IndustryCodes":["RAI","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  OTTAWA, July 6 /CNW Telbec/ - The Canadian Transportation Agency, in its Decision No. 344-R-2007, has found that the Canadian National Railway Company (CN) breached its statutory obligations to provide Great Northern Grain Terminals Ltd. (GNG) with adequate and suitable rail service. The complaint alleged that CN discriminated against GNG in the distribution of rail cars, rendering GNG and other small grain handling companies uncompetitive in the marketing of grain. \b \bThe Agency found that \"in establishing car supply policies that have restrictive terms and conditions like minimum order durations and exclude significant segments of the shipper community, CN unilaterally becomes the arbiter of which of its captive shippers are eligible for a competitive advantage.\" The Decision also states that \"through its virtually exclusive control of rail service in portions of the western Canadian grain market, CN creates an imbalance and, inevitably, as seen in this case, a failure in the market place.\" \b \b \b    << \b    In order to remedy this situation, the Agency ordered CN to: \b \b    - put in place a program whereby GNG can order blocks of 50 rail cars in \b      advance; \b \b    - not prohibit or restrict GNG from trading cars; \b \b    - advise GNG of the methodology it uses in its determination of \b      allocating rail cars and encouraged the railway to make this \b      information available to other shippers on its Web site; and \b \b    - implement the Agency's directions by the beginning of the 2007-2008 \b      crop year, commencing August 1, 2007. \b    >> \b \b \bAlthough the Agency's jurisdictional scope in this matter was limited to GNG's service problems, the Decision acknowledged that \"the systemic nature of CN's conduct has undoubtedly affected other grain shippers\", and expressed the need for \"a new and open dialogue between CN and its shippers, so that they are able to reasonably deal with car supply issues independent of regulatory intervention to the greatest possible extent.\" \b \bSections 113 to 116 of the Canada Transportation Act stipulate that railway companies must provide an adequate and suitable level of service to shippers.

(Crown), and its subsidiaries Crown Cork & Seal Company, Inc. (CCS), Crown Americas, LLC. (CA), and Crown European Holdings, SA (CEH) as follows: \u001d  Crown: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'B+'. \u001d  CCS: --IDR 'B+'; --Senior unsecured notes 'B/Recovery Rating (RR) of RR5'. \u001d  CA: --IDR 'B+'; --Senior secured dollar term facility 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior secured dollar revolving facility 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior unsecured notes 'B+/RR4'; \u001d  CEH: --IDR 'B+'; --Senior secured euro term facility 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior secured euro revolving facility 'BB+/RR1'; --Senior secured euro 1st priority notes 'BB+/RR1'; \u001d  Approximately $3.5 billion of debt is covered by the ratings. The Rating Outlook is Stable. \u001d  The ratings reflect Crown's leading market share across its product categories, balanced revenue mix, geographic diversification, good liquidity, modest near-term debt maturities, volume growth in emerging markets, and focus on debt reduction. Rating concerns include high leverage, escalating raw materials and energy costs, intense competition in mature markets, increasing cash deployment towards shareholders, and to a lesser extent, asbestos liability. \u001d  The Stable Outlook reflects the relatively steady demand in Crown's key end-markets, consistent operating performance and solid cash generation. The company's internationally balanced asset portfolio is also a key factor lending stability to the Outlook. \u001d  Crown has been challenged with substantially higher raw materials costs over the past few years but has successfully passed higher costs to its customer base in most cases. Higher energy costs are an additional pressure on margins. Despite these challenges, Crown has maintained stable profitability over the past several quarters, and has repaid a meaningful portion of debt over the past few years. Free cash generation of $164 million in 2006 was below Fitch's expectation. Management has indicated that working capital was the primary factor leading to lower than expected free cash flow. \u001d  In late 2006, Crown added an additional $200 million of term debt under its existing credit facility, using the proceeds to pay down outstanding revolver balances and improve liquidity. Fitch has updated its recovery analysis to account for the additional secured debt outstanding. \u001d  Despite the additional debt, the ratings on each debt class within the capital structure remain unchanged. Fitch expects that, in a distressed scenario, all secured claims including the senior secured credit facility (at CA and CEH) and the senior secured first priority notes at CEH would obtain full recovery. However, the two unsecured classes (at CA and CCS) would likely be impaired. Compared to Fitch's previous analysis, the estimated recovery value for holders of the unsecured debt held at CCS would be reduced from the high end to the low end of the 'RR5' recovery band (11% to 30%) due to the additional debt. Fitch views the CCS unsecured class as structurally subordinate to the unsecured class at CA, and therefore rates the CA class one notch higher at 'B+/RR4'. \u001d  Crown maintains debt reduction as a top financial priority, although the company was a net borrower in 2006. Pension contributions, asbestos payments, and shareholder distributions are competing uses of cash. Shareholder focused actions may be gaining a larger share of excess cash distribution. Crown repurchased $135 million of stock in 2006 (after just $38 million in 2005) and has $227 million remaining under its current repurchase authorization. Crown has indicated that excess cash in 2007 will be directed towards debt reduction and share repurchases in roughly a two-thirds, one-third proportion. The company is targeting free cash flow in the $330 million to $370 million range for 2007.  After expected cash asbestos payments of about $25 million, Crown could direct $200 million or more towards debt reduction. Greater deleveraging could take place in 2008 if cash flows improve as expected. \u001d  Fitch believes Crown's free cash flow target is achievable and expects operating cash flows to improve over the intermediate term, driven by volume growth, product mix, and lower pension payments. Fitch expects lower capital spending as certain foreign investment projects have been completed. \u001d  As of March 31, 2007 the company's liquidity was about $689 million, comprised of $278 million cash and $411 million of available revolver. The company has modest debt maturities of $43 million and $39 million due in 2007 and 2008. Crown's financial position and debt service obligations offer substantial flexibility for the next several years. Crown divested the last of its plastic packaging assets in 2006 and Fitch does not believe further asset sales will be a source of funds for significant debt reduction as they have been in the past. \u001d  At fiscal year-end (FYE) 2006 Crown's credit metrics were relatively stable year over year. As of Dec. 31, 2006, the company had operating EBITDA leverage of 4.4 times (x) (compared to 4.3x in 2005) and EBITDA interest coverage of 2.3x (compared to 2.3x in 2005). It should be noted that Fitch's calculation of these ratios is not equivalent to those allowed for covenant compliance, which incorporate a provision for asbestos payments, among other things. Covenants under the senior secured credit facilities limit debt-to-EBITDA to 4.25x through Sept. 30, 2007 and EBITDA interest coverage to 2.75x through the same date.  Requirements by FYE2007 will be 4.0x and 2.9x respectively. \u001d  Asbestos payments and new claims continue to decline steadily. Crown paid $26 million for asbestos related settlements in 2007 compared to $29 million in 2005. New claims fell by nearly 50% year over year and the company expects payments of $25 million in 2007. \u001d  Looking ahead, key risks and challenges include escalating raw materials and energy costs. Fitch believes Crown may face stronger headwinds from rising raw materials prices, particularly for aluminum in North America, as price ceilings contained in some supplier contracts are removed. These ceilings may have partially shielded the company from the dramatic escalation in aluminum prices in recent quarters. If further cost increases are not completely passed through or if there is a lag in pass through, profitability could be challenged. \u001d  Crown should continue to see solid volume and revenue growth in certain emerging markets. Productivity and cost reduction initiatives are also beginning to show results so far in 2007. Competition will remain fierce in mature markets and volume losses are always a possibility. However, Crown rebounded strongly from volume losses in early 2006, capturing new volume in higher margin specialty can products. \u001d  Fitch's Recovery Ratings (RR), introduced in 2005, are a relative indicator of creditor recovery on a given obligation in the event of a default. A broad overview of Fitch's RR methodology as it relates to specific sectors, including a Case Study webcast, can be found at http://www.fitchratings.com/recovery. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 13:29 ET (17:29 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"dfa7ab09791c1d5943b840255076a87a","symR":["HD","US4370761029"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.998263,-0.00099],"ret5":[0.9962779,-0.00099],"Headline":"Home Depot (HD) Mkt On Close Sell Imbalance: Shrs 144300","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HD","US4370761029"],"IndustryCodes":["HIM","RTS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:40 ET (19:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"dfbe948c29d06d900c0f1698ec9810ce","symR":["CHIC"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Charlotte Russe Says Allan Karp Resigns From Bd >CHIC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CHIC"],"IndustryCodes":["RTS","SAP","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:31 ET (20:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"dfc62754f39d6511c4cbfe33022ac225","symR":["CNE","CNE.UN.T","CA1375131077"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Canetic Resources Tgt Raised To C$18 From C$15: Scotia >CNE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T11:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CNE","CNE.UN.T","CA1375131077"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 07:31 ET (11:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e03182129f018740a0506e9cbe23e434","symR":["DCN","DCNAQ","US2358111068"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Dana To Get Up To $750M Invest From Centerbridge Cap, Others","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T04:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DCN","DCNAQ","US2358111068"],"IndustryCodes":["OTA","XFFX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 00:55 ET (04:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e0329b3b594a608956cdb2264d73c607","symR":["APNB"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Holder 1837 RMB MANAGERS LLC Sells 5,952 Of ASPENBIO PHARMA INC >APNB","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["APNB"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC"],"Story":"\b \bSOURCE: Form 4 \b \bISSUER: ASPENBIO PHARMA INC \bSYMBOL: APNB \b \bFILER: 1837 RMB MANAGERS LLC \bTITLE: Beneficial Owner \b \bDATE               TRANSACTION             SHARES       PRICE            VALUE \b7/5/07             Sale                     5,952       $4.65          $27,677 \b \bOWNERSHIP: 2,865,963 (Indirect) \b \b  The Form 4 is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by insiders \b  to report transactions in their companies' shares.

MediCredit is presently discussing with healthcare providers how to access cash flow without waiting or attempting to manage the specialty Insurance Claims that they generate.  The diagnostic, clinical and rehabilitation care business will result in hundreds of millions of dollars.  Each state with no fault insurance mandates insurance companies must provide for whatever services are prescribed. \b \u001d  The growth comes in direct proportion to funding capital availability and the market in which these funds are employed for high profitability and security of investment.  Principal rated insurance companies involved in these unique business payments, include, but are not limited to, Allstate, State Farm, Liberty Mutual, Nationwide, MIC (GMAC), General Assurance, Prudential, Aetna, Geico, Hartford, Progressive, Countrywide, Encompass, Metropolitan Insurance. \b \u001d  Gunther Slaton, President of GSI states, \"The long-term wrap-up for expanding GSI's business in this arena is expected to compound profits many time over with the expansion of MediCredit's niche market business potential.

Healthcare providers want to deal with people they know and it becomes network selling.  No sale is done overnight and usually, once connected you are connected long term and then get referrals as each Client is treated with special handling.  We are cognizant of the patients, the physicians, the treatments, and the reimbursement protocols all of which are key elements in the services and funding instruments sold in this $2-trillion+ market.\" \b \u001d  Gunther Slaton, President of GSI states, \"Seymour Spilka represents the paradigm for specialty insurance funding and servicing aspects of this receivable business.  His resume states it all for the investors.\" \b \u001d  Seymour Spilka, President and CEO, started MediCredit, Inc. in 1990, managing a portfolio of healthcare providers specializing in the no-fault insurance arena financing programs.  Mr. Spilka set-up, coordinated, and managed the entire operations of the company in the marketing, sale, net-value determination modeling, financing, processing and collection, accounting and services of the existing and prospective Client base.  The asset-backed business has continued to be highly successful and profitable as a niche market specialty business.

However, the difference in pain reduction between patients treated with hylastan and patients treated with a steroid was not significant.

Travelers said its portion will come from its asbestos reserves without hurting earnings. \u001d  The settlement comes after a federal appeals court reinstated an ACandS lawsuit in January 2006 over which limits apply to ACandS's coverage. The lawsuit claimed that Travelers is liable for 45% of the $2.8 billion that Lancaster, Penn.-based ACandS paid to settle asbestos-related claims. Travelers had $4.47 billion set aside for asbestos and environmental claims at the end of 2006. \u001d  \"ACandS has been one of our most significant and longest-standing asbestos exposures,\" said Jay S.

In another upbeat signal, hiring for April and May was revised higher, as government statisticians found a net 75,000 jobs that they'd missed in previous counts. To be certain, the pace of hiring is much slower this year. Job creation so far has averaged 145,000 a month, weaker than the monthly rate of 189,000 new jobs seen during 2006. And some of June's data looked a bit suspect. Construction firms took on 12,000 more workers despite the ongoing weakness in that sector, while Brian Fabbri of BNP Paribas noted that government hiring jumped by 40,000, which he said was \"double (the) recent trend growth\" and a hint that the end of the school year may have disturbed the seasonal adjustment process. Some economists said a wide disparity between the two sets of data that constitute the full employment report suggested payroll counts could be revised a lot lower when the government issues its benchmark revisions next year. \u001d  Still, many economists said recent hiring gains suggest the economy pulled out its first-quarter torpor over the past three months. With incomes and hours on the job strengthening - average hourly earnings climbed 0.3% in June, while the work week extended to 33.9 hours, up a hair from May - consumers should be left with more to spend. \"The job engine still appears to be cranking along at this point,\" economists at Morgan Stanley wrote, adding that further weakness in housing could lead to more job losses, but that the support to incomes from a healthy overall job market should help \"sustain household buying power.\" Nigel Gault, U.S. economist at consulting firm Global Insight, said the data \"adds to the evidence that the economy bounced back in the second quarter.\" He thinks that the economy grew at roughly a 3% to 3.5% annual clip during the second quarter after the anemic 0.7% rate of expansion seen in the first quarter. Indeed, economists at Bear Stearns noted that taken with other recent indicators such as the Institute for Supply Management's factory and services indexes, the jobs report shows the \"economy ended the second quarter with good momentum.\" \u001d  The report, meanwhile, served to further underpin the broadly held belief that the Federal Reserve won't be messing around with interest rates anytime soon. The central bank has said that it remains concerned about inflation, and the gains in wages coupled with a steady unemployment rate - it was unchanged at 4.5% in June, which hints that capacity utilization is tight - will keep policy makers on guard. Joel L. Naroff, chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors, wrote that \"with firms continuing to look for workers, the (Fed) is not wrong in worrying that labor constraints could put pressure on business costs.\" But Joshua Shapiro, the chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc., wrote that there is nothing in the report to move the Fed \"away from its 'do-nothing' stance.\" Janet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed, said in a speech in Singapore on Friday that the central bank should be tilted toward fighting inflation while not posing any risks to the economy's growth. \b \b   Stocks Rise In Light Trading \b \u001d  Those stock traders who didn't call it a week immediately after the Independence Day holiday appeared to hightail it out of town soon after the jobs report came out, as most benchmarks inched up in light trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up about 50 points by midday to climb to around 13620, while the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained about 8 and 5 points, respectively. Treasurys sold off on the employment news, pushing the 10-year yield up to about 5.18%, while the dollar gained on the yen and the euro thanks to the jobs report. Crude-oil prices were higher, climbing to around $72.60 a barrel amid renewed worry about political turmoil in Nigeria. Stocks in Asia were stronger with markets in China and Hong Kong leading the charge, while European stock indexes strengthened moderately. \b \b   CME Sweetens CBOT Bid Again \b \u001d  Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME) increased its offer for crosstown rival CBOT Holdings Inc. (BOT) for the third time, hoping that it can woo CBOT holders who had indicated they would resist the deal when shareholders vote on it Monday. Under the new terms, CME would offer CBOT 36.2% of a combined company, up from 34.6% before. The revised terms won the support of at least one large shareholder, Caledonia Investments, which had previously said it would reject the deal. The CME-CBOT deal has received the blessing of federal regulators, and influential proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services threw its backing behind the deal. Supporters argue that the deal offers greater long-term value to shareholders than a competing bid from the Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE). ICE has been a persistent suitor. It upgraded its offer last month by promising more cash, among other enhancements. The CME-CBOT union would create the world's largest derivatives exchange at a time of huge growth in trading of futures and options. Since 2001, derivatives trading has grown nearly 30% a year on average worldwide. \b \b   British Muslims Denounce Attacks \b \u001d  As the investigation into the failed terrorist bombings in London and Glasgow gathered steam, British Muslim groups launched an advertising campaign that seeks to distance them from the attackers by saying that the attempted attacks were \"not in our name\" and that such violence runs counter to Islamic teaching. Over the last week, British authorities have noted a number of retaliatory attacks and threats against Muslims in England and Scotland. Meanwhile, authorities in Britain and Australia were busy pursuing leads. Prime Minister Gordon Brown said \"we are getting to the bottom of this cell that has been responsible for what is happening.\" In Australia, police seized computers from two hospitals as they explored connections between a doctor arrested there this week and the British cell. Indian physician Muhammad Haneef was detained Monday at the airport in Brisbane after trying to board a flight with a one-way ticket. In the U.S., the FBI confirmed that another suspect, Mohammed Asha, has been in contact with the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, an outreach group in the U.S. for foreign medical students. \b \b   Dana, Unions Reach Deal \b \u001d  Auto-parts supplier Dana Corp. (DCNAQ), which is operating under bankruptcy protection, has reached a settlement with its two top labor unions that will allow Dana to cease providing non-pension retiree benefits. Instead, Dana will contribute up to $704 million plus $80 million in stock to trusts known as voluntary employer-benefit associations, which will manage the benefits. The settlement is similar to a deal that Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) struck with its unions and that some analysts had said could serve as a useful model for other companies that are struggling with steep legacy costs. Dana had been pushing to cut wages and benefits and filed a court motion to cancel its labor contracts, a move  unions said would lead to a strike if granted. The deal unveiled Friday should lessen the chance of a strike. Meanwhile, Dana said it has received a planned investment commitment for up to $750 million from a group led by private-equity firm Centerbridge Partners. \b \b   Close of Keyspan Deal Nears \b \u001d  U.K. utility company National Grid PLC (NGG) said it is close to reaching an agreement in principle over terms of its $7.3 billion acquisition of U.S. utility Keyspan Corp. (KSE) with the New York State Department of Public Service. The merger is scheduled to be put before the department for a vote Aug. 22, and if it is approved, then National Grid expects to close the deal in short order. State officials had earlier been critical of the deal, saying National Grid wasn't passing along a sufficient share of the transaction's purported $800 million in savings to consumers. And regulators proposed that KeySpan's 2,400-megawatt Ravenswood power plant be sold. Combined, the companies would be the third-largest utility in the U.S. \b \b   Microsoft Plans Canada Software Center \b \u001d  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) plans to open a software development center in Canada this fall in an effort to attract talent while avoiding immigration issues. The location, which is not far from the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., would \"allow the company to continue to recruit and retain highly skilled people affected by the immigration issues in the U.S.,\" Microsoft said. The software giant has been a vocal proponent of raising the number of visas for skilled workers from abroad. \"Microsoft is a global company, and our greatest asset is smart, talented, highly skilled people,\" said S. Somasegar, corporate vice president of development. \u001d  For continuously updated news from the Wall Street Journal, see WSJ.com at http://wsj.com. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:54 ET (16:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e4195e948b0806d4710e2e237b7fe5ba","symR":["VRA"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Amex Reaffirms Decision To Delist Viragen Stock >VRA","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VRA"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \b   DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  Viragen Inc.

A list of creditors holding the largest unsecured claims against Tuneup Masters hasn't yet been filed with the court. \u001d  The company blamed its financial difficulties on pending litigation and Auto Life Acquisition Corp.'s failure to pay a $1.3 million note. \u001d  Tuneup Masters sold 53 stores located in California and Nevada to Auto Life in December 2005 for $2.8 million. Auto Life paid $1.5 million of the purchase price in cash, and issued a 60-day note to Tuneup Masters for the remaining $1.3 million. \u001d  Auto Life defaulted on the note in March 2006, and filed a Chapter 11 petition of its own in California on June 6. \u001d  Litigation is pending in California against both Tuneup Masters and Auto Life over certain leases that were assigned as part of the sale. \u001d  Meanwhile, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge D. Michael Lynn granted Tuneup Masters' emergency request for permission to pay wages and withholding taxes incurred before the start of the Chapter 11 case. \u001d  The first-day order allows the company to pay about $47,000 to its workforce of roughly 95 employees. \u001d  Bankruptcy laws prohibit a company from paying claims that arose before the Chapter 11 filing unless authorized by a bankruptcy court. \u001d  Failure to pay the pre-bankruptcy wages would, the company said, cause its workers to suffer \"personal hardship\" and adversely impact its ability to reorganize or maintain operations until its assets until they can be sold. \u001d  Forshey & Prostok L.P. is representing Tuneup Masters in the bankruptcy case, which has been assigned number 07-42933. \u001d  -Carol McCleary, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-7100; carol.mccleary@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 08:29 ET (12:29 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e4ad91f357dfc3c0a68a2e1f565e37d5","symR":["PPHN.EB","CH0027752242"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Lehman Cuts Petroplus To Equalweight From Overweight","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T04:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PPHN.EB","CH0027752242"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 00:47 ET (04:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e4b003dbe9a52807e0bbc57e367908fb","symR":["BFTH"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Harbinger Capital Sends Letter To Bally Total Fitness","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T10:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BFTH"],"IndustryCodes":["RCS","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 06:02 ET (10:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e53c39ba07c60143b2d48729c1c1eeda","symR":["HERO"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Hercules Offshore, Inc.

(SOLUQ) trade creditors says an attempt by noteholders to delay voting on the company's reorganization plan is aimed at gaining leverage to negotiate a higher recovery than other general unsecured creditors are set to receive. \u001d  The group, calling itself the ad hoc Solutia trade claims committee, said the noteholder group's objection to the company's bankruptcy-exit strategy is \"based solely\" upon the fact it's now considered equal - for repayment purposes - to other unsecured creditors after losing a lawsuit against the chemical company earlier this year. \u001d  \"They are still looking for a premium to the recovery of general unsecured creditors,\" the trade creditor group said in court papers filed Friday. \u001d  The noteholder group - known as the ad hoc committee of Solutia noteholders - last week asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan to delay voting on Solutia's Chapter 11 reorganization plan until after the court considered a proposed settlement between Solutia and former corporate parent Monsanto Co. (MON). The settlement, which serves as the basis of the reorganization plan, would give 20% of Solutia's post-bankruptcy stock to Monsanto and splits most of the remaining 80% between the general unsecured creditors and noteholders. \u001d  The noteholder group said Solutia's creditors can't make an informed decision on the plan until after the settlement is vetted by the bankruptcy court. A hearing on the settlement is scheduled for Sept. 5, but creditors could begin voting on the reorganization plan as early as next week if the court approves the Chapter 11 plan's disclosure statement at a Tuesday hearing. \u001d  The trade creditors urged the Manhattan court to approve the disclosure statement Tuesday over the noteholder group's objection, saying the Monsanto deal is substantially the same as one the noteholders signed off on in April. \u001d  The difference now, according to the trade creditors, is that the noteholders are now facing equal recovery to that of Solutia's unsecured creditors after losing a lawsuit in May seeking status as a secured creditor. \u001d  \"Accordingly, they are forced to try to backpedal from their earlier disclosures since they now lack the leverage to negotiate for a premium over general unsecured creditors - unless they can somehow significantly change the Monsanto settlement,\" the trade creditors said. \u001d  In April, the noteholder group negotiated a deal to give Monsanto 17% of the reorganized Solutia's equity in exchange for a contribution toward Solutia's $650 million in environmental-cleanup costs. But on May 1, the bankruptcy court issued its decision to deny the noteholders' bid for secured-creditor status, significantly changing their expected recovery in the Chapter 11 case. \u001d  The settlement Solutia ultimately reached with Monsanto gives the former parent 20% of its reorganized equity in exchange for a $200 million payment to cover cleanup costs and a promise to cover costs from future lawsuits arising from its former chemical business before the Solutia spinoff. Noteholders, owed $450 million, are slated to receive a 44.1% stake in the reorganized company while general unsecured creditors will get 34.1% of the shares. \u001d  The trade creditors say it expects the noteholder committee to object to the settlement over Monsanto's higher post-bankruptcy stake. \u001d  \"The noteholders' committee is quibbling about $36 million, which, in the context of a company that has an estimated total enterprise value of $2.8 billion, represents barely more than 1% of that value,\" the trade creditors said. \u001d  Monsanto spun off its chemical business as Solutia in 1997. Monsanto then merged into Pharmacia Corp. in early 2000. Pharmacia spun off its agricultural business as Monsanto in 2002 and a year later the pharmaceuticals segment of the company was acquired by Pfizer Inc. (PFE). \u001d  St. Louis-based Solutia filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 17, 2003, listing total assets of $2.85 billion and debts of $3.22 billion. \b \u001d  -Marie Beaudette, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1354; marie.beaudette@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:09 ET (19:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e576bc1fc6b78d14cf4d2296984c7834","symR":["3112.FR","AKH","FR0000031122"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Air France KLM: Passenger Traffic +4.9% In June 07 Vs June 06","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T06:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["3112.FR","AKH","FR0000031122"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \u001d  AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--Air France-KLM Friday said it posted a 4.9%  rise in traffic, while capacity was up 4.5%.

The six largest health funds have 80% of the Australian market, with the remainder split between the next 31 funds. \u001d  The federal government has proposed selling off state-owned Medibank Private, the market leader with about 27% of the national health insurance market and almost 3 million members. \u001d  A spokesman for BUPA Australia, the Australian arm of British United Provident Association dismissed local newspaper reports that it was in the running as \"market speculation,\" and added BUPA was \"considering a range of opportunities.\" \u001d  BUPA entered the Australian market in 2002 when it teamed up with Macquarie Bank Ltd. to pay A$595 million for the health insurance business of general insurer AXA Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd. \u001d  The insurer, which sold its portfolio of 26 U.K. private hospitals to private equity group Cinven for GBP1.44 billion (US$2.8 billion), is cashed up and looking for opportunities to expand Australian HBA and Mutual Community brands. \u001d  Australian newspapers also reported Friday that private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Pacific Equity Partners were among the parties that have approached MBF. \u001d  Neither company was immediately available for comment. \u001d  Australians spent A$60 billion on health care in 2006, a figure that is set to double in the next 40 years as the population ages, according to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. \u001d  MBF will consider the takeover approaches but declined to name the parties because of the confidential nature of the talks, it said in a statement late Thursday. \u001d  The insurer will press ahead with its listing plans, it said. \u001d  MBF has engaged UBS and Deutsche Bank to advise on the share sale, the Australian Financial Review reported Friday. \u001d  The Sydney-based insurer has previously indicated a possible initial public offering in the first quarter of 2008. \u001d  Members of Newcastle-based NIB, the sixth-largest fund with 320,000 contributors, will vote July 19 on a plan to sell shares in the insurer for a listing in October. NIB, which has 6.8% of the nation's private health insurance market, has hired JPMorgan to arrange its initial public offering. \u001d  The federal government last year appointed Carnegie Wylie & Co. to advise on the sale of Medibank. \u001d  BUPA, MBF and NIB have all welcomed the Medibank sale, which is dependent on the re-election of the conservative government later this year. \b \b   -By Andrew Harrison, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9671-4323; andrew.harrison@dowjones.com \b   (Susan Murdoch in Melbourne contributed to this story) \b   -Edited by Graham Morgan \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:38 ET (06:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e5cc838014565424f3e45ee1ad4178e3","symR":["9984.TO","VOD","VOD.LN","GB00B16GWD56","JP3436100006","9984.TO","VOD","VOD.LN","GB00B16GWD56","JP3436100006"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,1.022672,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.022672,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,1.012999,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,1.012999,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Softbank Gains Net 204,800 Mobile Phone Users In June","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T04:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["9984.TO","VOD","VOD.LN","GB00B16GWD56","JP3436100006"],"IndustryCodes":["CTS","TLS","X225","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 00:46 ET (04:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e5cdbdb9589675697d3cb7e3d5167e02","symR":["POL"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[1.073939],"ret5":[1.094545],"Headline":"PolyOne Sees Net Book Gain On Transactions >POL","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T16:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["POL"],"IndustryCodes":["CHC","CHM","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:19 ET (16:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e5de78885a5d54db8723d8a6379ab557","symR":["MDU"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9944904],"ret5":[1.002755],"Headline":": S&P: Cascade Natural Gas Corp Affirmed>MDU","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T21:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MDU"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's: \b \u001d  SAN FRANCISCO (Standard & Poor's) July 6, 2007--Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said today that the ratings of Cascade Natural Gas Corp.

Family Room Entertainment's goal, through EFFI and EFFP, is to facilitate relationships (and as such, provide production related services) between creative talent (including writers, actors and directors) and companies who produce, finance and distribute motion pictures. FMLY derives its income from producer fees, production consulting and service fees and royalties as well as participation in the profits, if any, of certain of the pictures it produces. \b \u001d  The FMLY co-founders, Randall Emmett and George Furla, believe that they have the expertise and contacts within the entertainment industry, specifically in the competitive development, production and distribution arenas, to profitably acquire content, package product by adding value to the content with top quality talent and arrange with third parties to produce and finance motion pictures which are in the moderate to higher level budgets, which can be distributed by those with the expertise to effectively do so to a mass worldwide audience. However, there is no assurance that any motion picture, which has not yet been released, will be released, that a change in the scheduled release dates of any such films will not occur or, if such motion picture is released, it will be successful. \b \b   Forward Looking Statement: \b \u001d  Safe Harbor: Statements contained in this news release, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Hedge ineffectiveness is an accounting charge to show the effectiveness of currency, interest rate and other hedging, the company said. \u001d  Revenue will be up 26% at more than GBP1.07 billion from GBP850 million the previous year, with like-for-like sales growth of at least 10%. \u001d  Bridgewell Securities analyst Howard Seymour said the trading update was \"very strong\" and noted the profit figure was \"very good\" even though the market was anticipating a strong performance. He expects forecasts to increase but retains a neutral rating on the stock. \u001d  The U.K. and Ireland saw \"reasonably good overall levels of construction activity\" during the period, but the company said building activity was now cooling in Ireland. Revenue increased by 18% in U.K. and Ireland, and like-for-like sales growth was more than 9%. \u001d  Mainland Europe performed best, reflecting \"a general strengthening of market demand\" as well as several acquisitions, which led to revenues increasing by 50%, or 53% in local currency, and like-for-like sales growth of more than 20%. \u001d  SIG completed 14 acquisitions during the period, for GBP261 million. \u001d  The company said that the second half of 2006 \"benefited from a sharp uplift in demand in Germany, and from the positive impact of acquisitions made in that period,\" and therefore comparators for the second half would be more demanding than the first half. \u001d  But it said the board was confident \"that further progress will be made.\" \u001d  SIG's shares have risen 17% since it reported full-year results in March, boosted by the EUR297 million acquisition of French roofing products distributor Lariviere in May. SIG's shares closed Thursday at 1345 pence, valuing the company at GBP1.8 billion. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sigplc.co.uk \b \u001d  -By Molly Dover, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-207-842-9358; molly.dover@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 02:27 ET (06:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e7cc99c6f538804647eeea7e8f563068","symR":["OBAS"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9818594],"ret5":[0.9659864],"Headline":": Optibase Commences Partial Cash Tender Offer for Scopus Video Networks Ltd.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T10:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OBAS"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bHERZLIYA, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 06, 2007-- \u001d  Optibase Ltd. (NASDAQ:OBAS) announced today that it has commenced a tender offer to purchase an aggregate of 678,000 ordinary shares of Scopus Video Networks Ltd. (NASDAQ:SCOP) for a price of $5.25 per share in cash, less any required withholding taxes and without interest. Optibase currently beneficially owns 3,035,223 ordinary shares of Scopus, representing approximately 22.5% of Scopus' outstanding shares, and, following the consummation of the tender offer, would own approximately 27.6% of Scopus' outstanding shares. \b \u001d  The initial period of the tender offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York time on Monday, August 6, 2007, unless the initial offer period is extended by Optibase. If prior to the completion of the initial offer period, all the conditions to the offer are satisfied or, subject to applicable law, waived by us, the consummation of the offer would result in Optibase being the beneficial owner of Scopus shares representing more than 25.0% of the voting power in Scopus. As required by Israeli law, Optibase will then provide an additional period of four calendar days during which shareholders may tender their shares. However, shareholders will have no withdrawal rights during such additional four-calendar day period. \b \u001d  As more fully described in the Offer to Purchase relating to the tender offer, the tender offer is conditioned upon: (1) at least 678,000 ordinary shares, representing at least 5.0% of the voting power in Scopus, being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the completion of the initial offer period, (2) as required by Israeli law, since the consummation of the offer would result in Optibase beneficially owning Scopus shares representing more than 25.0% of the voting power in Scopus, the aggregate number of shares validly tendered in the offer and not properly withdrawn must be greater than the number of shares represented by notices of objection to the offer (excluding Scopus shares held by Optibase and certain affiliates of Scopus or Optibase), and (3) certain other conditions specified in the Offer to Purchase. The tender offer is not conditioned on the receipt of financing or the approval of the board of directors of Scopus. \b \u001d  On July 5, 2007, the last trading day before commencement of the offer, the closing sale price of the Scopus shares was $4.96 on Nasdaq. \b \u001d  The complete terms and conditions of the tender offer, including important U.S. and Israeli income and withholding tax considerations relating to the tender offer, are contained in the Offer to Purchase included as an exhibit to the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Computershare Trust Company N.A. is the depositary for the offer. \b \u001d  Important Information: This is not an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any ordinary shares of Scopus. The tender offer that is described in this press release will only be made through the Offer to Purchase, Letter of Transmittal and related tender offer documents. All shareholders of Scopus should read the tender offer materials, which are being filed today by Optibase, and the Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement with respect to the tender offer which will be filed in due course by Scopus, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholders of Scopus should read the tender offer materials and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement because they contain important information about the tender offer. The tender offer materials, the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement and other filed documents will be available at no charge on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov and will also be made available without charge to all shareholders by contacting The Altman Group, the information agent for the tender offer, at U.S. toll free 800-622-1525 or outside the U.S. 201-806-7300. Shareholders are urged to read these materials carefully before making any decision with respect to the tender offer. \b \u001d  Forward-Looking Statements: This press release may contain forward-looking statements. The accuracy of such statements is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, including, but not limited to, the effect of general economic conditions, political events and fluctuations in the share price of Scopus.

Revenue increased by 18% in U.K. and Ireland, and like-for-like sales growth was more than 9%. \u001d  Mainland Europe performed best, reflecting \"a general strengthening of market demand\" as well as several acquisitions, which led to revenues increasing by 50%, or 53% in local currency, and like-for-like sales growth of more than 20%. \u001d  SIG completed 14 acquisitions during the period, for GBP261 million. \u001d  The company said that the second half of 2006 \"benefited from a sharp uplift in demand in Germany, and from the positive impact of acquisitions made in that period,\" and therefore comparators for the second half would be more demanding than the first half. \u001d  But it said the board was confident \"that further progress will be made.\" \u001d  SIG's shares have risen 17% since it reported full-year results in March, boosted by the EUR297 million acquisition of French roofing products distributor Lariviere in May.

Oil's firmness may force further caution because of the effect of higher prices on consumer spending. \u001d  CMC Markets, the U.K. spreadbettor, is calling the FTSE up 3 points at 6638, but the DAX down 6 at 7981 and the CAC down 3 at 6057. \u001d  In corporate news, Swiss bank UBS, which has been buffeted by a series of setbacks including a costly blowup of an internal hedge fund, is removing Chief Executive Officer Peter Wuffli, according to people familiar with the company. \u001d  Wall Street futures are mixed after stocks seesawed in uneven post-holiday trading Thursday as a rebound in bond yields stifled investors' excitement about new buyout activity and strength in the U.S. service sector. \u001d  Payroll company Automatic Data Processing and consultancy Macroeconomic Advisers said the private sector added 150,000 jobs last month, a good sign that the Labor Department's report on June nonfarm payrolls Friday will show a solid rise. \u001d   Joe Balestrino, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Inc., said, \"If things are good, yields are supposed to be a little higher.\" \u001d  In Asia, shares in Shanghai fell Friday and paced regional markets, including Japan, lower. \u001d  The Australian market was weaker, although mining giant BHP Billiton set another record high. \u001d  FOREX: \u001d  The euro is locked in narrow ranges against the dollar and yen, pending more influences, but the market may have to wait until next week for the European currency to break free. Some traders tried to sell the euro on the ECB news but failed to get much response. \u001d  \"The dollar is weak going into the jobs report,\" said Dixon Fung, currency strategist at MG Financial in New York. \"And if the data comes in weak, traders will take advantage of it and start selling the dollar.\" A 128,000 increase in total jobs is expected. \u001d  BONDS: \u001d  European government bond prices are likely to open mixed, after they fell Thursday once Europe's central banks indicated the need for higher interest rates. However, the market came under pressure late in the session due to the release of the U.S. Institute of Supply Management services index. \u001d  The U.S. data was viewed by market participants as reducing the prospect of a reduction in interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the near-term. \u001d  \"The ECB is fretting about inflation, they have the bit between their teeth for higher rates and they should tighten again by September,\" said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns. \u001d  As for the U.K., he said, \"Expanding growth, overheating domestic demand and overcooked credit demand spill over into increased inflation risks for the U.K. economy.\" \u001d  \"The BOE looks set to stamp it out. The only doubt in the market's mind is whether the BOE is going to stop at 6.0%,\" Brown said. \u001d  \"The fact the Monetary Policy Committee continues to view that medium term inflation risks 'lie to the upside' after today's move is a pretty clear indication that they are minded to raise rates further,\" Gavin Redknap, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank said. \u001d  Treasurys are slightly higher Friday, but all that could change with the labor report. \u001d  \"Both ISM surveys signaled considerable strength in the second quarter and solid forward momentum as the economy entered the third quarter,\" said Haseeb Ahmed, economist with JP Morgan. \"Both surveys reaffirmed the message from (the weekly jobless) claims (data): labor markets remain healthy.\" \u001d  In Japan, prices of government bonds fell amid continuing caution over the policy of the Bank of Japan. Dealers look for the JGB 10-year yield to stay in a 1.85%-1.95% range next week with dip-buying demand likely strong at 1.95%. \u001d  Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui said the economy \"will likely keep its long-lasting expansion based on a favorable cycle led by production, income and expenditure.\" Fukui also said, \"The BOJ will continue to work toward sustainable economic growth and stable prices through conducting monetary policy in an appropriate manner by carefully assessing economic and price conditions.\" \u001d  ENERGY: \u001d  Oil prices are little changed Friday despite supply concerns amid renewed violence and the kidnapping of foreign oil workers in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer. \u001d  August Nymex gained 4 cents to $71.85 a barrel in Asia. The contract advanced 40 cents to settle at $71.81 Thursday despite larger-than-expected increases in U.S. crude and petroleum product inventories. \u001d  METALS: \u001d  Spot gold was up $1.90 at $650.10/oz, boosted by from slight physical buying and firmer oil prices, traders said. However, dealers saw resistance ahead in the area of $655-$660. \u001d  LME 3-month copper, now down $10 at $7,849, may ease in London trade as long position holders are likely to take profit after the metal's rally this week. But copper won't drop far, as falling inventories are supportive, leaving open the possibility of further gains expected next week. \u001d  CALENDAR: Friday, July 6, 2007 \bGMT                                                        Expected  Previous \b0645  FRA  May     Foreign Trade                           -EUR2.6B -EUR2.83B \b0645  FRA  1Q      Cost-of-Construction Index \b0730  UK   May     Mfg Output                               0.3%MM    0.3%MM \b                                                            0.9%YY    1.3%YY \b0730  UK   May     Indus Production                         0.3%MM    0.3%MM \b                                                            0.3%YY    0.4%YY \b1000  EU   May     OECD Lead Indicator                              110.0 \b1000  GER  May     Mfg Orders                               +0.5%MM   -1.2%MM \b                                                            +8.9%YY   +7.9%YY \b1100  CAN  Jun     Employment Report                        6.1%      6.1% \b1230  US   Jun     Non-farm Payrolls                        +128K     +157K \b1230  US   Jun     Unemployment Rate                        4.5%      4.5% \b1340  US   Jun     ECRI Inflation Gauge                               118.2 \b1430  US   Jun 29  US Energy Dept Natural Gas Stocks (in    +79       +99 \b                   billion cubic feet) \b1900  US   Jun     Tsy STRIPS \b2301  UK   Jun     NIESR GDP Estimates \b \u001d  -By Dennis Baker; Dow Jones Newswires; dennis.baker@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 01:00 ET (05:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"efcc1168249a43d704d7f6577b439328","symR":["VAN.BT","BE0003839561"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Belgian Bra Maker Van De Velde Says Turnover On The Rise","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T15:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VAN.BT","BE0003839561"],"IndustryCodes":["CLO","TEX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \b   Edited Press Release \b \u001d  BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--Belgian luxury bra maker Van de Velde SA (VAN.BT) said Thursday that consolidated turnover prepared in accordance with IFRS rose in the first half of the year from EUR63.5 million in 2006 to EUR67.0 million in 2007. \u001d  The strong expansion in the growth markets continued across the board.

(OTCBB: TCPS, Frankfurt: UYE.F) does business as Terocelo Inc. Terocelo is in the business of designing, developing, licensing and marketing technology focused in the communications marketplace. Terocelo is positioned in the high-growth, wireless communication market having developed breakthrough, disruptive technologies. These technologies can be integrated into many high-volume commercial markets, including cell phone, automotive, base station, Femto/Pico Cell, and First Responder markets. \b \u001d  The company has developed and patented True Software Radio(R), a proprietary technology that creates convergence for the wireless industry. True Software Radio(R) has produced the Lycon(TM) family of wireless transmitter-receiver chipsets, designed to enable cell phones, PDAs, laptops, and infrastructure with different radio frequencies, standards, and protocols to adjust by software command so that they can communicate across otherwise incompatible networks, without the need for multiple radios.

It dulls corporate reflexes, and shareholders suffer. \u001d  The complicating factor here is UBS's relatively lackluster performance in recent quarters, made worse by the embarrassing collapse of Dillon Read Capital Management, an internal hedge fund. That weakened Wuffli's position as CEO, let alone as chairman-to-be. \u001d  Ospel is now likely to make his presence felt by shifting UBS in a more conservative direction. \u001d  Ospel's decision to swap Wuffli for wealth-management executive Marcel Rohner is significant because it could foreshadow a more risk-averse approach to investment banking, which hasn't jibed well with UBS's main activity of low-risk, high-margin private banking. \u001d  Ospel represents UBS' old guard who tidied up after the bank's controversial involvement with Long Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that collapsed nine years ago. That left them battle scarred and naturally suspicious of Wall Street's risk-taking. \u001d  Wuffli represented a newer generation of managers, at ease with the rising amounts of risk UBS needed to take on in a serious foray into U.S. investment banking. \u001d  By most accounts, he and Ospel worked well together in 2001 and 2002, putting together what was meant to become a bulge-bracket investment bank as rival firms were forced to fire bankers, write off loans and generally cut back on spending in the wake of the bursting technology bubble. \u001d  Now Wuffli wouldn't be wrong in arguing that's a task that takes years to pull off, while UBS's recent acquisitions are yet to take effect. \u001d  But UBS has failed to make major inroads into fixed-income, despite heavy investment and hiring new staff, as well as revving up value-at-risk. The demise of Dillon Read Capital Management in May must have looked like a mini-LTCM to Ospel. \u001d  Despite insisting there will be no change in strategy Friday, UBS may well now slow spending to bolster its modest commodities-trading and leveraged-loan operations. \u001d  Instead, the bank might put more cash into its share buyback plan, currently worth CHF8 billion, though, if anything, UBS is ahead of its peers on this front. \u001d  It would be better to focus on making the most out of recent acquisitions to appease investors unaccustomed to the quarterly earnings disappointments UBS has delivered of late. \u001d  With Rohner - a young, undoubtedly talented UBS executive - coming to the CEO role sooner than insiders expected - largely untested by a financial-market blowout or a private-banking scandal - Ospel may argue he has more reason to bring his experience to bear UBS' daily agenda. \u001d  But the two have to show that UBS is capable of the sustainable earnings growth that it has promised with its recent investments. \b \u001d  (Arindam Nag has covered business and finance for 16 years in Asia, Europe and the United States.

The Company is slowing its capacity growth as part of its continuing plans for flight network development and cost reductions, and to help better adequate airline seat capacity growth with the capacity of the Brazilian air transportation system. \b \u001d  The revised fleet plan will meet the expected demand for air travel in the Company's markets; GOL estimates approximately 12% annual Brazilian market growth for 2007 and 2008.

For 2008, the fleet plan has reduced by eight 737-300s and two 737-700s, and increased by three 737-800s. For 2009, the fleet plan has reduced by two 737-300s, and increased by one 737-800.

For 2Q07, total operating expenses per ASK (\"CASK\") are estimated at R$14.9 cents (CASK decreased approximately 5% in the quarter versus 2Q06, excluding VRG). \b \bSOURCE  GOL Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. \b \u001d    /CONTACT: investors, GOL, +(5511) 3169 6800, ri@golnaweb.com.br; media - U.S. & Europe, G.

(together, Affinity Group), to positive from stable. At the same time, Standard & Poor's affirmed its 'B' corporate credit rating on the company. Total debt outstanding was $400 million as of March 31, 2007. \u001d  \"The improved outlook reflects our expectation of improved financial metrics after the company's sale of its retail segment,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Deborah Kinzer. \u001d  On April 16, 2007, Affinity Group announced that it entered into a stock purchase agreement with FreedomRoads Holding Co. LLC, through which FreedomRoads will acquire Affinity Group's retail segment, Camping World Inc., for $175 million. The company plans to use the estimated net proceeds of $132 million from the sale to pay down its term loans. Although the retail segment has contributed more than 50% of Affinity Group's total revenue, the segment's EBITDA margins are lower than Affinity Group's membership and publishing segments and have higher required capital expenditures, working capital usage, and operating lease expenses. \u001d  Affinity Group is a direct-marketing firm targeting North American recreational vehicle (RV) owners and outdoor enthusiasts. Through its membership operations, books, and magazines, Affinity Group markets products and services relevant to RV owners. \u001d  The ratings reflect soft membership trends at Affinity Group's RV resort network and golf discount clubs, and high debt leverage. These factors are only modestly offset by the company's good competitive position, attractive EBITDA margins, and relatively stable earnings of its core RV clubs and publishing niches. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 12:17 ET (16:17 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f5f5e0ecbc0b59f6473df1c3916cf280","symR":["MS"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9941168],"ret5":[0.9967164],"Headline":": Moody's Assigns Morgan Stanley Funds","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T18:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MS"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Moody's Investors Service: \b \u001d  London, 06 July 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned a bond fund credit rating of Aa to the Morgan Stanley Funds p.l.c. Euro Enhanced Yield Fund (\"the Fund\"), citing the high quality of the Fund portfolio in addition to the investment adviser's structured, research-driven investment management process; thorough credit process, which features both quantitative and qualitative assessments; and strong, independent compliance and risk management processes. Moody's has also assigned an MR1 market risk rating to the Fund, reflecting its very low sensitivity to changing interest rates and other market conditions. \u001d  In accordance with the objective of the Fund, which is to provide high current income to the extent consistent with maintaining capital stability and liquidity, the portfolio will consist of high quality securities. The Fund will invest in securities with long-term ratings of no less than A3 or short-term ratings of no less than P-1; given the quality of the securities and their likely final maturities, expected to be five years or fewer, the weighted average expected loss of the portfolio as a whole should be comparable to that of a Aa-rated security at all times. Although the Fund may invest in a wide range of fixed income securities, Moody's expects the portfolio to consist of corporate bonds (approximately 30%), asset-backed securities (30%) and mortgage-backed securities (30%). The remaining 10% of assets under management will be invested in short-term money market instruments to provide liquidity. \u001d  The Fund's market risk rating of MR1 is driven by the Fund's duration, expected to be in the range of three to six months but in no case more than a year. The investment adviser will generally manage duration by investing in a mix of floating- and fixed-rate assets but may make use of derivatives, primarily futures but possibly over-the-counter swaps, futures or forwards for this purpose. While the investment in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, which exhibit prepayment and extension risk, may add volatility to Fund net asset value, any such additional volatility should be compatible with the MR1 rating level. \u001d  The Fund is a sub-fund of the Morgan Stanley Funds p.l.c., a Dublin, Ireland-domiciled open-ended investment company with variable capital in accordance with the UCITS III directive. The investment manager of the Fund is Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc. and the distributor is Morgan Stanley Investment Management Limited. The custodian is State Street Custodial Services (Ireland) Limited and the administrator is State Street Fund Services (Ireland) Limited. \u001d  Moody's money market and bond fund credit ratings are opinions of the investment quality of shares in mutual funds and similar investment vehicles, which principally invest in short-term and long-term fixed income obligations, respectively. The ratings are not intended to consider the prospective performance of a fund with respect to appreciation, volatility of net asset value, or yield. Funds rated Aa are judged to be of an investment quality similar to Aa-rated fixed income obligations -- that is, they are judged to be of high quality by all standards. \u001d  Moody's market risk ratings are opinions of the relative degree of volatility of a rated fund's net asset value, with an emphasis on downside risk. The rating is not intended to consider prospective performance of a fund with respect to price appreciation or yield. Funds rated MR1 have a very low sensitivity to changing interest rates and other market conditions. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 14:58 ET (18:58 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f5f78b4c7ca23bcbe47a525d615dded0","symR":["UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483","UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9996727,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9996727,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[0.9998364,-0.00099,-0.00099,0.9998364,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UBS CEO Rohner: Taking Mkt Concerns Over Rev Lag Seriously","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T09:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UBS","UBSN.VX","CH0024899483"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XDJGI","XGTI","XNYA","XSMI","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 05:10 ET (09:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f638fd9a4fac6507d46a9d9482d44ba7","symR":["AMGN","US0311621009"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9950748,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.014046,-0.00099],"Headline":"Amgen (AMGN) Block: 320,062 Shrs At 54.82","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T20:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMGN","US0311621009"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bAMGEN INC. \bLast trade  NMS: -0.04 at 54.82 on 0.01 uptick \bTrade vol:       320,062 =    5.7% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:     774,788 =   13.9% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:   3,775,810 =   23.2% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:       5,567,376 =   34.3% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:16,244,357 / Prev day -0.33 on 11,122,877 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 16:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f63d1210f8eb9d66b65d5f491ca0265c","symR":["MSFT","US5949181045"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[0.9966633,-0.00099],"ret5":[1.027027,-0.00099],"Headline":"Microsoft (MSFT) Block: 350,000 Shrs At 29.90","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T19:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MSFT","US5949181045"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\bMICROSOFT CORP. \bLast trade NADF: -0.09 at 29.90 on 0.01 uptick \bTrade vol:       350,000 =    0.9% ttl vol. \bTtl blk vol:  10,030,250 =   25.8% ttl vol. \bAvg blk vol:  16,136,443 =   29.4% avg daily vol \bTtl vol:      38,921,472 =   70.8% avg daily vol \bAvg daily vol:54,949,328 / Prev day -0.03 on 47,844,444 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 15:03 ET (19:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f685331c263c7862738a9a9b1335cb47","symR":["KPM.XX","NEOL"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"NeoPharm Dismisses Auditor KPMG, Hires BDO Seidman >NEOL","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T21:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KPM.XX","NEOL"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","ICS","SVC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \b   DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  NeoPharm Inc.

Currently, there are few proven treatment options available to patients with breast cancer whose disease has rapidly progressed through or whose disease is not responding to prior treatment with approved chemotherapies.  This study was one of five Phase II ixabepilone studies published in this issue of JCO, including three additional studies in metastatic breast cancer and one in non-small cell lung cancer. \b \u001d  \"Drug resistance is a major concern in treating patients with advanced disease,\" said Renzo Canetta, vice president, Oncology Global Clinical Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb. \"The results of this study are important as they provide valuable information about this investigational compound and its potential in patients with advanced breast cancer that is no longer responding to any of the current U.S. approved chemotherapy treatments.\" \b \u001d  The 126 patients enrolled in the single-arm Phase II study (CA163081) had heavily pretreated, advanced metastatic breast cancer, which had progressed through three prior therapies (anthracycline, taxane and capecitabine).  The primary endpoint was objective response rate, which is an assessment of the response to treatment as determined by the independent radiology facility (IRF).  Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response, time to response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), and with the exception of OS, analyses were based on IRF data.  Response-evaluable patients were defined as patients with measurable disease, as determined by the IRF, which met the resistance criteria for anthracyclines, taxanes, and capecitabine.  Results of the 113 response-evaluable patients were assessed by the IRF, as well as independently by investigators at the study site, and showed: \b \b \b    -- Objective response rate was achieved in 11.5% of patients as determined \b       by the IRF and 18.6% as determined by the investigators. \b    -- Median duration of response of 5.7 months. \b    -- Median time to response of 6.1 weeks. \b    -- Median progression-free survival of 3.1 months. \b    -- Median overall survival of 8.6 months. \b \b \u001d  Overall treatment-related non-hematological adverse events greater than or equal to 20% included: peripheral sensory neuropathy 60% (Grade 3/4: 14%); fatigue/asthenia 50% (Grade 3/4: 14%); myalgia/arthralgia 49% (Grade 3/4: 8%); alopecia 48% (Grade 3/4: 0%); nausea 42% (Grade 3/4: 2%); stomatitis/mucositis 29% (Grade 3/4: 7%); vomiting 29% (Grade 3/4: 1%); diarrhea 22% (Grade 3/4: 1%); and musculoskeletal pain 20% (Grade 3/4: 3%).  Treatment-related hematological adverse events greater than or equal to 20% included: leukopenia 90% (Grade 3/4: 49%); anemia 84% (Grade 3/4: 8%); neutropenia 79% (Grade 3/4: 54%); and thrombocytopenia 44% (Grade 3/4: 8%). \b \b    About Ixabepilone \b \u001d  Ixabepilone is an investigational compound, a semisynthetic analog of epothilone B, designed to inhibit or prevent the growth or development of cancer cells.  Epothilones are a potential new class of antineoplastic (or chemotherapy) agents.  For information on ixabepilone clinical trials, log on to www.clinicaltrials.gov. \b \u001d  On June 19, 2007 the company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted, for filing and granted priority review of, these data as part of the New Drug Application for ixabepilone.  The target action date is in late October.  The proposed indications for ixabepilone are as a monotherapy to treat patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer after failure of an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine and in combination with capecitabine to treat patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer after failure of an anthracycline and a taxane.  The company also plans to submit these data as part of a registrational dossier in the European Union, and other countries this year. \b \b    About Bristol-Myers Squibb \b \u001d  Bristol-Myers Squibb is a global pharmaceutical and related health care products company whose mission is to extend and enhance human life. \b \u001d  This press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding product development.

The most significant changes in the product mix will occur at Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant (CMP), Mechel's main steel asset - about US$1.3 billion will be invested in the modernization of CMP. These investments will allow the plant to double its output of continuously cast steel billets while also extending its mix of construction and engineering rolled products. Mechel plans to strengthen its position as one of Russia's leading producers of long products. To fulfill this task, about US$650.0 million will be invested by 2011. \b \u001d  To achieve this objective, Coil Mill 250-2 will be modernized and a new mill will be installed to manufacture structural shapes, for which there is a strong market in Russia. This project will result in a noticeable optimization of CMP's product portfolio: instead of producing billets for export, the plant will begin manufacturing about 1 million tonnes of high margin products for Russian market. In addition, construction of a bloom machine with a complex of steel processing outside stove in the oxygen-converter shop and new rolled facilities in the blooming shop are planned. \b \u001d  The investment plan also provides for the reconstruction of CMP's existing hot and cold rolling facilities, with a concurrent increase in stainless steel flat rolled products output. To fulfill this task, US$250.0 million will be invested. The operations to realize this plan include: 1) modernization of the continuous casting slab machine and construction of the complex of steel processing outside stove to increase the annual slab output to 1.2 million tonnes; 2) reconstruction of hot rolling mill 2300/1700 to increase its annual capacity to 1.1 million tonnes, including 400,000 tonnes of thick plates; and 3) reconstruction of the cold rolling shop to increase the output of the high quality stainless steel flat products. These investments will allow the plant to expand its product mix in terms of stainless flat products' sizes and grades while also improving product quality. \b \u001d  Mechel plans to supplement its investments in CMP made during the last 2-3 years to further reduce costs. Investments allocated for this will total about US$400.0 million. The Company will continue developing sinter plant No. 2. The construction of the sinter plant is in line with Mechel's strategic objective to increase its self-sufficiency in raw materials and reduce steel production costs. Implementation of this project will allow Mechel to increase its self- sufficiency in iron ore concentrate to 70% of its total consumption. The present planned production capacity of the commissioned sinter plant amounts to about 4.5 million tonnes of sinter annually. Mechel plans to increase sinter production at CMP to 6.5 million tonnes annually by 2012. In addition, the Company is planning construction of a new blast furnace with an annual capacity of 1.7 million tonnes, while decommissioning obsolete facilities. The oxygen-converter shop will also be reconstructed. \b \u001d  Investments in the modernization of Izhstal will total about $140.0 million. The plant's technical re-equipment program provides for fundamental modernization of its steel melting operations and a reconstruction of its long product rolling facilities, which will result in an increase in its output. The Company also plans to decommission the mill's open hearth facilities, and also increase the EAF output to about 500,000 tonnes and reconstruct Mill 250. \b \u001d  In line with Mechel Targoviste's investment plan, the plant's medium-grade and small-grade rolling mill complex will be modernized, which will result in increasing its rolled section output to 500,000 tonnes annually. Also, a vacuum machine will be reconstructed in order to reduce production costs and increase its annual capacity to 200,000 tonnes. The investments in the both projects will total about $25.0 million. \b \u001d  About $105.0 million will be invested in modernization of the hardware product facilities at Mechel's subsidiaries to enable producing new types of products. \b \u001d  In the mining segment, Mechel has set an objective to increase its coal output to 25 million tonnes by 2010 from 17 million tonnes in 2006. The Company plans to invest about $1.2 billion in its coal sector during 2007-2011. About $700.0 million of that amount will be invested in Southern Kuzbass: in constructing new mines Erunakovskaya-1, Sibirginskaya (Extension 2), and Olzherasskaya-Glubokaya; in constructing the Sibirginsk Washing Plant; and implementing a cost reduction program in coal mining and transportation. \b \u001d  In order to expand its coal exports to the Asia-Pacific Region, Mechel will reconstruct Port Posiet. The investment will total about $70.0 million. As the result, the port will become a modern sea terminal. This will allow Mechel to expand its sales market and reduce costs. \b \u001d  The Company also plans to invest about $90.0 million in the modernization of mining and transportation equipment at Korshunov Mining Plant to maintain its output at 5 million tonnes. \b \u001d  Regarding high nickel prices in the long term and the permanent shortage of the metal, Mechel will invest about $300.0 million in the technical re- equipment of Southern Urals Nickel Plant. This will allow the Company to increase its nickel output to 24,000 tonnes, while reducing its production costs. \b \u001d  \"Mechel intends to continue to grow and take advantage of the opportunities ahead of it.  Our annual investments in production over the next five years amount to about US$400.0 million - US$500.0 million, and we expect to fund them out of our strong operational cash flow. Our previous capital expenditures have been key to the generation of our strong operational and financial results. The new well balanced capital expenditure program reflects Mechel's overall strategy aimed at further expanding its mining segment and increasing effectiveness and profitability of its steel segment. In both segments we are going to focus on the projects that will allow Mechel to achieve good operational results, increase value-added products output and productive efficiency,\" Mechel Management Company's Chief Executive Officer, Vladimir Polin, commented. \b \b                                     *** \b \u001d  Mechel is one of the leading Russian mining and metals companies.

He replaces Peter Wuffli, 49, effective immediately. \u001d  The move, first reported on the Wall Street Journal's Web site, appears to be the handiwork of Marcel Ospel, UBS' 57-year-old chairman, former CEO and architect of the major Swiss banking merger in 1997 that formed UBS. \u001d  Alongside the change, Ospel will extend his tenure as chairman for at least another three-year term. \u001d  UBS said the move stems from the board's unanimous refusal to accept a succession plan put forth by Ospel roughly one year ago, which called for Wuffli to succeed Ospel as chairman, with the latter retiring from the bank altogether. Ospel denied that there had been rifts in strategy and said UBS has no changes to business plans or growth initiatives underway. \u001d  However, the changes immediately gave rise to fears that Wuffli was sacked because UBS is set to report further hefty losses from a failed in-house hedge fund, Dillon Read Capital Management, which is being shut down. \u001d  \"It remains to be seen whether all of the subprime hit was kitchen-sinked last quarter, or if there is more marked-to-market in 2Q,\" said Kinner Lakhani, London-based analyst with ABN Amro. First-quarter earnings from UBS were dented by 150 million Swiss francs ($123 million) in losses from Dillon Read from trades on mortgage securities gone bad. Lakhani rates UBS at hold with and CHF80 target. \u001d  UBS Chairman Ospel said second-quarter earnings, due Aug. 14, will \"contain both positive and negative swings\" but are expected to be broadly in line with market expectations. Ospel said he wouldn't discuss Dillon Read trading patterns more specifically. \u001d  Lakhani said that is little comfort, given that sizable losses at Dillon Read or elsewhere could easily be masked though healthy returns in other units. \u001d  The shares veered sharply lower in pre-market trading, but recovered to open slightly higher. At 0833 GMT, the stock was up CHF0.45, or 0.7%, at CHF74.25 amid a largely unchanged broader Swiss blue chip market. \u001d  Analysts said they were taken aback by Wuffli's immediate departure. Rohner is assuming the top job Friday, and Ospel said Wuffli will leave \"shortly\" - given that the bank was nearing the end of a costly expansion in fixed income, where it has spent months hiring bankers and building teams in areas such as commodities and leveraged finance, traditional weak spots. \u001d  The Swiss banking regulator told the AP that it hadn't intervened in the CEO change and had learned of it Friday morning. \u001d  In recent months, Wuffli has had to contend with a slew of setbacks and with criticism from analysts over UBS' lagging share price, with some critics urging UBS to consider a break-up of the bank to avoid a conglomerate discount that has set in. \u001d  UBS has disappointed analysts several quarters running by missing earnings expectations, mainly because of rising costs for the fixed-income efforts. \u001d  As a result, UBS shares have slumped compared with those of cross-town rival Credit Suisse Group (CS). Since November, when UBS reported the first in what became a series of quarterly slides in fixed income revenue, UBS shares have shed 0.7%, while Credit Suisse stock has gained 13%. \u001d  Other setbacks for UBS include the loss of several high-profile bankers earlier this year, among them investment banking president and veteran dealmaker Ken Moelis, who left after the bank's conservative ways prevented it from making inroads in hot areas such as leveraged finance. \u001d  And in May, UBS was forced to shut in-house hedge fund Dillon Read after losses from trading mortgage securities weighed on the bank's fixed-income revenue. \u001d  Incoming CEO Rohner will also have to address calls to consider a split-up of its main arms, which are investment banking and private banking, or financial services for the wealthy. \u001d  Earlier this year, a faction of investment bankers had been pushing to spin out the investment bank from UBS, with speculation centering on Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEH). UBS rejected the speculation in May, saying it remains committed to keeping the bank together in spite of the recent turmoil. \u001d  Meanwhile, a recent study by Deutsche Bank argued that UBS should reconsider the private banking arm as well. Deutsche analyst Matt Spick urged UBS to either restructure or sell less profitable units, such as a U.S. brokerage arm, to banish a conglomerate discount UBS trades on. \u001d  Rohner will be replaced by Raoul Weil as head of the private banking arm, which also oversees business with corporate clients and a domestic retail operation . \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.ubs.com \u001d  -By Katharina Bart, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 8043; katharina.bart@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 04:52 ET (08:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f954c9b05bd92830fd65aa422cd043d4","symR":["BOT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"CBOT Holdings Cl (BOT) Block: 65,000 Shrs At 218.77","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T17:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BOT"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\bCBOT HOLDINGS INC.

What happens in Hong Kong, however, is growing in significance. \u001d  Most shares trading in China's two stock markets, in Shanghai and Shenzen, are the so-called A shares, out-of-bounds for all but a handful of overseas investors. \u001d  Fund managers do see an increasing correlation between mainland China's and Hong Kong's market, where almost all foreign investors go to get their exposure to China. \u001d  That increased correlation is particularly true in the case of the \"H-shares,\" or shares of mainland Chinese companies trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange, and the so-called \"red chips,\" companies incorporated and listed in Hong Kong. \u001d  \"The overall correlation between Hong Kong and China is increasing,\" said Richard Gao, the San Francisco-based manager of the $1.2 billion Matthews China Fund. \"Hong Kong's economy is more and more dependent on the Chinese economy.\" \u001d  In addition, more large mainland Chinese companies such as utility Huaneng Power International (HNP) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (1349.HK) have A and H shares, mainly to raise more money - and their overall profile - in the market, Gao said. \u001d  Volatility in the mainland stock markets is likely going forward. But if any downdrafts are a result of investors' knee-jerk reactions to government restrictions or speculative forces, then global ripple effects would be limited. \u001d  Only if stocks decline for fundamental reasons such as low corporate earnings expectations and macro-economic changes, \"then we will see more of an impact,\" Gao said. \u001d  An 8.9% plunge in the Shanghai Stock Exchange in February was one of the culprits in stoking a global sell-off. A 8.3% drop in June following a tripling of a trading tax, however, failed to have the same far-reaching consequences, as more investors realized how insular Chinese markets are. \u001d  Volatility and government intervention notwithstanding, foreign investors are still overweight in China for the most part, largely on an upbeat view on the Chinese economy, driven by strong inter-regional trade, robust industrial activity and export growth. \u001d  Chinese equities have gained 25% in dollar terms so far this year on the MSCI Barra index, outpacing the 20% gain in MSCI's broader emerging markets index and the 19% increase in the so-called BRIC country index, which encompasses China as well as Brazil, Russia and India. \u001d  The Chinese, on average, save roughly 40% of their earnings, keeping these massive savings mostly parked in cash, said Richard Batty, a strategist for U.K.-based Standard Life, which has about $250 million in emerging markets. \u001d  Batty likes sectors exposed to consumer trends, seeking to benefit from the country's massive savings and the favorable economic backdrop. \u001d  Companies such as sport shoe maker China Hongxing Sports (BR9.SG) are expected to ride the wave of general demand as well as an increased brand awareness among Chinese consumers, Batty said. Other sectors Standard Life likes in China include pharmaceuticals and health, on demographics and a low market penetration, and services, particularly in the education sector. \u001d  Following the example of neighboring South Koreans, who spend about 5% of their income in after-school programs for their children, more Chinese are spending more money on extra-curricular activities for their children, said Batty. Standard Life is betting on New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (EDU) to play that trend, he said. \u001d  Matthews' Gao also has his chips on the domestic consumption trends, too, although he declined to name companies. Financial and infrastructure-related companies are also among his favorites, he said. \u001d  \"In the past, the economy was driven by export growth,\" he said. \"As people's living standards improve, future growth is more dependent on the domestic side.\" \b \u001d  -By Claudia Assis, Dow Jones Newswires; 201 938 4385; claudia.assis@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 17:04 ET (21:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f9d575bd32184a7c3b57a78a1b35563e","symR":["ABVT"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": AboveNet Implements GE's Smallworld","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-06T13:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABVT"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  NEW YORK, July 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AboveNet Communications, Inc., a provider of fiber based connectivity solutions for businesses and carriers, today announced that it has implemented the Smallworld Network Inventory(TM) portfolio of products from GE Energy to help manage its extensive fiber optic network footprint.

Fears of slowing economic growth and tighter monetary policy may have increased interest in bigger, less-volatile names, but that doesn't mean there aren't still small-cap sectors and stocks poised for robust returns. \u001d  There's no question the great small-cap run has left both the blue chips and the broader market wallowing in its wake. Since the market trough in the fourth quarter of 2002, the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 Index is up 155%. That beats the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 77 percentage points and bests the S&P 500 index by 68 percentage points. \u001d  That's an astonishing performance gap, driven by unprecedented global liquidity and economic growth. It's also one that was naturally bound to narrow. \u001d  \"Contrary to popular belief, smaller-cap stocks are extremely cyclical,\" wrote Richard Bernstein, Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist, in a June report. \"In markets around the world, their performance is closely tied to global liquidity. Rising interest rates and the increasing cost of capital are not the building blocks for a small-cap bull market.\" \u001d  And although that doesn't mean small caps are in a bear market, they have indeed begun to lag. For the first half of the year, the Russell's up nearly 6%, a performance that most investors would be delighted with most of the time. But then small-cap investors have been spoiled for so long, it's almost shocking that the Russell's gain only matched that of the S&P 500. Even worse, the Russell trailed the Dow by nearly two percentage points, and the large-cap Nasdaq 100 by more than four percentage points. \u001d  But small-cap investors needn't despair. One of the big attractions of small caps is that the more they are ignored or out of favor, the more likely they are to be mispriced. \u001d  \"Whenever I see a sentiment that is overwhelming or almost unanimous  --  when every consultant, every asset manager, when every person who's paid to make asset allocations is saying that large caps should outperform  --  that makes me feel good about being in small caps,\" says Joseph Zock, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Small Cap Value fund (TSCVX). \u001d  Two themes that should continue to benefit small caps are private-equity takeouts and consolidation, and the fact that small caps are intrinsic to large-cap companies' supply chains, Zock says. \u001d  At the sector level, the best bets appear to be in technology and health care. As for tech, it benefits from a weak U.S. dollar, says Zock. \"Much of their earnings are driven from overseas, and we see a lot of companies that are undervalued in addition to being out of favor just on a cyclical basis.\" (Note: The portfolio managers interviewed for this story own the stocks they recommended.) \u001d  One small-cap tech Zock is bullish on is Cabot Microelectronics (CCMP). The company makes the fluid that removes debris created in the etching process of silicon chips. Chip producers can't afford to have any problems that reduce productivity in the fabrication process, meaning they're unlikely to try an unproven supplier, Zock says. Analysts are split on whether the stock is a Buy or Hold, according to Thomson Financial, and the median price target of $43 implies an upside of more than 18% from Cabot's Tuesday closing price of $36.28. With a forward price/earnings multiple of 21, Cabot trades in line with peers, and at less than 1.0 the forward price/earnings-to-growth, or PEG, ratio, offers a discount of about 60% to peers, according to Thomson. (PEG measures how expensive a stock is relative to its growth prospects.) \u001d  As for health care, the sector looks attractive partly because it's underperformed for so long and partly because it's defensive, says Tony Sutton, portfolio manager at the Putnam Small Cap Growth fund (PNSAX). \u001d  \"Health care has been kind of a backwater industry,\" he says. \"It's been pretty much lagging most of the other sectors. So we're overweight health care going into the back half of the year. If the strength in the market starts to either go flat or south  --  coupled with the fact that the valuations are pretty decent  --  we might get the situation where health care outperforms.\" \u001d  One of Sutton's picks is Salix Pharmaceuticals (SLXP), which specializes in drugs for gastrointestinal diseases. Xifaxan, a site-specific antibiotic, is already approved for travelers' diarrhea and is in a number of late-stage clinical trials for other disease indications. \"The data for those is coming out in the next 18 months to two years and the some those markets are just gigantic,\" Sutton says. \u001d  Analysts have the stock at Hold, partly over concern that there will be a generic competitor to Colazal, another Salix product. Their median price target of $15 implies an upside of more than 21% from Tuesday's $12.35 closing price. With a forward P/E of 12 and a forward PEG ratio of 0.6, Salix offers 60% discounts to peers by both measures. \u001d  Shifting from sectors to styles, it looks like small-cap growth is ready to come into its own, benefiting from many of the same forces favoring large caps, namely concern over a slowing global economy. \u001d  \"One trend we're seeing is a return to growth,\" says Jeffrey James, small-cap growth manager at Driehaus Capital Management. \"As the economy decelerates, a growth premium can be placed on stocks that are outgrowing the economy and their peers. And the growth premium going back to 1979 is at its lowest level on a P/E, price/sales and price/book basis.\" \u001d  The market is certainly favoring small-cap growth over small-cap value so far in 2007, with total return of the Russell 2000 Growth Index exceeding that of the Russell 2000 Value Index by almost six percentage points over the past six months. That's quite a turnabout considering that value has outperformed growth consistently this decade. \u001d  Within small-cap growth, James is also bullish on tech, as well as alternative energy, commercial aerospace and agriculture. Within agriculture, James offers an interesting derivative play on the ethanol boom: Titan International (TWI). The company makes tires for all manner of agricultural vehicles, including tractors, combines and plows. Analysts have Titan at Buy, and their median price target of $36.50 implies an upside of 13% from Tuesday's close of $32.27. There's no PEG ratio for the stock and its forward P/E of 19 offers a 10% premium to peers, but then that's not out of order for a growth stock. \u001d  The small-cap party may not be as raucous as it

(VMED), all of whom compete with BSkyB for U.K. television viewers, have warned the Commission that BSkyB's position could have a negative impact on a range of issues, from competition to news provision. \u001d   BSkyB, the U.K.'s dominant pay television operator, unexpectedly bought its stake in ITV, the country's largest commercial free to air operator, in November. \u001d  The BBC, Channel 4, and ITN, a news provider which is part-owned by ITV, also warn that the shareholding could damage the independence and impartiality of news provision in the U.K. \u001d  The Competition Commission is consulting media organizations as it investigates BSkyB's position, after two U.K. regulators, Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading, referred the matter to the Commission. \u001d  \"BSkyB already has a history of using its powerful market positions adversely to affect its rivals' ability to compete,\" Virgin Media said in its submission. \"The acquisition provides it with an additional incentive and ability to do so.\" \u001d  Virgin Media has vocally criticized BSkyB for its share purchase in ITV, which was made shortly after Virgin, then trading as NTL Inc., approached ITV seeking bid talks. Virgin has since launched a lawsuit against BSkyB in England's High Court, alleging it behaves anticompetitively in supplying programs and services to rival operators. \u001d  Channel 4, which is commercially operated under license to the U.K. government, said it believed BSkyB's position in ITV would lead to a \"substantial lessening of competition in U.K. broadcasting and related markets.\" \u001d  Channel 4 also noted that \"the bringing under common control of two of the three material television news suppliers is not in the public interest since it will result in an unacceptable reduction in the plurality of persons with control of U.K. media enterprises.\" \u001d  BSkyB wasn't immediately available to comment Friday. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sky.com \u001d                 http://www.competition-commission.org.uk \u001d  -By Jessica Hodgson, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 92 93; jessica.hodgson@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 06, 2007 11:16 ET (15:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fd5d4894a47e5e15a322efe91ea86e55","symR":["MMCE","US55312Q2084"],"date":"2007-07-06","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": MMC Energy, Inc.

One of the greatest, most popular, and charismatic wrestlers of all time, Hogan virtually single-handedly took the world of professional wrestling from cult following into the mainstream of American entertainment. Hogan made his pro debut in 1978 and later in the early 1980's was cast as Thunderlips in the hit movie Rocky III, which propelled him into the international spotlight. He then entered the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1983. Hogan won the WWF title numerous times, and was credited with dealing Andre the Giant his first loss in pro wrestling. After leaving the WWF he made his comeback with World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the WWF's bitter rival. \b \b    About DMGI \b \u001d  Founded in 2005, Digital Music Group, Inc.

Analysts said technical traders were also propping up the market on strong buy signals sent by crude once it crossed the $70 threshold. \b \u001d  Crude for August delivery was last trading at $72.66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 85 cents from Thursday's close. \b \u001d  Top gainers in the oil group included U.S.-traded shares of Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), up nearly 2.7% at $85.12, and France's Total SA (TOT), up 2.5% at $84.09. \b \u001d  The gains follow a note from Deutsche Bank's London office upgrading much of the European integrated oil sector. The broker raised its second-quarter earnings estimates on the group by an average 12% following an upward revision to its long-term crude-oil price forecast. \b \u001d  Among individual stocks, Deutsche Bank lifted its recommendation on Royal Dutch Shell to buy from hold and raised its target price on BP PLC (BP) to 670p from 580p. \b \u001d  Amid the upgrades and the higher oil price, Dow Jones Industrial Average component Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) was up 1% at $86.05 a share while Chevron Corp. (CVX) was ahead 1.3% at $87.66 and ConocoPhillips (COP) was up 0.9% at $81.48. \b \u001d  Friday's initial gains were keeping the Amex Oil Index on track for a 3.5% advance for the holiday-shortened week. \b \u001d  The Amex Natural Gas Index was up 0.5% at 515.5 points, rising from a flat opening despite a slightly bearish weekly gas-supply report from the Energy Information Administration. The data, which typically is released Thursday, was delayed a day by the Independence Day holiday. \b \u001d  The EIA said gas inventories rose 78 billion cubic feet for the week ended June 29, putting total stocks at 2.52 trillion cubic feet. That works out to 84 bcf less than a year ago but is still a stubbornly high 364 bcf more than the five-year average. \b \u001d  Natural-gas futures fell 2% to $6.47 per million British thermal units on the report since traders had been expecting a slightly lower build in supplies. \b \u001d  Banc of America Securities lowered its second-quarter earnings estimates for the exploration and production sector by about 8% on average, due to \"wider natural price gas differentials [especially in the Rockies] than what we had previously modeled, along with other adjustments and fine-tuning.\" \b \u001d  The broker said its revised earnings estimates put it slightly below the Wall Street consensus for the group. It cautioned that other analyst estimates appear overly optimistic for Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC), Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ) and EnCana Corp.

Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 are expected to range from $113.5 million to $115.5 million, compared to net sales of $115.9 million for the second quarter of 2006. Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2007 are expected to range from $223 million to $225 million, compared to net sales of $222.8 million for the corresponding six-month period in 2006. \b \u001d  Norman Stout, Inter-Tel's Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We are releasing this preliminary net sales data to provide more current information to Inter-Tel stockholders as they consider how to vote on the proposed Mitel merger. In particular, we did not meet the second quarter net sales used in the projections in our proxy statement for the Mitel merger, and we also expect to be well below projected net sales for the second half of 2007 and the full year 2007, based on the current sales trends and trajectory.\" \b \u001d  Preliminary net sales of core telephone systems and software in 2007 did not meet the level of such sales used in the projections, as a result of lower than anticipated larger size system sales and not meeting growth targets for smaller size system sales. While Inter-Tel remains optimistic about the sales potential of the 7000 family of network communications solutions, sales of larger line size systems, including the 7000 family, did not meet Inter-Tel's projections. \b \u001d  Craig Rauchle, Inter-Tel's President and Chief Operating Officer, added, \"We are pleased that despite a significant amount of distraction and a difficult and highly competitive sales environment, our associates and sales channel personnel were able to achieve these overall levels of sales.\" \b \u001d  Significant variables that could affect the actual level of net sales for the remainder of 2007 include the impact of the emerging competitive landscape in telephony, whether the Company is able to increase sales of larger line size systems, whether projected growth targets for smaller size systems sales can be realized, how sales of the Company's products are impacted by the pending Mitel merger, and how the Company's business and results of operations are impacted by the continued expense, distraction and disruption from proxy fights. \b \u001d  Inter-Tel does not intend to update the projections contained in its definitive proxy statement for the Mitel merger, but will include the preliminary net sales information described in this press release in a supplement to the definitive proxy statement which will be filed with the SEC and sent to Inter-Tel stockholders. \b \b   About Inter-Tel (Delaware), Incorporated \b \u001d  Inter-Tel (Nasdaq: INTL) offers value-driven communications products; applications utilizing networks and server-based communications software; and a wide range of managed services that include voice and data network design and traffic provisioning, custom application development, and financial solutions packages. An industry-leading provider focused on the communication needs of business enterprises, Inter-Tel employs approximately 1,940 communications professionals, and services business customers through a network of 57 company-owned, direct sales offices and approximately 300 authorized providers in North America, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and South Africa. More information is available at www.inter-tel.com. \b \b   Forward-Looking Statements \b \u001d  This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements regarding preliminary net sales results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2007. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical or current facts, statements based on assumptions, suppositions and uncertainties, statements about beliefs and expectations, and the Company management's projections and evaluations of future events. Forward-looking statements may be statements in the future tense and often include the words \"may,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" \"projects\" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. In particular, any statements regarding expectations with respect to future sales and profitability or management's expectations of actual 2007 second-quarter net sales and related financial performance and other matters are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company's control and may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those projected or implied in such forward-looking statements. Inter-Tel disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \b \u001d  The preliminary net sales results for the second quarter of 2007 described in this press release have not been reviewed or audited by Ernst & Young, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and are subject to confirmation and change. Risks and uncertainties that might cause actual results to differ from those reflected in the preliminary results include, but are not necessarily limited to, the risk that Inter-Tel's actual net sales may be different from those anticipated; timing and size of orders from and shipments to major customers; proper identification of GAAP revenues and deferred revenues before all reviews have been completed; reliance on accounting systems, procedures and processes performed on an accelerated basis to identify the appropriate net sales volumes in the United Sates and in our international operations; and accounting for extended warranties and maintenance. Other important factors that might affect actual results, performance or achievements of the Company include, among other things, failure to complete the proposed merger with Mitel; the outcome of any discussions with or actions by Mr. Mihaylo and affiliated parties; effects of the announcement and pendency of the proposed Mitel merger; effects on the Company's business associated with the announcement of Mr. Mihaylo's leveraged recapitalization strategy or his proxy contest intentions; evolution in customer demand for the Company's products and services; fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality; uncertainty of future operating results; industry, competitive and technological changes; price and product competition; general market trends or economic changes, and the impact of recently enacted or proposed regulations. For a further list and description of risks and uncertainties that may impact the Company, please see the Company's previously filed SEC reports, including the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 15, 2007, its Form 10-Q filed on May 10, 2007, its Current Reports on Form 8-K, and the Company's definitive proxy statement for the upcoming special meeting of stockholders. \b \b   Additional Information \b \u001d  In connection with the pending Mitel merger, Inter-Tel filed a definitive proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 29, 2007.
