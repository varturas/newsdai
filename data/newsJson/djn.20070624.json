(LMT) expects there to be U.S. demand for more than 200 of its C-130J cargo planes in coming years, business development executive Jim Grant said in a Paris Air Show interview. \u001d  The Pentagon hasn't yet begun to aggressively seek funds for a big new purchase. But the U.S. Air Force has said it would like to buy 115 more planes for special operations missions, and possibly another 50 or so combat delivery aircraft as older models wear out. \u001d  Lockheed Martin also predicts the Marine Corps will want to buy more C-130J tankers to replace its aging fleet, and the Coast Guard could follow suit. This would add up to healthy ongoing demand for the workhorse cargo plane, which former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld tried to cancel in late 2004. \u001d  \"We see a very, very bright future for the C-130J,\" said Grant, Lockheed Martin's vice president for customer engagement on airlift programs. \u001d  International sales also are a possibility, but in smaller numbers. This week, Norway's parliament approved a proposed four-plane deal. Canada, India and Israel also are looking at proposed purchases, Lockheed Martin said. \u001d  Teal Group, a Washington-area consulting firm, expects the C-130J line to sell 18 to 20 aircraft per year through at least 2020. Richard Aboulafia, the firm's aircraft expert, said international sales are on track to pick up because Lockheed Martin has lowered its per-plane price. \u001d  A new C-130J currently sells for between $55 million and $65 million per aircraft, depending on purchase options, Grant said. The plane comes in two basic styles, a short-body version for special missions and a longer plane for routine transport use. \u001d  Lockheed's cargo plane outlook also will be affected by U.S. Air Force plans to upgrade cockpits in older C-130 models. Boeing Co. (BA) is developing an avionics modernization program kit and will build the first batch of so-called AMP kits. \u001d  But Boeing and Lockheed may face off for mass production of the kits because of lingering fallout from an Air Force procurement scandal. The Air Force said last week that the C-130 AMP production competition is slated for fiscal year 2011. \u001d  Boeing will be required to qualify contractors to compete for that contract, the Air Force said. That could affect any cockpit upgrades sought for foreign fleets, as well as the U.S. inventory. The Air Force recently reduced the number of C-130s it plans to upgrade, saying it would prefer to buy new planes if it can find the money. \u001d  So far, the Air Force has sought information from interested bidders on the special operations cargo planes. Analysts say Lockheed Martin has a clear shot to win the contract, if the Air Force gets the money to move forward.    Many companies have expressed interest in learning about the cargo plane program, according to a U.S. government contracting Web site. But at the Paris Air Show, executives from Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) and the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. (5730.FR) said they had no current plans to try to sell the U.S. Air Force the Airbus A400M, a new EADS cargo plane that will be larger than the C-130J, in a partnership similar to their joint tanker plane bid. \u001d  \"I'm not aware of a requirement which the United States Air Force has for a platform of that characteristic,\" said Northrop Grumman chief executive Ronald Sugar, when asked about the A400M at a press conference. \"If there is in fact a requirement in the future for an airplane in that class, we'll certainly be talking.\" \u001d  Northrop Grumman is named on a U.S. Air Force Web site listing companies interested in the special operations cargo plane solicitation. Lockheed Martin is also on the list, but EADS isn't. \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; Rebecca.Christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24,

(Nasdaq: ISIS) announced today the presentation of five \bresearch studies demonstrating potent and selective antisense inhibition of \bmultiple gene targets involved in metabolic disorders such as diabetes, \bobesity and dyslipidemia.  The presentations made during the American Diabetes \bAssociation's (ADA) 67th Scientific Sessions in Chicago included studies in a \bvariety of animal models ranging from mice to monkeys in which the effects of \bantisense drugs against a diverse set of targets were evaluated, including \bPTP-1B, SGLT2 and PKC-delta for diabetes, and JNK1 and mDIC for obesity.  The \bhighlights of each study along with information about each target are provided \bbelow. \b\b \b   The use of advanced and proprietary antisense chemistries has allowed Isis \bto rapidly evaluate many potential targets for treatment of complex diseases \bsuch as diabetes and obesity in well established animal models.  To date, Isis \bhas analyzed the effects of inhibiting over 120 distinct gene targets in \banimals, and this efficiency in the drug discovery process has resulted in a \brich supply of promising drugs with which to populate its future pipeline. \b\b \b   \"As shown by the presentations, our program is making excellent progress \bexpanding our metabolic disease franchise in diabetes, and we are also \badvancing well toward our recently-defined goal of identifying novel anti- \bobesity agents,\" said C. Frank Bennett, Ph.D., Senior Vice President of \bResearch, Isis Pharmaceuticals.  \"In our pipeline we have ISIS 113715, a novel \binsulin sensitizer targeting PTP-1B which may also promote weight loss.  In \baddition, we have ISIS 325568, targeting glucagon receptor, which inhibits \bglucagon action in the liver and has additional potentially disease-modifying \beffects in the pancreas.  And we have ISIS 377131, targeting glucocorticoid \breceptor selectively in liver and fat, which has multiple metabolic effects in \baddition to lowering glucose such as anti-obesity and lipid-lowering effects. \bFinally, we are evaluating drugs targeted to SGLT2 that act in the kidney to \bincrease glucose excretion in urine.  Thus we have created a pipeline of drugs \bthat work in unique and complementary ways to potentially treat diabetes.\" \b\b \b\b    Summary of the ADA presentations (including two late-breaking abstracts): \b\b \b   Increased Circulating Total and High Molecular Weight Adiponectin (HMW) \bConcentrations and Improved Insulin Sensitivity After Treatment with an \bAntisense Oligonucleotide Targeting Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) \bin Obese Insulin-Resistant Rhesus Monkeys (late-breaking abstract) \b\b \b   Authors: P. J. Havel*, M. M. Swarbrick*, K. L. Stanhope*, S. F. Murray, B. \bP. Monia, S. Bhanot; Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; *University of California, \bDavis, CA \b\b \b   ISIS 113715 is an antisense drug that inhibits the production of protein \btyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B), an enzyme that reduces the activity of the \binsulin receptor in response to insulin stimulation.  ISIS 113715 is currently \bin Phase 2 development for type 2 diabetes, and in human and animal studies to \bdate, the drug has demonstrated reductions in blood glucose levels without \bcausing hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, weight gain or nausea.  The current \bstudy demonstrated that the glucose lowering effects of ISIS 113715 may be \bmediated in part by an increase in a key fat-derived hormone, adiponectin. \bFive obese, insulin-resistant monkeys that were treated with ISIS 113715 for 4 \bweeks demonstrated improved insulin sensitivity and reduced fasting insulin \blevels.  The monkeys also had increased levels of adiponectin, particularly \bthe most potent form (HMW adiponectin), which is known to improve insulin \bsensitivity. Results from these studies suggest that ISIS 113715 improves \binsulin sensitivity in part by increasing the levels of circulating \badiponectin. \b\b \b   Sanjay Bhanot, M.D., Ph.D., Vice President of Metabolic Diseases Research \b& Development, Isis Pharmaceuticals, commented, \"These data extend our \bprevious findings and demonstrate that just 4 weeks of treatment with ISIS \b113715 completely normalized insulin resistance in obese monkeys, which \bunderscores the important role of PTP-1B in mediating insulin resistance in \bprimates.  Another novel finding from this study was that one major mechanism \bby which ISIS 113715 likely mediates its insulin enhancing effects is by \bincreasing adiponectin levels, particularly the most potent form of this \bhormone.  Increases in adiponectin could mediate both the insulin sensitizing \band anti-obesity effects that have been observed with ISIS 113715 in \bpreclinical studies.  We look forward to exploring this potential mechanism as \bwe further the drug in Phase 2 development.\" \b\b \b   Short (12-nucleotide) 2nd Generation Antisense Oligonucleotides \bSelectively Inhibit SGLT2 Expression Across Multiple Species and are \bBioavailable Following Intrajejunal Administration \b\b \b   Authors:  E. V. Wancewicz, A. Siwkowski, B. Meibohm*, C. R. Yates*, M. \bPearce, J. Matson, N. Y. K. Chew, C. E. Lillie, L. Tillman, G. Hung, R. S. \bGeary, S. Bhanot, B. P. Monia; Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; *University of \bTennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN \b\b \b   The sodium dependent glucose transporter type 2 (SGLT2) contributes to \bglucose re-absorption in the kidney.  Decreasing SGLT2 function promotes \bglucose excretion to help reduce blood sugar levels, making it an attractive \btarget for the treatment of diabetes.  In the study presented at the ADA \bconference, the authors demonstrated in several animal species that antisense \binhibitors of SGLT2 effectively reduced target mRNA levels, increased urinary \bglucose excretion and consequently lowered blood glucose levels without \bcausing dangerously low levels of blood sugar known as hypoglycemia. The data \breported included studies conducted in dogs and rats with treatment periods \branging from 6-20 weeks.  In the ZDF diabetic rats, weekly treatment with a \blow dose (1.6 mg/kg/week) of the antisense inhibitor of SGLT2 produced a \bsustained and significant (>40%) decrease in fed plasma glucose levels and a \bHbA1c decrease of >4 percentage points compared to untreated or control \btreated groups.  Collectively, the studies not only confirm SGLT2 as a good \btherapeutic target for diabetes, but also demonstrate that Isis' antisense \bSGLT2 inhibitors are highly potent and have significant potential for oral \bdelivery.  These compounds effectively and specifically inhibit the production \bof SGLT2 in the kidney tissue, without having any effect on related gene \bproducts such as SGLT1 and SGLT3. \b\b \b   \"We think a drug that improves glucose excretion will be an exciting \baddition to our pipeline of diabetes drugs which act through distinct \bmechanisms,\" said Brett P. Monia, Ph.D., Vice President of Antisense Drug \bDiscovery, Isis Pharmaceuticals.  \"This is the first kidney target that we \bhave approached with our second-generation drugs, and we are certainly \bencouraged by what we have seen in the animal models.  The high potency of our \boptimized antisense drugs targeted to SGLT2, coupled with the drugs' \bselectivity in inhibiting production of SGLT2 without affecting SGLT1 or \bSGLT3, makes a compelling case for the development of such molecules for the \btreatment of diabetes.\" \b\b \b   Acute Inhibition of Liver PKC-Delta Prevents Hepatic Insulin Resistance \bCaused by Short-Term Lipid Infusion (late-breaking abstract) \b\b \b   Authors:  E. Park*, X. Guan*, B. Tse*, A. I. Oprescu*, I. G. Fantus*, S. \bBhanot, R. McKay, A. Giacca; Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; *University of \bToronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada \b\b \b   Protein kinase C-delta (PKC-delta) activity has been associated with \bcertain types of liver insulin resistance, but whether it is a mediator of \bthis problem has been difficult to determine because of the lack of selective \binhibitors. These experiments were designed to determine whether PKC-delta \bplays a key role in free fatty acid (FFA)-induced insulin resistance that may \bcontribute to diabetes.  In this study the authors demonstrated that potent \band specific antisense inhibition of PKC-delta in the liver led to reduced \bFFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance in rats without affecting insulin \bsensitivity.  The results provide evidence for a contribution of PKC-delta in \bcausing hepatic insulin resistance and point to the therapeutic potential of \bPKC-delta as a target to treat type 2 diabetes. \b\b \b   Reduction in JNK1 Expression Lowers Adiposity and Improves Insulin \bSensitivity in Diet-Induced Obese Mice \b\b \b   Authors:  S. F. Murray, L. M. Watts, S. Booten, J. Tokorcheck, B. P. \bMonia, S. Bhanot, X. X. Yu; Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \b\b \b   A number of studies indicate that c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) \bcontributes to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.  The authors have \bpreviously presented their observations that treatment of genetically obese \bmice with antisense inhibitors of JNK1 reduced body fat content and improved \bmetabolic syndrome (insulin resistance and dyslipidemia). This study extends \bthose observations to mice with diet-induced obesity.  The mice were fed a \bhigh-fat diet and subsequently treated twice weekly for 6.5 weeks with an \bantisense inhibitor of JNK1 or a control compound.  The JNK1 antisense drug \bdid not affect food intake but reduced JNK1 mRNA in the appropriate tissues \b(liver and fat), and reduced body weight, reduced body fat content, and \bincreased metabolic rate.  Mechanistically, these effects were consistent with \bvarious secondary changes in gene expression triggered by reduced JNK1 levels. \bThe results suggest that therapeutic inhibition of JNK1 in the tissues where \bantisense drugs naturally distribute could provide clinical benefit for \bobesity and metabolic syndrome. \b\b \b   Antisense Reduction of mDIC Expression Lowers Body Weight and

Scientific Sessions in Chicago-- \b\b \b\b \b   SAN DIEGO and CHICAGO, June 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Orexigen(TM) \bTherapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: OREX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the \btreatment of central nervous system disorders with an initial focus on \bobesity, today announced that data from a sub-study of its Phase IIb multi- \bcenter clinical trial of Contrave(TM) demonstrated robust improvements in both \bvisceral fat and insulin resistance. \b\b \b   Contrave is a proprietary fixed dose combination of bupropion SR \b(sustained release) and Orexigen's novel formulation of naltrexone SR in a \bsingle tri-layer tablet. Contrave is designed to act on neurons in the brain \bwith the goal of achieving appetite suppression, decreased food craving, and \bsustained weight loss. \b\b \b   Across the three Contrave arms, the mean reduction in visceral fat ranged \bfrom 13.7% to 16.7% after 24 weeks of treatment compared to a mean 4.6% \breduction among the placebo group. Moreover, the effect of Contrave was \bsubstantially larger than that seen with either of Contrave's individual \bcomponents when given alone. Visceral fat is located inside the abdominal \bcavity and surrounds vital organs such as the liver. Visceral fat \baccumulation, as opposed to subcutaneous fat which is found just underneath \bthe skin, is associated with increased risk of heart disease and Type II \bdiabetes. \b\b \b   Additional findings from this sub-study of 107 obese subjects revealed \bthat Contrave improved measures of insulin resistance and demonstrated a \bpositive impact on a number of other risk factors including triglycerides, \bcholesterol, and blood sugar. Together, such improvements hold potential for \blonger term health benefits. \b\b \b   \"These clinical findings suggest the weight loss associated with Contrave \balso included a substantive loss in visceral fat. This is important for both \bpatients and physicians because of the well-recognized link between visceral \bfat, diabetes and heart disease,\" said Gary Tollefson, M.D., Ph.D., Orexigen \bPresident and CEO. \"We believe that Contrave may represent an important new \bweapon in the treatment of obesity, not only for the weight loss it appears to \bproduce, but also for its potential impact on the behavioral and metabolic \bsequelae associated with obesity.\" \b\b \b   \"The effect of Contrave on markers of insulin resistance is a novel \bobservation that has potential to demonstrate a greater level of \bpharmacological synergy than had been anticipated,\" said Frank Greenway, M.D., \bPrincipal Investigator of the study and Professor and Chief of the outpatient \bdepartment at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge. \"In \bthis study, the effect of Contrave on insulin resistance and other metabolic \bfactors was superior to what was seen with placebo, bupropion, or naltrexone \balone.\" \b\b \b   Contrave is now being studied in two separate multi-center Phase III \bstudies, one of which is designed to assess its safety and efficacy in obese \bsubjects with Type II diabetes. \b\b \b   Data on the effect of Contrave on visceral fat and insulin resistance will \bbe presented at the ADA 67th Scientific Sessions on Saturday, June 23rd, 6:00- \b7:15pm and Monday, June 25th, 12:00-2:00pm in Chicago (IL).  Contrave data can \bbe found in category 20B, poster number 45LB entitled, \"Weight Loss with \bBupropion and Naltrexone Improves Markers of Insulin-Resistance.\" \b\b \b\b    About Orexigen Therapeutics \b\b \b   Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the \bdevelopment of pharmaceutical product candidates for the treatment of central \bnervous system disorders, with an initial focus on obesity. Orexigen's lead \bcombination product candidates targeted for obesity are Contrave(TM), which is \bin Phase III clinical trials, and Empatic(TM) (formerly Excalia(TM)), which is \bin a Phase IIb clinical trial. Both product candidates take advantage of the \bCompany's understanding of how the brain appears to regulate appetite and \benergy expenditure, as well as the mechanisms that come into play to limit \bweight loss over time. Each product candidate is designed to act on a specific \bgroup of neurons in the central nervous system with the goal of achieving \bappetite suppression and sustained weight loss. Further information about the \bCompany can be found at http://www.Orexigen.com. \b\b \b\b    Forward Looking Statements \b\b \b   Orexigen cautions you that statements included in this press release that \bare not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements.

By Nicolas Parasie \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--The French Finance Ministry Sunday said it plans to reduce its stake in France Telecom (FTE) by 5% to reduce public debt. \u001d  The French government intends to sell 130 million shares in the country's largest telecoms company, but that number could increase to 180 million, or 7% of France Telecom's share capital, depending on the demand. \u001d  After the planned offer, the French government, directly or indirectly, will still own between 25.5% and 27.4% of France Telecom. \u001d  Newly appointed Finance Minister Christine Lagarde in a statement said the state \"intends to remain a significant shareholder in France Telecom in the medium term.\" \u001d  The government will use the proceeds of the stake reduction to reduce its debt. \u001d  France Telecom recently sold its Dutch unit for just over EUR1.3 billion to Deutsche Telekom AG (DT). \u001d  France Telecom is Europe's second-largest telecommunications company, behind Deutsche Telekom, in terms of customer totals and revenue. \u001d  The stake reduction could be seen as an important sign that French President Nicolas Sarkozy is serious about reducing state involvement in the economy. In addition, Sarkozy will need the proceeds of these transactions to help finance tax cuts and other reforms. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.francetelecom.com/fr/ \u001d  - By Nicolas Parasie, Dow Jones Newswires; nicolas.parasie@dowjones.com; +33 1 40 17 1770 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 14:39 ET (18:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"11d87319ef0ddb63a6d248f8bb90b61d","symR":["US0383161058"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Applix Inc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T07:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["US0383161058"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  Applix Inc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=US0383161058 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 03:10 ET (07:10 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"11e03bf6b2f6ad71a0e40dea588c72f4","symR":["RET.LN","GB00B05KXB62"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Retec Digital plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T09:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RET.LN","GB00B05KXB62"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","MED"],"Story":"\u001d  Retec Digital plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B05KXB62 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"11f4b28a4a61fafbf14fb7a74746050f","symR":["AMLN","LLY","US5324571083"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": BYETTA(R) Treatment for Three and -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T19:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMLN","LLY","US5324571083"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b        JAMA. 2004: 291(3), 335-342. \b\b \b\b \b\bSOURCE  Eli Lilly and Company \b\b \b     /CONTACT: Kindra Strupp of Lilly, +1-317-277-5170 office, +1-317-554-9577 cell; or Alice Bahner Izzo of Amylin, +1-858-642-7272 office, +1-858-232-9072 cell \b\b    /Web site: http://www.lilly.com \b\b    /Web site: http://www.amylin.com \b\b    /Web site: http://www.lillydiabetes.com \b\b    /Web site: http://www.BYETTA.com/ \b\b \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 15:56 ET (19:56 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1214d1fb2d362972d5f1eb37cd8b4362","symR":["BHD"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Strategic Bond Trust (BHD)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T07:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BHD"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  BlackRock Strategic Bond Trust (BHD): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BHD or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 03:34 ET (07:34 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"12874793fb890e3d2a197c8c6652af8b","symR":["OREX"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Orexigen: Contrave Has Positive Effect On Visceral Fat, Insulin Resistance>OREX","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T19:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OREX"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 15:49 ET (19:49 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"12ae84cb7c311f7e4b57236a2f0391e2","symR":["AVID"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Avid Technology","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T07:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AVID"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","MOV","XDJGI","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Avid Technology: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=AVID or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 03:14 ET (07:14 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"12bab58ce2a78b748d544a9ca7969987","symR":["2804.TO","JP3831200005"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Steel Partners Japan Comments on Today's Vote by Shareholders of Bull-Dog Sauce","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T04:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["2804.TO","JP3831200005"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP"],"Story":"\bTOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 24, 2007-- \u001d  Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund (Offshore), L.P. (\"SPJSF\"), the largest shareholder of Bull-Dog Sauce Co. Ltd. (TOKYO:2804) (the \"Company\"), made the following comments on the result of the vote by shareholders of the Company on the proposal to approve the issuance of stock acquisition rights (\"SARs\") at its annual general meeting of shareholders held in Tokyo today. This proposal was approved at the Company's annual general meeting. \b \u001d  SPJSF opposed the Company's proposal because it believes the Company sought to implement measures to dilute SPJSF's shareholdings and prevent its tender offer. SPJSF plans to continue to seek to block the issuance of the SARs through legal action. \b \u001d  Mr. Warren Lichtenstein, manager of SPJSF, commented: \"We are disappointed that the proposed \"SARs\" have been approved. We believe that this anti-takeover measure will materially harm the Company's value and question why the Board is using Company assets - that could otherwise be used for the Company's growth - to oppose a bid by a supportive, long-term shareholder to acquire more shares in the Company. Such a scheme, if allowed to be carried out, would be detrimental to the legal framework of corporate Japan, would weaken international faith in the integrity of the Japanese capital markets and could deter investment in Japanese companies and Japan's national economy as a whole.\" \b \u001d  SPJSF commenced the tender offer through Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund - SPVII LLC (\"SPVII\") with the goal of acquiring 100% of the total voting rights of the Company (including shares it currently owns). SPJSF strongly believes that the Company's management has no right to block its tender offer because the partnership is a responsible bidder and should not be penalized for having faith in the Company and its prospects. SPJSF has repeatedly stated that it is solely interested in owning the Company and would give the management the requisite time and assistance to carry out its business plans. \b \u001d  SPVII is offering Yen 1,700 per share (a 26.7% premium to the 1-month average closing share price prior to SPJSF's submission of a letter of intent to commence the tender offer, and a 25.8% premium to the 12-month average closing share price) and Yen 1 per SAR. The tender offer is set to expire on August 10, 2007. \b \b   About SPJSF \b \u001d  Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund (Offshore), L.P. is a long-term relationship/active value investor that seeks to work with the management of its portfolio companies to increase corporate value for all stakeholders and shareholders. \b \b    CONTACT: Media Contact: \b             PRAP JAPAN \b             Ian

WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA \b \u001d  TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Shareholders in a Tokyo condiment maker approved a plan to block a U.S. fund's takeover attempt on Sunday, raising the stakes in a court decision expected this week that will help define the lengths companies can go to protect themselves. \u001d  At their annual general meeting, Bull-Dog Sauce Co. (2804.TO) shareholders approved the use of a defense measure, widely known as a \"poison pill,\" that would dilute the stake held by Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund (Offshore) L.P. and would make it less likely the fund will succeed with a tender offer it opened in May. The plan gives all shareholders, except Steel Partners, warrants to buy three new shares of the company for less than a penny each. The fund will receive cash instead but see its stake watered down to less than 3% from more than 10%. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  Sunday's decision, supported by more than two-thirds of Bull-Dog's shareholders, ratchets up the stakes in a lawsuit filed by the fund. Steel Partners claims the company's poison pill violates Japanese law by targeting a specific shareholder - the fund. The court is expected to rule on the legality of the pill as early as Tuesday. \u001d  Investors and lawyers are watching the case closely because it is widely expected to set a precedent for the use of corporate defense measures in Japan, where management is facing a surge in challenges from newly restive shareholders. \u001d  Steel Partners, which forced another small Japanese company to seek a merger after the fund tried to acquire it, opened a roughly $260 million tender offer last month for Bull-Dog, a maker of Worcestershire and other sauces. It is offering Y1,700 for each share of the Tokyo-based company. Bull-Dog's stock price has jumped 26% since Steel Partners expressed interest in buying it. \u001d  The shareholder vote caps a rough week for Steel Partners, which is run by Warren Lichtenstein, a 41-year-old American investor who has rattled the chains of companies in Japan and South Korea, as well as the U.S. On Friday, shareholders in Brother Industries Ltd. (BRTHY), a sewing machine maker, voted against a Steel Partners proposal asking for a dividend hike. A similar proposal was shot down by shareholders at Inaba Denki Sangyo Co. (9934.TO), an electric equipment trader. \b \u001d  -By Andrew Morse, Wall Street Journal Asia \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 08:14 ET (12:14 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007

JOURNAL ASIA) \b   By Kate Linebaugh \u001d  Growing up in the Philippines, Jose Isidro Camacho, or Lito, as he is known, was an ambitious kid. The son of a lawyer, he skipped a couple of grades and enrolled at De La Salle University-Manila at age 16. By studying through the summers, he earned a degree in mathematics only three years later in 1975. \u001d  \"I wanted to finish and get on with life,\" Mr. Camacho says. \"We lived a modest life -- not poor but not rich. You want to move up as quickly as you can. And I've been in a hurry since.\" \u001d  After spending two years at a Philippine insurance company, Mr. Camacho decided a master's degree in business administration would speed his career goal of working for a New York bank. At Harvard, near Boston, he not only got an M.B.A., but he also met his wife -- they have been married 27 years -- and developed a lifelong passion for the Red Sox, the Major League Baseball team in Boston. \u001d  After graduating in 1979 he worked for two decades at Banker's Trust -- before and after its acquisition by Deutsche Bank -- in New York, Tokyo, Manila, Singapore and Hong Kong. Then he got the call from Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to serve in her government. The father of six spent three years working in Ms. Arroyo's cabinet briefly as energy secretary and then as finance secretary until 2003. \u001d  In 2005, Mr. Camacho joined Credit Suisse Group, as Asia vice chairman. He is also the company's country manager for Singapore and head of Asian public policy. He travels to one or another Asian country for work every week, while maintaining a passion for collecting and a kennel of show dogs in Manila. \u001d  Mr. Camacho, 51 years old, spoke by telephone from his Singapore office to Kate Linebaugh in Hong Kong. \b \u001d  WSJ: What was your first job and what did you learn from it? \u001d  Mr. Camacho: I started working at 19, after I finished university, as an assistant analyst at an insurance company. The lesson at my first job was just about everything. I had no accounting or business background. I was hearing words like debits and credits for the first time. Fortunately, I was working for someone who had just finished his M.B.A. from Stanford and was quite young. So he was very sympathetic to me. He taught me a lot. \b \u001d  WSJ: Why did you decide to get an M.B.A., and would you recommend business school to someone starting out in your field? \u001d  Mr. Camacho: Back in those days, if you wanted to move up in the world, an M.B.A. was almost a prerequisite. I think today it is slightly less important. Today, the world is moving so much faster. If you are working in a very meaningful position, learning on the job might be even more valuable than what you learn in a two-year M.B.A. program. \b \u001d  WSJ: What's the one thing you wish every new hire knew? \u001d  Mr. Camacho: In today's world, you would wish that new hires were a bit more enterprising, even in corporate roles, and were able to take the initiative when they see things that can be improved. Today, creativity, innovation and imagination are much more important than just being able to follow instructions, especially in our business. \b \u001d  WSJ: Investment banking is renowned for being an ego-driven culture. What advice would you give someone taking on a role as a manager of investment bankers? \u001d  Mr. Camacho: I think it's important to recognize and be aware of the ego issue. At the same time, to be successful you need to make sure that people are able to work together. So while you have to respect differences in personalities, you have to draw the line when it gets in the way of being able to work together. \b \u001d  WSJ: What principle of management do you wish you knew when you were first starting out in your field? \u001d  Mr. Camacho: To be much more empowering. That's my type of management. I've been in management for a long, long time now, including when I was in government. One thing you realize very quickly as a manager, as a leader: You're only as good as the people who work for you. Unless you can empower them and be willing to delegate and to take a risk on your people, you are not going to get anywhere. \b \u001d  WSJ: You have managerial experience in both the public and private sectors. What are the differences? \u001d  Mr. Camacho: One big difference is the constituencies you are serving. When you're in the corporate sector it's a lot clearer. You are serving your clients, you're serving your company or your shareholders. When you're in government, the constituency is less clear and changes, depending on the issues you are dealing with. In some cases, clearly your constituency would be the public at large. There are some things where your constituency is the Congress or your boss, the president, or the media. In the public sector you have to know whom you are addressing because there are a lot of them and it changes. \b \u001d  WSJ: What were the toughest decisions you've had to make as a manager? \u001d  Mr. Camacho: To let go of people. I've done that in my life and it's unpleasant. And because you're affecting another human being, it's very emotional. The only advice I can give is: Do it, because these are things we have to do, but do it with compassion, so that at least you mitigate the emotional trauma that one suffers. \b \u001d  WSJ: What was the most satisfying decision you've made as a manager? \u001d  Mr. Camacho: I've made a lot of satisfying decisions in my private-sector roles. But it becomes even more satisfying when you're in the public sector. In the public sector -- especially in the senior role that I had -- many of your decisions permeate throughout the whole population. So when you make the right decision you know you've done well for millions of people. \b \u001d  WSJ: What are you reading now? \u001d  Mr. Camacho: I'm not big into business books or novels. I like reading reference books. I am an avid hobbyist and collector. I read books on the arts, carpets, animals, horses, dogs, and architecture. When I go to a book store or a library, that's where I gravitate. \b \u001d  WSJ: What is the most important piece of technology you use personally, and why? \u001d  Mr. Camacho: The BlackBerry, unfortunately. It's the one that I'm holding on to the most number of hours every day. It is really connectivity to people and to information. I use my BlackBerry as a cellphone. For me it's the way of talking to people, it's the way I'm able to communicate via email. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 17:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow

tolerability of \bJANUVIA in 91 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic renal \binsufficiency (creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min). Patients \bwith moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and \bthose with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or \bperitoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety \band tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small \bincrease in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate \brenal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. \bIn addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to \bplacebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy \bstudies. (See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).) \b \b    14.2 Combination Therapy \b \b    Combination Therapy with Metformin \b \b    A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a \b24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed \bto assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. \bPatients already on metformin (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg \bper day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo \brun-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic \bagent (N = 229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off \btherapy for at least 8 weeks, N = 41) were randomized after a run-in \bperiod of approximately 10 weeks on metformin (at a dose of at least \b1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients were randomized to the \baddition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once \bdaily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the \bstudies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. \b \b    In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant \bimprovements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with \bmetformin (Table 3). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of \bpatients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with \bplacebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both \btreatment groups. \b \b \b                               Table 3 \b          Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) \b              for JANUVIA in Combination with Metformin+ \b=--------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                                  JAN \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 15:57 ET (19:57 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"18652cbec8a0e6e843562c07f293f59f","symR":["BDF"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Rivus Bond Fund (BDF)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T09:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BDF"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Rivus Bond Fund (BDF): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BDF or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 05:26 ET (09:26 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1898fe8f110374402cb193cb48a95077","symR":["CII"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc.

Philippines' PLDT Expects Better 3Q Performance","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T06:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PHI","TEL.PH","PH7182521093"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (TEL.PH) expects its third-quarter profitability to be better this year than the group's usual performance during this period. \u001d  PLDT President Napoleon Nazareno said Sunday the Philippines' largest telecommunications firm will likely post strong third-quarter earnings as an offshoot of a better second-quarter performance. \u001d  \"The second quarter is doing very well maybe because the economy is doing very well too,\" Nazareno told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum here. \u001d  The other factors for the strong second-quarter earnings are the increased spending associated with the congressional and local elections in May and the fruits of the company's new strategy to further grow its market share. \u001d  \"We call this strategy slicing and dicing the market. We are segmenting it more finely and really moving into those markets with specific offerings that cater to those segments,\" he said. \u001d  \"So all those three factors are leading us to believe that the third-quarter, which is normally low before it kicks up in the fourth, might be better. It will still be lower compared to the first and second but it will be much better than last year,\" Nazareno also said. \u001d  In the first quarter, PLDT posted a net profit of PHP8.6 billion ($187 million), unchanged on the year, as higher taxes and the stronger peso limited profitability. \u001d  Revenue in the January-March period, however, was 10% higher than in the year-ago period. \u001d  \"What we did in the first quarter is sustainable,\" he said. \u001d  For the whole of 2007, the group's core earnings, which exclude foreign exchange translation and derivative gains, will likely meet PLDT's forecast of around PHP33 billion, Nazareno reiterated. \u001d  The growth drivers this year will be the company's wireless, broadband and information technology businesses. \u001d  \"The wireless is trending higher than 10% in the second-quarter actually, so we are very happy with that,\" he said. \u001d  \"The broadband business is moving very fast,\" Nazareno also said, adding that the company is on track to double its broadband subscriber base at the end of 2007 from around 327,000 currently. \u001d  The growth in call centers and outsourcing is encouraging as well, he said. \u001d  The company's cash position continues to be robust, enabling it to lower its debt stock and eliminating the need to borrow more to finance capital spending. \u001d  So far this year, PLDT has repaid $84 million of its debt, bringing its net debt down to $1 billion. \u001d  \"Where it was possible, we have prepaid some of our short-term loans and our medium-term ones. We are at the point where our debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) is 0.5%-0.6%, which is extremely healthy,\" Nazareno said, noting that the ratio was sharply lower than the2.0%-2.5% levels when the company was submerged in high debt. \u001d  \"With the amount of cash that we are generating operationally, it looks like our capex requirement will be supported by internally-generated cash,\" said Nazareno. \u001d  The company may also use excess cash to buy back shares or pay shareholders a special dividend, he added. It hopes to finalize the plan at the end of the year and carry out the exercise around the second quarter of next year, he said. \b \u001d  -By Ditas Lopez, Dow Jones Newswires; +65-6415-4044;

The decision is due as early as this week. \u001d  Under the defense system, Bull-Dog will issue three stock warrants for each share of the company on July 11 if Steel Partners doesn't scrap the tender offer by July 4, Kyodo reported. \u001d  Bull-Dog will issue equity warrants in the same manner to Steel Partners, but the fund will not be able to exercise them and instead the sauce maker said it will buy them back in cash for Y396 per warrant, Kyodo said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 02:34 ET (06:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1c6c76d6ab1fc8a34fa25ea592116b08","symR":["NASI"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for North American Scientific Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T08:48:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NASI"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  North American Scientific Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NASI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 04:48 ET (08:48 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1c7a3df719bf29aa5f863fbc825e1e8a","symR":["GB0030001043"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Jupiter Green Inv.

These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the \benzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved \bin the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood \bglucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase \binsulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by \bintracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also \blowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to \breduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging \bactive incretin levels, JANUVIA increases insulin release and \bdecreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent \bmanner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not \binhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations \bapproximating those from therapeutic doses. \b \b    12.2 Pharmacodynamics \b \b    General \b \b    In patients with type 2 diabetes, administration of JANUVIA led to \binhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an \boral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to \b3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, \bdecreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of \binsulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin \bconcentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was \bassociated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced \bglucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. \b \b    In studies with healthy subjects, JANUVIA did not lower blood \bglucose or cause hypoglycemia. \b \b    Cardiac Electrophysiology \b \b    In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy \bsubjects were administered a single oral dose of JANUVIA 100 mg, \bJANUVIA 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the \brecommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval \bobtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during \bthe study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the \bplacebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 \bhours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be \bclinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma \bconcentrations were approximately 11-fold higher than the peak \bconcentrations following a 100 mg dose. \b \b    In patients with type 2 diabetes administered JANUVIA 100 mg \b(N=81) or JANUVIA 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful \bchanges in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of \bexpected peak plasma concentration. \b \b    12.3 Pharmacokinetics \b \b    The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin has been extensively \bcharacterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. \bAfter oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, \bsitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations \b(median Tmax) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. Plasma AUC of \bsitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner. Following a \bsingle oral 100 mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of \bsitagliptin was 8.52 ?M-hr, Cmax was 950 nM, and apparent terminal \bhalf-life (t1/2) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased \bapproximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to \bthe first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of \bvariation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The \bpharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy \bsubjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. \b \b    Absorption \b \b    The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. \bBecause coadministration of a high-fat meal with JANUVIA had no effect \bon the pharmacokinetics, JANUVIA may be administered with or without \bfood. \b \b    Distribution \b \b    The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single \b100 mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is \bapproximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound \bto plasma proteins is low (38%). \b \b    Metabolism \b \b    Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the \burine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. \b \b    Following a (14C)sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the \bradioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six \bmetabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to \bcontribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In \bvitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the \blimited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from \bCYP2C8. \b \b    Excretion \b \b    Following administration of an oral (14C)sitagliptin dose to \bhealthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity \bwas eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of \bdosing. The apparent terminal t1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of \bsitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was \bapproximately 350 mL/min. \b \b    Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion \band involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for \bhuman organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in \bthe renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 \bin sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also \ba substrate of p-glycoprotein, which may also be involved in mediating \bthe renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a \bp-glycoprotein inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of \bsitagliptin. \b \b    Special Populations \b \b    Renal Insufficiency \b \b    A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the \bpharmacokinetics of JANUVIA (50 mg dose) in patients with varying \bdegrees of chronic renal insufficiency compared to normal healthy \bcontrol subjects. The study included patients with renal insufficiency \bclassified on the basis of creatinine clearance as mild (50 to less \bthan 80 mL/min), moderate (30 to less than 50 mL/min), and severe \b(less than 30 mL/min), as well as patients with ESRD on hemodialysis. \bIn addition, the effects of renal insufficiency on sitagliptin \bpharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild or moderate \brenal insufficiency were assessed using population pharmacokinetic \banalyses. Creatinine clearance was measured by 24-hour urinary \bcreatinine clearance measurements or estimated from serum creatinine \bbased on the Cockcroft-Gault formula: \b \b \bCrCl = (140 - age (years)) x weight (kg) {x 0.85 for female patients} \b       --------------------------------- \b       (72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)) \b \b \b    Compared to normal healthy control subjects, an approximate 1.1- \bto 1.6-fold increase in plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in \bpatients with mild renal insufficiency. Because increases of this \bmagnitude are not clinically relevant, dosage adjustment in patients \bwith mild renal insufficiency is not necessary. Plasma AUC levels of \bsitagliptin were increased approximately 2-fold and 4-fold in patients \bwith moderate renal insufficiency and in patients with severe renal \binsufficiency, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, \brespectively. Sitagliptin was modestly removed by hemodialysis (13.5% \bover a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session starting 4 hours postdose). \bTo achieve plasma concentrations of sitagliptin similar to those in \bpatients with normal renal function, lower dosages are recommended in \bpatients with moderate and severe renal insufficiency, as well as in \bESRD patients requiring hemodialysis. (See Dosage and Administration \b(2.2).) \b \b    Hepatic Insufficiency \b \b    In patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score \b7 to 9), mean AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% \band 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following \badministration of a single 100 mg dose of JANUVIA. These differences \bare not considered to be clinically meaningful. No dosage adjustment \bfor JANUVIA is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic \binsufficiency. \b \b    There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic \binsufficiency (Child-Pugh score greater than9). \b \b    Body Mass Index (BMI) \b \b    No dosage adjustment is necessary based on BMI. Body mass index \bhad no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of \bsitagliptin based on a composite analysis of Phase I pharmacokinetic \bdata and on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase \bII data. \b \b    Gender \b \b    No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no \bclinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin \bbased on a composite analysis of Phase I pharmacokinetic data and on a \bpopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of Phase I and Phase II data. \b \b    Geriatric \b \b    No dosage adjustment is required based solely on age. When the \beffects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did \bnot have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of \bsitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly \bsubjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma \bconcentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. \b \b    Pediatric \b \b    Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in \bpediatric patients have not been performed. \b \b    Race \b \b    No dosage adjustment is necessary based on race. Race had no \bclinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin \bbased on a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, \bincluding subjects of white, Hispanic, black, Asian, and other racial \bgroups. \b \b    Drug Interactions \b \b    In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions \b \b    Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, \b2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is \ba p-glycoprotein substrate, but does not inhibit p-glycoprotein \bmediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is \bconsidered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that \butilize these pathways. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007

The incidence of \bselected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with \bJANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, \b2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). \b \b    No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG \b(including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with \bJANUVIA. \b \b    Laboratory Tests \b \b    The incidence of laboratory adverse reactions in patients treated \bwith JANUVIA 100 mg was 8.2% compared to 9.8% in patients treated with \bplacebo. Across clinical studies, a small increase in white blood cell \bcount (approximately 200 cells/microL difference in WBC vs placebo; \bmean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/microL) was observed due to \ban increase in neutrophils. This observation was seen in most but not \ball studies. This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to \bbe clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic \brenal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency \bwere randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the \bsame magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean \b(SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated \bwith JANUVIA (0.12 mg/dL (0.04)) and in patients treated with placebo \b(0.07 mg/dL (0.07)). The clinical significance of this added increase \bin serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. \b \b    7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \b \b    7.1 Digoxin \b \b    There was a slight increase in the area under the curve (AUC, 11%) \band mean peak drug concentration (Cmax, 18%) of digoxin with the \bco-administration of 100 mg sitagliptin for 10 days. Patients \breceiving digoxin should be monitored appropriately. No dosage \badjustment of digoxin or JANUVIA is recommended. \b \b    8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \b \b    8.1 Pregnancy \b \b    Pregnancy Category B: \b \b    Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits. \bDoses of sitagliptin up to 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times the human \bexposure at the maximum recommended human dose) did not impair \bfertility or harm the fetus. There are, however, no adequate and \bwell-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction \bstudies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should \bbe used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Merck & Co., Inc. \bmaintains a registry to monitor the pregnancy outcomes of women \bexposed to JANUVIA while pregnant. Health care providers are \bencouraged to report any prenatal exposure to JANUVIA by calling the \bPregnancy Registry at (800) 986-8999. \b \b    Sitagliptin administered to pregnant female rats and rabbits from \bgestation day 6 to 20 (organogenesis) was not teratogenic at oral \bdoses up to 250 mg/kg (rats) and 125 mg/kg (rabbits), or approximately \b30- and 20-times human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose \b(MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Higher doses increased \bthe incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or \bapproximately 100 times human exposure at the MRHD. \b \b    Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to \blactation day 21 decreased body weight in male and female offspring at \b1000 mg/kg. No functional or behavioral toxicity was observed in \boffspring of rats. \b \b    Placental transfer of sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats \bwas approximately 45% at 2 hours and 80% at 24 hours postdose. \bPlacental transfer of sitagliptin administered to pregnant rabbits was \bapproximately 66% at 2 hours and 30% at 24 hours. \b \b    8.3 Nursing Mothers \b \b    Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to \bplasma ratio of 4:1. It is not known whether sitagliptin is excreted \bin human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution \bshould be exercised when JANUVIA is administered to a nursing woman. \b \b    8.4 Pediatric Use \b \b    Safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA in pediatric patients have not \bbeen established. \b \b    8.5 Geriatric Use \b \b    Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in clinical safety and \befficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, \bwhile 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in \bsafety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and \bover and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical \bexperience have not identified differences in responses between the \belderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older \bindividuals cannot be ruled out. \b \b    This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. \bBecause elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal \bfunction, care should be taken in dose selection in the elderly, and \bit may be useful to assess renal function in these patients prior to \binitiating dosing and periodically thereafter (see Dosage and \bAdministration (2.2); Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)). \b \b    10 OVERDOSAGE \b \b    During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single \bdoses of up to 800 mg JANUVIA were administered. Maximal mean \bincreases in QTc of 8.0 msec were observed in one study at a dose of \b800 mg JANUVIA, a mean effect that is not considered clinically \bimportant (see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)). There is no experience \bwith doses above 800 mg in humans. \b \b    In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual \bsupportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the \bgastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including \bobtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy as \bdictated by the patient's clinical status. \b \b    Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, \bapproximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour \bhemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if \bclinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable \bby peritoneal dialysis. \b \b    11 DESCRIPTION \b \b    JANUVIA Tablets contain sitagliptin phosphate, an orally-active \binhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme. \b \b    Sitagliptin phosphate is described chemically as \b7-((3R)-3-amino-1-oxo-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butyl)-5,6,7,8- \btetrahydro-3- (trifluoromethyl)-1,2,4-triazolo(4,3-a)pyrazine \bphosphate (1:1) monohydrate. \b \b    The empirical formula is C16H15F6N5O-H3PO4-H2O and the molecular \bweight is 523.32. The structural formula is: \b \b    (OBJECT OMITTED) \b \b    Sitagliptin phosphate is a white to off-white, crystalline, \bnon-hygroscopic powder. It is soluble in water and N,N-dimethyl \bformamide; slightly soluble in methanol; very slightly soluble in \bethanol, acetone, and acetonitrile; and insoluble in isopropanol and \bisopropyl acetate. \b \b    Each film-coated tablet of JANUVIA contains 32.13, 64.25, or \b128.5 mg of sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate, which is equivalent to \b25, 50, or 100 mg, respectively, of free base and the following \binactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous dibasic \bcalcium phosphate, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, and \bsodium stearyl fumarate. In addition, the film coating contains the \bfollowing inactive ingredients: polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene \bglycol, talc, titanium dioxide, red iron oxide, and yellow iron oxide. \b \b    12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \b \b    12.1 Mechanism of Action \b \b    Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its \bactions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation \bof incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are \bincreased by JANUVIA, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of \bthese hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 \b(GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 15:57 ET

WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPE \b \u001d  MOSCOW (Dow Jones)--PricewaterhouseCoopers' Russian unit said Sunday it suspects former management of now-bankrupt oil giant OAO Yukos (YUKO.RS) may have provided inaccurate information to its auditors and thus PwC's financial reports on the company for the years 1994-2004 should no longer be relied upon. \u001d  PwC's decision to withdraw the Yukos audits is a big boost to the Kremlin and Russian prosecutors, who have sought to portray the oil giant as a massive tax-evasion and money-laundering scheme. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  The company, once Russia's largest oil producer with a reputation for western-style management and transparency, was crushed by $27 billion in back-tax claims starting in 2004. The attack on the company was widely viewed a politically motivated, Kremlin retribution for the political ambitions of Yukos' billionaire CEO and main shareholder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was later convicted of fraud and tax evasion and is now serving an eight-year sentence in a Siberian prison. Most of Yukos' assets have been sold off to the state-controlled energy groups. \u001d  Russian prosecutors are pursuing a second case against Mr. Khodorkovsky, accusing him and his colleagues of fraud and money-laundering at Yukos. PwC officials said the revelations that led them to doubt their audits came in the course of this probe, when PwC officials were confronted with new evidence over the last few months. PwC declined to detail that evidence. \u001d  \"PwC decided to withdraw its audit opinions for Yukos when it became aware of new information which had it been known at the time may have affected Yukos's audit reports,\" PwC said in a statement. \"PwC now believes information and representations which was provided to PwC by Yukos's former management may not have been accurate.\" \u001d  \"In addition, PwC's decision to withdraw the reports was influenced by the fact that some former shareholders and management of Yukos are continuing to encourage others to rely on PwC's audit reports,\" the statement said, without elaborating. \u001d  A spokeswoman for Yukos former management, which left Russia for fear of prosecution as pressure on the company rose, said they have written to PwC's CEO in the U.S. seeking explanation. \u001d  The decision comes as PwC is fighting a court battle in Russia against tax authorities who have alleged that the auditor knowingly aided Yukos in what authorities charge was a massive tax-evasion scheme. PwC denies those allegations and appealed after it lost the first round in that court battle. The appeal is scheduled to be heard July 18 in Moscow. PwC also faced charges it underpaid taxes and the firm paid $14 million last year to settle those obligations. \u001d  A PwC official said Sunday the decision to withdraw the Yukos audits wasn't related to the court case now under appeal, which PwC still plans to continue to pursue. At issue in that litigation is whether PwC knew of illegal activity at the time of the audits, something PwC continues to deny. If PwC were found to have knowingly falsified audits, it could lose its license to operate in Russia, where it is one of the largest auditors. \b \u001d  -By Gregory White, The Wall Street Journal \b

\u001d  AMMAN (Dow Jones)--Iraq is about to issue a tender to sell at least 3 million barrels of Kirkuk crude from the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, the head of Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization, or SOMO, said Sunday. \u001d  \"We will announce a tender to sell 3 million barrels or more from the northern oil fields,\" Falah al-Amery told Dow Jones Newswires. \"We are expecting the tender to be announced soon.\" \u001d  The new sales would be the first since mid January when SOMO sold 3 million of Kirkuk crude, one million barrels each to Spain's Companla Espanola de Petroleos SA (CEP.MC), or Cepsa, France's Total SA (TOT) and Italy's ERG SpA (ERG.MI). \u001d  Last year, SOMO held five tenders totaling around 10 million barrels of Kirkuk crude on the international market. \u001d  Persistent sabotage against pipelines and oil installations has kept exports from the north shut for most of the time since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. \u001d  Iraq exports the bulk of its crude oil from southern oil outlets, selling an average of 1.5 million barrels a day. \u001d  -By Hassan Hafidh; Dow Jones Newswires; + 962 777 612 111; hafidh8@hotmail.com \u001d

TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Bull-Dog Sauce Co. (2804.T0) Sunday secured support from its shareholders for a plan aimed at thwarting a takeover bid by a U.S. investment fund, putting the spotlight on a Tokyo court which is weighing the legality of the Worcester sauce maker's \"poison pill.\" \u001d  Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund (Offshore) L.P., a New-York based fund and largest shareholder in the Japanese company it's seeking to buy, said it was \"disappointed\" that the anti-takeover plan was passed and that it would continue to try to block it through legal action. \u001d  The news highlights a clash between a growing cadre of foreign activist investors and a corporate culture that is still trying to come to grips with Western-style capitalism. With cross-shareholding arrangements between Japanese firms having unwound significantly in recent years, managers are having to face a new breed of investors, who are agitating for increased focus on shareholder value. It's a new world for many Japanese companies, which have traditionally paid more attention to the interests of other stakeholders, such as their main banks, suppliers and employees. \u001d  The squabble between Bull-Dog and Steel Partners is attracting particular attention because the outcome will help define how far Japanese companies can go to defend themselves against unsolicited acquirers. \u001d  With mergers and acquisitions activity gathering pace and foreign investment funds increasing their presence in Japan, poison pills and other anti-takeover schemes have proliferated here as companies seek to deter unsolicited takeovers by rivals and corporate raiders. \u001d  Steel Partners has been one of the most visible of the growing ranks of foreign activist investment funds in Japan, targeting a range of companies in industries from beer and instant noodles to power saws. \u001d  On May 18, it started a tender offer to buy the shares it doesn't own in Bull-Dog. The condiment maker unveiled a poison pill plan on June 7. That prompted Steel Partners to file a suit with the Tokyo District Court four days later in an effort to block the poison pill. \u001d  Under the plan, Bull-Dog would be able to issue three stock acquisition rights per share to all its shareholders, but with a provision that would prevent Steel Partners from converting its rights into shares. That could potentially dilute the investment fund's stake from about 10% to less than 3%. \u001d  Steel Partners says the scheme is aimed at sinking its takeover bid and has called it \"a discriminatory act against the investment partnership in violation of current Japanese law.\" \u001d  In its statement Sunday, Steel Partners said: \"Such a scheme, if allowed to be carried out, would be detrimental to the legal framework of corporate Japan, would weaken international faith in the integrity of the Japanese capital markets and could deter investment in Japanese companies and Japan's national economy as a whole.\" \b \u001d  -By Arran Scott, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; arran.scott@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 07:26 ET (11:26

Toyota offers several other hybrid models, including the hybrid Camry and hybrid Lexus models. \u001d  The new vehicle is expected to play a driving role in Toyota's plans to increase hybrid sales to one million vehicles a year after 2010 in response to efforts to tighten emissions regulations in Japan, the U.S. and Europe, the Nikkei said. \u001d  Phones rang unanswered at Toyota Sunday. \u001d  Earlier this month, Toyota said it had sold more than one million hybrid vehicles around the world since the Prius' introduction in 1997. The Prius accounted for nearly three-quarters of those sales. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 02:05 ET (06:05

(7236.TO), formerly named Toyo Radiator, will set up a Russian production site for autoparts through a partnership with the world's largest aluminum firm, The Nikkei reported in its Monday morning edition. \u001d  T.Rad will form a joint venture with UC Rusal to make aluminum radiators for cooling car engines beginning in January 2009.  The company would become the first independent autoparts maker to set up operations in Russia, where makers of finished cars are establishing their own plants to tap a quickly growing market. \u001d  Most autoparts makers are cautious about entering the Russian market, where the government aims to nurture domestic players in the industry.  But by teaming up with Rusal, T.Rad aims to ensure a supply of aluminum raw material as well as secure customers. \u001d  The 50-50 joint venture, which is to be established soon, would be chaired by Oleg Deripaska, the billionaire owner of Rusal.  A T.Rad official will serve as president.  A factory with an annual capacity of 300,000 parts will be built in the city of Nizhny Novgorod for an estimated Y3 billion. \u001d  Aluminum radiators for trucks and buses will be supplied to Russia's second-largest automaker, Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod, known as GAZ. \u001d  Beginning in 2010, capacity will be expanded to 600,000 units for supply to foreign automakers setting up production in Russia. \u001d  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203.TO) will start production in Russia this year, and Nissan Motor Co. (7201.TO) and Suzuki Motor Corp.

SINGAPORE (AP)--Asia will be the biggest driver of Coca-Cola's growth over the next 10 years, the head of the world's biggest beverage company said Sunday, adding that the company had lost out by not investing enough in the region in the past. \u001d  \"Asia is at the core,\" Neville Isdell, the chairman and chief executive of the Atlanta, Georgia-based Coca-Cola Co., said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u001d  \"Because we haven't been making sufficient investments, we have underperformed the opportunities that are present in Asia,\" he said in Singapore on the sidelines of the two-day World Economic Forum on East Asia conference, which brought together some of the world's most influential industry leaders. \u001d  Isdell's comments come on the heels of Coca-Cola's upbeat financial results for the first quarter of 2007, when its profits jumped 14%. \u001d  The company said its worldwide unit-case volume sales grew 6% - the highest rate since 2002. \u001d  Isdell said Coca-Cola has invested more than US$1 billion over the last 12 months in Asia, particularly in the Philippines, China, India and Indonesia. \u001d  \"There is no question that the biggest driver of our growth over this century, and over the next 10 years, is Asia. It's a very simple equation. It's where people are, and it's where the economic growth is, and it's clearly where we are focused,\" Isdell said. \u001d  \"If you are not a major player in Asia you will not be a successful global company,\" he said. \u001d  The company's market share in Asia's non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink beverage market is currently \"in the teens\" and will become much higher in the next five years, Isdell said, without elaborating. \u001d  \"We believe we will be the engine of growth for the industry,\" he said. \u001d  In a wide-ranging interview, Isdell talked about the acquisition strategy of Coca-Cola, which purchased Vitaminwater maker Glaceau earlier this month for US$4.1 billion. He said Vitaminwater would be available in Asia in the next few years. \u001d  He refused to say if Coca-Cola is thinking of buying Scottish mineral water maker Highland Spring, which some analysts have valued at US$1 billion. \u001d  \"We know Highland Spring is certainly not worth a billion, and certainly not worth half a billion,\" said Isdell. \u001d  But \"we look at everything that is out there,\" he said, adding that acquisitions will be a core strategy of Coca-Cola's expansion. \u001d  \"We believe if we want to get to a critical mass in a hurry, we will go the acquisition route. The way we phrase it is, 'build-buy equation all the time.'\" \u001d  Isdell acknowledged that the soft drinks industry in India has been set back by five years due to recent allegations that water used in soft drinks was contaminated with pesticide.

ex-Yukos managers) \b \u001d  By Gregory White \u001d  Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPE \b \u001d  MOSCOW (Dow Jones)--PricewaterhouseCoopers' Russian unit said Sunday it suspects former management of now-bankrupt oil giant OAO Yukos (YUKO.RS) may have provided inaccurate information to its auditors and thus PwC's financial reports on the company for the years 1994-2004 should no longer be relied upon. \u001d  PwC's decision to withdraw the Yukos audits is a big boost to the Kremlin and Russian prosecutors, who have sought to portray the oil giant as a massive tax-evasion and money-laundering scheme. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  The company, once Russia's largest oil producer with a reputation for western-style management and transparency, was crushed by $27 billion in back-tax claims starting in 2004. The attack on the company was widely viewed a politically motivated, Kremlin retribution for the political ambitions of Yukos' billionaire CEO and main shareholder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was later convicted of fraud and tax evasion and is now serving an eight-year sentence in a Siberian prison. Most of Yukos' assets have been sold off to the state-controlled energy groups. \u001d  Russian prosecutors are pursuing a second case against Mr. Khodorkovsky, accusing him and his colleagues of fraud and money-laundering at Yukos. PwC officials said the revelations that led them to doubt their audits came in the course of this probe, when PwC officials were confronted with new evidence over the last few months. PwC declined to detail that evidence. \u001d  \"PwC decided to withdraw its audit opinions for Yukos when it became aware of new information which had it been known at the time may have affected Yukos's audit reports,\" PwC said in a statement. \"PwC now believes information and representations which was provided to PwC by Yukos's former management may not have been accurate.\" \u001d  \"In addition, PwC's decision to withdraw the reports was influenced by the fact that some former shareholders and management of Yukos are continuing to encourage others to rely on PwC's audit reports,\" the statement said, without elaborating. \u001d  Former Yukos managers Steve Theede, CEO from July 2004 until the company's bankruptcy declaration in 2006, and Bruce Misamore, chief financial officer from April 2001, said in a statement Sunday that during their tenure, the information provided to PwC was complete and correct. \"It is inconceivable that there is any 'new information' that PWC did not have already or had access to because they had full access to everything available to the management of the company,\" they said. A spokeswoman said the former managers have written to PwC's CEO in the U.S. seeking an explanation. \u001d  The decision comes as PwC is fighting a court battle in Russia against tax authorities who have alleged that the auditor knowingly aided Yukos in what authorities charge was a massive tax-evasion scheme. PwC denies those allegations and appealed after it lost the first round in that court battle. The appeal is scheduled to be heard July 18 in Moscow. PwC also faced charges it underpaid taxes and the firm paid $14 million last year to settle those obligations. \u001d  A PwC official said Sunday the decision to withdraw the Yukos audits wasn't related to the court case now under appeal, which PwC still plans to continue to pursue. At issue in that litigation is whether PwC knew of illegal activity at the time of the audits, something PwC continues to deny. If PwC were found to have knowingly falsified audits, it could lose its license to operate in Russia, where it is one of the largest auditors. \b \u001d  -By Gregory White, The Wall Street Journal \b

\b   By Rebecca Christie \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) and the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. (5730.FR) hailed the international market for aerial refueling planes at last week's Paris Air Show, hoping that U.S. officials might be swayed by the sight of new aircraft from around the world. \u001d  EADS had three tankers at the air show: its own narrow-body demonstrator, an Airbus A310-based tanker owned by Germany, and a larger A330 tanker that belongs to Australia. The EADS-Northrop team also announced it has started to build the first KC-30 for the U.S. Air Force, even though that competition won't wrap up until the end of this year, at the earliest. \u001d  Executives said this investment shows their determination to prevail in the U.S. competition, which could be worth $40 billion to the winning team. But when pressed, they admitted that that tanker could wind up elsewhere. \u001d  \"We are sure we are finding great customers in other places in the world for this great airplane,\" said EADS co-chief executive Tom Enders, taking questions at an air show press conference. \u001d  EADS and Northrop Grumman said they would stay flexible on future teaming arrangements, depending on what countries were looking to buy. Throughout the air show, there was an undercurrent of buzz that Saudi Arabia might finally announce plans to buy EADS tankers, but no announcement took place. \u001d  The buzz about Boeing Co. (BA), the other contender in the U.S. race, was decidedly less upbeat. The company's tankers for Italy and Japan are behind schedule, and there were no Boeing tankers at the air show. \u001d  Boeing officials said they were undaunted by the competition, or the politics surrounding it. The company says it has learned much from its Japan and India programs and believes it can win on merit. \u001d  \"I think if we write the best proposal and have the right price we win. If we don't, we lose,\" said Jim Albaugh, Boeing's top defense executive, in an air show interview. \u001d  A split buy remains part of public debate, even though the Air Force says it can't afford to buy two kinds of aircraft simultaneously. At the air show, U.S. Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne told reporters the Air Force could only afford one tanker for now, but members of Alabama's congressional delegation privately acknowledged they are still investigating funding for a split buy. If the Northrop-EADS team wins a tanker order, it has pledged to start a U.S. assembly line in Alabama, a state with a growing aerospace market and a big presence at this year's air show. \b  -By

ZAGREB, Croatia (AP)--Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in the Croatian capital Sunday for a one-day meeting of Balkan leaders to discuss the region's energy concerns. \u001d  Russia is a key energy supplier to Southeast European countries and its leaders were looking to boost cooperation over the oil and gas that passes through their nations en route to the European Union. \u001d  Croatian President Stipe Mesic said that countries in the region were \"an important hub of energy routes and have all the potential to develop into an even more important hub in the future.\" \u001d  \"We can only achieve this through mutual cooperation in the region,\" he added. \u001d  The E.U. imports more than 40% of its natural gas, and almost half of this comes from Russia. Some central and eastern European countries depend almost entirely on Russian gas. \u001d  Leaders from Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia, Romania and Montenegro were to also take part in the talks, on issues ranging from the diversification of energy sources and its secure transport to market deregulation, environmental concerns and privatization. \u001d  Several countries in the region are collaborating on energy projects designed to diversify gas sources and reduce their dependence on Russia. Earlier this year, Croatia and Hungary agreed to strengthen cooperation in developing a liquefied petroleum gas terminal on the Croatian coast. \u001d  The terminal is scheduled to begin distributing gas from mostly north Africa and the Middle East to central Europe as of 2012. \u001d  Putin was expected to try to bolster Russia's presence in the Balkans as the dominant oil and gas source. \u001d  Russia's Atomstroiexport recently agreed to build a nuclear power plant in Bulgaria, while OAO Lukoil (LKOH.RS) and OAO Gazprom (GSPBEX.RS) were also rapidly increasing gas sales volume and developing

In this study the authors demonstrated that \bgenetically obese mice treated with an antisense inhibitor of mDIC experienced \bsignificantly reduced weight gain and body fat content without a significant \bimpact on food consumption.  Antisense treatment also improved hyperglycemia, \bglucose and insulin tolerance.  The mice also showed reductions in liver fat \baccumulation, which correlated with increases in whole body metabolic rate and \bdecreases in total triglyceride levels.  These positive effects indicate that \bmDIC plays an important role in the body's metabolism and energy management \band suggest a potential clinical benefit for mDIC-targeted antisense drugs in \bthe treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. \b\b \b   \"The data from JNK1 and mDIC antisense studies indicate that targeting \bperipheral tissues with our drugs can lead to significant effects not only on \bbody fat content, but also on several other metabolic defects that often \bco-exist in obese patients,\" said C. Frank Bennett, Ph.D., Senior Vice \bPresident of Research, Isis Pharmaceuticals.  \"Importantly, these studies \bprovide initial validation for our discovery approach of developing our \bcompounds as anti-obesity drugs that have a peripheral mechanism of action but \bdo not cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby minimizing the potential of \bcentral nervous system side-effects that are observed with several weight loss \bdrugs on the market or in development.  As we advance multiple drugs for the \btreatment of diabetes, we look forward to expanding our discovery effort in \bthe area of obesity, which is a disease with high unmet medical need.\" \b\b \b\b    About Isis' Metabolic Disease Drugs in Development \b\b \b\b    ISIS 113715, targeting protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) \b\b \b   PTP-1B is responsible for turning off the activated insulin receptor, so \bby reducing levels of PTP-1B, ISIS 113715 enhances the activity of insulin. \bBecause ISIS 113715 is an insulin sensitizer that acts by increasing the \bactivity of the insulin receptor in response to insulin, Isis plans to develop \bthis drug initially as an adjunct to insulin therapy in the diabetes treatment \bparadigm. PTP-1B has long been recognized as an attractive target for \btreatment of diabetes, but due to structural similarities among closely \brelated proteins, it has been difficult to identify small molecule drugs with \bsufficient specificity to be safe. ISIS 113715 selectively inhibits the \bproduction only of PTP-1B, making it possible to reduce PTP-1B activity \bwithout having effects on closely related proteins that would likely lead to \bunwanted side effects.  Isis has previously presented positive Phase 2 results \bin patients with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes treated with ISIS 113715 as a \bsingle agent, and it is currently conducting a combination study of ISIS \b113715 in patients uncontrolled on other oral anti-diabetic drugs. Because the \binitial registration plan calls for using ISIS 113715 as an adjunct to insulin \btherapy, this study is evaluating it in combination with sulfonylureas. \bSulfonylureas, which are commonly prescribed oral anti-diabetic drugs, \bincrease insulin secretion in the body and therefore they offer the best \bapproximation of a combination with insulin therapy in the milder disease \bsetting appropriate for this first combination experience with ISIS 113715. \b\b \b\b    ISIS 325568, targeting glucagon receptor (GCGR) \b\b \b   Glucagon is a hormone that opposes the action of insulin and stimulates \bthe liver to produce glucose. In type 2 diabetes, unopposed action of glucagon \bcan lead to increased blood glucose levels. Reducing the expression of liver \bGCGR using antisense inhibitors is expected to reduce excessive liver glucose \bproduction and thereby lower blood glucose levels, resulting in improved \bglycemic control. In preclinical studies, antisense inhibitors of GCGR led to \bsubstantial improvements in glucose control and a concomitant reduction in the \blevels of blood triglycerides without producing hypoglycemia. In addition, \btreatment with ISIS 325568 led to an increase in circulating glucagon-like \bpeptide, or GLP-1, which is a hormone that helps to preserve pancreatic \bfunction, thereby enhancing insulin secretion. These results suggest that ISIS \b325568 has a dual mechanism that affects both the liver and pancreas and could \bdemonstrate disease modifying effects.  Isis plans to initiate Phase 1 \bclinical trials for ISIS 325568 in 2007. \b\b \b\b    ISIS 377131, targeting glucocorticoid receptor (GCCR) \b\b \b   Glucocorticoid hormones have a variety of effects throughout the body, \bincluding promotion of liver glucose production and fat storage. Although \binhibition of GCCR has long been recognized as an attractive strategy for \bdevelopment of therapeutics for type 2 diabetes, the side effects associated \bwith systemic GCCR inhibition have challenged development of traditional \bdrugs. Antisense inhibitors of GCCR take advantage of the unique tissue \bdistribution of oligonucleotides that allows the antisense drugs to antagonize \bglucocorticoid action primarily in liver and fat tissues.  Notably, antisense \bdrugs do not reduce GCCR expression in the central nervous system or adrenal \bglands - inhibition of GCCR expression in these two organs can lead to \bsystemic side effects.  Preclinically, Isis has shown that ISIS 377131 has a \bbroad therapeutic profile that includes reduction of blood glucose levels, a \bdramatic and favorable effect on lipid levels including cholesterol and \btriglycerides, and a reduction in body fat.  Therefore, this drug may prove to \bhave an attractive therapeutic profile that includes attenuation of diabetic \bdyslipidemia and obesity which often goes hand-in-hand with type 2 diabetes. \bIsis plans to begin IND-enabling preclinical studies for ISIS 377131 in 2007. \b\b \b\b    ABOUT ISIS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. \b\b \b   Isis is exploiting its expertise in RNA to discover and develop novel \bdrugs for its product pipeline and for its partners.

Following administration of 0.25 mg digoxin concomitantly \bwith 100 mg of JANUVIA daily for 10 days, the plasma AUC of digoxin \bwas increased by 11%, and the plasma Cmax by 18%. \b \b    Metformin: Co-administration of multiple twice-daily doses of \bsitagliptin with metformin, an OCT substrate, did not meaningfully \balter the pharmacokinetics of metformin in patients with type 2 \bdiabetes. Therefore, sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of OCT-mediated \btransport. \b \b    Sulfonylureas: Single-dose pharmacokinetics of glyburide, a CYP2C9 \bsubstrate, was not meaningfully altered in subjects receiving multiple \bdoses of sitagliptin. Clinically meaningful interactions would not be \bexpected with other sulfonylureas (e.g., glipizide, tolbutamide, and \bglimepiride) which, like glyburide, are primarily eliminated by \bCYP2C9. However, the risk of hypoglycemia from the co-administration \bof sitagliptin and sulfonylureas is unknown. \b \b    Simvastatin: Single-dose pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, a CYP3A4 \bsubstrate, was not meaningfully altered in subjects receiving multiple \bdaily doses of sitagliptin. Therefore, sitagliptin is not an inhibitor \bof CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. \b \b    Thiazolidinediones: Single-dose pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone \bwas not meaningfully altered in subjects receiving multiple daily \bdoses of sitagliptin, indicating that JANUVIA is not an inhibitor of \bCYP2C8-mediated metabolism. \b \b    Warfarin: Multiple daily doses of sitagliptin did not meaningfully \balter the pharmacokinetics, as assessed by measurement of S(-) or R(+) \bwarfarin enantiomers, or pharmacodynamics (as assessed by measurement \bof prothrombin INR) of a single dose of warfarin. Because S(-) \bwarfarin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9, these data also support \bthe conclusion that sitagliptin is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor. \b \b    Oral Contraceptives: Co-administration with sitagliptin did not \bmeaningfully alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of norethindrone \bor ethinyl estradiol. \b \b    Effects of Other Drugs on Sitagliptin \b \b    Clinical data described below suggest that sitagliptin is not \bsusceptible to clinically meaningful interactions by co-administered \bmedications: \b \b    Metformin: Co-administration of multiple twice-daily doses of \bmetformin with sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the \bpharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes. \b \b    Cyclosporine: A study was conducted to assess the effect of \bcyclosporine, a potent inhibitor of p-glycoprotein, on the \bpharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Co-administration of a single 100 mg \boral dose of JANUVIA and a single 600 mg oral dose of cyclosporine \bincreased the AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin by approximately 29% and \b68%, respectively. These modest changes in sitagliptin \bpharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically meaningful. The \brenal clearance of sitagliptin was also not meaningfully altered. \bTherefore, meaningful interactions would not be expected with other \bp-glycoprotein inhibitors. \b \b    13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY \b \b    13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \b \b    A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female \brats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. \bThere was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma \bin males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. \bThis dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human \bexposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of \b100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at \b150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A \btwo-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice \bgiven oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. \bThere was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to \b500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. \bSitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic \bactivation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster \bovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics \bassay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, \band an in vivo micronucleus assay. \b \b    In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and \b1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during \bmating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and \bfemales were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. \bNo adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg \b(approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based \bon AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased \bresorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times \bhuman exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison). \b \b    14 CLINICAL STUDIES \b \b    There were 2316 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in four \bdouble-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies \bconducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. \bIn these studies, the mean age of patients was 54.8 years, and 62% of \bpatients were white, 18% were Hispanic, 6% were black, 9% were Asian, \band 4% were of other racial groups. \b \b    In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced \bclinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma \bglucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to \bplacebo. \b \b    14.1 Monotherapy \b \b    A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two \bdouble-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another \bof 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA \bmonotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an \bantihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, \bexercise, and drug wash-out period of about 7 weeks. Patients with \binadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the wash-out period \bwere randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in \bperiod; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off \btherapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% \bto 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind \bplacebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were \brandomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the \b24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, \bor JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals \bduring the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to \bplacebo or JANUVIA. \b \b    Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant \bimprovements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table \b2). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and \b17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week \bstudy, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients \breceiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C was \bnot affected by gender, age, race, or baseline BMI. As is typical for \btrials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, mean response to JANUVIA in \bA1C lowering appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at \bbaseline. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater \bglycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on \blipid endpoints was similar to placebo.

This flight test \bmarked the first time that a SM-3 was fired from an Aegis destroyer. In \bprevious tests, the missile was launched from Aegis cruisers. It was the third \bintercept of a medium-range target with a separating re-entry warhead and the \bninth successful intercept for the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense program. \b\b \b   \"This successful flight test again demonstrates the tactical, operational \bcapability of SM-3 and the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Weapon System in \breal-world conditions,\" said Frank Wyatt, Raytheon's vice president of Naval \bWeapon Systems. \"We are proud of SM-3's impressive record of successful \bintercepts.\" \b\b \b   The SM-3 Block IA provides increased capability to engage short-to- \bintermediate-range ballistic missiles. The SM-3 Block IA incorporates rocket \bmotor upgrades and computer program modifications to improve sensor \bperformance, missile guidance and control, as well as lower cost. It also \bincludes producibility and maintainability features required to qualify the \bmissile as a tactical fleet asset. \b\b \b   \"The program has truly transitioned to a manufacturing mindset. We have \bdelivered more than 23 operational SM-3 rounds to our customers. We are \bramping up our facilities and suppliers to accelerate deliveries of this \burgently needed capability to the fleet,\" said Wyatt. \b\b \b   Raytheon's Missile Systems business in Tucson, Ariz., is developing SM-3 \band leads the integrated team effort, which includes Alliant Techsystems, \bAerojet and The Boeing Company. The kinetic warhead seeker and final \bintegration occur in Raytheon's state-of-the-art kill vehicle space \bmanufacturing facility in Tucson, alongside the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle, \ban element of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program. Final assembly and \btesting of SM-3 occurs at Raytheon's Camden, Ark., facility. \b\b \b   Raytheon Company, with 2006 sales of $20.3 billion, is a technology leader \bspecializing in defense, homeland security and other government markets \bthroughout the world. With a history of innovation spanning more than 80 \byears, Raytheon provides state-of-the-art electronics, mission systems \bintegration and other capabilities in the areas of sensing; effects; and \bcommand, control, communications and intelligence systems, as well as a broad \brange of mission support services.

Delaney \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  In a further shuffling of top roles, Yahoo Inc. (YHOO)  appointed David Karnstedt head of North American advertising sales and announced the departure of long-time Chief Sales Officer Wenda Harris Millard, saying that industry changes required new skills at the Internet company. \u001d  Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. (MSO) separately announced that Millard, 52, would be president of media at the New York company, a new post overseeing its various magazine, publishing, TV and radio activities. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  As part of its move, Yahoo put responsibility for both Web search ads and graphical display advertising-such as banner ads-in North America under the post of Karnstedt, 41, who previously headed Yahoo's U.S. search ad sales. Yahoo executives said that the company needed to be more coordinated in selling advertisers both types of ads. \u001d  Yahoo's latest executive changes follow the resignation of Terry Semel as chief executive and his replacement by Yahoo cofounder Jerry Yang. Announcing that shuffling last week, the company said that its revenue for the rest of the year would likely come in toward the lower end of its projections because of slowing growth in display advertising, the area Millard oversaw. \u001d  \"Yahoo requires a different set of skills to drive the business forward,\" said Gregory Coleman, Yahoo's executive vice president of Global Sales. A company spokesman said that it had notified Millard a few weeks ago that Karnstedt would oversee both display and search ad sales in North America. One person familiar with the matter said that prior to her resignation Millard had been tapped by Yahoo to oversee sales of such ads outside the U.S. \u001d  \"I feel badly that Yahoo has had such a tough time lately,\" said Millard in an interview. \"And I'm sorry they announced the story this way because clearly I resigned and I have a great new job,\" she added, saying that she submitted her resignation Sunday morning. \u001d  Millard, a media veteran well-known on Madison Avenue who arrived at Yahoo in Oct. 2001, played a lead role in the company's efforts to convince traditional brand advertisers to spend more money online. \u001d  Karnstedt in 2001 joined Overture Services Inc., the Web search advertising company that Yahoo acquired in 2003. \u001d  Yahoo President Susan Decker said that the changes were \"one of many steps we're taking to reinvigorate display\" advertising sales.  She said the company hoped to improve its sales for so-called \"direct-response\" advertising efforts, where advertisers are looking for specific sales-related results as opposed to more generally improving consumer perceptions of their brands. \b   By Kevin J.

After 24 weeks, body weight was increased more with JANUVIA than with placebo (mean change from baseline of +0.8 vs. -0.4 kg, respectively; p less than 0.001). \b \u001d  \"These new potential uses of sitagliptin as add-on to sulfonylurea, as add-on to sulfonylurea plus metformin, and as initial therapy in combination with metformin, if approved by the FDA, would provide physicians with additional treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes,\" said Mark Kipnes, M.D., associate medical director, Diabetes and Glandular Research Associates, and clinical professor of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. \b \b   As Merck announced in February, these data have been submitted to \bthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in support of proposed new \bindications for the use of JANUVIA. One sNDA is filed in support of a \bproposed new indication for the use of JANUVIA, as an adjunct to diet \band exercise, in combination with metformin as initial therapy to \bimprove glycemic control. The other sNDA is filed in support of two \bproposed new indications for use of JANUVIA, as an adjunct to diet and \bexercise, as add-on therapy to a sulfonylurea when the single agent \balone does not provide adequate glycemic control and as add-on therapy \bto the combination of a sulfonylurea plus metformin when dual therapy \bdoes not provide adequate glycemic control. The FDA is reviewing the \bsNDA for these indications and Merck expects FDA action by \bmid-October. \b \b   A pooled analysis of 5,141 patients showed overall incidence of \badverse experiences, incidence of serious adverse experiences, and \bincidence of discontinuations due to adverse experiences were similar \bin the JANUVIA and non-exposed groups for up to two years (Poster \b#534-P) \b \b   The safety and tolerability of JANUVIA was assessed by pooling \bdata from nine completed Phase IIB and III studies, including the \bstudies discussed above, ranging from 24 to 104 weeks in duration, and \bincluding 5,141 patients treated with either JANUVIA 100 mg daily \b(n=2,786) or other treatments (placebo or an active comparator) \b(n=2,355). The studies assessed JANUVIA as monotherapy, initial \bcombination therapy with metformin, or add-on to another oral agent \b(metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylurea, or sulfonylurea and \bmetformin). \b \b   JANUVIA 100 mg daily was generally well-tolerated as monotherapy, \bas initial combination therapy, or as add-on therapy. For adverse \bexperiences (either clinical or laboratory), the overall incidence of \badverse experiences, the incidence of serious adverse experiences, and \bthe incidence of discontinuations due to adverse experiences were \bsimilar in the JANUVIA treated patients and in patients who received \bother therapies (patients on placebo or active comparator). \bDrug-related adverse experiences were higher in the non-exposed group \bdue to hypoglycemia reported in sulfonylurea-treated patients (since \bstudies in which a sulfonylurea agent was a treatment in patients not \breceiving JANUVIA were included in this pooled analysis). \b \b   Specific clinical adverse experiences, expressed as a rate of \bgreater than or equal to 1 event per 100 patient-years of exposure, in \bthe JANUVIA population included nasopharyngitis (12 vs. 9), \bhypoglycemia (9 vs. 58), increased blood glucose (5 vs. 9), \bosteoarthritis (2 vs. 1), contact dermatitis (1 vs. less than 1), \btremor (1 vs. less than 1), nasal congestion (1 vs. less than 1), and \breduced blood glucose (1 vs. 3) for JANUVIA and non-exposed patients, \brespectively. \b \b   Dosing of JANUVIA \b \b   The recommended dose of JANUVIA is 100 mg once daily, with or \bwithout food, for all approved indications. No dosage adjustment is \bneeded for patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency or in \bpatients with mild renal insufficiency (CrCl greater than or equal to \b50 mL/min). To achieve plasma concentrations of JANUVIA similar to \bthose in patients with normal renal function, lower dosages are \brecommended in patients with moderate and severe renal insufficiency \bas well as in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients requiring \bhemodialysis. For patients with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl \bgreater than or equal to 30 to less than 50 mL/min), the dose of \bJANUVIA is 50 mg once daily. For those with severe renal insufficiency \b(CrCl less than 30 mL/min) or with ESRD requiring dialysis, the dose \bof JANUVIA is 25 mg once daily. Because there is a need for dosage \badjustment based upon renal function, assessment of renal function is \brecommended prior to initiation of JANUVIA and periodically \bthereafter. \b \b   Dosing of JANUMET \b \b   JANUMET should be given twice daily with meals, with gradual dose \bescalation as needed to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects \bdue to metformin. In this formulation, the dose of sitagliptin remains \bconstant (100 mg daily) and is combined with the two most widely \bprescribed doses of metformin (1000 mg daily or 2000 mg daily). The \brecommended starting dose of JANUMET for patients not on prior \bmetformin therapy and for those not adequately controlled on \bsitagliptin is 50 mg sitagliptin and 500 mg metformin twice-daily with \bmeals. For patients already receiving metformin therapy, the starting \bdose should be based on the patient's current metformin regimen. The \btotal daily dose should not exceed 100 mg sitagliptin and 2000 mg \bmetformin. \b \b   Metformin and sitagliptin are known to be substantially excreted \bby the kidney. The risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis \bincreases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus, \bpatients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal \bfor their age should not receive JANUMET. In the elderly, JANUMET \bshould be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for \badequate glycemic effect, because aging can be associated with reduced \brenal function. Any dose adjustment should be based on a careful \bassessment of renal function. Before initiation of therapy with \bJANUMET and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be \bassessed and verified as normal. \b \b   Selected cautionary information for JANUVIA \b \b   Because JANUVIA is renally eliminated, and to achieve plasma \bconcentrations of JANUVIA similar to those in patients with normal \brenal function, a dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with \bmoderate renal insufficiency and in patients with severe renal \binsufficiency or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring \bhemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Safety and effectiveness of \bJANUVIA in pediatric patients have not been established. There are no \badequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. JANUVIA should \bbe used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Caution should be \bexercised when JANUVIA is administered to a nursing woman. In clinical \btrials, JANUVIA demonstrated an overall incidence of side effects \bcomparable to placebo. The most common side effects reported with \bJANUVIA (greater than or equal to 5 percent and higher than placebo) \bwere stuffy or runny nose and sore throat, upper respiratory \binfection, and headache. \b \b   Selected cautionary information for JANUMET \b \b   JANUMET should be avoided in patients with evidence of hepatic \bdisease. Before initiation of therapy with JANUMET and at least \bannually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified as \bnormal. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake \bwhile receiving JANUMET. Patients may require discontinuation of \bJANUMET and temporary use of insulin during periods of stress and \bdecreased intake of fluids and food such as may occur with fever, \btrauma, infection or surgery. Patients previously controlled on \bJANUMET who develop laboratory abnormalities or clinical illness \bshould be evaluated promptly for evidence of ketoacidosis or lactic \bacidosis. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients \breceiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 \bcases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 \bpatient-years). When lactic acidosis occurs, it is fatal in \bapproximately 50 percent of cases. \b \b   Expanding clinical development program for sitagliptin family \b \b   Merck's clinical development program for sitagliptin is robust and \bcontinues to expand with 47 studies completed or under way, and nine \bmore studies set to begin this year. There have been more than 7,600 \bpatients in the Company's clinical studies with about 4,700 of these \bpatients, being treated with sitagliptin. Additionally, about 1,900 \bpatients have been treated with sitagliptin for more than a year. \b \b   About Merck \b \b   Merck & Co., Inc. is a global research-driven pharmaceutical \bcompany dedicated to putting patients first.

Oil Daily reported last week. \u001d  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. has short-listed companies to develop sour gas from the Shah field, but has postponed a decision on the more challenging Bab field, IOD said. \u001d  International oil majors, including Exxon Mobil (XOM), ConocoPhillips (COP), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), Total SA (TOT), Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY), Japan Oil Development Co. and Germany's Wintershall (WSL.YY) submitted bids in April for a 40% stake in a 30-year joint venture to develop Abu Dhabi's sour gas reserves, IOD said. \u001d  Adnoc has asked them to rework their bids based on just the Shah field, IOD said, which has less carbon dioxide and sulfur than the Bab field. \u001d  Sour gas is highly sulfuric so difficult and dangerous to extract. Several companies, including BP and Shell, had declined to bid for Bab because of the technical and environmental risks associated with the treatment of the sour gases in Bab, which is located near a densely populated area, IOD said. \u001d  Adnoc had initially expected to produce 3 billion cubic feet a day of sour gas and 1 billion feet a day of sweet, or cleaner, gas, from both fields over 30 years, IOD said. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://energyintel.com \u001d  -Dubai Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +9714 364 4962; djnews.dubai@dowjones.com \u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones &

\b   By Ruediger Schoss \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Heads of Equity Capital Markets, or ECM, of national and international banks surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires see business remaining robust in the second half of 2007 in light of recent record-breaking performance on capital markets worldwide. \u001d  \"It's likely that in the coming weeks, we can expect the same level of issuance volume as we've seen in previous months,\" according to Joerg Maertin, JP Morgan's ECM-head for German-speaking regions. \u001d  Volume in the second half of the year could even be higher, taking 2007 to the level last reached in 1999. According to the Deutsche Aktieninstituts, issuance volume in 1999 reached EUR10.47 billion. After a record year in 2000 with EUR26.56 billion in issuance volume, volume sunk in 2003 to zero as the dotcom bubble burst. \u001d  Since 2004, volume has been on the rise. 2004 saw a total volume of EUR1.98 billion in initial public offerings, or IPOs. In the two subsequent years, volume rose to EUR4.08 billion and EUR6.94 billion, respectively. \u001d  After the first half of 2007 saw 18 IPOs with a total volume of EUR3 billion, the second half of the year will hardly be quieter, according to HSBC Trinkhaus & Burkhardt ECM head for Germany and Austria Joerg Schroeder. \"It will nearly be as robust as the first half of the year and we'll see a similar number of IPOs,\" he said. \u001d  Managing Director of Bankhaus Sal. Oppenheim Wolfgang Jensen agreed. \"The volume could even be somewhat higher if one or two larger companies that aren't yet firm stock exchange candidates like Siemens (SI) VDO enter the scene,\" he said. \u001d  Deutsche Bank's head of ECM, Georg Hansel, has also ruled out the possibility of a quiet second half ahead. \"I expect an issuance volume of over EUR10 billion,\" he said. \u001d  It's difficult to predict which sectors will be active, the experts said. \"There hasn't been any particular groupings and there won't be looking back on the year,\" JP Morgan's Maertin said. \"We have seen some real estate sector IPOs, but they don't make up 50% of the volume.\" \u001d  Despite the fact that real estate stocks have mostly shown disappointing development, the second half of the year will likely see many real estate sector IPO candidates, according to the experts. \u001d  \"Real estate IPOs will play a big role in the next one or two years,\" Jensen noted. ECM-head Schroeder, however, said he expects a bit of a slow-down after Boetzelen Real Estate AG (BOE.XE) and Vector Hospitality Plc (VEH.LN) canceled their planned IPOs in June on the grounds of unfavorable market conditions. \u001d  \"In light of Boetzelen and Vector Hospitality, I don't believe that the market environment is such that it could engender a boom,\" Schroeder said. \u001d  \"I expect increased investor interest in renewables and socially responsible investments,\" said HSBC's Schroeder. JP Morgan has predicted that logistics companies will make up a significant portion of IPOs, pointing to the Hamburg Port Authorities and German rail car company VTG AG. Hansel said IPOs mainly from the automotive, infrastructure and real estate sectors will be in focus until the end of the year. \u001d  Also, so-called trade sells are seen playing a greater role following the IPOs of Gerresheimer AG (GXI.XE), Versatel AG (VTW.XE) and Wacker Chemie AG (WCH.XE) in the first half of the year initiated by private equity companies. \u001d  \"Private equity will contribute to characterizing the market beyond the second half of the year,\" Jensen said. \"Funds have a variety of companies that are ready to be marketed.\" He highlighted the announced or expected sales of Tognum, Deutscher Annington and Homag. \u001d  Although issuance volumes are already near the peak levels seen around the year 2000, the ECM heads said these days are over. \"In the 12 months prior to the peak of the DAX in 2000, we had some 30 IPOs above EUR100 million. This year there have been five to date,\" summed up Maertin, adding, \"That's healthy, but there isn't a comparable sense of euphoria. Since the end of the 1990s, we've reached quite a bit in Germany in terms of stock market culture.\" \b \u001d  -By Ruediger Schoss, Dow Jones Newswires; +49 (0)69 29725 500; ruediger.schoss@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"83d7b1736437a918790152d876976e4c","symR":["UXI"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for ProShares Ultra Industrials (UXI)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T09:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UXI"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\u001d  ProShares Ultra Industrials (UXI): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=UXI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 05:15 ET (09:15 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"83e896f0866e500389f343a4210366fd","symR":["PHTM.LN","GB0008481250"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Photo-Me International PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T08:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PHTM.LN","GB0008481250"],"IndustryCodes":["ENT","REQ","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Photo-Me International PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0008481250 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 04:55 ET (08:55 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"842d615529c8fa08f9f3991605b0c5cc","symR":["AIT.LN","GB0030383326"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Active Capital Trust PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T07:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AIT.LN","GB0030383326"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Active Capital Trust PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0030383326 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 03:02 ET (07:02 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"84401a9b7e096090ea3adb524fb6ea66","symR":["FPEA.LN","GB0030738164"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for F&C Private Equity Trust plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T07:53:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FPEA.LN","GB0030738164"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  F&C Private Equity Trust plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0030738164 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 03:53 ET (07:53 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"846393d3a942723c177945b33053efff","symR":["UVU"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for ProShares Ultra Russell MidCap Value (UVU)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T09:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UVU"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\u001d  ProShares Ultra Russell MidCap Value (UVU): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=UVU or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 05:16 ET (09:16 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"84c4f6197bed7799b57559ca6813df75","symR":["MIY"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock MuniYield Michigan Insured Fund, Inc.

Study findings showed comparable \bimprovements in blood sugar control with BYETTA and insulin glargine \btherapies, with weight loss and lower incidence of hypoglycemia associated \bwith BYETTA. Patients in the study were also taking one of two commonly used \boral medications. These findings were presented at the 67th Annual Scientific \bSessions of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in Chicago. \b\b \b   This open-label crossover study of 114 people with type 2 diabetes \bcompared treatment with BYETTA (5 mcg for 4 weeks and 10 mcg for 12 weeks) and \boral medication (metformin or a sulfonylurea) with treatment with insulin \bglargine and oral medication on measures of blood sugar control, weight change \band incidence of hypoglycemia during two 16-week periods. Treatment with \bBYETTA resulted in blood sugar control (measured by A1C reductions) comparable \bto treatment with insulin glargine (-1.43 percent vs. -1.41 percent, \brespectively).(1) \b\b \b   However, BYETTA treatment with metformin resulted in statistically \bsignificant lower risk of hypoglycemia (2.6 percent) than treatment with \binsulin glargine and metformin (17.4 percent). Additionally, there were seven \bepisodes of severe hypoglycemia in three patients taking insulin glargine and \bno severe episodes during treatment with BYETTA, reflecting a lower overall \brisk of hypoglycemia. BYETTA treatment was also associated with a 5.7-pound \bweight loss from baseline, compared with a 1.3-pound weight gain among \bindividuals in the insulin glargine group (a 7.0-pound difference between \bgroups). \b\b \b   \"Adding BYETTA to oral medication to achieve target blood sugar control \blevels can be an important next step in the management of type 2 diabetes,\" \bsaid Michael Trautmann, MD, lead investigator of this study and Medical Fellow \bof Eli Lilly and Company. \"This study shows that adding BYETTA to oral \bmedication before insulin use may help people with type 2 diabetes obtain the \bsame glucose control as insulin and yet lose weight with reduced risk of \bhypoglycemia.\" \b\b \b   BYETTA was generally well-tolerated in this study, and side effects were \bconsistent with those seen in previous studies. In clinical trials and post- \bapproval adverse event reports, the most common side effect is mild-to- \bmoderate nausea, which affects fewer than half of patients and usually \bdecreases over time. \b\b \b   BYETTA is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy for people with type \b2 diabetes who are not achieving blood sugar control using metformin, a \bsulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione. Over three million prescriptions have \bbeen written in the U.S. since being approved by the Food and Drug \bAdministration (FDA) in 2005. \b\b \b\b    For more information, visit www.BYETTA.com. \b\b \b\b    About BYETTA \b\b \b   BYETTA is the first in a class of drugs called incretin mimetics for the \btreatment of type 2 diabetes. BYETTA exhibits many of the same effects as the \bhuman incretin hormone glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 improves blood \bsugar after food intake through multiple effects that work in concert on the \bstomach, liver, pancreas and brain. BYETTA is approved by the FDA for use by \bpeople with type 2 diabetes who are unsuccessful at controlling their blood \bsugar levels. BYETTA is an add-on therapy for people currently using \bmetformin, a sulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione. BYETTA provides sustained \bA1C control, low incidence of hypoglycemia when used with metformin or a \bthiazolidinedione, and progressive weight loss. For full prescribing \binformation, visit www.BYETTA.com. \b\b \b\b    Safety and Tolerability \b\b \b   BYETTA improves glucose (blood sugar) control in patients with type 2 \bdiabetes who are taking metformin, a sulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione. \bBYETTA is not a substitute for insulin in patients whose diabetes requires \binsulin treatment. BYETTA is not recommended for use in patients with severe \bproblems with the stomach or food digestion, or those who have severe kidney \bdisease. Before using BYETTA, patients should tell their healthcare provider \bif they are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. BYETTA \bhas not been studied in children. \b\b \b   When BYETTA is used with a medicine that contains a sulfonylurea, \bhypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a possible side effect. To reduce this \bpossibility, the dose of sulfonylurea medicine may need to be reduced while \busing BYETTA. Other common side effects with BYETTA include nausea, vomiting, \bdiarrhea, dizziness, headache, feeling jittery, and acid stomach. Nausea is \bmost common when first starting BYETTA, but decreases over time in most \bpatients. BYETTA may reduce appetite, the amount of food eaten, and body \bweight. These are not all the side effects with BYETTA. A healthcare provider \bshould be consulted about any side effect that is bothersome or does not go \baway. \b\b \b\b    About Diabetes \b\b \b   Diabetes affects more than 20 million in the United States and an \bestimated 246 million adults worldwide.(2,3) Approximately 90-95 percent of \bthose affected have type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of \bdeath by disease in the United States and costs approximately $132 billion per \byear in direct and indirect medical expenses.(4) \b\b \b   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National \bHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey, approximately 60 percent of people \bwith diabetes do not achieve their target blood sugar levels with their \bcurrent treatment regimen.(5) \b\b \b\b    About Amylin and Lilly \b\b \b   Amylin Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company committed to \bimproving lives through the discovery, development and commercialization of \binnovative medicines.

Christie \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--The U.S. government wants Japan to buy the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for its next fighter jet, rather than the more advanced - and currently unexportable - F-22 Raptor, said U.S. officials attending the Paris Air Show. \u001d  Japan has asked the U.S. for information on the F-22, and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) officials have flown across the Pacific to talk about it. But the U.S. still has laws on the books prohibiting F-22 exports. And what little Washington interest there was in selling the jet to extend its production seems to be fading. \u001d  \"We have no interest in an F-22 international sale,\" said U.S. Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne, when asked about the state-of-the-art stealth fighter at an air show roundtable. \u001d  \"I think there's a lot to do with that airplane to achieve an international opportunity, and I'm not sure that anybody's inclined to put up the investment capital to make an F-22 suitable for international sale,\" Wynne said, referring to the changes that would be needed to protect closely held U.S. technology. \u001d  Economics may be driving the shifting calculus between the F-22 and its intended-for-mass-production cousin, the F-35 Lightning II. Both jets are built by Lockheed Martin, both jets are \"fifth generation\" stealth fighters, and both jets face production crunches because of pressures on the U.S. defense budget. \u001d  The U.S. currently plans to buy just 184 F-22 stealth fighters, about 200 fewer than the Air Force says it needs. In a bid to prolong the fighter's production line, Washington officials began to cautiously discuss relaxing the export ban. \u001d  But now the F-35 is coming into its own, and into its own production crunch. The U.S. has cut the number of early-run purchases, pushing up per-plane costs and also setting the stage for a tricky production surge in a few years, when international purchases begin. \u001d  If foreign buyers start purchases a year or two earlier than currently planned, it could smooth out this jump and help the F-35 line accelerate without a hitch, said Lockheed Martin program manager Tom Burbage. The U.S. has eight initial partners on the F-35 program, and more than a dozen other countries have expressed interest in buying the plane. But some partner nations have delayed their planned purchases because of concern that it might not be ready on time. \u001d  \"They had airplanes in there but they moved them out,\" Burbage said in an air show interview. \"We might be able to put them back if we can incentivize with price.\" \u001d  The F-35's target price is between $45 million and $65 million each, a range that doesn't include development costs or adjustments for inflation. In contrast, the F-22 costs between $110 million and $130 million each; it is an earlier design that was never aimed at the thousands of planes in the F-35's target market. \u001d  Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kohler, an Air Force general who leads the U.S. government's foreign military sales program, said his office hopes to have its F-35 sales plan in place within the next month or so. Foreign deliveries aren't expected until around 2013 or 2014, but the U.S. wants to be able to start working on contracts much sooner. \u001d  When it comes to Japan, the U.S. believes that the F-35 will meet all of that country's requirements, even though Japan also has inquired about the F-22, Kohler told reporters at the air show. \"Japan has expressed a strong desire for a fifth generation aircraft,\" he said. \"I hope to be able to put the Japanese in a Joint Strike Fighter soon.\" \u001d  Lockheed Martin says it will follow the U.S. government's lead. So far the company has answered generic questions about its airplanes, without any expectation for foreign F-22 sales, said Rob Weiss, who leads business development for Lockheed Martin's aeronautics unit, in an interview. \u001d  Other countries also are in discussions about new fighters. First up are the eight F-35 partner nations plus Singapore and Israel, who have been interested in the program since its inception. Japan, Spain, Greece and South Korea are also considered near-term prospects, Lockheed Martin officials said. \u001d  While the U.S. and other governments debate when to buy Joint Strike Fighters and in what numbers, the plane's development is making great strides. Jon Beesley, the plane's chief test pilot, said the F-35 is a \"huge leap\" from prior aircraft, even the F-22, because of its electrical system and sophisticated flight computers. \u001d  Other airplanes \"have an electric brain. This one has electric muscle. Nobody's ever done that before,\" Beesley said in an air show interview. \"If there were ever an airplane that deserves to be called Lightning, it's this one.\" \b \u001d  On the Web: A list of Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other program information is available at www.jsf.mil \b \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; Rebecca.Christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 11:49 ET (15:49 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8c01129f581987667511438582d27ca5","symR":["BKD"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Brookdale to Participate in 2007 Jefferies Healthcare Conference June 26","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T19:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BKD"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\bBrookdale to Participate in 2007 Jefferies Healthcare Conference June 26 \b \b\b \b   CHICAGO, June 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Brookdale Senior Living Inc. \b(NYSE: BKD) announced today that it will participate in the Jefferies \bHealthcare Conference in New York, NY on Tuesday, June 26, 2007, beginning at \b2:40 p.m. (ET).

and Display Advertising Sales Teams to Better Serve its Advertising Partners \b\b \bPromotes David Karnstedt to Lead Unified Team as Head of US Sales \b\b \b\b \b   SUNNYVALE, Calif., June 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Yahoo! Inc. \b(Nasdaq: YHOO), a leading global Internet company, will combine its Search and \bDisplay advertising sales teams in the US, and has appointed David Karnstedt, \bcurrently senior vice president of Yahoo!'s Search sales business, to lead the \bunified organization as Head of North American Sales.  Karnstedt, a long-time \bYahoo! executive and industry veteran will continue to report to Gregory \bColeman, Yahoo!'s EVP of Global Sales.  This transition continues the steps \bYahoo! has been taking since the beginning of the year to organize product \bmanagement, engineering, and distribution around marketing customers rather \bthan advertising products. \b\b \b   \"Integrating our world-class search and display sales teams under David's \bleadership will allow us to better serve all of our advertisers' marketing \bobjectives ranging from brand awareness to direct response,\" said Sue Decker, \bPresident, Yahoo!  \"This is one of many important steps we're taking to \bre-invigorate our display business, further build on our industry-leading \bposition in advertising, and drive thought-leadership in the online \badvertising marketplace.\" \b\b \b   Advertisers are increasingly seeking solutions that span a wide variety of \bad products, such as search, display and video, that when combined can deliver \bsignificantly better results than when used independently.  As a result of \bthese changes, Yahoo!'s integrated sales organization will be the first of its \bkind to offer the widest selection of advertising products coupled with the \bbroadest scale of search and display inventory to customers.  By organizing \baround marketers and their needs rather than advertising products, the company \bwill be better positioned to provide marketing customers with the most \bcomprehensive set of end-to-end solutions that achieve a wide range of \bmarketing objectives.  Yahoo!'s leading position in display and strong \bposition in search give it an advantage to offer integrated marketing \bsolutions to its marketing partners. \b\b \b   \"The future of advertising isn't about choosing between search and \bdisplay, but about leveraging the breadth of advertising products to more \beffectively reach your customers with the right message, in the right context, \bat the right time, and on the right platform,\" said Coleman.  \"David Karnstedt \bhas done great things for Yahoo!'s Search Sales business, and it's his \bleadership skills, business acumen and keen understanding of the new media \blandscape that make him the perfect person to help shape the future of \bYahoo!'s advertising sales business.\" \b\b \b   Karnstedt joined Yahoo! Search Marketing (formerly Overture) in September \b2001.  Since joining Yahoo!, Karnstedt has built and managed the company's \bNorth American search sales force.  Prior to joining Yahoo!, Karnstedt was a \bkey member of the management teams at a number of pioneering internet \bcompanies including Wired Digital Lycos and Alta Vista where he developed \brevolutionary online advertising methods that are still in use today. \bKarnstedt was also a catalyst for developing products and marketing strategies \bthat leveraged the auction-based search environment for many of the world's \bleading marketers.  He has also been responsible for developing and \badministering some of the Internet's earliest research regarding the impact of \bbranding through the use of online advertising. \b\b \b   \"By taking a more holistic approach to advertising sales, Yahoo! will \bbecome a more consultative seller, which should make buying complete solutions \beasier for our customers across Yahoo! and our partner network,\" said \bKarnstedt.  \"These moves will also enable our world class sales team to more \beffectively meet the needs of our advertisers - not just today but well into \bthe future.\" \b\b \b   As part of the reorganization, Wenda Millard, Yahoo!'s Chief Sales Officer \bin the US will be leaving the company effective immediately. \b\b \b   Coleman added, \"While Wenda was a big contributor to our success in the \bpast, the industry has shifted and requires a different set of skills to take \bthe business forward.  We appreciate her dedication during her years of \bservice and wish her well in the next chapter of her career.\" \b\b \b   In December 2006, Yahoo! announced the findings of a Web-wide study \bconducted by comScore that measured the impact of display and search \badvertising campaigns. The study, entitled \"Close the Loop: Understanding \bSearch and Display Synergy,\" found that online users who were exposed to both \bthe search and display advertising campaigns increased their share of page \bviews relative to competitive sites by 68 percent, and time spent by 66 \bpercent. More importantly, among those exposed to both the search and display \bads, purchases of an advertiser's products and services increased by 244 \bpercent online and 89 percent offline compared to online users with similar \bbehavior who were not exposed to these ads. \b\b \b   The integration of Yahoo!'s search and display advertising sales teams is \bunderway, and the company will make additional announcements about the \bstructure of the organization and the executives that will lead it shortly. \b\b \b\b    Building on Yahoo!'s Positive Momentum \b\b \b   Yahoo! is moving aggressively to build-on its long-term leadership \bposition in display advertising, while further strengthening its strong \bposition in search.  Today's announcement follows a number of other key \binitiatives that Yahoo! has undertaken to invigorate its display advertising \bbusiness, which include:  announcing the intention to acquire Right Media; \bintegrating our Inside Sales Organization into the search sales team to create \ba performance hub; building of an off-network display business through recent \bpartnerships with eBay, the Newspaper Consortium and Comcast; and offering day \bparting options on Yahoo!'s home page. \b\b \b\b    About Yahoo! \b\b \b   Yahoo!

 ZAGREB, Croatia (AP)--Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday pledged to help the Balkan region meet its energy needs and assume a greater role in the safe supply of oil and gas to mainstream Europe. \u001d  Speaking at a one-day energy conference of Southeast European leaders, Putin said Russia was prepared to help develop local infrastructure and boost cooperation over the oil and gas that passes through the region's nations en route to the European Union. \u001d  \"Russia is a world-leading factor in energy supply,\" Putin told a news conference, adding that Moscow was committed to international agreements in the energy field, including \"investment, cooperation and interaction with the Balkans.\" \u001d  Putin listed projects or studies under way linking energy sources from the Black Sea and Caspian Sea to the E.U. through Bulgaria, Serbia, Macedonia and Hungary, as well as a recent underground pipeline agreement between Italian oil giant Eni SpA (E) and Russia's state-controlled OAO Gazprom (GSPBEX.RS) \u001d  \"Russia is committed to participation in joint energy projects and meeting the highest environmental standards,\" Putin said, adding that Moscow \"is open to dialogue, but also ready to protect its national interests.\" \u001d  Croatian President Stipe Mesic said that countries in the region were \"an important hub of energy routes and have all the potential to develop into an even more important hub in the future.\" \u001d  \"We can only achieve this through mutual cooperation in the region,\" he added. \u001d  The E.U. imports more than 40% of its natural gas, and almost half of this comes from Russia. Some central and eastern European countries depend almost entirely on Russian gas. \u001d  Leaders from Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia, Romania and Montenegro also took part in the talks, on issues ranging from the diversification of energy sources and its secure transport to market deregulation, environmental concerns and privatization. \u001d  Several countries in the region are collaborating on energy projects designed to diversify gas sources and reduce their dependence on Russia. Earlier this year, Croatia and Hungary agreed to strengthen cooperation in developing a liquefied petroleum gas terminal on the Croatian coast. \u001d  The terminal is scheduled to begin distributing gas from mostly north Africa and the Middle East to central Europe as of 2012. \u001d  Putin, signaling Russia's efforts to reassert its presence in the Balkans, expressed interest in expanding capital investments, power networks and pipelines. He also supported the idea of an \"energy ring\" in the Black Sea region, which he said could help outline the parameters of a common power grid in Europe. \u001d  Russia's Atomstroiexport recently agreed to build a nuclear power plant in Bulgaria, while Lukoil and Gazprom were also rapidly increasing gas sales volume and developing transit routes in the region. \u001d  Putin was also expected touch on Serbia's breakaway province of Kosovo and other international issues during bilateral talks on the sidelines. \u001d  \"Contacts with regional leaders neighboring Kosovo will provide more insight on developments and new evaluations of the situation,\" the Russian president's adviser, Sergei Prihodko, said. \u001d  The U.S. States and E.U. are backing a U.N. Security Council resolution which they hope would lead to Kosovo's independence from Serbia. \u001d  However, Prihodko reiterated that veto-wielding Russia would only support solutions approved by Serbia. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 11:43 ET (15:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a3b7dc2dc22d0a6b05fab5a622a0ab43","symR":["SGA"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Saga Communications, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T09:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SGA"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  Saga Communications, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=SGA or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 05:28 ET (09:28 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a3dc6c72c33fdd41696988b091c68084","symR":["AMLN","LLY","US5324571083"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Amylin, Lilly: BYETTA Shows Comparable Glucose Control To Insulin","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T21:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMLN","LLY","US5324571083"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Treatment for Three and a Half Years Associated with Reductions in Cardiovascular Risk Factors in People with Type 2 Diabetes \b\b \b- BYETTA also Showed Sustained Improvements in Blood Glucose Control and Progressive Weight Loss - \b\b \b\b \b   CHICAGO, June 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \b(Nasdaq: AMLN) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced results \bfrom a study that showed BYETTA(R) (exenatide) injection sustained \bimprovements in blood sugar levels and progressive weight loss through three \band a half years of therapy. BYETTA treatment was also associated with \bimprovements in cardiovascular risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes. \bThese findings were presented at the 67th Annual Scientific Sessions of the \bAmerican Diabetes Association (ADA) in Chicago. \b\b \b   People with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for various \bcardiovascular problems, including high blood pressure and cholesterol. In \bthis study, 151 people with type 2 diabetes who had taken part in a 30-week \bplacebo-controlled trial were followed in open-label extension studies. After \bthree and a half years, participants using BYETTA (10 mcg) twice daily with \boral medication showed sustained reductions in blood sugar as measured by A1C \b(-0.8 +/- 0.1 percent) and fasting blood glucose (-24 +/- 4 mg/dL), consistent \bwith findings from previous studies. \b\b \b   Treatment with BYETTA in combination with common oral medications was also \bassociated with progressive weight loss (-11.68 +/- 1.1 lbs), improved \btriglyceride levels (-44.4 +/- 12.1 mg/dL or 12 percent), and lower systolic \band diastolic blood pressure (-3.5 +/- 1.2 mmHg or 2 percent and -3.3 +/- 0.8 \bmmHg or 4 percent, respectively). Results also showed an increase in HDL, or \b\"good\" cholesterol levels after three and a half years (+8.5 +/- 0.6 mg/dL or \b24 percent) and a decrease in LDL, or \"bad\" cholesterol levels (-11.8 +/- 2.9 \bmg/dL or 6 percent).(1,2) \b\b \b   \"The sustained improvements in blood glucose control and the secondary \bbenefits of progressive weight loss seen with BYETTA are well documented,\" \bsaid David Kendall, Executive Director, Medical Affairs, Amylin \bPharmaceuticals, Inc. \"These studies document that BYETTA may have additional \band important effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors providing \binteresting areas for further study, including additional metabolic advantages \bof weight loss in people with diabetes.\" \b\b \b   BYETTA was generally well-tolerated in this study, and the side effects \bwere consistent with those seen in previous studies. In clinical trials and \bpost-approval adverse event reports, the most common side effect is mild-to- \bmoderate nausea, which affects fewer than half of patients and usually \bdecreases over time. \b\b \b   BYETTA is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy for people with type \b2 diabetes who are not achieving blood sugar control using metformin, a \bsulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione. Over three million prescriptions have \bbeen written in the U.S. since being approved by the Food and Drug \bAdministration (FDA) in 2005. For more information, visit www.BYETTA.com. \b\b \b\b    About BYETTA(R) (exenatide) injection \b\b \b   BYETTA is the first in a class of drugs for the treatment of type 2 \bdiabetes called incretin mimetics. BYETTA exhibits many of the same effects as \bthe human incretin hormone glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 improves \bblood sugar after food intake through multiple effects that work in concert on \bthe stomach, liver, pancreas and brain. BYETTA is approved by the FDA for use \bby people with type 2 diabetes who are unsuccessful at controlling their blood \bsugar levels. BYETTA is an add-on therapy for people currently using \bmetformin, a sulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione. BYETTA provides sustained \bA1C control, low incidence of hypoglycemia when used with metformin or a \bthiazolidinedione, and progressive weight loss. For full prescribing \binformation, visit www.BYETTA.com. \b\b \b\b    About Diabetes \b\b \b   Diabetes affects more than 20 million in the United States and an \bestimated 246 million adults worldwide.(3,4) Approximately 90-95 percent of \bthose affected have type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is the fifth leading cause of \bdeath by disease in the United States and costs approximately $132 billion per \byear in direct and indirect medical expenses.(5) \b\b \b   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National \bHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey, approximately 60 percent of people \bwith diabetes do not achieve their target blood sugar levels with their \bcurrent treatment regimen.(6) \b\b \b\b    Important Safety Information for BYETTA(R) (exenatide) injection \b\b \b   BYETTA improves glucose (blood sugar) control in patients with type 2 \bdiabetes who are taking metformin, a sulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione. \bBYETTA is not a substitute for insulin in patients whose diabetes requires \binsulin treatment. BYETTA is not recommended for use in patients with severe \bproblems with the stomach or food digestion, or those who have severe kidney \bdisease. Before using BYETTA, patients should tell their healthcare provider \bif they are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. BYETTA \bhas not been studied in children. \b\b \b   When BYETTA is used with a medicine that contains a sulfonylurea, \bhypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a possible side effect. To reduce this \bpossibility, the dose of sulfonylurea medicine may need to be reduced while \busing BYETTA. Other common side effects with BYETTA include nausea, vomiting, \bdiarrhea, dizziness, headache, feeling jittery, and acid stomach. Nausea is \bmost common when first starting BYETTA, but decreases over time in most \bpatients. BYETTA may reduce appetite, the amount of food eaten, and body \bweight. These are not all the side effects with BYETTA. A healthcare provider \bshould be consulted about any side effect that is bothersome or does not go \baway. \b\b \b   For complete safety profile and other important prescribing \bconsiderations, visit www.BYETTA.com. \b\b \b\b    About Amylin and Lilly \b\b \b   Amylin Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company committed to \bimproving lives through the discovery, development and commercialization of \binnovative medicines.

(6765.TO) have agreed to merge next year to combat increasingly fierce competition in the consumer electronics industry. \u001d  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. (6752.TO), which has been exploring possibilities to unload its 52.4% stake in the company, known as JVC, also said in a statement Saturday that it was considering various options to increase its corporate value but that \"nothing has yet been decided.\" \u001d  A spokesman for Kenwood wasn't immediately available for comment. \u001d  The Nikkei reported that Kenwood informed Matsushita it was ready to do a deal on JVC, the once-thriving inventor of VHS technology that has fallen on hard times amid falling prices of flat-screen TVs and other consumer electronics it makes. The newspaper said JVC and Kenwood have agreed to integrate their operations under a holding company in 2008. \u001d  Kyodo News also reported Saturday that JVC and Kenwood have started full-scale talks for merging their management under a holding company next year, citing sources close to the negotiations. \u001d  For Matsushita, a deal with Kenwood would end a months-long effort to find a buyer for JVC, whose weak results have blemished its earnings performance. Matsushita, known for its Panasonic line of products, had been in talks with U.S. private equity firm TPG Inc. toward a JVC deal, but turned to Kenwood after the negotiations broke down earlier this month. \u001d  A merger between Kenwood and JVC would be a step toward consolidation of Japan's consumer electronics industry. The sector is packed with rival makers, ranging from giants like Matsushita and Sony Corp. (6758.TO) to smaller companies like Pioneer, Kenwood and JVC. All are feeling the heat from companies in South Korea and Taiwan, and hyper-competition in areas such as TVs has sent prices plunging, cutting into profit margins. \u001d  Like many of Japan's small electronics makers, JVC has been hit hard, and its restructuring efforts have failed to stem the flow of red ink. It expects its group net loss to widen to Y10.50 billion for the current fiscal year through March 2008 from Y7.89 billion last fiscal year. \u001d  Kenwood is in better shape. Its group net profit fell 74% last fiscal year to Y1.59 billion but it forecasts a strong rebound to Y4.00 billion this fiscal year. \u001d  The two consumer electronics makers could make a good fit strategically, with JVC's focus on audio and visual equipment complementing Kenwood's strength in car navigation systems and communications devices. \u001d  According to The Nikkei, Kenwood will buy Y20 billion in JVC shares as early as this summer, raising its position to 13%. Matsushita will sell a portion of its stake in JVC to Kenwood's top shareholder, investment firm Sparx Group Co. (8739.JA). \u001d  When JVC and Kenwood integrate operations under the holding company in 2008, Matsushita will sell the rest of its JVC shares to the holding company to complete the transaction. The holding company's stock will be listed instead of Kenwood and JVC, the newspaper said. \u001d  The Nikkei said the three companies aim to reach a final agreement by the end of next month. \u001d  On the Tokyo Stock Exchange Friday, JVC's shares closed up 0.8% at Y395, while Kenwood slipped 0.5% to Y196.

of Two Head-to-Head Studies Demonstrated Long-Acting Insulin Lantus(R) Lowered Free Fatty Acid Levels Equal to or Better Than Thiazolidinediones \b \b\b \b   BRIDGEWATER, N.J., June 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Results from two new \bhead-to-head studies showed that when added to metformin and/or a \bsulfonylurea, the once-a-day, long-acting insulin Lantus(R) (insulin glargine \b[rDNA origin] injection), significantly reduced free fatty acid levels in \bpatients with type 2 diabetes compared to pioglitazone and had comparable \beffects to rosiglitazone. These results were presented at the American \bDiabetes Association's (ADA) 67th Annual Scientific Sessions. \b\b \b   Free fatty acids are released in the bloodstream during the breakdown of \bfat. High levels of free fatty acids have been linked to a number of serious \bcomplications, including insulin resistance. Since people with diabetes have \bnaturally higher levels of free fatty acids, managing these levels effectively \bis an important component of diabetes treatment. \b\b \b   \"High levels of free fatty acid have been shown to affect the regulation \bof glucose production by the liver and also may impact beta cell function in \bthe pancreas, where insulin is secreted,\" said Julio Rosenstock, MD, Director \bof Dallas Diabetes and Endocrine Center at Medical City and also a Clinical \bProfessor of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, \bDallas, Texas. \"Lipotoxicity generated by the elevated free fatty acid levels, \bcontributes to glucose dysregulation and insulin resistance and plays a major \brole in type 2 diabetes.\" \b\b \b   In the first analysis (Change in Lipid Variables With Insulin Glargine \b(GLAR) vs Pioglitazone (PIO) Added to a Sulfonylurea (SU) or Metformin (MET) \b- Abstract # 0890-P), which examined the benefits of add-on therapy with \bLantus(R) or pioglitazone in patients inadequately controlled on metformin or \ba sulfonylurea, the free fatty acid decreases seen with Lantus(R) were \bsignificantly greater than with pioglitazone (week 24: -0.19 plus or minus \b0.02 versus -0.13 plus or minus 0.02mmol/l, P=0.03, week 48: -0.23 plus or \bminus 0.02 versus -0.15 plus or minus 0.02mmol/l, P=0.01). \b\b \b   \"Physicians and patients face a difficult choice when glycemic control \btargets are not achieved with metformin or a sulfonylurea,\" explained lead \bstudy author Janet McGill, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Co-Director of \bthe Prevention and Control Core of the Diabetes Research and Training Center, \bWashington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.  \"This study is \bparticularly timely, as the need for a better understanding of the metabolic \baffects associated with rosiglitazone, pioglitazone and Lantus(R) has never \bbeen greater.\" \b\b \b   The most common adverse events in this study were infections and \binfestations, nervous system disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue \bdisorders, general disorders and administration-site conditions, and \bgastrointestinal disorders. Overall, hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia \boccurred more frequently with patients treated with insulin glargine as \bcompared to those treated with pioglitazone. \b\b \b   The second analysis (Free Fatty Acid (FFA) Changes with Insulin Glargine \b(GLAR) vs Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) According to Baseline A1C in T2DM - \bAbstract # 0889-P) also compared the free fatty acid-lowering effects of add- \bon therapy with Lantus(R) versus TZDs, including a comparison with \brosiglitazone (study 2) as well as pioglitazone (study 1). Patients were \bgrouped using baseline A1C (an important test that measures average blood \bglucose control over a two- to three-month period) scores by low, middle, and \bhigh levels. \b\b \b   After 24 weeks, mean decreases in free fatty acid were significantly \bgreater with Lantus(R) versus pioglitazone in the middle (-0.19 plus or minus \b0.03 versus -0.09 plus or minus 0.03mmol/L, P=0.02) and high (-0.24 plus or \bminus 0.03 versus -0.13 plus or minus 0.03mmol/L, P=0.02) A1C groups (study \b1). \b\b \b   The baseline A1C-dependent effect on free fatty acid levels may be more \bpronounced with Lantus(R), possibly reflecting greater A1C reductions in \bpatients with higher baseline A1C. \b\b \b   In the comparison between Lantus(R) and rosiglitazone, free fatty acid \bdecreases were similar after 24 weeks, but decreases in triglyceride levels \bwere significantly greater with Lantus(R) in the low A1C group (A1C 6.4-8.1 \bpercent, P=0.006). High triglycerides are one of many factors that may \bindicate a person is at risk for heart disease, which accounts for about 65 \bpercent of deaths in people with diabetes. \b\b \b   The most common adverse events in this study were infections and \binfestations, nervous system disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue \bdisorders, general disorders and administration-site conditions, and \bgastrointestinal disorders. Overall, hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia \boccurred more frequently with patients treated with insulin glargine compared \bto those treated with pioglitazone; however, there were no differences in \bhypoglycemia between the patients treated with insulin glargine and those \btreated with rosiglitazone. \b\b \b   \"The benefits seen in these studies are very promising and will be \bexamined further, as we continue to explore the cardiovascular potential of \bLantus(R) treatment,\" stated Antonio Tataranni, MD, Vice President, Medical \bMetabolism, sanofi-aventis. \"For example, the ongoing ORIGIN study will \bexamine long-term cardiovascular outcomes in more than 12,000 diabetic and \bpre-diabetic patients. The ORIGIN study is now fully enrolled and we expect \bits results in 2010.\" \b\b \b\b    About Poster 1 \b\b \b   (Change in Lipid Variables With Insulin Glargine (GLAR) vs Pioglitazone \b(PIO) Added to a Sulfonylurea (SU) or Metformin (MET)  - Abstract # 0890-P) \b\b \b   This randomized, multicenter, 48-week, parallel-group, open label study \bcompared the lipid changes observed with Lantus(R) (n=129) and pioglitazone \b(n=130) add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes patients inadequately controlled \bwith greater than or equal to 50 percent of the maximum labeled dose of a \bsulfonylurea or greater than or equal to 1000mg of metformin.  Free fatty \bacid, triglyceride and HDL changes were compared in the two groups \b(sulfonylurea or metformin). \b\b \b   After 48 weeks, A1C was decreased to a significantly greater extent in the \bmetformin group of the glargine versus pioglitazone group (P<0.024; for the \bsulfonylurea at 48 weeks P=NS).  Free fatty acid decreases from baseline with \bLantus(R) were significantly greater than pioglitazone at both 24 weeks and 48 \bweeks for the group receiving sulfonylurea (week 24: -0.19 plus or minus 0.02 \bversus -0.11 plus or minus 0.03mmol/l, P=0.05, week 48: -0.21 plus or minus \b0.03 versus -0.10 plus or minus 0.04mmol/l, P=0.03) \b\b \b\b    About Poster 2 \b\b \b   (Free Fatty Acid (FFA) Changes with Insulin Glargine (GLAR) vs \bThiazolidinediones (TZDs) According to Baseline A1C in T2DM - Abstract # 0889- \bP) \b\b \b   This analysis was based on study one and a randomized, multicenter, 24- \bweek, parallel-group, open label study to assess free fatty acid and \btriglyceride changes according to baseline A1C in type 2 diabetes patients \binadequately controlled on a sulfonylurea and/or metformin receiving add-on \btherapy with either Lantus(R) or rosiglitazone).  The poster examines results \bof these pioglitazone and rosiglitazone arms as two separate studies. \b\b \b   In the Lantus(R) (n=165) versus pioglitazone (n=182) study, baseline and \bweek 24 lipid values were available for 121 and 129 patients, respectively. \bBaseline A1C groups were defined as low (7.1 - 8.6 percent), middle (8.7 - 9.7 \bpercent), and high (9.8 - 13.4 percent). In the Lantus(R) (n=105) versus \brosiglitazone (n=112) comparison, baseline and week 24 lipid values were \bavailable for 87 and 83 patients, respectively.  A1C groups at this juncture \bwere low (6.4 - 8.1 percent), middle (8.2 - 9.2 percent) and high (9.3 - 11.0 \bpercent). \b\b \b   In the Lantus(R)-pioglitazone study, decreases in mean plus or minus SE \bfree fatty acid were significantly greater with Lantus(R) versus pioglitazone \bin the middle (-0.19 plus or minus 0.03 versus -0.09 plus or minus 0.03mmol/L, \bP=0.02) and high (-0.24 plus or minus 0.03 versus -0.13 plus or minus \b0.03mmol/L, P=0.02) A1C groups. In the Lantus(R)-rosiglitazone comparison, \bfree fatty acid decreases were similar with glargine and rosiglitazone. \bDecreases in triglycerides were similar for glargine and pioglitazone in all \bgroups regardless of baseline A1C, and significantly greater with glargine \bversus rosiglitazone in the low A1C group (-0.36 plus or minus 0.14 versus \b0.20 plus or minus 0.14, P=0.006). \b\b \b\b    About Diabetes \b\b \b   Diabetes is a chronic, widespread condition in which the body does not \bproduce or properly use insulin -- the hormone needed to convert glucose \b(sugar) into energy. More than 230 million people worldwide are living with \bthe disease. This number is expected to rise to a staggering 350 million \bwithin 20 years.(1) It is estimated more than 20 million Americans have \bdiabetes, including an estimated 6.2 million who remain undiagnosed.(2) At the \bsame time, approximately half of those diagnosed are not achieving the general \bblood sugar control standard of A1C <7 percent recommended by the American \bDiabetes Association (ADA).(3) The A1C test measures average blood glucose \blevels over a two- to three-month period. \b\b \b\b    About sanofi-aventis \b\b \b   Sanofi-aventis is one of the world leaders in the pharmaceutical industry, \branking number one in Europe.

\u001d  By Rebecca Christie \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) expects there to be U.S. demand for more than 200 of its C-130J cargo planes in coming years, business development executive Jim Grant said in a Paris Air Show interview. \u001d  The Pentagon has not yet begun to aggressively seek funds for a big new purchase. But the U.S. Air Force has said it would like to buy 115 more planes for special operations missions, and possibly another 50 or so combat delivery aircraft as older models wear out. \u001d  Lockheed Martin also predicts the Marine Corps will want to buy more C-130J tankers to replace its aging fleet, and the Coast Guard could follow suit. This would add up to healthy ongoing demand for the workhorse cargo plane, which former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld tried to cancel in late 2004. \u001d  \"We see a very, very bright future for the C-130J,\" said Grant, Lockheed Martin's vice president for customer engagement on airlift programs. \u001d  International sales also are a possibility, but in smaller numbers. This week, Norway's parliament approved a proposed four-plane deal. Canada, India and Israel also are looking at proposed purchases, Lockheed Martin said. \u001d  Teal Group, a Washington-area consulting firm, expects the C-130J line to sell 18 to 20 aircraft per year through at least 2020. Richard Aboulafia, the firm's aircraft expert, said international sales are on track to pick up because Lockheed Martin has lowered its per-plane price. \u001d  A new C-130J currently sells for between $55 million and $65 million per aircraft, depending on purchase options, Grant said. The plane comes in two basic styles, a short-body version for special missions and a longer plane for routine transport use. \u001d  Lockheed's cargo plane outlook also will be affected by U.S. Air Force plans to upgrade cockpits in older C-130 models. Boeing Co. (BA) is developing an avionics modernization program kit and will build the first batch of so-called AMP kits. \u001d  But Boeing and Lockheed may face off for mass production of the kits because of lingering fallout from an Air Force procurement scandal. The Air Force said last week that the C-130 AMP production competition is slated for fiscal year 2011. \u001d  Boeing will be required to qualify contractors to compete for that contract, the Air Force said. That could affect any cockpit upgrades sought for foreign fleets, as well as the U.S. inventory. The Air Force recently reduced the number of C-130s it plans to upgrade, saying it would prefer to buy new planes if it can find the money. \b \u001d  -By Rebecca Christie, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9243; Rebecca.Christie@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 11:34 ET (15:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d78b16b5811bda15882526f235b7ce59","symR":["BWC"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock World Investment Trust (BWC)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T07:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BWC"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  BlackRock World Investment Trust (BWC): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BWC or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 03:35 ET (07:35 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d7f3e15aef5137992122c9cc97927e43","symR":["ASFI"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for ASTA Funding","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T07:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ASFI"],"IndustryCodes":["CFN","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  ASTA Funding: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=ASFI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 03:12 ET (07:12 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d7fb41d3b6ab1bf6c8271f771146cd91","symR":["JPZ"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen Equity Premium Income Fund (JPZ)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T08:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JPZ"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen Equity Premium Income Fund (JPZ): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=JPZ or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 04:51 ET (08:51 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"d86b0761a02cd6bdf48041532c3aa3f9","symR":["12085.FR","FR0000120859"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Imerys -

Review-Xinhua","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T11:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CAY.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BEIJING (Dow Jones)--The most recent draft of China's anti-monopoly law will add a requirement that regulators consider national security, not just antitrust, issues in reviewing foreign purchases of Chinese companies, the official official Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday, citing a meeting of lawmakers. \u001d  The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Sunday started reviewing the latest draft of the anti-monopoly law amid rising concerns over acquisitions of local firms by foreign investors. U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group L.P., for example, agreed in 2005 to buy a stake in heavy machinery maker, Xugong Group Construction Machinery Co., but the deal still awaits regulatory approval even though Carlyle has cut back its proposed stake. \u001d  \"Where national security is concerned, foreign companies merging with or buying domestic firms, or other ways of effecting a concentration of operators, will undergo review according to the relevant national rules,\" the report cited the draft as saying. \u001d  The latest draft law also won't specify the sales thresholds that would require companies planning a merger to notify the government, according to the report. \u001d  The lawmakers removed the criteria for the review because they couldn't agree on suitable sales levels, and will instead let the State Council, China's Cabinet, set the appropriate sales thresholds. \u001d  \"Operators whose level of concentration meets the thresholds under the State Council's rules should first notify the State Council's organization carrying out the anti-monopoly law. Transactions can't proceed before the notification is made,\" the report cited the draft as saying. \u001d  A previous draft, disclosed in June 2006, required companies planning a merger to notify the government, triggering an antitrust review, if their combined world-wide sales exceeded CNY12 billion and if any one company had Chinese sales of more than CNY800 million in the prior year. \u001d  An even earlier draft, dated July 2005, had set lower thresholds, which would have required more mergers and acquisitions to undergo antitrust review. \b \u001d  -By Terence Poon; Dow Jones Newswires;

the JANUVIA and Non-Exposed Groups \b        For Up to Two Years \b \bCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 23, 2007-- \u001d  Late breaking data presented at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 67th Annual Scientific Sessions showed that, when used investigationally as initial therapy, JANUVIA(TM) (sitagliptin) in combination with metformin provided significant glycemic improvement and was generally well tolerated over 54 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additional new data from investigational studies presented also showed that JANUVIA significantly improved blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes when added to a sulfonylurea, glimepiride (dual combination therapy), or when added to a sulfonylurea and metformin (triple combination therapy). Additional data were presented at the meeting regarding the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA. \b \b   JANUVIA is a selective, once-daily dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) \binhibitor that enhances a natural body system, called the incretin \bsystem, which helps to regulate glucose by affecting the beta cells \band alpha cells in the pancreas. JANUVIA is the first and only DPP-4 \binhibitor to be approved and marketed in the United States for \bpatients with type 2 diabetes. JANUVIA is indicated, as an adjunct to \bdiet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 \bdiabetes mellitus. JANUVIA is also indicated to improve glycemic \bcontrol, in combination with metformin or a thiazolidinedione (TZD), \bin patients with type 2 diabetes when the single agent alone plus diet \band exercise do not provide adequate glycemic control. JANUVIA should \bnot be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of \bdiabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. \bThere are no contraindications for JANUVIA. \b \u001d  Sitagliptin is also a component of JANUMET(TM) (sitagliptin/metformin HCl), the first and only tablet combining a DPP-4 inhibitor and metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. JANUMET is indicated, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes who are not adequately controlled on metformin or sitagliptin alone or in patients already being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin. Consistent with the labeling for metformin alone, JANUMET is contraindicated in patients with renal disease, renal dysfunction, or abnormal creatinine clearance; and acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis. JANUMET should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes. Consistent with the labeling for metformin alone, the labeling for JANUMET contains a boxed warning for lactic acidosis, a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with JANUMET. \b \u001d  Initial combination therapy with JANUVIA and metformin significantly improved blood sugar control compared with metformin alone over one year (LB-04; Study #036) \b \b   This study demonstrated a mean A1C reduction from baseline of 1.8 \bpercent in patients treated with JANUVIA 50 mg/metformin 1000 mg twice \bdaily for up to 54 weeks (n=153). Additionally, mean A1C reductions \bfrom baseline were 1.4 percent in patients treated with JANUVIA 50 \bmg/metformin 500 mg twice daily (n=147), 1.3 percent in patients \btreated with metformin 1000 mg twice daily (n=134), 1.0 percent in \bpatients treated with metformin 500 mg twice daily (n=117), and 0.8 \bpercent in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg once daily (n=106). \b \b   After completing an initial 24-week placebo-controlled phase \b(n=1091) (\"Phase A\"), 762 patients with a mean baseline A1C of 8.7 \bpercent continued in a 30-week, double-blind, active-controlled phase \b(\"Phase B\") on their previous active treatments: JANUVIA 50 \bmg/metformin 1000 mg twice daily (n=161); JANUVIA 50 mg/metformin 500 \bmg twice daily (n=160); metformin 1000 mg twice daily (n=153); \bmetformin 500 mg twice daily (n=147); and JANUVIA 100 mg once-daily \b(n=141). \b \b   Two-thirds (67 percent) of patients continuing past 24 weeks in \bthis study achieved the ADA target A1C goal of less than seven percent \bon JANUVIA 50 mg/metformin 1000 mg twice daily (n=153) compared to 44 \bpercent on metformin 1000 mg twice daily alone (n=134). Further, 48 \bpercent of patients treated with JANUVIA 50 mg/metformin 500 mg twice \bdaily (n=147), 25 percent of patients treated with metformin 500 mg \btwice daily (n=117), and 23 percent of patients treated with JANUVIA \b100 mg once daily (n=106) reached the ADA target A1C goal. \b \b   Duration of response was demonstrated by data showing that 85 \bpercent of patients treated with JANUVIA 50 mg/metformin 1000 mg twice \bdaily and 70 percent of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg once \bdaily who achieved the target A1C goal of less than seven percent at \bWeek 24 had a Week 54 A1C value of less than seven percent (n=96 and \b33, respectively). In addition, 80 percent of patients treated with \bJANUVIA 50 mg/metformin 500 mg twice daily (n=65), 79 percent of \bpatients treated with metformin 1000 mg twice daily (n=63), and 59 \bpercent of patients treated with metformin 500 mg twice daily (n=34) \bwho reached a goal A1C of less than seven percent at Week 24 had a \bWeek 54 A1C value of less than seven percent. \b \b   Over the 54 week study, five out of 182 patients (three percent) \btreated with JANUVIA 50 mg/metformin 1000 mg twice daily and two out \bof 182 patients (one percent) treated with metformin 1000 mg twice \bdaily had at least one episode of hypoglycemia. Incidences of \bgastrointestinal adverse experiences were similar to those observed \bwith metformin alone (26 percent vs. 31 percent with metformin 1000 mg \btwice daily). \b \b   \"Initial therapy with one agent is often unsuccessful at getting \bpatients to blood sugar goals. Many patients may require initial \bcombination therapy, and this study provides important and useful \binformation about the use of sitagliptin and metformin, in addition to \bdiet and exercise, in order to achieve and maintain blood sugar \bcontrol,\" said John Amatruda, M.D., vice president, clinical research, \bMerck & Co., Inc. \"This study examines the clinical effect of initial \bcombination therapy with JANUVIA and metformin, the two drugs \bcomprising JANUMET, over one year.\" \b \b   An important predictive factor of the magnitude of A1C reduction \bin response to anti-hyperglycemic therapy is a patient's starting \blevel of A1C. In a subgroup analysis of patients grouped by severity \bof starting baseline A1C, treatment with JANUVIA 50 mg/metformin 1000 \bmg twice daily demonstrated increasing mean A1C reductions from \bbaseline the higher the baseline A1C. A mean reduction of 3.1 percent \bwas seen in patients with baseline A1C of 10 percent or more (n=17), \bwhile reductions of 2.2 percent, 1.7 percent, and 1.0 percent were \bseen with baseline A1C values of nine to 10 percent, eight to nine \bpercent, and less than eight percent, respectively. \b \b   Investigational study showed JANUVIA significantly improved blood \bsugar control when added to sulfonylurea or to sulfonylurea and \bmetformin vs. sulfonylurea or sulfonylurea and metformin alone (Poster \b#535-P; Study #035) \b \b   In this study, which was designed to examine the efficacy and \bsafety of JANUVIA in patients with type 2 diabetes whose blood glucose \blevels were inadequately controlled (A1C levels of 7.5 percent to 10.5 \bpercent) on a sulfonylurea (glimepiride) alone or on a sulfonylurea \b(glimepiride) plus metformin, JANUVIA demonstrated a significant mean \bdifference from placebo in A1C of 0.9 percent in patients on \bglimepiride and metformin and 0.6 percent in patients on glimepiride \balone (p less than 0.001 for both comparisons to the addition of \bplacebo). \b \b   After a titration/stabilization period on glimepiride (at least 4 \bmg/day) with or without metformin (at least 1500 mg/day) and a 2-week \bplacebo run-in, 441 patients with a mean baseline A1C of 8.3 percent \bwere randomized to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once-daily or \bplacebo for 24 weeks. Of these patients, 212 were on glimepiride alone \b(106 each on JANUVIA or placebo), and 229 on glimepiride and metformin \b(116 on JANUVIA, 113 on placebo). The primary endpoint was A1C change \bfrom baseline for the entire cohort. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 15:56 ET (19:56

JANUVIA can be taken with or \bwithout food. \b \b    2.2 Patients with Renal Insufficiency \b \b    For patients with mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance \b(CrCl) greater than or equal to 50 mL/min, approximately corresponding \bto serum creatinine levels of less than or equal to 1.7 mg/dL in men \band less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL in women), no dosage adjustment \bfor JANUVIA is required. \b \b    For patients with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl greater than \b30 to less than 50 mL/min, approximately corresponding to serum \bcreatinine levels of greater than 1.7 to less than or equal to 3.0 \bmg/dL in men and greater than 1.5 to less than or equal to 2.5 mg/dL \bin women), the dose of JANUVIA is 50 mg once daily. \b \b    For patients with severe renal insufficiency (CrCl less than 30 \bmL/min, approximately corresponding to serum creatinine levels of \bgreater than 3.0 mg/dL in men and greater than 2.5 mg/dL in women) or \bwith end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or \bperitoneal dialysis, the dose of JANUVIA is 25 mg once daily. JANUVIA \bmay be administered without regard to the timing of hemodialysis. \b \b    Because there is a need for dosage adjustment based upon renal \bfunction, assessment of renal function is recommended prior to \binitiation of JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. Creatinine \bclearance can be estimated from serum creatinine using the \bCockcroft-Gault formula. (See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).) \b \b    3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS \b \b    -- 100 mg tablets are beige, round, film-coated tablets with \"277\" \bon one side. \b \b    -- 50 mg tablets are light beige, round, film-coated tablets with \b\"112\" on one side. \b \b    -- 25 mg tablets are pink, round, film-coated tablets with \"221\" \bon one side. \b \b    4 CONTRAINDICATIONS \b \b    None. \b \b    5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \b \b    Use in Patients with Renal Insufficiency: A dosage adjustment is \brecommended in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency \band in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal \bdialysis. (See Dosage and Administration (2.2); Clinical Pharmacology \b(12.3).) \b \b    Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia: In clinical \btrials of JANUVIA as monotherapy and JANUVIA as part of combination \btherapy with metformin or pioglitazone, rates of hypoglycemia reported \bwith JANUVIA were similar to rates in patients taking placebo. The use \bof JANUVIA in combination with medications known to cause \bhypoglycemia, such as sulfonylureas or insulin, has not been \badequately studied. \b \b    6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \b \b    Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying \bconditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of \ba drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of \banother drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \b \b    6.1 Clinical Trials Experience \b \b    In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination \btherapy, the overall incidence of adverse reactions with JANUVIA was \bsimilar to that reported with placebo. Discontinuation of therapy due \bto clinical adverse reactions was also similar to placebo. \b \b   Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of \b24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, \bJANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Two 24-week, placebo-controlled \bcombination studies, one with metformin and one with pioglitazone, \bwere also conducted. In addition to a stable dose of metformin or \bpioglitazone, patients whose diabetes was not adequately controlled \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 15:57 ET (19:57 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f76848b769b17d7aa6a07904a44630bf","symR":["VUG"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T09:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VUG"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\u001d  Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=VUG or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 24, 2007 05:49 ET (09:49 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f7c569f4f599cc1dae540d23fb6feb60","symR":["PHTM.LN","GB0008481250"],"date":"2007-06-24","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Activist To Call For Photo-Me Intl To Drop Review - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-24T11:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PHTM.LN","GB0008481250"],"IndustryCodes":["ENT","REQ","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Activist investor Brian Myerson plans to call for Photo-Me International PLC (PHTM.LN) to abandon a strategic review it has been carrying out over the past year, and for the resignation of four of the company's directors, reports The Sunday Times newspaper, without citing any sources. \u001d  Principle Capital, an investment fund headed by Myerson, will this week call for a shareholders' extraordinary meeting.
