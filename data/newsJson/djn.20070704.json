It's hard to see good fundamental reasons for valuations to go much higher when the sector is already benefiting from unusually favorable conditions. \u001d  So private-equity buzz may not be enough to sustain the share-price gains triggered by the Blackstone bid. Intercontinental Hotels shares were up over 5% and Accor's were up 7% Wednesday. \u001d  But both companies have seen strong-price gains in the past year, with Accor up 48% and Intercontinental up 35%. \u001d  That's left their stock trading at around a median multiple for the sector of 21X estimated 2008 earnings. That's hardly a bargain-basement valuation, especially when you consider Blackstone's offer values Hilton at around 14X estimated 2008 earnings. \u001d  Of course, Blackstone isn't the only private-equity firm to have seen the sector's potential. Colony Capital is a key shareholder in Accor where it forced a management shakeup last year and a shift in the company's strategy. \u001d  And you can see why there is so much interest. The hotel sector is enjoying a spectacular boom. \u001d  Buoyant real-estate markets worldwide are inflating hotel property values - up 9.4% in Europe in 2006 - pushing up average hotel-room values. \u001d  London tops the list in Europe with an average room value of EUR677,000, while the European average has hit a 14-year high at EUR252,000. \u001d  But the trade is doing well too. \u001d  Take Accor whose 2007 first quarter results, traditionally the weakest quarter in the hotel industry, showed like for like revenues from hotels up 7.2%, the strongest growth in the past ten years. \u001d  The upscale segment of its European hotel operation generated a revenue per available room up 13%, building on an already strong 2006 performance. \u001d  At Intercontinental, 2006 revenue per available room rose 9.8% even as it expanded aggressively, predicting it'll exceed its target of opening 60,000 new rooms by the end of 2008. \u001d  But therein lies the risk of future overcapacity and a squeeze on profits that the companies' frothy stock-market ratings don't seem to be discounting, particularly as monetary policy tightens globally, as well as the possibility of economic shocks that might hit the sector. \u001d  Investors have already discounted improved returns as the hotel groups dispose of their property portfolios to focus on being asset-light service companies. Cash from the sales can be used for acquisitions or returned to investors. \u001d  Now, Blackstone's bid for Hilton was at a 40% premium to the previous day's closing price, an impressive sign of the  further value that some investors are expecting from these companies. \u001d  But this may prove to be as good as it gets. \b \u001d  (Sean Walters, the newest member of Dow Jones Newswires' Skeptic team, has previously consulted on such areas as operational strategy, marketing and finance.

(TSX VENTURE:BXX) is pleased to announce that subsequent to having successfully completed its due diligence, it has signed the Option Agreement with ElDore Mining Corporation Limited (ASX:EDM) pursuant to the original letter agreement described in a news release dated May 7th, 2007. The Option Agreement provides Boxxer the right to acquire a 65% interest in the Nalesbitan gold project (the \"Property\") located in the Province of Camarines Norte, within Barangay Dumagman, Municipality of Lobo, Republic of the Philippines. The Property comprises a contiguous block of 14 mining claims covering 1,184 hectares (approximately 2,800 acres) and is located approximately 300 kms. east-southeast of Manila, on the Bicol Peninsula on the country's main island of Luzon. \b\b \b\bThe proposed terms and conditions of the Option Agreement are: \b\b \b\b1. Boxxer will assume (by novation) EDM's farm-in rights to the joint venture and the obligations to spend the balance of US$7,000,000 remaining under the farm-in joint venture agreement to earn a 37% interest in the economic benefits of the Property; \b\b \b\b2. Boxxer will acquire EDM's 28% Property interest on payment of the following cash obligations: \b\b \b\bPayment of US$3,000,000 to EDM, which represents EDM's expenditures on the Property to date, and an additional US$3,000,000 bonus. The total payments (the \"Payments\") to EDM would be approximately US$6,000,000, less the expenditures incurred by Boxxer during the due diligence period, to be paid as follows: \b\b \b\b(a) US$50,000 cash payment on signing the Option agreement (these funds have been paid); \b\b \b\b(b) US$100,000 cash payment on completion of a positive feasibility study on the Property \b\b \b\b(c) US$250,000 cash payment on the Option being exercised and transfer of the 28% equity interest; \b\b \b\b(d) US$250,000 cash payment on reaching commercial production, and \b\b \b\b(e) thereafter US$250,000 per quarter until full payont of the US$6,000,000. \b\b \b\bThe condition precedent to entering into the Option Agreement of Boxxer having to complete a C$1.5 million financing has been waived by EDM. EDM has also obtained regulatory approval for the proposed transaction. \b\b \b\bA considerable amount of exploration and development has been completed on the Property over the past 20 years. The Property is underlain by variably altered volcanics and is considered to have potential for epithermal gold-silver mineralization and porphyry related copper-gold-silver molybdenum mineralizatioin. The main area of surface gold-silver mineralization located within the Project is referred to as the Nalesbitan Hill Gold Deposit. \b\b \b\bBoxxer is currently assessing the previous drilling results from the Nalesbitan Project, where gold mineralization in the main zone is exposed on surface. Boxxer plans to commence a 2,100 meter infill diamond and reverse circulation drilling program to confirm the continuity and grade of the gold mineralization in this zone in mid to late July. One of the objectives of the drilling program is to test the zone of gold mineralization to a maximum depth of 90 metres below surface. A minor program of the drilling program will be used to test several of the other zones of gold mineralization previously identified on the property. \b\b \b\bTaiga Consultants Ltd. of Calgary, Alberta has been retained to complete a National Instrument #43-101 compliant report (the \"Report\") on the Property.

The report comprehensively covers seven territories and seven classes of business. \b \b   The key findings of the report are: \b \b   --  The four major factors identified in April--favorable 2006 \b        financial results, continued capital infusion, diversifying \b        reinsurer appetites and the populist movement in the United \b        States--continue to depress reinsurance property pricing and \b        in turn increase competition for other lines of business. \b \b   --  A fifth factor is emerging this July renewal cycle. Insurers \b        are being squeezed and are buying less reinsurance and as a \b        consequence, there is less premium in the market. Reinsurers \b        are competing aggressively for the remaining more volatile \b        business. \b \b   --  July 1 reinsurance pricing, depending on the insurers' \b        specific experience, remained flat or fell, in some cases \b        significantly. \b \b   --  The capital markets are emerging as increasingly viable \b        competitors to traditional reinsurers. \b \b   --  In North America, reinsurers contend with price competition, \b        capital market competition, government-sponsored reinsurance \b        vehicles (Florida's Hurricane Catastrophe Fund), and the \b        explosion of residual markets (\"Fair Plans\"). \b \u001d  Peter Hearn, CEO, Willis Re commented: \"The reinsurance industry is undergoing seminal change and includes a variety of constituents such as the capital markets, local governments, residual markets and self insurance. We welcome these changes and continue to provide consultative advice to help our clients identify, quantify and spread their risk.\" \b \u001d  Willis Group Holdings Limited is a leading global insurance broker, developing and delivering professional insurance, reinsurance, risk management, financial and human resource consulting and actuarial services to corporations, public entities and institutions around the world.

Iberdrola shares have outperformed the Spanish benchmark IBEX index by 30% in the past three years. \u001d  But they have underperformed the Spanish market by nearly 7% since talk first surfaced last month of a possible big U.S. acquisition. \u001d  While the GBP11.6-billion purchase of ScottishPower fitted the bill, even though Iberdrola paid a full price, you'd have thought Iberdrola would focus on integrating the British company. Instead, it surprised investors with a EUR6.4-billion acquisition of Energy East Corp. \u001d  The transaction raises eyebrows for a number of reasons. \u001d  First, Iberdrola's hands are full. ScottishPower apart, it is also preparing to float its enlarged renewable-energy business. \u001d  Secondly, EECis hardly a prize asset. Investors have to take Iberdrola's word for its ability to improve EEC's performance for the investment to represent the valuable diversification away from Europe and Latin America that the Spanish company says it is. \u001d  Unfortunately, the record of European utilities on making U.S. acquisitions work, given the complicating factors of local politics and regulations, isn't good. One example is ScottishPower itself which unplugged its PacificCorp deal in 2005, taking a charge of $1.7 billion. \u001d  After all, EEC is a transmission and distribution company, catering to retail customers between New York State and Maine. \u001d  As such, the business faces more onerous regulation than a generation business. Late last year the New York State Public Service Commission cut the yearly value of EEC's state electricity tariff by $36.2 million, when the utility had asked for a $58-million increase. \u001d  And EECisn't a best-in-class asset, compared with some of its peers. Its balance sheet is relatively stretched with average 3-year EBIT interest coverage at 2.1X, lower than 2.5X for ConEd, 3.6X for NSTAR and 4X for CH Energy Group. Its 3-year return on equity, at 8.6%, is lower than its peers. \u001d  So Iberdrola has some heavy lifting to do long-term to improve Energy East's performance even if the purchase won't have an immediate impact on Iberdrola's balance sheet, having raised fresh equity to finance the cash deal. \u001d  Iberdrola is taking on EEC's $3.4-billion investment plan to upgrade infrastructure and modernize its metering system. \u001d  And EEC makes up no small part of Iberdrola's overall business, equivalent to around 15% of assets and around 10% Ebitda at the enlarged group. \u001d  Iberdrola will have to find all the value it can from making EEC more efficient if management is to convince shareholders there's more to its strategy than self-preservation. \b \u001d  (Arindam Nag has covered business and finance for 16 years in Asia, Europe and the United States.

Open pit Resources are reported above a 1g/t cut off inclusive of ROM/low grade stockpiles and material milled to date (shown in note 4, below). Resources as at 30 April are shown in the table below. Gold grades for the reported open pit resource have been determined using Multiple Indicator Kriging (MIK) based on block dimensions of 12.5m (east) x 25m (north) x 6m (elevation) and using a selective mining unit of 2m (east) by 5m (north) by 2.5m (elevation). Gold estimation and model blocks were constrained within geologically derived wireframes. Due to the homogenous nature of the data no top cut has been applied to the resource data prior to estimation. It is observed that higher values in the dataset have little influence on the grade of the deposit. \b \b \b=--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                         Tonnes \bOpen Pit resource as at 30 April 2007       (Mt)       Au g/t           Moz \b=--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bMeasured                                     21           1.9           1.3 \b=--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bIndicated                                    12           1.7           0.6 \b=--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bMeasured + Indicated Total                   32           1.8           1.9 \b=--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bInferred                                      6           1.8           0.3 \b=--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b \b2.

The cost of the material began to rise in the last financial year, said Wiseman. \u001d  \"HDPE costs have risen further since then and will impact our outlook unless these costs subside or we seek recovery in the period ahead,\" he said. \u001d  By 0710 GMT, the company's shares were down 2 pence, or 0.5%, at 520 pence in a higher London market. \u001d  The rise in volumes was largely expected, said Nicola Mallard at Investec Securities. \"It's mainly last year's contract gains,\" she said, though there will be some additional volume coming through later in the year as a result of a Cooperative contract. \u001d  The company secured contracts in its last financial year to supply convenience store chain One Stop and supermarket group Booths. It also expanded its supply deals with J Sainsbury PLC (SBRY.LN) and Tesco PLC (TSCO.LN). \u001d  Mallard pointed out that the rising cost of packaging was an issue for the whole industry. She said it would be mitigated to some extent by the rise in prices paid for raw milk by the major supermarkets - which should filter through to producers like Robert Wiseman. \u001d  From July 1, 126 of Robert Wiseman's producers in Scotland benefitted from the GBP25 million Tesco Sustainable Dairy Group Initiative, which raised the price producers receive for their milk to 22 pence per liter. Sainsbury has also pledged to raise prices paid to dairy farmers. \u001d  Mallard said the company would also be able to make efficiency gains next year once the Bridgwater dairy is operational. \u001d  The company is constructing a new dairy in the South West of England, which will process 500 million liters of milk per year, and service customers in the south of England much more efficiently than at present. \u001d  Construction of the new dairy at Bridgwater in Somerset is progressing satisfactorily, the company said, and production should commence on schedule in December 2007. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.wiseman-dairies.co.uk \b \u001d  -By Michael Carolan, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9278; michael.carolan@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 03:25 ET (07:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0d132e5b2f6c4a0f73492d87cef28f88","symR":["ATEC.VI","AT00000ATEC9"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Austria's A-Tex Industries Plans Debut Hybrid Bond Issue","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T14:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ATEC.VI","AT00000ATEC9"],"IndustryCodes":["FAC","XATX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 10:19 ET (14:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0d6a4dd27e4967f6036e4c2de7ba8182","symR":["UMI.BT","BE0003626372"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Umicore Shr Price Likely To Keep Rising - Degroof","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T13:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UMI.BT","BE0003626372"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XB20","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  1342 GMT [Dow Jones]--Umicore SA's (UMI.BT) share price will likely keep rising on top of strong gains seen this week, thanks to Citigroup's target price hike for the group and increasing optimism on Nyrstar's value, predicts Bank Degroof. \"I'm certainly counseling not to sell,\" says Degroof's Bernard Hanssens, adding \"it's too early to tell just how much value will be created\" for Umicore through Nyrstar.

(Nasdaq: ENTU), a world leader in securing digital identities and information, today announced its preliminary financial results for the second quarter ending June 30, 2007. \b \u001d  Entrust expects total revenue for the quarter to be approximately $24.3 million, an increase of 10% over Q2, 2006.  Product revenue for the quarter is expected to be approximately $8.8 million, an increase of 20% over Q2, 2006. Services revenue is expected to be approximately $15.5 million, an increase of 6% over Q2, 2006. \b \u001d  Net income on a GAAP basis is expected to be a loss of $0.05 per share for the second quarter, down from a net loss of $0.02 per share in Q2, 2006.  On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share for the second quarter are expected to be a loss of approximately $0.02, down from $0.00 per share in Q2, 2006.  These non-GAAP results exclude the following items: amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, restructuring and related adjustments, stock- based compensation, and impairment of certain strategic investments. See the financial table below reconciling these non-GAAP figures to GAAP. \b \u001d  \"I am pleased that we grew product revenue 29 percent for the first half of the year, however I am disappointed in our revenue attainment from large deals in the quarter.  Our growth is underpinned by our revenue from transactions under $500 thousand, which increased by 50 percent in first half of the year over last year and our $5 million increase in deferred revenue from Q2, 2006,\" said Bill Conner, Entrust Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  \"Based on the growth on IdentityGuard, PKI, total transactions, new customers and our services business I feel we are well positioned to continue to execute our growth plan for the second half of 2007.\" \b \b \b    Additional Business Highlights: \b \b     - Total revenue increased 13% for the first half of 2007 over the first \b       half of 2006, and increased 10% over Q2, 2006. \b     - Product revenue increased 29% for the first half of 2007 over the first \b       half of 2006, and increased 19% over Q2, 2006. \b     - Deferred revenue is expected to be over $28.0 million, an increase of \b       $5.0 million from the $23.0 million in the second quarter of 2006. \b     - Product revenue from deals under $500 thousand increased 37% over Q2, \b       2006.  For the first half of 2007, product revenue from deals under \b       $500 thousand increased 50% over the first half of 2006. \b     - Entrust's top 5 product revenue transactions accounted for 8 percent of \b       revenue in the quarter.  Entrust's largest transaction was a U.S. \b       federal government deal valued at approximately $1.0 million, and there \b       were no product deals over $1.0 million in the quarter. \b     - Transactions increased to 107, up 51% over Q2, 2006.  For the first \b       half of 2007 transactions increased 69% over the first half of 2006. \b       New customer traction continued to increase, adding 30 new customers in \b       the quarter, up 67% over Q2, 2006.  For the first half of 2007 new \b       customers increased 89% over the first half of 2006. \b     - Entrust IdentityGuard product revenue increased 40% over Q2, 2006 and \b       the company achieved their first Entrust IdentityGuard Token shipments. \b     - PKI product revenue increased 9% over Q2, 2006 driven by record SSL and \b       new Extended Validation (EV) SSL certificate revenue. \b     - Single Sign-on (SSO) product revenue increased 95% over Q2, 2006 driven \b       by government portals and interest in providing SSO as part of a \b       layered authentication approach with Entrust IdentityGuard. \b     - Services revenue in the quarter was approximately $15.5 million, which \b       is up 6% from Q2 of last year.  The key driver for the increase in \b       services revenue was the company's 2nd highest quarterly support and \b       maintenance revenue attainment. \b     - Entrust expects to have positive cash flow from operations for the \b       quarter.  Cash and marketable securities increased to over $23.0 \b       million from $20.8 million in the first quarter of 2007. \b \b \b    Guidance: \b \u001d  Entrust is now targeting total revenue for the second half of 2007 of $55.0 million. Entrust is targeting a net loss of $.02 per share for the second half of 2007 and a non-GAAP income per share of $0.04.  These non-GAAP results exclude the following items: amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions, restructuring and related adjustments, stock-based compensation, and impairment of certain strategic investments.

The company's management believes that by excluding charges such as the purchased intangibles amortization in cost of goods sold, the amortization of purchased intangible assets in operating expenses, stock compensation expense, restructuring charges and write down of strategic investments from its GAAP- based results, these non-GAAP financial measures are more likely to facilitate investors' understanding of the company's ongoing business operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons to the operating results of the company's competitors and provide investors with greater transparency with respect to the supplemental information used by management in its operational and financial decision making. \b \u001d  The non-GAAP measures are included to provide investors with supplemental information to facilitate their understanding of Entrust's operating results and future prospects. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to assess its success in reducing the company's cost structure, to measure its ongoing cash operating costs, and to establish budgets and operational goals. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial and operating results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as non-GAAP measures are susceptible to varying calculations and they may not be comparable, as presented, to other similarly titled measures of other companies. \b \u001d  This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to Entrust's projected revenue, net income and net loss per share and non-GAAP income per share for the second half of 2007.  Such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are unforeseen operating expenses, unconverted customer opportunities, issues associated with revenue recognition, issues raised in connection with the review of quarterly financial results, and the risk factors detailed from time to time in Entrust's periodic reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation Entrust's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. While Entrust may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, Entrust specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if its estimates change. \b \b    About Entrust \b \u001d  Entrust (NASDAQ: ENTU) secures digital identities and information for governments, enterprises and consumers in 1,650 organizations spanning 60 countries.

That reverses a trend of slowing growth that began in February. \u001d  The Voca monthly index takes into account changes in tax, national insurance contribution rates and other employer payments or deductions. The figures are calculated as a three-month moving average. \u001d  Voca said the growth of take-home pay was particularly strong in the manufacturing sector, increasing 4.8% in June. \u001d  However, with official statistics recording a continued contraction in manufacturing employment, Voca said the rise in take-home pay may reflect higher redundancy payments rather than the growth of basic wages. \u001d  Even at its higher rate of growth, take-home pay is likely to have declined in real terms in June. According to official data, the most comprehensive measure of inflation recorded a 4.5% increase in consumer prices over the year to May. \u001d  The pickup in take-home pay will make it slightly more likely that the Bank of England will raise its key, Bank rate to 5.75% from 5.5% Thursday in an effort to assure consumers that it will succeed in bringing the inflation rate back down to its 2.0% target over the next two years. \b \u001d  -Paul Hannon, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9491; paul.hannon@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 09:18 ET (13:18 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1c7ce10dc61760e01c682cb5c3ef8a8c","symR":["UKDAY"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"UK 1Q Housing Equity Withdrawal GBPB13.2B Vs GBP13.3B 4Q","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T08:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b \u001d  Corrected July 4, 2007 04:49 ET (08:49 GMT)\u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 04:36 ET (08:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1cf69e56b1a37ac1f78604df93ae3491","symR":["12050.FR","12777.FR","FTE","VOD","VOD.LN","FR0000120503","FR0000127771","GB00B16GWD56"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EU Crt Rules Changes To SFR, Orange 3G Licenses Were Legal","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T07:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12050.FR","12777.FR","FTE","VOD","VOD.LN","FR0000120503","FR0000127771","GB00B16GWD56"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","CON","CTS","FTS","MED","MOV","TLS","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LUXEMBOURG (Dow Jones)--The French government acted legally when it changed the conditions of third-generation mobile telecommunications licenses granted to SFR and Orange, a European Union court ruled Wednesday. \u001d  The court rejected an appeal from French conglomerate and mobile phone operator Bouygues SA (12050.FR).

PLC (MGCR.LN), a U.K. specialist materials company, said Wednesday that its interim results will be hurt by the strengthening of sterling but that it remains on the look out for bolt-on acquisitions. \u001d  The weakness of a number of currencies, particularly those related to the U.S. dollar, will hit its first-half revenue by around GBP20 million and its underlying operating profit and GBP4 million compared with the year-ago period, Morgan Crucible said in a trading update ahead of its Aug. 1 results release. \u001d  However, on a constant currency basis, the business is performing \"strongly,\" with revenue growth up around 8% in the first six months of 2007. The result is largely thanks to the strong performance of the group's thermal ceramics and carbon businesses. \u001d  Analysts said trading was \"ahead of expectation,\" and Cazenove upgraded its rating on the stock to outperform from in-line and increased its full-year forecasts. \u001d  Cazenove and Bridgewell agreed that the stock has greater upside than its sector peers, and Cazenove suggested the shares \"could test the 310 pence level.\" \u001d  At 0753 GMT, Morgan Crucible's shares were up 6.75 pence, or 2.3%, at 299.5 pence in a slightly higher London market. \u001d  Morgan Crucible said the strength of its balance sheet gives it \"the flexibility to pursue bolt-on acquisitions to support our core businesses and accelerate our growth strategy.\" \u001d  \"As we have indicated before, if we are unable to find suitable acquisitions at the right price, we are committed to improving balance-sheet efficiency as we have demonstrated with our share buyback program,\" Morgan Crucible said. \u001d  The company has bought back and canceled 12.5 million shares, or 4% of shares in issue, at a cost of GBP34 million. \u001d  Morgan Crucible said the board \"remains confident in the strength of our core businesses and in the potential for continued improvement in our operating profit margins. The platform we have created allows us to look forward to further progress in the second half of the year.\" \u001d  Chief Executive Mark Robertshaw said the group's strategy \"remains to focus on higher-margin, higher-growth, higher-value-added products and markets and to continue to drive down our cost base as we further rationalize our manufacturing footprint and increase our proportion of manufacturing in low-cost locations.\" \u001d  \"We are also continuing to look actively for acquisitions to support our core businesses; however, we are determined to maintain our financial and strategic discipline if we believe sellers' price expectations to be unrealistic,\" he said. \u001d  \"The healthy organic growth of the group combined with our robust balance sheet put Morgan Crucible in a strong position to continue to drive towards our target of mid-teen operating profit margins,\" he said. \u001d  In the first half of 2007, group operating profit margins post restructuring were up more than 11% from 6.3% in the same period a year earlier. \u001d  \"The momentum in group underlying profit margins has continued into 2007 with margins before restructuring and one-off costs expected to be over 12% for the half year compared to 10.6% in the first half of 2006 with all divisions once again delivering margin progression,\" Morgan Crucible said. \u001d  Morgan Crucible shares closed at 293 pence Tuesday, valuing the company at GBP822.4 million. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.morgancrucible.com \u001d  -By Lilly Vitorovich, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-0-207 842 9290; lilly.vitorovich@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 04:07 ET (08:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"201cf12a5e018affc4e8a4bc409c3b5c","symR":["CADAY"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"TIMED WIRE: Canada Programming Schedule: Wed July 4","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CADAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b \bTime (EST)         Feature                     *DJNS Code \b \b11 AM          =Canada Hot Stocks                  N/NYH \b \b11:50 AM       =Toronto Midday Stock Comment       N/TOR \b \bNoon           =CANADA VENTURE                     N/XCH \b \b12:30 PM       =Canada News Highlights             N/HOH \b \b2 PM           =Canada Hot Stocks                  N/NYH \b \b4:20 PM        =Toronto Closing Stock Comment      N/TOR \b \b4:30 PM        =Canada News Highlights             N/HOH \b \u001d  *To learn the codes you need to use for your particular vending system, please contact our customer service department at 800-223-2274 or by e-mail at Newswires@dowjones.com. \b-0- \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 08:00 ET (12:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2029edb65a31cc4f032e6334884cdd4d","symR":["ESLT","ESLT.TV","IL0010811243"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Elbit Systems Reports Claim Filed Vs Co., ImageSat, Others","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T14:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ESLT","ESLT.TV","IL0010811243"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","DFN","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  A claim has been filed by certain minority shareholders of ImageSat International N.V. against ImageSat, Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd., Elbit Systems Ltd.

No further details were provided by the group. \u001d  A Sportingbet spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires that talks were constructive but they couldn't find a middle ground. He declined to comment further. \u001d  The unstable regulatory environment in Europe, which has the online gambling sector under a cloud, made it impossible to agree on the terms of a merger, a Bwin spokesman said. \u001d    The decision comes two and half months after rivals, 888 Holdings PLC (888.LN) and Ladbrokes PLC (LAD.LN), called off similar tie-up talks amid the regulatory uncertainty and unexpected closure of the lucrative U.S. market last year. \u001d  888 took bets from U.S. customers prior to the government banning the sector, while Ladbrokes was mulling setting up online operations in the region. They were in tie-up talks for some seven months. \u001d  The Sportingbet announcement was expected among some industry observers and gaming analysts following growing uncertainty about the online gambling industry in Europe and Bwin's falling share price in recent months, Daniel Stewart & Co. analyst James Hollins said. \u001d  Some investors thought that Bwin's falling share price might have affected any deal involving Bwin securities, he noted. \u001d  There has been good institutional support for Sportingbet based on fundamentals of late, with the group doing well operationally, said Hollins, who is reinstating Sportingbet with a buy rating and 62 pence target price. \u001d  Daniel Stewart & Co. are house brokers to Sportingbet. \u001d  At 1242 GMT, Sportingbet shares were down 5 pence, or 8.1%, to 54 pence, valuing the group at GBP233.7 million, in a slightly higher London market. Bwin shares were up 2.8%  at EUR24.80 in a flat Vienna market. \u001d  Last month, Sportingbet posted a sharp rise in third-quarter group operating profit, and said it remained confident for the remainder of the financial year. \u001d  Stripping out exceptional charges, goodwill amortization and share option charges, group operating profit rose more than threefold to GBP3.0 million in the third quarter ended April 30 from GBP0.8 million in the same period a year earlier. The third-quarter result was underpinned by a strong performance in Sportingbet's core sports betting operations. \u001d  Group operating profit before exceptional items is the key figure U.K. investors and analyst track when assessing the group's operating performance. \u001d  Turnover from continuing operations rose to GBP291.1 million in the third-quarter from GBP229.4 million a year ago. \u001d  In order to aid comparison, the financial and operational information for the prior period is stated excluding the U.S. business, which was sold in October 2006, resulting in Sportingbet's exit from the market. \u001d   On March 7, Sportingbet confirmed it was in talks with Austria-based Bwin about the possible acquisition of Sportingbet in the wake of recent press speculation. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sportingbet.com \b                     http://www.bwin.com \b \u001d  -By Lilly Vitorovich, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-0-207 842 9290; lilly.vitorovich@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (Flemming Hansen in Vienna contributed to this story.) \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 08:52 ET (12:52 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"220e0fd3d97c98ba1a158aa657920484","symR":["GMEXICO.MX","MXP370841019"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Mexico Mining Union Plans 24-Hour Nationwide Walkout","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T17:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GMEXICO.MX","MXP370841019"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","ONF","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b \b   (Updates with comment from company official) \b \u001d  MEXICO CITY (Dow Jones)--Mexico's National Mining and Metal Workers Union plans to stage a 24-hour nationwide walkout Thursday unless labor authorities agree to address its demands over safety concerns at mines, a union official said Wednesday. \u001d  Carlos Pavon, the union's secretary of political affairs, said the planned walkout by \"nearly all\" of the union is set to start at 7 a.m. local time (1200 GMT) Thursday. \u001d  The union, which represents about 250,000 members, is also threatening to strike later this month at several facilities operated by Grupo Mexico (GMEXICO.MX), including the country's largest copper mine, Cananea, the zinc mine at Zacatecas and a smaller mine at Taxco, Pavon said. \u001d  The miners union, which has made most of its safety complaints against Grupo Mexico, is insisting the Labor Ministry get the company to sit down to negotiate its demands, Pavon added. \u001d  A Grupo Mexico official rejected the union charges about safety, saying the company is meeting standards at all of its facilities, and exceeding them in some. \u001d  The official said the effects of a one-day strike would probably be minimal, and would depend on the number of workers who decide to join in the stoppage.

Over the past year, the regulator has pressed operators to lower mobile phone roaming charges and has pushed for changes in several broadband markets. The commission last week took Germany to court for giving Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) a legal monopoly over the country's broadband network. \u001d  Telefonica's fine shows how the regulator is escalating its crackdown on antitrust abuses by levying heftier fines. In similar cases in 2003, Wanadoo, the Internet arm of France Telecom (FTE), was fined EUR10.4 million and Deutsche Telekom was penalized EUR12.6 million. In a range of recent collusion cases, fines have been several times larger than in comparable cases just a few years ago. \u001d    Kroes said Telefonica's fine was justified because of the seriousness of the abuse and the harm done to consumers. Spanish broadband customers pay 20% more than the average price in the 15 oldest E.U. member countries and Spain's broadband penetration rate is 20% lower than average, according to the commission. \u001d  Telefonica said it will appeal the fine, calling the commission's penalty \"unjustified and disproportionate.\" It added that it has complied with rules established by Spain's telecommunications regulator. \u001d   \"Telefonica finds itself squeezed between two regulators, the national regulator and the European Commission, which are at odds with each other,\" the company said in a statement. \u001d    Telefonica said its share of Spain's broadband market has decreased steadily to its current 55% from 95% in 2001. The company's main competitors for broadband services include Orange, a unit of France Telecom, and Jazztel PLC (JAZ.MC). \u001d  Being a former state-owned monopoly helped Telefonica rig Spain's broadband market, according to the commission. About 80% of high-speed Internet connections in Spain are made over fixed telephone lines. Telefonica, which was privatized in 1997, is the only Spanish telecommunications company with a nationwide fixed-line network. \u001d     The commission said that between September 2001 and December 2006, the margin between Telefonica's retail prices and the fees it charged for network access was too thin for other providers to cover their costs. \u001d  Telefonica's business plan and cost accounts show that the company \"could not have been unaware that it was engaging in a margin squeeze,\" the commission said. \u001d  The E.U. regulator opened a formal investigation into Telefonica's business practices in February 2006. That prompted Spain's telecommunications authority to force the company to lower its wholesale prices in December 2006, ending the company's antitrust abuses, according to the commission. \b \u001d  -By Adam Cohen, Dow Jones Newswires; +322 741 1486; adam.cohen@dowjones.com \u001d  (Peppi Kiviniemi and Jason Sinclair contributed to this article) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 07:56 ET (11:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"23cc7f2ad3396d022df21565baf27d4d","symR":["DWN.XE","DE0006283302"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"HSBC Upgrades Deutsche Wohnen To Overweight Vs Neutral","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T05:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DWN.XE","DE0006283302"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","RED","XDJGI","XSDAX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 01:44 ET (05:44 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"23e4f6840a31a3573e2983a007d10179","symR":["BBI","BBIB","DJDAY","MOVI"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"IN THE MONEY: Movie Gallery's Covenant Crisis Redux","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T11:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BBI","BBIB","DJDAY","MOVI"],"IndustryCodes":["CSV","OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \b   By Michael Rapoport \b   A Dow Jones Newswires Column \b \u001d  (This article was originally published Tuesday) \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Movie Gallery Inc. (MOVI) just showed investors how dangerous it can be to ever again trust a company once it gets into serious trouble with its debt covenants. \u001d  The video-store chain said late Monday it had failed to meet two covenants, the financial thresholds required to certify to its lenders that it's healthy. If the breach isn't resolved, the company's creditors would be able to collect immediately on $1.2 billion in debt. The stock crashed Tuesday, losing nearly two-thirds of its value to close at 66 cents. \u001d  This crisis comes in the wake of similar trouble meeting covenant levels that plagued Movie Gallery last year - a problem that seemed to be resolved when the company refinanced its credit facility in February and reset its covenants to very lenient, easy-to-meet levels. Not so, apparently. \u001d  What this means, in part, is that Movie Gallery appears to have had a second quarter so atrocious that it couldn't even meet those ultra-relaxed covenant levels. Some back-of-the envelope calculations suggest Movie Gallery's operations may have produced less than half the cash earnings in the second quarter than they did in the year-ago period. \u001d  But this crisis is also a reminder that Movie Gallery hasn't done very well in forecasting the future of its business. That goes for many other companies that get into covenant trouble as well. \u001d  When a company has covenant problems by definition that means it's in danger of not meeting the performance requirements to which it had previously agreed. Even if the company survives the crisis and gets its covenant levels waived or relaxed, that inability to forecast the future - to be able to tell just what a business is capable of, and what thresholds it can meet - can lead it back into covenant trouble all over again. Investors should realize that and be wary. \u001d  A Movie Gallery spokeswoman declined to comment. \u001d  But a look at the numbers suggests just how dismal its recently completed second quarter must have been. The company said Monday its covenant breach was caused by \"significantly softer-than-expected second-quarter results,\" and that may be an understatement. \u001d  Movie Gallery tripped two key covenants. One requires it to keep its \"leverage ratio\" - the ratio of its debt to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - within specified levels. The other requires the company to maintain a minimum level of \"interest coverage,\" or Ebitda as a multiple of the interest payments on its debt. \u001d  The leverage ratio Movie Gallery must meet is debt of no more than 6.75 times the last four quarters' Ebitda - a very lenient level, and one the company easily met earlier this year. The fact that Movie Gallery can't stay below that level now, combined with its current debt and its announced Ebitda for the prior three quarters, imply its second-quarter Ebitda must have been no more than about $37 million, compared with the year-ago figure of $57.6 million. (These are rough, highly unofficial calculations, not sanctioned by the company.) \u001d  It gets even worse when you look at the interest-coverage covenant under which the past four quarters' Ebitda must be at least 1.4 times the past four quarters' interest payments. Even taking into account the interest savings the company expected from the February refinancing, it appears second-quarter Ebitda must have been no more than around $26 million if the company failed to meet the required interest-covenant level. \u001d  In other words, the fact that the company failed both covenants suggests that roughly $26 million - down 55% from a year ago - is the maximum level of Ebitda that Movie Gallery could have posted in the second quarter. \u001d  To be fair, the terrible performance isn't all Movie Gallery's fault. Conditions in the video-rental business have been dismal lately; the company said in its statement Monday that \"we, like most of the industry, have experienced a sharp decline in our rental business\" in recent months. \u001d  Last week, Movie Gallery's rival Blockbuster Inc. (BBI) estimated revenues from the domestic in-store rental industry - the only kind of video rental Movie Gallery does, since it doesn't have an online-rental program - fell 13% in the first half of 2007. Blockbuster also said it needed a break on its own covenants because the company has been spending a lot on a new online-rental program. \u001d  Then again, part of the poor performance is Movie Gallery's fault. A big part of the company's problems has been its ill-fated acquisition of Hollywood Entertainment Corp. in 2005, which never worked out the way Movie Gallery hoped it would. \u001d  Movie Gallery is holding a conference call with its lenders Tuesday to address its problems. The company says its business will continue without interruption, and that it plans cost-cutting moves, including possibly closing or consolidating stores. Longer term, Movie Gallery says it will consider a sale of the company, a recapitalization and other alternatives. \u001d  But that may not help investors who've bought Movie Gallery stock in recent months. And any other investors who think they see good value in a beaten-down company with covenant troubles may want to think twice. \u001d  (Michael Rapoport is one of four \"In the Money\" columnists who take a sophisticated look at the value of companies, and their securities, and explore unique trading strategies.) \u001d  -By Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5976; michael.rapoport@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 07:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2430bff17d6f4723e48e0f487160e208","symR":["NXT.LN","GB0032089863"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Citigroup Lowers Next Price Target","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T06:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NXT.LN","GB0032089863"],"IndustryCodes":["RTS","SAP","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  0611 GMT [Dow Jones]--Citigroup lowers Next (NXT.LN) price target to 2200p from 2300p, citing deteriorating trading patterns.

Offloading its lagging biscuit division to Kraft Foods Inc. for a rich 5.3 billion euros ($7.2 billion) leaves the French consumer group as a pure play in the attractive dairy-products and beverages businesses, but there are still improvements to be made. \u001d  Top of the list: Danone needs to buy out as many of its partners as possible. The company's disastrous experience in China is a lesson. A spat with Zong Qinghou, its partner in China, has devastated Danone's promising business there. Danone's Indian experience is hardly more encouraging. There, it is locked in arbitration to end a biscuit partnership -- which Kraft isn't buying. \u001d  Danone may need to rebuild rather than buy out in these two promising markets, but it can move elsewhere. There are opportunities in the U.S., Colombia, Vietnam and Australia, where it has joint ventures. Getting full control would not only stave off the risk of problems from partners, it also would ensure that Danone shareholders get the full advantage of these markets. Danone could afford it, given the proceeds of the Kraft sale. If the partnerships' earnings justify Danone's current 22 multiple of estimated 2007 earnings, it would take about 4 billion euros to buy them all out. \u001d  Then there are acquisitions. With a successful brand and image to support it, Danone has plenty of options. Dutch baby-food maker Royal Numico, with a market capitalization of 7.6 billion euros, has been called a natural extension to the group's franchises. Wimm-Bill-Dann, a $3.4 billion juice and dairy group with a leading position in Russia, also would fit. Danone already owns an 18% stake. \u001d  Sure, the money from Kraft won't stretch far enough for Danone to reconfigure its portfolio entirely, but Danone was sitting on an unleveraged balance sheet even without selling its biscuits. It could gear up by a further 10 billion euros and still have debt at a fairly conservative 25% of enterprise value. Add that to the 5.3 billion euros from Kraft and that leaves the French with more than 15 billion euros. For a 32 billion euros company, that's a lot of money to play with. \u001d  If Danone boss Franck Riboud spends wisely, investors will become even more enthusiastic about Danone's prospects. That might be more credible than any arbitrary government protections. \b \u001d  SAP/Oracle \b \u001d  SAP AG has suffered an embarrassing setback in its competition against Oracle Corp. The German software company was forced to acknowledge that its U.S. subsidiary, TomorrowNow, downloaded documents and software patches from Oracle without permission. SAP will pay thrice for this transgression. \u001d  The likely direct effect is small. SAP probably will pay a fine or settlement to end Oracle's lawsuit. The figure is unlikely to exceed $100 million, according to Citigroup Inc. research. If so, it would be a slap on the wrist, considering Oracle's market capitalization is more than $60 billion. \u001d  The indirect effects will hurt more. Oracle and its boss, Larry Ellison, always have had a swashbuckling image. SAP, by contrast, has been perceived as solidly earnest, if a bit plodding. Its admission of wrongdoing tarnishes that reputation, and the longer the suit drags on, the more damage potentially done. \u001d  SAP's confession also hurts its TomorrowNow unit, which services Oracle software on the cheap. While the unit booked only $16 million of revenue last year, it was potentially a big threat to Mr. Ellison's company. That's because Oracle gets more revenue from maintaining its applications than from selling new ones. It and similar groups increasingly act like razor companies, peddling discounted handles in the hope of selling lots of recurring, high-margin blades. So a discount competitor could cut into Oracle's margins. \u001d  SAP says it is beefing up TomorrowNow, but clients undoubtedly will wonder about the quality of the unit's service if it needed to resort to pilfering Oracle's proprietary materials. The odds that SAP can wound Oracle's cash cow now look smaller, and that's by far the biggest damage caused by the scandal. \b \u001d  New Look \b \u001d  New Look Group PLC was for a while the poster child of U.K. leveraged buyouts. In recent days, though, it seems to have lost some of its looks. Owners Apax Partners and Permira have failed to get their GBP 1.8 billion ($3.6 billion) reserve price in an auction of the U.K. retailer, which they bought in 2004 for GBP 700 million. The bidders were reluctant to pay more than GBP 1.7 billion, according to people familiar with the situation, and the auction was disbanded. \u001d  It's hard to see why the buyout groups wouldn't just take the cash. A price of GBP 1.8 billion would put New Look on roughly the same multiple, based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as U.K. high-street stalwart Marks & Spencer. New Look has been growing at breakneck speed, but the durability of that growth is unproven. Cheap fashion is a volatile business. That makes GBP 1.7 billion look hardly stingy. \u001d  Second, New Look's appeal has been diminished by the clumsiness of the auction process. An asking price of GBP 2 billion was bandied about in the press, then talked down. Rumored buyers never materialized. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. even went to the unusual length of denying on the record that it was acting as a principal in a bid. Future bidders can use these stumbles as negotiating tools. \u001d  Apax and Permira probably will refinance New Look and try to sell it, but even if they juice up the debt to seven times New Look's Ebitda for last year and sell for GBP 1.8 billion in a year's time, the net present value of their takings would be GBP 630 million -- only GBP 30 million more than they could have gotten this time round. \u001d  -- Una Galani, Robert Cyran and John Foley \u001d  --- \u001d  For more commentary, go to www.breakingviews.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 00:30 ET (04:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"29078d9dc4da8fc8adab120596787188","symR":["AGF.B.T","CA0010921058"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": AGF Continues Record Setting Pace For Mutual Fund Sales In June>AGF.B.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T17:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AGF.B.T","CA0010921058"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  TORONTO, July 4 /CNW/ - AGF Management Limited (AGF) again broke a record for sales reporting gross sales of long-term funds of $492.9 million for the month of June 2007.

It's hard to see good fundamental reasons for valuations to go much higher when the sector is already benefiting from unusually favorable conditions. \u001d  So private-equity buzz may not be enough to sustain the share-price gains triggered by the Blackstone bid. Intercontinental Hotels shares were up over 5% and Accor's were up 7% Wednesday. \u001d  But both companies have seen strong-price gains in the past year, with Accor up 48% and Intercontinental up 35%. \u001d  That's left the two companies' stock trading at around a median multiple for the sector of 21X estimated 2008 earnings. That's hardly a bargain-basement valuation - but then consider Blackstone's offer that values Hilton at around 31X estimated 2008 earnings. \u001d  Of course, Blackstone isn't the only private-equity firm to have seen the sector's potential. Colony Capital is a key shareholder in Accor where it forced a management shakeup last year and a shift in the company's strategy. \u001d  And you can see why there is so much interest. The hotel sector is enjoying a spectacular boom. \u001d  Buoyant real-estate markets worldwide are inflating hotel property values - up 9.4% in Europe in 2006 - pushing up average hotel-room values. \u001d  London tops the list in Europe with an average room value of EUR677,000, while the European average has hit a 14-year high at EUR252,000. \u001d  But the trade is doing well too. \u001d  Take Accor whose 2007 first quarter results, traditionally the weakest quarter in the hotel industry, showed like for like revenues from hotels up 7.2%, the strongest growth in the past ten years. \u001d  The upscale segment of its European hotel operation generated a revenue per available room up 13%, building on an already strong 2006 performance. \u001d  At Intercontinental, 2006 revenue per available room rose 9.8% even as it expanded aggressively, predicting it'll exceed its target of opening 60,000 new rooms by the end of 2008. \u001d  But therein lies the risk of future overcapacity and a squeeze on profits that the companies' frothy stock-market ratings don't seem to be discounting, particularly as monetary policy tightens globally, as well as the possibility of economic shocks that might hit the sector. \u001d  Investors have already discounted improved returns as the hotel groups dispose of their property portfolios to focus on being asset-light service companies. Cash from the sales can be used for acquisitions or returned to investors. \u001d  Now, Blackstone's bid for Hilton was at a 40% premium to the previous day's closing price, an impressive sign of the  further value that some investors are expecting from these companies. \u001d  But this may prove to be as good as it gets. \b \u001d  (Sean Walters, the newest member of Dow Jones Newswires' Skeptic team, has previously consulted on such areas as operational strategy, marketing and finance.

Occidental Petroleum is seeking international arbitration over the decision. \u001d  The panel report makes similar charges against Petrobras, among them, it sold 40% of its stake in Ecuador's block 18 and Palu Azul oil fields to Japanese oil firm Teikoku Oil, without the proper authorization. \u001d  In January 2005, Petrobras signed a preliminary contract over the sale and  cooperation with the Japanese firm, and a separate 40% stake in private heavy oil pipeline OCP. \u001d  Petrobras later communicated its intention to sell the stakes to the stock market regulator of the Buenos Aires stock exchange, although approval by Ecuadorean government was still pending. \u001d  In Ecuador, Petrobras is part of the company's Argentine subsidiary Petrobras Energia (PESA.BA), which is listed on the Buenos Aires stock exchange. \u001d  Unions for Ecuador's state-owned oil firm Petroecuador and left-wing social groups have repeatedly demanded the government expel Petrobras from Ecuador. \u001d  Having read the report as well before stepping down from his post on June 13, Ecuador's former Energy Minister Alberto Acosta wrote a letter to President Rafael Correa, recommending considering possible sanctions and possibly ending Petrobras' operations contract. \b \u001d  -By Mercedes Alvaro, Dow Jones Newswires; 5939-9728-653; mercedes.alvaro@dowjones.com \u001d  (Bernd Radowitz in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this report.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 13:59 ET (17:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2eff40ae3b283d8ceaa6bf00c1277755","symR":["BHP","BHP.AU","CMS","ENDESA.SN","EOC","AU000000BHP4","CLP3710M1090"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"BHP Extends Chile GasAtacama Pipeline Bailout -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T17:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BHP","BHP.AU","CMS","ENDESA.SN","EOC","AU000000BHP4","CLP3710M1090"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","MNG","XATI","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XORD","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SANTIAGO (Dow Jones)--Diversified natural resources giant BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) extended its partial bailout of Chilean power generator and natural gas pipeline operator GasAtacama beyond September, Diario Financiero newspaper reported Wednesday. \u001d  The bailout is part of an agreement by which investment fund Southern Cross will buy the 50% stake CMS Energy Corp.(CMS) put on the auction block, Diego Hernandez, head of BHP Billiton's Base Metals Division, told the newspaper. \u001d  \"Yes, that's it; paying for our contracts and helping out in an important fashion so that the company doesn't suffer losses with its regulated clients,\" Hernandez said, the newspaper reported. \u001d  In early June, BHP Billiton and state mining giant Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile, or Codelco, bailed out GasAtacama with some $20 million, which helped the pipeline cover its losses on lower power rates with regulated clients. \u001d  Hernandez declined to detail how much it had paid GasAtacama in the second bailout, but he said he hopes other mining clients will also contribute to cover GasAtacama's financial woes. \u001d  GasAtacama, a joint venture between U.S.-based CMS Energy Corp. (CMS) and Chilean power Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (EOC), or Endesa, is going through a financial crisis as a result of Argentina's decision to reduce its natural gas exports. \u001d  Earlier this year, CMS opted to to sell its 50% stake in GasAtacama to Ashmore Energy International for a total of $80 million. Endesa, however, had a preferential option for the stake and last weekend announced it decided to transfer that option to investment fund Southern Cross. \u001d  Nevertheless, Southern Cross conditioned its GasAtacama acquisition to mining companies covering the losses from regulated, or residential, clients, Endesa said over the weekend in a filing with the local securities overseer. \u001d  While the company renegotiated terms with most of its unregulated clients, namely the large copper mining companies in northern Chile, it hasn't been able to pass its higher costs onto its regulated, residential clients, which represent 45% of its income. Currently, the company is waiting to solve a dispute with a power distributor before modifying its residential rates. \u001d  There is practically no hydroelectric generation on the SING grid, and the system relies on coal and natural gas-fired generators. \u001d  Since 2004, Argentina has reduced its natural gas exports to Chile to ensure it can meet domestic demand. \u001d  Although Argentina has plentiful supplies of gas, caps on prices have dissuaded companies from ramping up production. Over the past weeks, Argentina has deepened the cuts, forcing Chilean generators and industries to operate solely on diesel. \u001d  Analysts expect generators and industries to continue paying higher fuel costs at least until 2009, when two government-backed liquified natural gas re-gasification plants come on line in northern and central Chile. \b \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.diariofinanciero.cl \b \u001d  -By Patricia San Juan, Dow Jones Newswires 56-2-460-8546 patty.sanjuan@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 13:10 ET (17:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3083d529e05c15f925d65f0ab5b28481","symR":["OPC.T","CA68383K1093"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": OPTI Canada To Host 2Q 2007 Conference Call On July 13, 2007>OPC.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T11:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OPC.T","CA68383K1093"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  CALGARY, July 4 /CNW/ - OPTI Canada Inc.

The first phase of the Project consists of 72,000 barrels per day of SAGD (steam assisted gravity drainage) oil production integrated with an OPTI-operated upgrading facility, using OPTI's proprietary OrCrude(TM) process and commercially available hydrocracking and gasification. Through gasification, this configuration substantially reduces the exposure to and the need to purchase natural gas. The Project is expected to produce 58,500 bbl/d of products, primarily 39 degree API Premium Sweet Crude with low sulphur content, making it a highly desirable refinery feedstock. OPTI's common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol OPC. \b \bAdditional information regarding the Long Lake Project is available at http://www.longlake.ca. \b \bForward-Looking Statements \b \bCertain statements contained herein are forward-looking statements, including statements relating to: OPTI's operations; anticipated financial performance; business prospects, expansion plans and strategies; OPTI's plans and expectations concerning the use and performance of the OrCrude(TM) process and other related technologies; the cost, development and operation of the Long Lake Project and OPTI's relationship with Nexen Inc.

He declined to comment further. \u001d  The announcement was expected among some industry observers and gaming analysts following growing uncertainty about the online gambling industry in Europe and Bwin's falling share price in recent months, Daniel Stewart & Co. analyst James Hollins said. \u001d  Some investors thought that Bwin's falling share price might have affected any deal involving Bwin securities, he noted. \u001d  There has been good institutional support for Sportingbet based on fundamentals of late, with the group doing well operationally, said Hollins, who is reinstating Sportingbet with a buy rating and 62 pence target price. \u001d  Daniel Stewart & Co. are house brokers to Sportingbet. \u001d  At 1115 GMT, Sportingbet shares were down 5 pence, or 8.9%, to 54 pence, valuing the group at GBP231.6 million, in a slightly higher London market. Bwin shares were steady at EUR24.13 in a flat Vienna market. \u001d  Last month, Sportingbet posted a sharp rise in third-quarter group operating profit, and said it remained confident for the remainder of the financial year. \u001d  Stripping out exceptional charges, goodwill amortization and share option charges, group operating profit rose more than threefold to GBP3.0 million in the third quarter ended April 30 from GBP0.8 million in the same period a year earlier. The third-quarter result was underpinned by a strong performance in Sportingbet's core sports betting operations. \u001d  Group operating profit before exceptional items is the key figure U.K. investors and analyst track when assessing the group's operating performance. \u001d  Turnover from continuing operations rose to GBP291.1 million in the third-quarter from GBP229.4 million a year ago. \u001d  In order to aid comparison, the financial and operational information for the prior period is stated excluding the U.S. business, which was sold in October 2006, resulting in Sportingbet's exit from the market. \u001d   On March 7, Sportingbet confirmed it was in talks with Austria-based Bwin about the possible acquisition of Sportingbet in the wake of recent press speculation. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.sportingbet.com \b                     http://www.bwin.com \b \u001d  -By Lilly Vitorovich, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-0-207 842 9290; lilly.vitorovich@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (Flemming Hansen in Vienna contributed to this story.) \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 07:20 ET (11:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"36a315071a22752888f0b5db03c626bf","symR":["GNAN3B.SM","IBE.MC","BRGNANACNOR8","ES0144580018"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Brazil Utility Itapebi Issues BRL175M In Debentures","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T11:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GNAN3B.SM","IBE.MC","BRGNANACNOR8","ES0144580018"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XES","XIBEX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SAO PAULO (Dow Jones)--Brazilian hydroelectric power company Itapebi Geracao de Energia SA completed its non-convertible debenture issue worth 175 million Brazilian reals ($91 million), the company said Wednesday in a statement. \u001d  The issue was part of a two-year program totaling BRL250 million. \u001d  Banco Votorantim was the lead coordinator of the operation, which was rated at brAA- by Standard & Poor's. \u001d  The debentures were issued in two series. \u001d  The first series, totaling BRL87.5 million, will mature June 1, 2012, and the company will pay an annual interest rate of 9.5 percentage points over Brazil's General Price Index, known as the IGP-M. \u001d  The second series, also worth BRL87.5 million, will mature Dec. 1, 2012.

In the future, both companies will jointly develop new products based on Chery small-car platforms. \u001d  \"This is the start of a very long relationship between Chrysler and Chery,\" Chrysler Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said at a press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. \u001d  \"As part of the Chrysler Group's global transformation, we're finding new ways to bring vehicles to market faster, more efficiently, with less costs, and with the same high-quality standards,\" LaSorda said. \u001d  The first car to be produced under the deal will carry Chrysler's Dodge brand and will be available within 12 months, though initially only in markets such as South America and Eastern Europe, Chrysler executives said at a press briefing on Wednesday. \u001d  LaSorda told reporters on the sidelines of the briefing that he expects cars made under the deal to be sold in the U.S. by \"mid-to-late 2009.\" \u001d  Total production under the deal will reach 50,000 to 100,000 or more cars a year, and could be in the hundreds of thousands, LaSorda said. \u001d  Chrysler sold 2.14 million vehicles in 2006, down about 7% from a year earlier. \u001d  Chery, which specializes in small cars, sold about 300,000 cars last year and says it expects to sell 393,000 cars in 2007. It already exports cars to many developing countries, and has long sought to enter the U.S. market. \u001d  The agreement between Chrysler and Chery has been controversial, as labor leaders argue that the deal will turn Chrysler into a \"door opener\" for China's auto industry as it seeks inroads in the U.S. and Europe. \u001d  General Motors Corp. sued Chery in 2004, saying that a Chery subcompact known as the QQ was a copy of the Chevrolet Spark. The two companies settled the suit in 2005, without disclosing the terms. \u001d  LaSorda told reporters that there won't initially be any technology transfers to Chery as cars will be built on Chery's current platforms. \u001d  \"But when we go to work on joint projects, we'll certainly help them with any issues related to technology or product readiness,\" LaSorda added. \u001d  Asked about recent controversy over the safety of Chinese exports, LaSorda said he has \"no concerns at all\" about Chery. \u001d  Chrysler will work with Chery to ensure cars meet safety and other quality standards, he said. \u001d  \"I've been through their facilities,\" LaSorda said, \"and I don't see any issues with safety or quality.\" \b \u001d  -By Aaron Back, Dow Jones Newswires; (8610) 6588-5848; aaron.back@dowjones.com \u001d  (Jason Leow of The Wall Street Journal Asia contributed to this story.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 03:01 ET (07:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"385dd18821c9bad5f857ea8bb9d33a57","symR":["ITV.LN","GB0033986497"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Credit Suisse Keeps ITV At Underperform","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T11:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ITV.LN","GB0033986497"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\u001d  1120 GMT [Dow Jones] Credit Suisse cuts ITV (ITV.LN) FY '07 EPS by 7% to reflect additional loss from ITV's cinema advertising unit Carlton Screen Advertising and a drop in revenues to ITV Play.

(WSH), raised the specter of a faster-than-expected softening of reinsurance prices and, consequently, renewed pressure on company profits. \u001d  Some insurers and reinsurers played down the report, saying the worries about softer pricing had been overplayed, as prices had surged to record levels in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. \u001d  \"Continued capital infusion and diversifying reinsurer appetites...were working to depress reinsurance property pricing and in turn increase competition for other lines of business,\" said Peter Hearn, chief executive of Willis Re. \u001d  Hearn was referring to the fact that many traditional insurance companies - supported by rising interest rates and equity markets - have increased capital to write business, prompting many of them to cut premiums and use less reinsurance cover. \u001d  As a result, reinsurers, which provide backup coverage for insurers and take up the riskiest policies, are likewise competing more aggressively. \u001d  This has led prices to fall by as much as 20% for reinsurance property premiums in the U.S. and pressuring prices in other countries such as Australia. It is also affecting other business lines such as worker compensation or marine reinsurance, Willis Re said. \u001d  The scenario is well-known in the industry and referred to as the reinsurance cycle. \u001d  In the aftermath of a major disaster, premiums rise quickly. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, for instance, premiums for businesses such as boat insurance tripled. \u001d  The price spike, consequently, attracts new players, often Bermuda-based specialty reinsurers, and heats up competition - which again triggers price pressure. \u001d  In the past, the insurance industry was unable to combat the cycle, and the ups and downs of premiums were also reflected in the companies' volatile share prices. \u001d  But increased discipline and more stringent capital management allowed insurers and reinsurers to flatten the curve of the cycle. \u001d  \"In the past, reinsurance and insurance companies were bulking up business for the sake of business, which has led to a volatile cycle,\" said Munich Re (MUV2.XE) spokeswoman Anke Rosumek, who declined to comment on the German reinsurer's performance at the July renewals. \u001d  \"But today, we have risk-adjusted prices, and drop business when it fails to meet our profit benchmark,\" she said, adding that Munich Re's premium income has remained stable over the past few years as the company concentrates on profitable business. \u001d  Other insurance companies agreed. \u001d  \"It's no secret that prices have come under pressure worldwide and particularly in the U.S.,\" said Geoff Riddell, chief executive of Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN.VX) global corporate division. \u001d  \"However, not all insurers will be affected in the same way,\" Riddell said. \"Zurich, with its well-balanced and diversified book of business, both in terms of geography as well as business lines, and its focus on customer relationship and relevance, is well-positioned to dampen this impact.\" \u001d  Still, some analysts expressed caution and warned investors to wait for companies to report on the renewal season. \u001d  \"We believe that some brokers and investors are too positive on the non-life reinsurance underwriting cycle,\" said Rene Locher, analyst at Sal. Oppenheim in Zurich. \"Hence, July 2007 renewals could be a negative surprise to the market.\" \u001d  Companies are expected to report on renewals at the beginning of next month with their second-quarter results. Hannover Re (HNR1.XE) is due Aug. 3, followed by Munich Re on Aug. 6 and Swiss Re on Aug. 7. \u001d  Locher said prices are likely to come under pressure because of last year's relatively mild storm season. Catastrophe losses caused by hurricanes were low compared with 2005, when Hurricane Katrina alone caused claims in the range of $50 billion. \u001d  This year, however, more damaging storms could make landfall in the U.S. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts that 2007 could see three to five major hurricanes. \u001d  State involvement is also expected to increase competitive pressures, Locher said. \u001d  To help curb rises in insurance costs in Florida, lawmakers this year doubled the amount of losses covered by the state-owned Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, effectively depriving private reinsurers of a potential $1.5 billion to $2 billion revenue stream. \u001d  The strong competition could lead to more takeover deals in the sector, experts say. \u001d  \"This aggressive competition will soften the reinsurance market, and merger-and-acquisition activity will likely increase as pricing disciplines collapse,\" Willis Re's Hearn said. \u001d  Merger activity has risen over the past few months following Swiss Re's acquisition of General Electric Co.'s (GE) reinsurance division. Earlier this year, France's Scor SA (SCO) made a successful bid for Swiss peer Converium Holding AG (CHR). \u001d  -By Goran Mijuk, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 80 47; goran.mijuk@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 11:14 ET (15:14 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"38808d77ed2a708e13479715e9fb7075","symR":["532617.BY","AC.A.T","AC.B.T","BBD.A.T","BBD.B.T","BDRBF","CAE.T","CGT","ERJ","RYA.DB","RYAAY","CA0089117034","CA0089118024","CA0977511017","CA0977512007","CA1247651088","IE00B1GKF381","INE802G01018"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"CAE Inc.

(CGT) played in preparing pilots for their jobs was producing the simulators in which they practiced flying specific aircraft models. \u001d  Now, the Montreal-based company has become a global provider of training services for airlines, including, in some cases, sourcing and screening potential pilots. \u001d  A good thing, too. Pilot shortages are looming, especially in India and China - two of the world's fastest-growing air-travel markets. New low-cost carriers are popping up all over the place; legacy carriers are upgrading their fleets; and the big wave of former military pilots that moved into civil aviation after the Vietnam War are retiring. \u001d  The training market is now worth about US$3.5 billion a year, according to Desjardins Securities, about seven times the size of the market for simulation equipment. CAE, which is one of only four non-airline companies providing such services, is reaping the benefits. \u001d  CAE's civil-training unit is now one of its fastest-growing and most-profitable businesses. In fact, the unit provided the largest chunk of the company's operating earnings in the most recent quarter, and its widest profit margins. It \"continues to represent the CAE's operating segment with the best operating leverage,\" according to Paradigm Capital. \u001d  \"I think the strategy to get into the business was absolutely sound,\" says group president Jeff Roberts. Launched in 2000 and bulked up in 2001 with the purchase of Netherlands-based Schreiner Aviation Training, the flight-training business won more than C$450 million in new contracts in 2007, including 50 new business aviation contracts and 20 new commercial and regional aviation contracts with airlines around the world. \u001d  More importantly for a company vulnerable to the boom-and-bust cycle of the aviation industry, it provides regular income even in the downturns. \u001d  \"It's more like an annuity-type business,\" Roberts says. \"Pilots by regulation have to go to training every year. It's a \"very complementary business\" to the sale of flight simulators, he added. \u001d  Not only do pilots have to regularly update their certification, there are several other factors that bode well for the civil-training business. \u001d  Global economic expansion is driving the demand for air travel, with the International Air Transport Association forecasting annual 6% growth in 2008. Demand is expected to be even higher in the Asia-Pacific region, with Boeing estimating that China alone will add 4,000 aircraft and need more than 35,000 new pilots over the next 20 years. \u001d  Meanwhile, airlines as diverse as Air Canada (AC.B.T), Jet Airways of India (532617.BY) and Saudi Arabia's low-cost airline National Air Services, are embarking on major fleet expansions as their networks grow. The mandatory retirement age for pilots remains at 60, fueling regular turnover. And with military strategy now focused on ground wars, fewer military pilots are converting to civilian airlines. \b \b   Greater Demand For Pilots \b \u001d  There are signs of an upcoming pilot shortage: The General Aircraft Manufacturers Association says the number of U.S. pilots dropped below 600,000 for the first time in decades, adding that the number of student pilots is also down. More alarmingly, it also noted the average age for U.S. pilots is 46, an all-time high. \u001d  At the same time, demand for pilots is up. Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick says the airline hired 190 pilots in the first six months of 2007, compared to 300 for all of 2006, 100 for all of 2005, and none at all for the three years following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. \"It's largely due to the new aircraft coming in,\" Fitzpatrick says. Air Canada is replacing its aging Airbus widebody fleet with new Boeing 787 and 777 aircraft. \u001d  According to Dundee Securities, AIR Inc., which tracks pilot hiring trends, reported commercial pilot hiring in the U.S. is up 39% so far this year. \u001d  Business jet sales are also booming, with GAMA noting that shipments reached an all-time high in 2006, with a total of 885 units, up 18% from a year earlier. That's also fueling the demand for pilots, as well as a growing need for private pilot training. \u001d  CAE now has training contracts in place with aircraft makers Bombardier Inc. (BBD.B.T) and Brazil's Embraer S.A. (ERJ). It recently opened a business aviation training center in New Jersey. It has a joint venture with the Airport Authority of India to develop a national flight-training academy; and it has a deal with Ireland's Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) to supply it with up to 1,200 pilots a year. \u001d  It has also created a Global Academy, expected to churn out about 1,000 pilots a year for partner airlines. \u001d  \"What we've done is gone down in the development continuum,\" Roberts says. CAE will screen and help qualify cadets, then develop the curriculum and course content. Once the fledgling pilots emerge from the flight schools, CAE will train them on the specific aircraft models. \u001d  In India, its role is even greater. In partnership with the government, CAE will create and manage a new flight-training institute that will find and train many of the 5,000 pilots that India says it needs every year. \u001d  \"To say that all facets of aviation are robust right now is not an exaggeration, it is a reality,\" Roberts says. \"It's good to be us right now.\" \u001d  Longer-term, however, there may be some challenges. Benoit Poirier of Desjardins Securities notes that the bigger the airline, the less likely it is to outsource its pilot training. Airline consolidation could reduce the training market for providers like CAE, he said. As well, CAE may inadvertently cannibalize its training business with the introduction of its less-expensive 5000 Series flight simulators, which could make in-house training more feasible for smaller airlines. \u001d  Canaccord Adams, as well, has some long-term concerns. Analyst Robert Fay suggests the move towards additional standardization of fleets across a more limited number of aircraft platforms could limit growth of the civil-simulation industry. \u001d  And growing travel demand from areas like India, China and Latin America is based on economic growth and the development of a middle class, which remain vulnerable to a global economic slowdown, analysts say. \u001d  Desjardins makes a market in CAE securities but has no investment-banking relationship with the company. The Dundee analyst owns the stock but there is no investment-banking relationship with the company. Paradigm has no banking conflicts with the company, and it wasn't immediately clear whether Fay holds shares or whether Canaccord Adams has an investment-banking relationship with the company. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.cae.com \b \u001d  -Monica Gutschi, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2017; monica.gutschi@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 13:30 ET (17:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"38831374c90698821a31586e8be64936","symR":["PT","PTC.LB","TEF","TEF.MC","TLPP4.BR","TSP","BRTLPPACNPR5","ES0178430E18","PTPTC0AM0009"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Brazil's Telesp Plans To Launch Pay TV In July - Estado","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T18:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PT","PTC.LB","TEF","TEF.MC","TLPP4.BR","TSP","BRTLPPACNPR5","ES0178430E18","PTPTC0AM0009"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XGTI","XIBEX","XNYA","XP20","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SAO PAULO (Dow Jones)--Brazilian telecommunications company Telecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo (TSP), or Telesp, is planning to announce a new pay TV service in July, Antonio Carlos Valente, the company's chief executive, said Wednesday, according to the local Estado newswire. \u001d  The subsidiary of Spain's Telefonica SA (TEF), which currently offers fixed-line telecom and Internet services in Sao Paulo state, plans to launch a service via satellite. \u001d  \"We are negotiating with the principal content providers and finalizing some technical points; processes that we want to conclude as quickly as possible,\" said Valente at an event in Sao Paulo. \u001d  Last week, Telefonica Director-General Stael Prata said the company had already contracted 50 people for the new service, which will be called Telefonica TV Digital. \u001d  Last year, Telesp announced an accord with AstralSat, a satellite direct-to-home provider, and it also bought a share in TVA, a local cable TV provider.

The company's management believes that by excluding charges such as the purchased intangibles amortization in cost of goods sold, the amortization of purchased intangible assets in operating expenses, stock compensation expense, restructuring charges and write down of strategic investments from its GAAP- based results, these non-GAAP financial measures are more likely to facilitate investors' understanding of the company's ongoing business operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate comparisons to the operating results of the company's competitors and provide investors with greater transparency with respect to the supplemental information used by management in its operational and financial decision making. \b \u001d  The non-GAAP measures are included to provide investors with supplemental information to facilitate their understanding of Entrust's operating results and future prospects. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to assess its success in reducing the company's cost structure, to measure its ongoing cash operating costs, and to establish budgets and operational goals. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial and operating results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as non-GAAP measures are susceptible to varying calculations and they may not be comparable, as presented, to other similarly titled measures of other companies. \b \u001d  This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to Entrust's projected revenue, net income and net loss per share and non-GAAP income per share for the second half of 2007.  Such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are unforeseen operating expenses, unconverted customer opportunities, issues associated with revenue recognition, issues raised in connection with the review of quarterly financial results, and the risk factors detailed from time to time in Entrust's periodic reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation Entrust's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. While Entrust may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, Entrust specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if its estimates change. \b \b    About Entrust \b \u001d  Entrust (NASDAQ: ENTU) secures digital identities and information for governments, enterprises and consumers in 1,650 organizations spanning 60 countries.

About 70% to 80% of the country's oil workers are unionized, FUP said. \u001d  A strike would be \"negative, as it will affect oil production and sales,\" Sao Paulo based Banco Fator said in a release Wednesday. The bank said the strike threat is likely already incorporated in the company's share price. \u001d  Petrobras was up 0.2% to BRL53.81 at 1326 GMT Wednesday in Sao Paulo. \u001d  The oil workers federation demands promotions be based on merit only, and it claims workers in the company have been denied promotions without proper reasons being given. Petrobras' current system of staffing and promotions is creating unjust salary discrepancies, FUP said. \u001d  Petrobras produces more than 95% of Brazil's 1.85 million barrels of crude oil a day. The company has a near monopoly in refining and is the biggest fuel distributor in the country. \b \u001d  -By Bernd Radowitz, Dow Jones Newswires; +5521-2553-7322; bernd.radowitz@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 09:41 ET (13:41 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"404b5745b44bf3ba894e5601e7bc1ab4","symR":["ERIC","ERIC-B.SK","SE0000108656"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: HSBC Upgrades Ericsson Rating and Target Price","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T09:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ERIC","ERIC-B.SK","SE0000108656"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XST5","XSTX","XSXA"],"Story":"\u001d  0905 GMT [Dow Jones] HSBC Upgrades Ericsson from neutral to overweight and raises target price to SEK33 from SEK28.

The outlook for molybdenum continues to be positive, he noted, adding that molydbenum has unique physical properties, including a high melting point, strengthening capacity and corrosion resistance, and a unique market that will continue to support strong prices - as well producers - for \"many years.\" \u001d  The metal plays an imporant role in the steel, nuclear, oil, catalyst and electronic industries, Parkinson added. \u001d  He also said molybdenum consumption has been increasing at 4% annually and supply has been trailing demand since 2001. Limits on Chinese exports will further tighten supply in other parts of the world, he said. \u001d  Thompson Creek, which has operations in Idaho, Pennsylvania and British Columbia, is a pure-play producer with resources of more than 1 billion pounds. The company operates in politically-stable North America and the labor pool is also stable, Parkinson said. Thompson Creek's Langeloth facility recently signed a three-year contract with unionized employees and its other properties aren't unionized. \u001d  In Toronto Wednesday, Thompson Creek is up 1.4% to C$17.65. \u001d  Versant doesn't have an investment-banking relationship with Thompson Creek and Parkinson doesn't own the stock. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.thompsoncreekmetals.cm \b \u001d  -Wendy Tsau; 416-306-2100; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 12:46 ET (16:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"42531a06d41c9d05a18710482d917bcf","symR":["CBRY.LN","CSG","KO","GB0006107006","US1912161007"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Coca-Cola Mulls Buy Of Cadbury-Schweppes' Snapple -Reuters","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T17:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBRY.LN","CSG","KO","GB0006107006","US1912161007"],"IndustryCodes":["BVG","FOD","OFP","SFT","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Coca-Cola Co.

EHRs allow health care professionals access to a complete record of a patient's health history online. Unikoan derives the bulk of its revenue from managing the Child Health Network, a pediatric EHR system that includes 84 hospital sites and 500 physician offices in Ontario. \u001d  Managing EHR and drug information systems (DIS), which track an individual's prescription-drug history, are potential growth areas for Emergis. \"We are witnessing a disruptive change going on in the healthcare industry, with the entire industry struggling to cope with the rising costs of providing quality healthcare in Canada,\" said Genuity Capital's Richard Sung in a note Wednesday. \"One area where the government is looking to help defray these costs is electronic health records, which is seen as a way to make healthcare cheaper and more efficient.\" \u001d  The Canadian government through its crown corporation, Canada Health Infoway, wants 50% of Canadians using EHR systems by 2009, Sung said. Canada Health funds up to 75% of the costs to develop initiatives that meet its criteria and provincial governments typically cover the rest of the costs, as well as maintenance costs, he said. \u001d  Sung, who initiated coverage of Emergis Thursday with a buy rating and C$8.50 target, said Emergis is well-positioned to win DIS contracts because of its broad base of pharmacy-management systems across Canada. Emergis, which provides claims-processing services to health care practitioners, has management systems installed in close to 40% of pharmacies across Canada, he said. In addition, the Quebec City company won a contract to implement a DIS program for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, he said. While the deal is worth just C$30 million over nine years, it's significant because it establishes Emergis as a credible player for DIS opportunities in other provinces, he said. \u001d  In addition to its health care business, Emergis operates a finance division, which among other things, provides tax-filing services and paperless-mortgage transactions. Sung said the division has been a drag on the company's operating margins and diverted focus from the more exciting heathcare business. He said he believes the division could be worth about C$50-C$75 million, or 55-82 Canadian cents a share. That money could be used to finance additional acquisitions on the healthcare side, he said. \"Getting stronger in a smaller number of areas would, in our view, be a very good thing for Emergis,\" he said. \u001d  Paradigm's Leung said he believes the sale of non-core portions of the finance business may be the better choice, as some segments of the finance business, such as the electronic mortgage business, are new and generating good margins. \u001d  Leung and Sung don't own Emergis shares and there are no banking conflicts between Emergis and their firms. \u001d  In Toronto Wednesday, Emergis is up 32 Canadian cents, or 4.9%, to C$6.91 on 92,000 shares. The stock is up 34% in the past 12 months. Its 52-week high is C$7.10. \b   Company Web Site: http://www.emergis.com \b \b   -Stuart Weinberg, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2026; \b   stuart.weinberg@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 15:18 ET (19:18 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4b0c43799917b862a1de68ca5b5bcb6e","symR":["403591.FR","FTE","FR0004035913"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: France Telecom Comments Reassuring On Dividend","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T09:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["403591.FR","FTE","FR0004035913"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","ISV","TLS","XCA4","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\u001d  0915 GMT [Dow Jones] Prudent comments by France Telecom's (FTE) CEO about acquisitions in emerging markets are reassuring for dividend assumptions, Dexia says.

The Company recorded net earnings of $523,493 or $0.13 per share, compared with a net loss of $159,442 or $0.04 per share in the second quarter of the previous year. This major turnaround is attributable above all to the change in fair value of financial instruments (forward exchange contracts) recognized in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. \b \bIn Canada, sales fell 12.5%, from $3.4 million in the second quarter of 2006 to $2.9 million in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. In the United States, sales decreased by 16.7%, from $5.9 million in the second quarter of 2006 to $4.9 million for the quarter ended June 2, 2007. U.S. sales were recognized at an average conversion rate of 1.2614 in the second quarter of 2007, compared with 1.1960 in the second quarter of 2006. \b \bGross profit totalled $2.1 million, compared with $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2006. The gross profit margin rose significantly, from 20.6% in the second quarter of 2006 to 27.0% in the equivalent quarter of the current fiscal year. The substantial increase in gross profit, achieved despite the reduction in business volume, is due primarily to a more favourable exchange rate and an improvement in productivity. \b \bSelling expenses fluctuated very little, whereas administrative expenses decreased from $933,873 in the second quarter of 2006 to $765,363 in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. It should be pointed out that the administrative expenses recorded in the second quarter of the previous fiscal year included certain non-recurring expenses, related mainly to a strategic planning initiative. \b \bIn accordance with the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook, derivative financial instruments are now measured at fair value at the end of each quarter. Due the appreciation of the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar in the second quarter of 2007, the Company's forward exchange contracts increased by $732,898 during the same period. This amount has been deducted from the Company's operating expenses. \b \bOperating Results for the First Six Months \b \bDuring the six-month period ended June 2, 2007, net sales fell to $15.3 million, down 15.5% from $18.1 million in the first half of 2006. In Canada, sales went from $6.1 million in 2006 to $5.5 million for the current fiscal year. In the United States, sales declined from $12.0 million in 2006 to $9.8 million for the current fiscal year, a decrease of 18.2%. U.S. sales were recognized at an average conversion rate of 1.248, versus 1.269 in the first half of 2006. \b \bFor the first half of fiscal 2007 and 2006, gross profit totalled $3.9 million. The gross profit margin rose from 21.4% in the first half of 2006 to 25.2% in the six-month period ended June 2, 2007. The significant increase in the gross profit margin is due primarily to a sustained improvement in productivity, combined with tight control over general manufacturing expenses and raw material costs. \b \bSelling expenses fluctuated very little, while administrative expenses decreased by 14.1%, from $1.7 million in the first half of last year to $1.5 million in the first six months of the current fiscal year. \b \bAll in all, Amisco recorded net earnings of $430,069 or $0.1056 per share in the first half of the current fiscal year, compared with a net loss of $56,375 or $0.0138 per share in the first half of fiscal 2006. \b \bAmisco Industries Ltd. is a North American leader in the design and manufacture of composite painted tubular and steel sheet residential furniture. Founded in 1954, the Company manufactures beds, tables, chairs and stools.

United Capital said it has also stopped trading in the synthetic structured finance markets completely because they are \"highly volatile.\" \u001d  The Horizon funds had $145 million in cash as of July 3 and United Capital is working to satisfy redemption requests quickly, while keeping an eye on market risks. Trading losses and market re-pricing will leave the funds down in June and for the year, United Capital added. \u001d  United Capital is the latest credit market player to be hit by turmoil in the market for subprime mortgages, which caters to poorer home buyers with blemished credit records. Two Bear Stearns (BSC) hedge funds are struggling with subprime losses and others run by UBS AG (UBS) and Cambridge Place Investment Management are shutting down. \u001d  Rising delinquencies and flat home prices have hit the value of some asset-backed securities that contain subprime home loans. Experts say it's too early to know how badly mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations will be hit by subprime losses, but it's spooked enough investors to widen the spread between interest rates on some of these securities and less risky debt. \u001d  Such negative sentiment has increased other risks that are harder to gauge objectively, such as liquidity risk, redemption risk and \"the pricing risk resulting in margin calls issued to the entire structured-finance sector,\" United Capital said on Tuesday. \u001d  United Capital is an important participant in the market for asset-backed securities because the firm often buys distressed securities that others are trying to unload - providing needed liquidity in an often illiquid market. \u001d  But the firm's Horizon funds lost money recently when they closed down positions tied to ABX indexes, which track subprime mortgages, the firm explained. \u001d  \"Horizon has taken the step to suspend redemption requests in order to protect the interests of our investors while we continue to analyze the risks highlighted above,\" the firm said in a statement that was emailed to MarketWatch. \u001d  \"The majority of our selling was completed in June and we emphasize that we are not currently in a liquidation mode,\" the firm added. \"We have spoken to our lenders and they are supporting our efforts.\" \u001d  -Alistair Barr;

This is the biggest fine against a telecommunications company ever imposed by the Commission. \u001d  The Brussels antitrust watchdog found the wholesale cost of accessing Telefonica's broadband network was so close to prices charged to consumers that rivals were unable to earn a sufficient margin, shutting them out of the market. The commission also argued the rollout of competitors broadband networks has been slower in Spain than in other European countries due to Telefonica's practices. \u001d  Telefonica balked at what it said were conflicting criteria between the EU regulator and the Spanish telecom regulator, the CMT. \u001d  \"The CMT hasn't ruled against us for these reasons, and it seems strange that after years of accepting our prices and practices, now a different regulator is saying there was wrongdoing,\" a company spokesman said. \u001d  At 0956 GMT, Telefonica shares were 0.5% higher at EUR16.52 in an overall positive Madrid market. \u001d  \"Telefonica has a market capitalization of EUR79 billion and the impact of this fine is minimal, what could be more significant is if Telefonica is now facing a more restrictive regulatory scrutiny from Brussels,\" UBS analyst Bosco Ojeda said. UBS rates Telefonica at neutral with a EUR17.70 price target. \u001d  The hefty fine also signals a departure from the EU's former soft-glove approach to regulating European telecommunications companies. In 2003, two other telecommunications incumbents, France Telecom (FTE) and Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) were fined EUR10.4 million and EUR12.6 million respectively for similar infractions. But since Neelie Kroes took the helm as EU Competition Commissioner in 2004, the EU has tightened its grip on antitrust infractions, and hiked its fines. \u001d  \"Brussels is trying to make an example out of the  Telefonica case and send a message to the European national regulators,\" Juan Tuesta from local brokerage Banesto said. \"It's clear the EU is trying to wrestle control from domestic regulators, what remains to be seen is how far they are going to go,\" Tuesta added. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.telefonica.com \b \u001d  -By Jason Sinclair, Dow Jones Newswires, 34 913958127, jason.sinclair@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 06:10 ET (10:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"528da02d62f4700f75213360bb14fff6","symR":["GLBXF","GMX.T","CA3799001035"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Globex Mining: Comprehensive Program Underway At Getty Lead-Zinc Deposit>GMX.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T10:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GLBXF","GMX.T","CA3799001035"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG"],"Story":"\b   ROUYN-NORANDA, QUEBEC--(CCNMatthews - July 4, 2007) - GLOBEX MINING ENTERPRISES INC.

 0649 GMT [Dow Jones]--The European hotel sector is seen getting a fillip Wednesday after Hilton Hotels (HLT) agrees to be acquired by Blackstone for $18.5b in cash plus the assumption of $7.5b in debt. \"It is the biggest ever hotel deal, and will make Hilton the 8th US public hotel company to go private this year,\" says an analyst. He reckons investor focus will naturally switch to Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) which still owns GBP1B in property assets, has a relatively unleveraged balance sheet, a valuable pipeline of 170K unopened rooms, and strong positions in emerging markets such as China. \"IHG shares have been weak in recent weeks with the rest of the sector. We see M&A as a free option at the current share price,\" he adds. Says Accor (12040.FR) is less likely to be swallowed up than Intercontinental. IHG shares closed Tuesday at 1258p, Accor at EUR64.90.

(KAT.T) to C$22.50 from C$20 \"to reflect the quality of [Katanga's] Kamoto assets and in anticipation of metal production this fall.\" \u001d  Katanga is trading up 1.8% at C$19.69 in Toronto. \u001d  In a research report Wednesday, analyst David Charles said the company is still on-budget and on-target to ship its finished copper production from the Kamoto redevelopment project in December of this year. \u001d  Charles said that if Katanga were to become the subject of a takeover bid like the recent bid by Teck Cominco Ltd. (TCK) for Aur Resources Inc. (AUR.T), he believes the multiple offered would be higher than 1.1 times net asset value, despite the higher political risk associated with the Democratic Republic of Congo. He raised his target multiple to 1.2 times the net asset value from 1.1 times NAV to better reflect the multiple being offered (1.75 times NAV) by Teck for Aur. \u001d  As reported Tuesday, Teck offered C$4.1 billion in cash and stock for Aur to enhance its copper production and reserves. \u001d  Charles noted that Katanga plans a special meeting of shareholders on July 17, at which management will seek to increase the company's authorized share capital. He expects that any future share issuance could result in the dilution of Central Africa Mining & Exploration Co.'s 22% interest in Katanga. He added that the recent increase in RP Explorer Master Fund's stake in Katanga will act as a counter-balance to CAMEC's stake. RP Explorer recently acquired 4,675,000 shares of Katanga, raising its stake to 15.7% from 9.8%. \u001d  Charles, who doesn't own shares of the London mining company, maintained his rating on Katanga at buy. \u001d  GMP has an investment-banking relationship with Katanga. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.katangamining.com \b \u001d  -Tara Zachariah, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2100 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 12:07 ET (16:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5517751c13d7f3908220411627e9a259","symR":["RYA.DB","RYAAY","IE00B1GKF381"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Ryanair June Load Factor 85% Vs 87%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T09:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RYA.DB","RYAAY","IE00B1GKF381"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5576eb08b23bc1b6ea18801d8303d8a7","symR":["DCX","DCX.XE","DE0007100000"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"DaimlerChrysler Canada June Total Vehicle Sales Up 24.1%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T18:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DCX","DCX.XE","DE0007100000"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI","XES","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 14:31 ET (18:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"557938955408db16d399d5ce3b372a22","symR":["AUR.T","CA0515241069"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Aur Resources Tgt Upped To C$41 From C$27 At RBC >AUR.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T12:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AUR.T","CA0515241069"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 08:04 ET (12:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"55839b2275b1ffe629da63ed3277ddcf","symR":["PFE","US7170811035"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Pfizer Asks Nigerian Court To Dismiss State-level Case","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T12:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PFE","US7170811035"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  KANO, Nigeria (AP)--Pfizer Inc. (PFE) asked a court Wednesday to dismiss a state-level civil case seeking $2 billion in damages over allegations that the company conducted a drug experiment that led to deaths and disabilities among children more than a decade ago. \u001d  Pfizer, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, has denied those charges, which are at the heart of a separate case filed by the federal government seeking $7 billion. \u001d   Wednesday, in the northern city of Kano, the company argued that the state-level court lacked jurisdiction over the case, and that Pfizer had been served papers incorrectly. The judge's ruling was scheduled for July 30. \u001d  A separate criminal case seeking to hold several Pfizer officers personally responsible is scheduled to have its next hearing on July 9 in Kano. \u001d  New York-based Pfizer has denied any wrongdoing. A federal court in New York City dismissed a 2001 lawsuit by disabled Nigerians who allegedly took part in the study; that case is under appeal. \u001d  All the cases stem from the same mid-1990s drug study. Nigerian authorities allege that Pfizer illegally conducted a drug experiment on 200 children during a 1996 meningitis epidemic in Kano state's main city, also called Kano, resulting in deaths, brain damage, paralysis and slurred speech in many of the children. \u001d  Pfizer treated 100 meningitis-infected children with an experimental antibiotic, Trovan. Another 100 children, who were control patients in the study, received an approved antibiotic, ceftriaxone - but the dose was lower than recommended, the families' lawyers alleged. \u001d  Up to 11 children in the study died, while others suffered physical disabilities and brain damage. Pfizer always insisted its records show none of the deaths was linked to Trovan or substandard treatment. \u001d  In the Abuja civil case, the government is asking for $500 million for treatment, compensation and support for the victims of the drug test and their families. Another $450 million is earmarked for damages related to money spent to overcome concerns among Nigerians because of the test, and $1 billion is sought to pay for health programs.

(CCJ) and Areva (427583.FR) were just two of the few high-profile companies dealing in yellow cake at the start of the decade. That's now changed, with hundreds of companies poking and proding various basins around the world. \u001d  Enter Northwestern Mineral Ventures Inc. (NWT.V), a TSX Venture-listed company primarily active in Niger and Quebec - two of the world's key uranium-rich distinations. \u001d  \"We've specialized in acquiring large land positions in districts known for uranium deposits; we're not interested in small land packages around the world and that's why we've focused on Niger and Quebec,\" said Marek Kreczmer, Northwestern's president and chief executive. \u001d  This has created a perfect storm, of sorts. In June, Northwestern signed a 50/50 joint-venture agreement with another uranium play, Uramin Inc. (UMN.LN), forming a new company that will soon be listed on the London Stock Exchange Group PLC's (LSE.LN) Alternative Investment Market. \u001d  The deal - and the business - is all about eight highly prospective claims in Niger, a country that started giving out new uranium licences in early 2006 - Northwestern was one of the first. \u001d  \"At the time, we were looking for a partner - it was a strategy to minimize geological and political risk and to find (a company) well positioned to operate in Africa,\" Kreczmer said. \u001d  That strategy has paid off - for a number of reasons. The Uramin deal came just before another deal: Areva's US$2.5 billion deal to buy Uramin. That didn't alter Northwestern's Uramin agreement, which put US$4 million into its coffers plus a 38.5% interest in what will be a listed U.K. company. \u001d  \"It's going to be a pure Niger uranium play - that's unique and it's one which is well-funded,\" Kreczmer said. \u001d  Areva's arrival also means serious access to additional historical data as well as a potential entry into other parts of Africa, he said. It doesn't hurt that Areva already has two uranuim-producing mines in Niger. \u001d  Kreczmer said Northwestern has board control of the new company - yet to be named - during the current exploration phase. \"But once we hit the pre-feasibility phase, Uramin will take over operations,\" he said. \"We are explorers and have no ambitions of being builders.\" \u001d  Ultimately, Northwestern should end up with about 35 million shares in the new joint-venture company. If the stock does well in the market, it will only help fuel the company's other core play in Canada. \u001d  \"Yes, if it does well, we could be a cash-rich company; we would then make the decision to fund the company's operations and/or pay our existing shareholders,\" he said. \u001d  Coincidentally, Northwestern's Quebec property is adjacent to - you quessed it - an Areva-owned site that's about four or five times the size of Northwestern's own 800-square-kilometer claim, where Kreczmer's team has already identified 20 potential targets for further exploration.

The growth in premium traffic is positive for BA as it makes much of its profits from big-spending first- and business-class passengers. \u001d  The premium growth helped push BA's shares higher, analysts said. At 1452 GMT, the shares were up 20 pence, or 4.9%, at 439 pence in London. \u001d  Andrew Fitchie, an analyst with Collins Stewart, said BA is still benefiting from good premium demand and, while the load factor fell, it remains strong and \"bodes well for pricing.\" Collins Stewart has a buy rating. \u001d  Traffic on North American routes, measured in RPKs, declined 2.8% and by a similar amount on U.K/European routes. \u001d  The London-based carrier said market conditions remain broadly unchanged and that it is too early to assess how the latest security measures at British airports might hit forward bookings. It said weakness in the U.S. dollar to sterling isn't helpful for revenue but is having a positive impact on costs. \u001d  George Stinnes, head of investor relations at BA, said booking levels for the summer period remain good, although the airline continues to lose out to other European airports for long-haul transfer traffic. \u001d  Tighter security restrictions in the U.K. following last summer's security alert have lengthened passenger screening times and prompted many fliers to fly direct to other European airports and bypass Heathrow. Around a third of BA's long-haul business at the London airport is transfer traffic although this has fallen of late, Stinnes said. \u001d  Dublin-based Ryanair, the fast expanding Irish budget airline, meanwhile reported an 18% rise in seats sold to 4.35 million. The company is taking delivery of a net 30 new planes this year and has indicated it may have to discount fares this summer to fill its planes amid tough competition. \u001d  NCB Stockbrokers said the yield - or pricing - environment remains challenging for Ryanair, primarily due to softness in the U.K. market. It has a buy rating. \u001d  Ryanair's shares were up EUR0.05, or 0.9%, at EUR5.14. \b   Company Web sites: http://www.ba.com \b                      http://www.ryanair.com \b \u001d  -By Rod Stone, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 9295; rod.stone@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 11:23 ET (15:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5b2a60f46f104c6596bb3505f47195ae","symR":["RWD.LN","GB0007442014"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Robert Wiseman Trading Robust - Oriel","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T07:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RWD.LN","GB0007442014"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP"],"Story":"\u001d  0738 GMT [Dow Jones] Robert Wiseman's (RWD.LN) update indicates robust trading, says Darren Shirley at Oriel Securities.

Siemens' third-quarter figures are due July 26. The compilation and approval of an IPO prospectus usually takes several weeks. \u001d  Siemens said at the end of January that an IPO will likely involve the placement of 25% to 49% of VDO's share capital. \u001d  If Siemens should decide on an IPO, the company plans to complete the process in the current business year, which means before September 30. Even after an IPO, Siemens plans to retain a majority interest in VDO. \u001d  Siemens has repeatedly said that an IPO is preferred to a sale. Analysts note, however, that Siemens recently seemed increasingly open to a sale. \u001d  Former CEO Klaus Kleinfeld told analysts that the new supervisory board chairman Gerhard Cromme is keeping open all future options \"that generate value\" for VDO. \u001d  Two weeks ago, immediately after Siemens announced its IPO plans for VDO, Continental's Chief Financial Officer Alan Hippe said the company has made an indicative bid for VDO of around EUR10 billion, adding due diligence would be needed for a binding offer. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.siemens.com \b \u001d  -By Alexander Becker, Michael Brendel, Simon Steiner; Dow Jones Newswires; +49 69 29 725 500; alexander.becker@dowjones.com. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 11:19 ET (15:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"65b47b8506c2cb84c831039f856caaa5","symR":["8031.TO","AAL.LN","AAUK","MITSY","XTA.LN","GB0031411001","GB00B1XZS820","JP3893600001"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Chile Collahuasi Ups Offer, Workers Not Satisfied -Union","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T13:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["8031.TO","AAL.LN","AAUK","MITSY","XTA.LN","GB0031411001","GB00B1XZS820","JP3893600001"],"IndustryCodes":["DIB","MNG","SVC","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SANTIAGO (Dow Jones)--Management at Chilean copper mine Dona Ines de Collahuasi has improved its contract offer during mediated negotiations, but workers aren't satisfied with the offer yet, a union leader said Wednesday. \u001d  The company is now offering a 3.5% wage increase, a 4,800,000 Chilean peso ($9,134) copper-price bonus and several other bonuses, but workers are seeking an 8.0% wage hike and a CLP12 million bonus, Collahuasi union president Hernan Farias said in a telephone interview. \u001d  \"It's still well below what we're asking for,\" Farias said, adding that talks are scheduled to continue later Wednesday. \u001d  \"But at the rate we're advancing, this won't be resolved anytime soon,\" he said. \u001d  Last week, workers voted in favor of a strike. The company then sought a five-day government mediated period, pushing back the strike start date to July 9. \u001d  \"This looks like it's going to be resolved through a strike,\" Farias said, explaining that one of the sticking points was the formula to calculate the bonus based on production goals. \u001d  The union will hold a general assembly Saturday, when union leaders plan on informing members of the advances in negotiations and likely hold a vote on the latest offer, according to Farias. \u001d  Collahuasi is a joint venture between Xstrata PLC (XTA.LN) and Anglo American PLC (AAUK), each with a 44% stake.

We view the acquisition as relatively neutral to Rexam's business risk profile. A negative impact on the financial risk profile will be mitigated by Rexam's recently completed subordinated bond issue of EUR750 million, proceeds of about EUR660 million from the disposal of its Glass business, as well as proceeds from a GBP286 million equity issue. Credit measures are, however, expected to remain weak for the ratings over the near term.

The funds required were drawn from the proceeds of the previously announced $34.5 million bought-deal financing which closed on June 13, 2007. The Trust's intention to close these acquisitions was previously announced in conjunction with the disclosure of the financing. It is expected that these companies will add $5.8 million in incremental annualized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (\"EBITDAC\"). This results in an aggregate purchase multiple of enterprise value to EBITDAC of 3.8x. \b \bThe four companies include; \b \b- Anderson Well Servicing (1986) Ltd. (\"Anderson\") - Anderson operates a fleet of eight hot oilers from Grande Prairie, Alberta. The operations of Anderson will be merged with Essential's Cascade Services operation and results in Essential operating a total fleet of 23 hot oilers which are versatile trucks able to provide oil or chemicals at high temperature and pressure as required for maintenance of producing oil and gas wells and facilities. The demand for hot oilers is strong and growing and Essential is now the largest supplier of these services in northern Alberta and northeast British Columbia. \b \b- Blue-Vac Vacuum Truck Service (\"Blue-Vac\") - Blue-Vac operates 13 vacuum trucks and three sour gas scrubber units from Taber in southern Alberta. Blue-Vac will be integrated with Essential's Jacar operations that are also based in Taber and greatly expands the range of complimentary Transport services offered by Essential in this key operational area. \b \b- Canadian Coil Tubing Inc. (\"CCT\") - CCT operates four new coil tubing units from Strathmore, Alberta immediately east of Calgary. CCT will be integrated with Essential's Kodiak Coil Tubing operations and will result in Essential operating a total of 25 coil tubing units across southern Alberta and southwest Saskatchewan. \b \b- Redneck Flushbys Ltd (\"Redneck\") - Redneck operates four flushby's and one swab rig from Forestburg in central Alberta and will be merged with Essential's Cardinal Well Services (\"Cardinal\") operation which increases Essential's fleet of rod rigs and flushby's to 20 and increases the swab rig fleet to eight. Through Cardinal, Essential now operates one of the largest fleets of rod rigs and flushby's in central and southern Alberta. These are small, light and efficient service rigs specifically designed to service pumping oil wells. These rigs are in strong demand across western Canada's conventional oilfields. \b \bThe operations of these four private companies are being absorbed by existing Essential operations and will provide immediate incremental cash flow with no additional corporate personnel or resources required. \"The addition of the assets of these four excellent companies, their strong customer relationships and outstanding personnel will expand and strengthen Essential's operations in key operating areas,\" said James Burns, President and CEO of Essential. Key management personnel from these companies will be joining the Essential team to further strengthen operations. \b \bEssential is currently finalizing one additional previously disclosed acquisition and anticipates closing this transaction in July 2007. Several other potential acquisitions are also being evaluated. \b \bEssential is an energy service trust that provides a range of essential production services to oil and gas producers across western Canada from northeast British Columbia to southwest Saskatchewan including service rigs, coil tubing, rod rigs, swab rigs, vacuum trucks, pressure trucks, tank trucks, hydro-vacs, steaming and hot oiling along with other related services. Essential focuses on post drilling production maintenance and enhancement services to ensure stable cash flows for Essential unitholders. \b \bNon-GAAP Measures: Information set forth in this press release contains references to certain financial measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies or trusts. These financial measures are identified and defined below: \b \bEBITDAC is defined as earnings before, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense. We believe EBITDAC is a useful supplemental earnings measure as it provides an indication of the financial results generated by our principal business activities prior to consideration of how these activities are financed or how the results are taxed in various jurisdictions and before non-cash amortization expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. \b \bForward-Looking Statements: Certain information set forth in this press release, including a discussion of future plans and operations, contains forward looking statements that involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond management's control, including but not limited to, the impact of general economic conditions, industry conditions, fluctuation of commodity prices, fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, environmental risks industry competition, availability of qualified personnel and management, stock market volatility, timely and cost effective access to sufficient capital from internal and external sources.

About BRL1.5 billion of the total represented the stake held by foreign investors. \u001d  \"The outflow in June did not represent a lack of interest in Brazil by foreign investors,\" said Alvaro Bandeira, director of Rio de Janeiro-based brokerage Agora Senior. \"Along with the Arcelor movement, foreign investors also placed a portion of their money into local initial public share offerings by local companies.\" \u001d  Bovespa does not count foreign investments from new share offerings. In June, local companies raised a total of BRL6.9 billion through primary and secondary offers, according to the Brazilian Securities Commission, or CVM. \u001d  Foreign investors acquired more than 70% of local share offerings, according to banks involved in the IPOs. In the first half, foreign investment showed a net outflow of BRL136.6 million. For the full year 2006, Bovespa had a net inflow by foreign investors of BRL1.75 billion. \u001d  Foreign investors represented 35.6% of all transactions on the Bovespa during June, compared with 34.1% in April. In the first six months of 2007, foreign investors accounted for 34.5% of Bovespa transactions. In addition, Bovespa handled record trading volume in June. Total trading volume reached BRL105.2 billion, up from BRL87.3 billion in May. \u001d  The average daily volume in June was BRL5.26 billion, up from BRL3.9 billion seen in May. The benchmark Ibovespa index was up 4% in June at 54,392 points. \u001d  On Tuesday, Bovespa reported that the total market value of the 370 companies listed on the local exchange reached BRL2 trillion for the first time ever. In May the market value of listed companies was BRL1.9 trillion. \u001d  Brazil's largest company by market value is state-owned oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR), or Petrobras, which is worth BRL255 billion.

China's financial sector is still largely dominated by banks, which are seeking international partners to improve their risk management and product lines. \u001d  International Finance Corp., the World Bank's private investment arm, may also take a 5% stake in the Chinese bank, but that investment hasn't been finalized, one person close to the deal said. \u001d  Qingdao City Commercial Bank, founded in 1996, is 52%-owned by affiliates of Chinese white goods manufacturer Haier Group. The bank has 39 outlets and over 800 employees in the coastal city best known for the beer brand Tsingtao Beer. Tsingtao is an alternative spelling of the city's name. \u001d  Total foreign investment in a Chinese domestic bank is capped at 25%, with a single foreign investor being allowed no more than 20%. \u001d  A 19.9% stake would be valued around CNY1.04 billion ($137 million), according to a Dow Jones Newswires calculation based on the pricing of a private placement that Qingdao City Commercial Bank is conducting and assuming the Italian bank is a participant in the placement. \u001d  Shenzhen-listed Qingdao Kingking Applied Chemistry Co. (002094.SZ) said in a stock exchange statement dated June 28 that Qingdao City Commercial Bank was placing 900 million new shares to both foreign and local investors at CNY2.60 each and it would buy 20 million of the shares. The statement also said Qingdao City Commercial Bank's share capital before the placement totaled 1.1 billion shares. \u001d  The people familiar with Intesa Sanpaolo's deal, however, declined to discuss pricing or whether it was part of the private placement. \u001d  Intesa Sanpaolo Chief Executive Corrado Passera said in late June that the Italian bank was considering buying a stake in Qingdao City Commercial Bank. \u001d  Milan-based Intesa Sanpaolo's global reach consists of offices in 10 countries worldwide, mainly in central and Eastern Europe. It has recently expanded its operations in Egypt by acquiring a majority stake of Egyptian lender Bank of Alexandria. The bank owns Itay's largest retail network with over 5,500 branches in its home market. \u001d  IFC has previously disclosed it was seeking approval from its board to take a 5% stake in the coastal city lender. \b \u001d  -By Rick Carew, Dow Jones Newswires; 8610 6588-5848; rick.carew@dowjones.com \u001d  (Sabrina Cohen in Milan contributed to this story.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 06:01 ET (10:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"725e070ae5bcd44250c83f06ceefd3eb","symR":["DT","DTE.XE","FTE","JAZ.MC","TEF","TEF.MC","DE0005557508","ES0178430E18","GB0057933615"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"2nd UPDATE: EU Fines Telefonica EUR151.9M For Broadband Abuses","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T12:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DT","DTE.XE","FTE","JAZ.MC","TEF","TEF.MC","DE0005557508","ES0178430E18","GB0057933615"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XCA4","XDAX","XDJGI","XES","XGTI","XIBEX","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Updates an item that ran at 1211 GMT with further details, competitors' comments) \b \u001d  BRUSSELS (Dow Jones)--The European Commission Wednesday fined Spain's Telefonica SA (TEF) EUR151.9 million, saying the telecommunications giant used its grip on the country's telephone network to hamper rival broadband providers. \u001d  Telefonica squeezed its competitors' margins by raising fees for access to its telephone network and lowering its own prices for retail broadband services, the commission said in a statement. \u001d  Telefonica was \"making it virtually impossible for competitors to enter the market,\" the commission's top antitrust official, Neelie Kroes, told a news conference. \u001d  The commission's penalty, its highest ever against a telecommunications company, is part of a broader effort to shake up the sector, which is still dominated by former state-owned monopolies. Over the past year, the regulator has pressed operators to lower mobile phone roaming charges and has pushed for changes in several broadband markets. The commission last week took Germany to court for giving Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) a legal monopoly over the country's broadband network. \u001d  Telefonica's fine shows how the regulator is escalating its crackdown on antitrust abuses by levying heftier fines. In similar cases in 2003, Wanadoo, the Internet arm of France Telecom (FTE), was fined EUR10.4 million and Deutsche Telekom was penalized EUR12.6 million. In a range of recent collusion cases, fines have been several times larger than in comparable cases just a few years ago. \u001d   Kroes said Telefonica's fine was justified because of the seriousness of the abuse and the harm done to consumers. Spanish broadband customers pay 20% more than the average price in the 15 oldest E.U. member countries and Spain's broadband penetration rate is 20% lower than average, according to the commission. \u001d  Telefonica said it will appeal the fine, calling the commission's penalty \"unjustified and disproportionate.\" It added that it has complied with rules established by Spain's telecommunications regulator. \u001d   \"Telefonica finds itself squeezed between two regulators, the national regulator and the European Commission, which are at odds with each other,\" the company said in a statement. \u001d    Telefonica said its share of Spain's broadband market has decreased steadily to its current 55% from 95% in 2001. The company's main competitors for broadband services include Orange, a unit of France Telecom, and Jazztel PLC (JAZ.MC). Orange first complained to the commission about Telefonica's business practices in 2003. \u001d  The commission's fine \"confirms the validity of Orange's (complaint),\" Orange said in a statement. A spokesman for Jazztel declined to comment. \u001d  Being a former state-owned monopoly helped Telefonica rig Spain's broadband market, according to the commission. About 80% of high-speed Internet connections in Spain are made over fixed telephone lines. Telefonica, which was privatized in 1997, is the only Spanish telecommunications company with a nationwide fixed-line network. \u001d  Telefonica's business plan and cost accounts show that the company \"could not have been unaware that it was engaging in a margin squeeze,\" the E.U. regulator said. Between September 2001 and December 2006, the margin between Telefonica's retail prices and the fees it charged for network access was too thin for other providers to cover their costs, the commission added. \u001d  The commission opened a formal investigation into Telefonica's business practices in February 2006. That prompted Spain's telecommunications authority to force the company to lower its wholesale prices in December 2006, ending the company's antitrust abuses, according to the commission. \b \u001d  -By Adam Cohen, Dow Jones Newswires; +322 741 1486; adam.cohen@dowjones.com \u001d  (Peppi Kiviniemi and Jason Sinclair contributed to this article) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 08:26 ET (12:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"735df2033ab65646e9e9b3b0cefcc094","symR":["SRX.T","SRXAF","CA78464P2089"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": SR Telecom Receives C$45M Financing: New Term Loan Supported By Existing Shareholders>SRX.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T10:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SRX.T","SRXAF","CA78464P2089"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT"],"Story":"\b   MONTREAL, QUEBEC--(CCNMatthews - July 3, 2007) - SR Telecom Inc. (TSX:SRX) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with a syndicate of lenders comprised of shareholders and lenders of the Company providing for a term loan of up to $45.0 million, of which $35.0 million was drawn today and an additional $10.0 million will be available for drawdown for a period of up to one year from closing, subject to certain conditions. The term loan has a five-year term and is subject to the same security as the existing loans under the Company's existing credit facility, but ranking senior to the existing loans. The term loan bears cash interest at a rate equal to the greater of 6.5% or the three-month US dollar LIBOR rate plus 3.85% and additional interest that may be paid in cash or in kind, at the option of the Company, at a rate equal to the greater of 7.5% or the three-month US dollar LIBOR rate plus 4.85%. The cash portion of the interest will be payable in kind until December 2008. A payout fee of 5% of the term loan will be paid to lenders upon repayment or maturity of the loan. \b \b\"The level of support we have received today from our shareholders and lenders is a strong indication of their ongoing belief in SR Telecom, its people, its products and its WiMAX strategy,\" said Serge Fortin, SR Telecom's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"While it is clear that much remains to be done for SR Telecom to regain positive and sustainable momentum, these additional funds will enable us to execute on our growth strategy even though the delay in finalizing today's announcement has had a negative impact on manufacturing schedules and deliveries, and will have an unfavourable effect on second and third quarter results.\" \b \bAmendments to terms \b \bIn connection with entering into this new term loan, the syndicate of lenders has agreed to amend some of the terms of the initial advances under the credit facility and the convertible term loan. The maturity date has been amended to match the maturity date of this new financing and the cash portion of the interest will be payable in kind until December 2008. \b \bIn addition, amendments were also made to the terms of the credit facility and the convertible term loan for the portion of the debt held by two of the lenders, who are not Company insiders, whereby their respective portions would be convertible into common shares of the Company at a price of $0.114 per share. As well, the conversion price of the portion of the convertible term loan held by one of the lenders was amended to the same price. \b \bAs some of the parties participating in the financing are related parties of the Company, as defined by applicable securities legislation in Quebec and Ontario, the financing is considered a related-party transaction. However, it is exempt from the valuation and minority approval requirements, as it is a loan to the Company obtained on reasonable commercial terms that are no less advantageous to the Company than if the loan had been obtained from persons that were dealing at arm's length with the Company. \b \bThe Company will file a material change report less than 21 days prior to the closing date of the financing, a shorter period that is reasonable and necessary under the circumstances, which will allow the Company to complete the transaction in a timely manner in order to finance its operations and execute on its growth strategy. \b \bStatus update on results \b \bThe Company intends to update its financial statements and accompanying management's discussion and analysis for the periods ended December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007 in the coming days. \b \bAbout SR Telecom \b \bSR Telecom (TSX:SRX) is a recognized global leader in delivering innovative broadband wireless access (BWA) solutions that enable service providers to efficiently deploy quality voice, Internet and next-generation services in urban, suburban and remote areas.

(ENE) employees who finally received the first payment from a portion of millions in retirement funds lost during the company's collapse have been told they either were overpaid or underpaid because of a computer glitch. \u001d  Now some ex-workers might have to pay back money if they got too much. \u001d  Last year, former Enron workers received about $89 million, the first payment that is part of a lawsuit settlement over money they lost through Enron's employee stock ownership and 401(k) plans. \u001d  But nearly $22 million of the initial payment was miscalculated, said Harlan Loeb, spokesman for Enron, now known as Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. \u001d  About 7,700 ex-workers were overpaid, and about 12,800 were underpaid. But they won't know their fate until the recalculation is finished. \u001d  Enron is blaming the problem on Hewitt Associates Inc.

(7267.TO) expects its domestic auto sales to improve from the fiscal second half when it rolls out the redesigned version of its popular Fit compact model, a Honda executive said Wednesday. \u001d  \"The (domestic) market won't expand for the time being,\" said Manabu Nishimae, Honda's operating officer in charge of domestic operations. \u001d  But \"we expect sales to pick up from the second half, mainly with the (new) Fit that we will introduce in the autumn,\" he told reporters after a press conference about Honda's new automobile communications services. \u001d  Japan's auto makers have been on a roll overseas but are facing tough times at home. Sales of new vehicles excluding mini vehicles of 660cc or less dropped to a 30-year low in the first six months through June, according to the Japan Automobile Dealers Association. \u001d  Honda, which is Japan's second-largest auto maker by sales volume, has seen its domestic sales fall for five straight months since the start of 2007. Its sales over that same period were down 7.6% from a year earlier. \u001d  For the fiscal year ending in March, the car maker aims to narrow the decline in its domestic sales to 1.8%, after a 3.4% fall last year. Honda's domestic sales remain important, accounting for 18% of its overall global sales last fiscal year. \u001d  Honda launched partly redesigned versions of the Fit and Life small-car models, as well as the Step Wagon minivan, by late June, and plans to launch the all-new Fit this autumn in Japan, Nishimae said. \u001d  The Fit was Japan's third best selling model in Japan in 2006 after Toyota Motor Corp.'s Corolla and the Vitz compact, also offered by Toyota. \u001d  As part of efforts to lure domestic customers, Honda Wednesday unveiled new automobile communications services, also called telematics services. \u001d  About 40% of Honda car buyers use its telematics services, and these services have helped retain customers,  Nishimae said. \u001d  The new services include a function that automatically updates, through a wireless communication device, its navigation-information maps with newly opened roads. Until now, users of its telematics services needed to go to a Honda dealership to download such data. \u001d  The auto maker will begin the new map-updating service when it launches the redesigned Fit. \u001d  Honda will also start offering new services that provide telematics users with earthquake and weather information for the areas in which they are driving. \u001d  Toyota began a similar automobile communication service in Japan in May that updates maps used in its telematics service. \b \u001d  -By Yoshio Takahashi, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; yoshio.takahashi@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 03:00 ET (07:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7c338dc3f631e651f815cd3040d2d739","symR":["AST.MI","IT0003261069"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Astaldi Wins EUR616 Mln Contract For New Algerian Rail Line","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T11:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AST.MI","IT0003261069"],"IndustryCodes":["CON","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 07:03 ET (11:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7c3634c7332b9dee90a9f2ceca43fc4b","symR":["TYT.YY"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Toyota And Lexus Sales Sizzle In June","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T19:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TYT.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS"],"Story":"\bTORONTO, July 4 /CNW/ - Toyota Canada Inc.

(BA) aren't the only ones rubbing their hands over the surge in orders for passenger jets. \u001d  The two airplane manufacturers have seen a surge of orders, with a total of 550 worth an estimated $77 billion in firm deals coming at last month's Paris Air Show alone. But tire makers such as Michelin SA (12126.FR) of France, Japan's Bridgestone Corp. (5108.TO), Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) of the U.S. and Dunlop Aircraft Tyres Ltd. of the U.K. - like other aeronautical suppliers - stand to reap rich rewards from the production spike over the coming years. \u001d  Historically, the airframe construction industry has operated on a seven- to 10-year cycle, and most aviation industry analysts reckon that production could sputter in 2011 before picking up again in 2015. \u001d  But tire producers - unlike other suppliers - are shielded from the impact of an eventual downturn in airframe construction. That's because - as they do in the automobile or truck segments - they make a lot more money from replacement tires than from supplying original equipment to car and plane makers. \u001d  Accounting for about EUR500 million in annual sales, the aviation tire industry is tiny by comparison with the overall civil jetliner business, but it's growing at a robust rate of about 4% to 5% every year, in line with the rise in air traffic. \u001d  It's a lucrative one, too, though all tire manufacturers are coy about breaking out sales or profit data for their aviation businesses. \u001d  \"That's sensitive information,\" said Francois Corbin, head of Michelin's aviation tires division, adding: \"I'd be really interested to see my competitors' figures.\" \u001d  Eric Varndell, global marketing manager for Goodyear Aviation Tires, agreed. \"It's quite a small industry, and any information is well guarded.\" \u001d  Michelin's SR3 business segment - which lumps together aviation and other specialty tires as well as maps and guides and sales of branded goods - saw a 4.1% rise in sales last year to just under EUR2 billion, but its operating margin of 12.4% was 50% better than that of its car tire operations, and almost double that of truck tires. \u001d  Goodyear gives regional breakdowns, but of its overall operations and not by business segment. \u001d  \"I'd be very surprised if Michelin's aviation tire margins aren't greater than the average\" of its SR3 segment, said Stephen Cheetham, automotive analyst at Sanford Bernstein in London, although he acknowledged that \"it's very difficult to make sensible estimates\" because Michelin and other companies keep their data so close to their chests. \u001d  Aircraft tires are built to much higher standards than truck tires, and their manufacture is highly labor-intensive. Higher production costs mean that a single tire can sell for EUR1,500. \u001d  Aviation tires suffer extreme stresses compared with their ground-bound equivalents. Military jet tires, for example, are designed to carry loads equivalent to two heavy trucks, and are inflated up to 20 atmospheres, as opposed to around two for car tires. At the same time, they have to be able to resist going from a static state to several hundred kilometers an hour, instantly, on landing. And they have to be capable of going from minus 45 degrees Celsius to boiling point at the end of a landing rollout without losing any of their attributes. \u001d  Although selling tires for new aircraft is good business, tire makers make most of their money from supplying replacement or retreaded tires to aircraft that are already in service. A short- to medium-range Airbus A320 or a Boeing 737, for example, needs a tire change four times a year over its 30-year life span. \u001d  Goodyear claims to be the market leader in volume sales, but Michelin says it has a 60% share of the fast-growing radial tire segment that currently accounts for about 15% of the overall aviation tire market. \u001d  The market leaders now offer a service to customer airlines - especially those in the U.S. - in which they provide either new or retreaded tires to airlines on the basis of the number of landings their planes make. That way, customers don't have the bother of keeping track of managing all the tires on their aircraft and ordering replacements as they become used. \u001d  The supply-management system makes it easier for both the airline and the tire makers to predict the requirements for new and replacement tires. \u001d  The surge in demand is prompting tire makers to increase production capacity. Last month, Bridgestone started construction on a second production plant for radial aircraft tires in Tokyo, and Michelin is investing EUR30 million over five years to expand output at its main facility at Bourges, in central France. \u001d  Thomas Besson, who follows Michelin from London for Merrill Lynch, agreed that \"capacity constraints are starting to emerge,\" and that this is bolstering the pricing power of tire makers so that the business is becoming increasingly profitable. \u001d  Corbin said, however, that there's no supply shortage as yet. \"No planes are being grounded because they don't have tires,\" he said. \u001d  Because of the labor-intensive nature of the business, Sanford Bernstein's Cheetham said, adding physical production capacity also implies adding and training more personnel. \"Michelin may not be exactly dragging its feet, but it's a clever company, and it knows that the aviation industry is cyclical, so any new investment will be cautious,\" he said. \u001d  Until the 1980s, aircraft tires were made using a \"bias\" or crossply technique, but the gradual introduction of radial technology over the last two decades has given aircraft owners tires that are 20% to 30% lighter, and offer up to 50% more tread life. \u001d  Other advantages include less carcass fatigue, greater resistance to cuts and the ability to operate at cooler temperatures so that aircraft don't have to wait so long after landing to let their tires cool down before the planes take off again.

That suggests it might soon be the target of an activist investor seeking a big shakeup of the printer maker. \u001d  Oce beat expectations thanks to growth at its smallest unit that supplies wide-format printing systems, or WFPS, where the Dutch company has a competitive technological edge in a niche market. \u001d  But Oce's main unit - digital document systems which accounted for around 70% of its second-quarter sales - barely broke even. \u001d  Indeed, management has little to show for its acquisition of U.S.-based Imagistics, completed in November 2005 for $638 million, that was aimed at helping turn around the business. First-half sales at the DDS division fell around 3%, while it has managed only to edge into the black in the second quarter from a small loss a year earlier. \u001d  Oce's increased exposure to a weakened dollar hasn't helped, but the business is clearly battling to compete on the ground with the likes of the bigger Canon, Ricoh, and Xerox. \u001d  It's hard to see where Oce is going to find new operational leverage if it's had to pass on most of the merger benefits in the U.S. to customers. \u001d  Indeed, with little overlap between its two divisions. \u001d  The DDS division sells machines for high-volume printing, as in newspaper production, whereas the WFPS unit supplies more technical printing equipment used by the likes of advertisers and architects. \u001d  So the sooner management undertakes a more thorough strategic overview of Oce, the better - if it doesn't want to end up doing it under the pressure from more opportunist investors who might comes up with a plan of their own. \b \u001d  (Mathijs Schiffers has been a financial reporter since 1998, joining the Dow Jones Newswires Amsterdam bureau in 2004.

(0127.HK) soared Wednesday after the Hong Kong property developer confirmed it is in talks with several third parties on a possible sale. \u001d  Chinese Estates jumped 19% to close at HK$14.60, after hitting a record intraday high of HK$16. The stock opened at HK$15.50. Wednesday's surge raised the company's market capitalization to HK$33 billion from HK$27.8 billion, based on Friday's closing price of HK$12.30. Hong Kong's stock market was closed Monday for a public holiday. \u001d  The company's shares were suspended from trading Tuesday, following a report by the South China Morning Post that cited unnamed sources as saying a consortium of hedge funds and private-equity firms plans to buy the mid-tier developer. \u001d  Chinese Estates didn't identify the parties involved in the talks. \u001d  \"These talks are at a preliminary and confidential stage and may or may not lead to an offer for the company,\" it said in a statement Wednesday. \u001d  In mid-May, Chairman Joseph Lau said he abandoned a plan to take the company private because of opposition from other major shareholders. Lau holds a controlling 47.29% stake in the company. \u001d  Analysts said Chinese Estates shares were trading at a deep discount to their net asset value of between HK$18.0 and HK$18.50 a share prior to Tuesday's trading halt, making the company an attractive acquisition target. Hong Kong-listed mid-tier property developers are currently trading at up to a 30% discount to their estimated net asset values. \u001d  The SCMP said Tuesday that The Children's Investment Fund, Och Ziff Management, Marathon and Fortress Investment Group were looking at ways to make a joint bid for Chinese Estates. \u001d  The consortium could also include buyout firm Texas Pacific Group, the newspaper said. \u001d  The Children's Investment Fund, a U.K.-based hedge fund, declined to comment Wednesday on the report. It owns 7.86% of Chinese Estates, according to the developer's latest filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. \u001d  \"I think hedge funds or private equity groups probably have their eyes on Chinese Estates' quality commercial property portfolio in Hong Kong, the value of which isn't reflected in the company's share price,\" said Y.K. Chan, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at Phillip Capital Management (HK) Ltd. \u001d  Analysts said the consortium could also generate higher investment returns by selling some of the developer's prized commercial properties in Hong Kong. \u001d  \"This could be done via a property trust spin-off. With the proceeds (from the property sales), Chinese Estates could distribute a special dividend to its new shareholders,\" said a Hong Kong-based analyst, who declined to be named. \u001d  Chinese Estates' Hong Kong properties, which include investment properties and properties under development, accounted for 63.4% of the developer's estimated net asset value of HK$18.15 a share, brokerage house CLSA Group said in a report in late March. \u001d  The company's commercial properties in Hong Kong include shopping centers and office buildings in the bustling Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui areas. \b \u001d  -By Jonathan Li and Jeffrey Ng, Dow Jones Newswires; 852-2802-7002; jonathan.li@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 05:22 ET (09:22 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9567f83702b4c5295dc53d347daa65b3","symR":["13170.FR","ACGY","ACY.OS","SPM.MI","SUB.OS","TKP","FR0000131708","IT0000068525","KYG8549P1081","LU0075646355"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Morgan Stanley Lifts Technip Target Price","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T09:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["13170.FR","ACGY","ACY.OS","SPM.MI","SUB.OS","TKP","FR0000131708","IT0000068525","KYG8549P1081","LU0075646355"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XENX","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XOBX"],"Story":"\u001d  0906 GMT [Dow Jones] Morgan Stanley raises Technip's (TKP) price target to EUR64 from EUR56 along with other players' in the oil services sector as it thinks \"offshore construction margins may double.\" Adds it is \"not outside the realms of possibility for the EBITDA margins of contractors to double to 25-32% by '09 as the segment catches up in '07/'08 with the high EBITDA margins seen in Offshore Vessels.\" Keeps Technip at equal weight.

(KOS.T) is celebrating its \"massive coup\" in acquiring Dare Digital Ltd., a \"needed key player\" in London's digital marketing field, the company will focus on convergence of services and clients at a quick pace. \u001d  \"The challenge and priority is to integrate, under the Cossette brand-name umbrella,\" the four U.K. firms acquired by Cossette in the past three years, Cossette's chief executive, Claude Lessard, said on a conference call. \u001d  Lessard said he expects the integration, which began 12 months ago with the three other businesses, will now accelerate with Dare, to put forward the Cossette brand, and serve clients together. \u001d  The other three London companies are brand consultancy firm Identica, public relations firm Band & Brown and advertising agency MCBD. \u001d  Cossette, Quebec City, offers a range of communications services to clients in North America and Europe. \u001d  Dare offers Web-site development, online advertising, e-mail marketing, digital outdoor and mobile marketing to such clients as Vodafone Group PLC, Barclays PLC, Sony Europe, ITV and Sony Ericsson, the last of which is also a client of Cossette. Dare has total gross income of about C$20 million in fiscal 2007. \u001d  The deal, which will be completed in three stages over six years, was characterized by Lessard as a \"massive coup\" for Cossette. This is because he views digital marketing as a strong investment for the company's future. Dare has a good \"cultural fit\" and will help to build upon Cossette's goal of \"convergent communication.\" \u001d  Cossette has initially acquired 65.4% of Dare for about C$21 million. It can acquire the remaining 34.6% from 12 Dare employees under certain circumstances over the next five years. \u001d  When asked why the deal is structured in that way, Cossette's chief financial officer, Jean Royer, said on the call that Cossette wants Dare's owners to remain \"incentivized.\" \u001d  Dare's employees are highly entrepreneurial and want to keep a stake in the company, Royer said. But after the six-year-deal is completed, the shareholders could leave the firm, Royer said. \"It's a risk inherent in the business,\" he said. \u001d  Royer said the cost of buying 100% of Dare could be about C$42 million. \u001d  Royer said Cossette and Dare have similar margins and that pro forma share-earnings accretion is 3-4 Canadian cents, excluding amortization of intangible assets. \u001d  Aside from its consolidation in the U.K., Lessard said the priority for Cossette will be in the U.S. in the next 12 months, as the spectrum of offerings there is more limited than in either Canada or Europe. \u001d  In Toronto Wednesday, Cossette is unchanged at C$13 in thin trading. \u001d  Company Web Site: http://www.cossette.com \b \u001d  -Mirella Christou, Dow Jones Newswires: 416-306-2025 mirella.christou@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 14:36 ET (18:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"98af580a11dcd06cf4b799ed62a9ec2c","symR":["GIMB.BT","BE0003699130"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: KBC Guesses GIMV's Diatos Invest Worth EUR1.5M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T08:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GIMB.BT","BE0003699130"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  0805 GMT [Dow Jones]--KBC guesses GIMV NV's (GIMB.BT) new investment in French pharmaceutical company Diatos SA to be worth EUR1.5 million.

(GGOF) today announced the launch of Bank of Montreal GGOF C.O.R.E. Protected Deposit Notes, Series 2, 3, and 4. The Deposit Notes are based on the performance of GGOF Dividend Growth Fund, which is managed by Michael Stanley of Jones Heward Investment Counsel Inc. \b \bThe Deposit Notes offer a number of compelling features for investors. A dynamic asset allocation strategy provides up to 200 per cent exposure to a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks in order to enhance returns. At the same time, the Deposit Notes provide investors with the comfort of knowing that 100  per cent of their principal is protected if held to maturity by Bank of Montreal as issuer. With a maximum all-inclusive annual fee of 2.60 per cent, the Deposit Notes are competitively priced and are available in three Classes for greater choice in meeting individual investor needs: \b \bTotal Return Class is most suitable for investors seeking long-term \b \bcapital growth. All the Fund portfolio distributions will be notionally \b \breinvested. \b \bYield Class is ideal for investors seeking regular monthly income. The \b \bdistribution rate will be 100 per cent of the distribution rate of the \b \bFund and will be interest income. \b \bThe R.O.C. Class is most suitable for investors seeking regular monthly \b \bdistributions and tax deferral. The distribution rate will be \b \b100 per cent of the distribution rate of the Fund and will be R.O.C. \b \b(Return of Capital), which is tax deferred until maturity or when note is \b \bsold. \b \bEach series has a 6-year term. \b \b\"GGOF Dividend Growth Fund is an excellent core holding for investors seeking long-term capital growth. Jones Heward manages the Fund, which has a strong long-term track record investing in a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks. The addition of a dynamic asset allocation strategy and the availability of principal protection at maturity make it that much more appealing,\" said Gavin Graham, GGOF's Chief Investment Officer. \"With their very competitive pricing and availability in three different Classes, the Deposit Notes have been structured to be of interest to as wide an investor audience as possible.\" \b \bGGOF Dividend Growth Fund \b \bGGOF Dividend Growth Fund provides investors with the opportunity to benefit from dividend-paying stocks that have historically outperformed non-dividend-paying stocks over the long term. Dividend-paying stocks have historically provided the growth needed to generate long-term returns that outpace inflation and taxes. The Fund's goal is to generate a high level of tax-effective returns which includes dividend income and some capital gains from the increase in the value of securities held in the Fund's portfolio. \b \bGuardian Group of Funds \b \bGGOF provides investors with a full product line of 34 mutual funds, diversified by asset class, geographic region and capitalization. GGOF, with $6.2 billion of mutual fund assets under management at April 30, 2007, offers its funds exclusively through financial intermediaries. \b \bGGOF is a member of the BMO Financial Group and part of the organization's Private Client Group.

The move reflects higher forecasts for mobile growth, and growing demand for data services. Says the upgrade implies a better earnings outlook for the incumbents in particular, but notes some of this has already been priced in. On technical terms, Credit Suisse says the sector looks less overbought than at the start of the year and is still under-owned against long-term average holding levels. Also notes the sector is trading at a PE below historical levels while posting the highest dividend yield across all European sectors.

The French bank recently unveiled ambitious plans for its Greek subsidiary and is among the bidders for an Algerian state-owned bank that is expected to be privatized later this year. \u001d  \"I expect the sale price of Intesa Sanpaolo branches in the EUR1.5 billion range,\" said Elena Perini, a banking analyst with RASBank in Milan. She added that the French bank \"has already shown it aims at expanding at a fast pace in Italy.\" \u001d  In December, Italy's antitrust authority approved the merger between Banca Intesa SpA and Sanpaolo Imi SpA, but on the condition that the newly merged company would sell a total of 748 branches. \u001d  Intesa shareholder Credit Agricole last year had bought nearly 650 branches in total - 193 outlets and two regional banks - from the Italian bank for EUR6 billion, in return for waiving its veto of Intesa's merger with Sanpaolo. \u001d  Credit Agricole will face steep competition as \"more than 10 financial institutions have submitted non-binding bids for the 198 branches,\" a person familiar with the situation said Wednesday. \u001d  Siena-based Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS.MI), a consortium of Italian banks that also includes Veneto Banca, Banca Carige SpA (CGE.MI), Credito Valtellinese SCARL (CVAL.MI) and Italian mutual bank Banca Popolare di Milano SCARL (PMI.MI), have submitted non-binding offers, people familiar with the situation said. \u001d  According to unsourced press reports, Citigroup (C) and Deutsche Bank AG (DB) have also shown interest in the Intesa branches. \u001d  But Deutsche Bank isn't among the bidders, a person familiar told Dow Jones Newswires. \"Deutsche Bank has no ambitions regarding this,\" the person said. \u001d  A spokesman of Citigroup said \"the bank doesn't comment on market rumors,\" while Intesa Sanpaolo wasn't immediately reachable for a comment. \u001d  Credit Agricole shares since the branch acquisitions in Italy have outperformed the French CAC 40 index, but in recent months suffered from a share price decline, after weaker-than-expected first-quarter results.

The Fund's A credit rating reflects the upper medium-grade credit quality of the bond portfolio's investments, the manager's investment strategy and the Fund's diversification and issuer guidelines. The rating also reflects the fund advisor's strong investment, research and risk management capabilities. The MR3 market risk rating reflects the Fund's moderate sensitivity to interest rate changes, primarily due to it's effective duration which was 6.0 years as of 20 June 2007. \u001d  The UBS (CH) Institutional Fund - Bonds CHF Inland Passive is a sub-fund of the UBS (CH) Institutional Fund, domiciled in Switzerland. The Fund's objective is to replicate a benchmark of bonds denominated in Swiss francs (CHF), as represented by the Swiss Bond Domestic Index (SBDI), and to achieve performance in line with that of this benchmark. In doing so, the manager employs a stratified sampling technique to replicate the benchmark index's composition and return, however, the Fund's investment guidelines afford the manager some very limited discretion with regards to the management of both the duration as well as the asset composition of the Fund. The maximum permissible ex-ante tracking error by the Fund's internal guidelines is 0.5% and historically the investment adviser has managed the Fund at 0.2% tracking error, over the period from the Fund's inception to April 30, 2007. \u001d  The A credit rating reflects the Fund's overall high credit quality and also the fact that a small percentage of the Canton and Cantonal Bank issued securities, 1.2% as of May 18, 2007, does not carry a rating from any major credit rating agency. As of May 18, 2007, 87% of the Fund's assets were invested in sovereign and cantonal issued securities and 13% were invested in corporate financial issuers and Pfandbriefs, a composition consistent with that of the benchmark index to within 1%. As of the same date, about 80% of the Fund's holdings carried Aaa Moody's ratings. \u001d  The MR3 market risk rating primarily reflects the Fund's moderate sensitivity to interest rate changes. While the duration of the portfolio is not actively managed, internal investment guidelines permit the manager to deviate from the duration of its benchmark index by 10%. The Index's average historical duration since its inception in October 1998, has been 5.7 years, with a maximum of 6.2 years and a minimum of 5.1 years. The Fund manager does not currently make use of derivatives to manage the Fund's duration. While the investment adviser has no immediate plans to engage in derivatives-based investing, the Fund's prospectus permits the use of over-the-counter and exchange-traded interest rate derivatives. \u001d  UBS Global Asset Management (UBS Global AM) is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG (Moody's senior unsecured rating Aaa). UBSGAM provides investment products and services to private clients, financial intermediaries and institutional investors around the world through its major offices in Zurich, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and Chicago. It is currently the largest fund manager in Switzerland and its services include institutional asset management, pooled funds, investment funds and mutual funds, traditional and alternative investments, hedge and investment fund administration services. As of March 31st 2007, UBS Global AM had assets under management of CHF 883 billion ( 544 billion). \u001d  Moody's money market and bond fund ratings express opinions on the investment quality of shares in mutual funds and similar investment vehicles that principally invest in short-term and long-term fixed-income obligations, respectively. Moody's fund ratings address both credit quality and market risk considerations. The credit ratings reflect the average credit quality of a portfolio and are not intended to consider the prospective performance of a fund with respect to appreciation, volatility of net asset value, or yield. Funds rated A are judged to be of an investment quality similar to A-rated fixed-income obligations -- that is, they are judged to be of the upper medium quality by all standards. In addition to a credit quality rating, Moody's also assigns a market risk rating using a six-tiered numerical scale, from MR1+ to MR5. Funds with the least sensitivity to market changes will receive an MR1 rating, whilst the most sensitive funds will be rated MR5. Funds rated MR3 reflect the Fund's moderate sensitivity to changes in interest rate and other market conditions. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 02:40 ET (06:40 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9f6cd6c501b74fd9ce9ab9496ff58f19","symR":["UKDAY","UKDAY"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EUROPEAN MORNING BRIEFING: Div Payments & Ex Div Dates","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T05:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\bAcerinox (ACX.MC): 1H 2007 Dividend Payment Date \b \bAlliance Trust (ATST.LN): Q1 2007 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bAtrium Underwriting (AUW.LN): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bBabcock International Group (BAB.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bBraemar Seascope Group (BRG.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bBrunel International (34343.AE): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bBurberry Group (BRBY.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bBusiness Post Group (BPG.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bCampofrio (CPF.MC): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bCarphone Warehouse Group (CPW.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bChamberlin & Hill (CMH.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bCharles Stanley Group (CAY.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bChaucer Holdings (CHU.LN): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bChloride Group (CHLD.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bCML Microsystems (CML.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bCranswick (CWK.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bCreston (CRE.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bDebenhams (DEB.LN): 1H 2007 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bDee Valley Group (DVW.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bElectronic Data Processing (EDP.LN): 1H 2007 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bEnterprise Inns (ETI.LN): 1H 2007 Dividend Payment Date \b \bF&C Global Smaller Companies (FCS.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bFountains (FNT.LN): 1H 2007 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bFrench Connection Group (FCCN.LN): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bGB Group (GBG.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bGCap Media (GCAP.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bHavelock Europa (HVE.LN): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bHyder Consulting (HYC.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bIFG Group (IJG.DB): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bINDUS Holding (INH.XE): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bINDUS Holding (INH.XE): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bIntermediate Capital Group (ICP.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bInvesco Asia Trust (IAT.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bInvestment Company (INV.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bJPMorgan European Investment (JETG.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bJPMorgan European Investment (JETG.LN): Special Ex-Dividend Date \b \bJPMorgan Fleming Mercantile (JFM.LN): Q1 2007 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bJZ Equity Partners (JZE.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bLindsell Train Inv (LTI.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bLonmin (LMI.LN): 1H 2007 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bMan Group (EMG.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bMITIE Group (MTO.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bNumis Corporation (NUM.LN): 1H 2007 Dividend Payment Date \b \bPernod Ricard (12069.FR): 1H 2007 Dividend Payment Date \b \bPublic Power Corporation (PPC.AT): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bQueen's Walk Investment (QWIL.LN): Q4 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bRestaurant Group (The) (RTN.LN): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bSchroder UK Growth Fund (SDU.LN): 1H 2007 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bScottish Mortgage Investment (SMT.LN): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bShires Income (SHRS.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bSOS Cuetara (SOS.MC): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bSotogrande (STG.MC): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bSynergy Healthcare (SYR.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bTipiak (6648.FR): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bUMECO (UMC.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bVallourec (12035.FR): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \bVallourec (12035.FR): Special Dividend Payment Date \b \bWorkspace Group (WKP.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bWynnstay Properties (WSP.LN): FY 2007 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bXansa (XAN.LN): FY 2006 Ex-Dividend Date \b \bYule Catto (YULC.LN): FY 2006 Dividend Payment Date \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 01:00 ET (05:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9f9d724e4564cc4765050fe11989e96b","symR":["UKDAY"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"UK Halifax Jun House Prices +0.4% On Mo, +10.7% On Yr","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T07:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 03:00 ET (07:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9fa7c237499ac54aeeb08a828f99456a","symR":["OMG.T","CA68375U1075"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": OPMEDIC GROUP Inc.

The new prenatal screening tests offered by the Company contributed $0.367 million over the quarter. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the Company received $0.078 million in fees for these same tests. This upward trend will continue throughout the fiscal year. In addition, the new OPMEDIC division generated new surgical revenue of $0.311 million. \b \bFor the first nine months of the fiscal year, revenue totalled $6.921 million, for an increase of $1.373 million or 25% from $5.548 million in 2006. The prenatal screening tests provided by the Company since October 2006 contributed $0.897 million. Fees for these same tests were $0.192 million the previous year. The OPMEDIC division generated new surgical revenue of $0.610 million. \b \bCost of Services \b \bThe cost of services for the quarter ended May 31, 2007 rose from $0.815 million in 2006 to $1.113 million in 2007, an increase of $0.298 million. Expenses of $0.227 million incurred by the OPMEDIC surgical division accounted for most of this increase. Moreover, the new prenatal screening services resulted in additional payroll expense and supplies of $0.080 million. \b \bFor the first nine months of the fiscal year, the cost of services was $3.148 million, up by $0.993 million from $2.155 million in 2006. The surgical division's new expenses of $0.753 million and prenatal screening costs of $0.246 million accounted for this increase. \b \bGross Profit \b \bGross profit for the quarter ended May 31, 2007 was $1.443 million, up 24% from $1.165 million in 2006. The new prenatal screening services offered contributed $0.209 million, and the OPMEDIC division, which posted a gross profit for the first time, had a positive impact of $0.084 million compared to the same quarter a year earlier. \b \bFor the first nine months of the fiscal year, gross profit was $3.773 million, up 11% from $3.393 million in 2006. The $0.459 million contribution of the new prenatal screening services was offset by the $0.143 million higher loss of the OPMEDIC division, which had opened its doors in May 2006. \b \bThe gross margin for the quarter ended May 31, 2007 was 56%, compared to 59% in 2006. For the first nine months of the year, gross margin rose to 55% in 2007, as against 61% in 2006. The start-up period for the OPMEDIC division, and more specifically the costs relating to the new Laval premises, pushed down the ratio in 2007. \b \bGeneral and Administrative Expenses \b \bGeneral and administrative expenses for the third quarter ended May 31, 2007 totalled $0.691 million, up $0.083 million from $0.608 million in 2006. New expenses related to the opening of the Laval operating rooms accounted for this difference because the new premises were inaugurated in May 2006. \b \bFor the nine-month period ended May 31, 2007, general and administrative expenses were $2.189 million, compared to $1.702 million for the corresponding period in 2006, for an increase of $0.487 million. New expenses incurred as a result of the opening of the Laval operating rooms totalled $0.465 million, with higher professional fees of $0.226 million in 2007, of which $0.111 million was attributable to the settlement with Warnex Inc. in October 2006. The higher fees were offset by the $0.143 million decrease in stock-based compensation. \b \bNet Earnings (Loss) \b \bNet earnings and basic and diluted net earnings per share for the third quarter were respectively $0.290 million and $0.02, compared to $0.202 million and $0.01, respectively, in 2006. \b \bFor the nine-month period, the net loss was $0.400 million and the basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.02, whereas in 2006, net earnings were $0.657 million, basic earnings per share were $0.05 and diluted earnings per share were $0.04. The non-recurring expense of $1.250 million settlement for the prenatal screening tests in 2007 accounted for most of this difference. \b \bDetailed financial results can be accessed on the OPMEDIC GROUP web site at www.opmedicgroup.com. \b \bAbout OPMEDIC GROUP \b \bOPMEDIC GROUP is a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Quebec which provides healthcare-related services including surgical facilities and services to patients and surgeons (with its OPMEDIC division), fertility treatments, medical imaging, laboratory services and diagnostic procedures (with its PROCREA Cliniques division) and sperm banking services (with its PROCREA Cryopreservation Centre subsidiary).

The deal had an immediate knock-on effect in Europe as positive sentiment returned to the sector and investors began looking for the next takeover target. \u001d  In a slightly higher London market, Intercontinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG) shares rose 66 pence, or 5.2%, to 1323 pence, Whitbread PLC (WTB.LN) rose 95 pence, or 5.4%, to 1848 pence, Millennium & Copthorne PLC (MLC.LN) rose 32 pence, or 4.8%, to 684 pence. In Paris, Accor SA (12040.FR) shares were up 7.1% at EUR69.5 while in Madrid, shares of NH Hoteles S.A. (NHH.MC) were 3.1% higher at EUR16.55, with Sol Melia (SOL.MC) up 3.9% at EUR17.27. \u001d  Merrill Lynch said that \"asset heavy\" firms like NHH, Sol Melia and Millennium & Copthorne would set the pace Wednesday. \u001d  Hotel companies like Hilton and InterContinental, or IHG, have sold off most of their property assets in recent years, transforming from hotel owners to hotel operators or franchise owners. A hotel company with a large property estate would offer a private equity company an easy way to make a return on its investment through an asset sale. \u001d  Teather & Greenwood's Mark Reed said the Hilton deal wouldn't necessarily increase the likelihood of further deals in the hotel sector, but it would certainly boost confidence. \u001d  Reed pointed out that hotel stocks have been weak since the failure of the Vector Hospitality IPO a month ago. \u001d  Hotel owner Vector Hospitality postponed its planned GBP1.8 billion initial public offering in June due to lack of interest. Vector would have been the first hotel real estate investment trust, or REIT, to be listed in the U.K. \u001d  This failure, together with the heightened terrorist threat in recent weeks has seen sentiment weaken across the sector, said Teather & Greenwood's Reed. \u001d  The Hilton deal - and the high price offered relative to recent deals - should \"kick start confidence in the sector,\" said Reed. \"It's all very encouraging.\" \u001d  The price of the Hilton deal represents a premium of 40%over Monday's closing stock price. \u001d  Numis Securities' Richard Carter said the sector is at a point in the cycle where deals which seemed unthinkable 12 months ago are now happening apace. Carter expects Whitbread - which operates the Premier Inn hotel chain - to come under pressure to spin off its Costa Coffee unit and adopt a more innovative property ownership structure. \u001d  Bridgewell's Kate Pettem says that the read-across to Whitbread is not directly comparable, as most of Hilton's earnings come from franchised operations.. \u001d  \"It does give us comfort though, that a hot market for hotel deals has not diminished, and apparently high multiples are still being paid,\" she said. \u001d  One analyst said investor focus would now naturally shift to Intercontinental Hotels, or IHG, which counts Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza among its hotel brands. \u001d  IHG's strong position in emerging markets - especially China - and its GBP1 billion worth of property assets make it an obvious target for private equity. \u001d  One analyst pointed out that IHG is effectively in play already, with the Barclay Brothers sitting on the company's share register. \u001d  Reclusive entrepreneurs David and Frederick Barclay increased their stake in the company to 10% in June. The brothers have been cited as possible buyers of the hotels group since their initial shareholding first became known in January. \u001d  It is not clear what the brothers plan to do with their stake. As the analyst said: \"they don't brief analysts, they don't brief investors and they don't brief journalists.\" \u001d  Accor SA (12040.FR), meanwhile, has its own private equity interest to deal with. Colony Capital Tuesday said it had raised its stake in the French hotels group to 10.3% after converting EUR500 million in bonds to shares. \u001d  Colony Capital invested EUR1 billion in Accor debt in May 2005, comprising EUR500 million in exchangeable bonds and EUR500 million in convertible bonds. \u001d  The private equity firm pushed the hotels group to change its management and strategy, shedding non-core assets and restructuring its real-estate portfolio. \u001d  Analysts said the stake increase does not change Accor's valuation. \u001d  \"We believe that Colony, in the recent interest rate environment, is increasing its exposure to equity markets,\" said Matthias Desmarais, analyst with Societe Generale. \b \u001d  Company Web sites: http://www.ihgplc.com \u001d                     http://www.whitbread.co.uk \u001d                     http://www.nh-hotels.com \u001d                     http://www.accor.com \u001d                     http://www.solmelia.com \u001d                     http://www.millenniumhotels.com \b \u001d  -By Michael Carolan, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9278; michael.carolan@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (Mimosa Spencer in Paris and David Roman in Madrid contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 04:54 ET (08:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a15f9edd2ec1edad2956bbf65df09b33","symR":["DEB.LN","GTH.XX","NRK.LN","UKDAY","WMPY.LN","GB0001452795","GB00B126KH97"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UK Retailers' Pft Warnings Hit 15-Month High In 2Q - Survey","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T12:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DEB.LN","GTH.XX","NRK.LN","UKDAY","WMPY.LN","GB0001452795","GB00B126KH97"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","HOM","HPR","ICS","RTB","RTS","SVC","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The number of profit warnings issued by U.K. retailers almost doubled in the second quarter of 2007, taking them to their highest level in 15 months, accountancy firm Grant Thornton said Wednesday. \u001d  Negative trading statements were issued by 19% of all U.K. retailers listed on the London Stock Exchange in the quarter, compared to 10% in the previous three months. \u001d  \"The results are clear evidence that May's interest rate rise has begun to have an impact, along with the cumulative impact of the other interest rate rises since last summer,\" said David Bush, head of Grant Thornton's retail services team. \u001d  Grant Thornton's findings are in line with retailers' claims that U.K. consumers are starting to rein in spending in response to rising interest rates. Several companies, including mortgage lender Northern Rock PLC (NRK.LN) and house builder George Wimpey PLC (WMPY.LN) have said they expect slower consumer spending to hit their profits. \u001d  The highest number of warnings came from retailers of music, clothing and consumer electronics, Grant Thornton said. One such example is department store firm Debenhams (DEB.LN) which warned in April that the U.K. retail market was \"challenging,\" blaming interest rate rises for low consumer spending. \u001d  Food retailers remain little affected by the rate rises, Grant Thornton said, with no U.K. food retailers issuing a negative trading statement in the quarter. \u001d  \"Food and drink retailers continue to go from strength to strength in the U.K. and have benefited from strong consumer demand over the past quarter,\" Bush said. \u001d  The Bank of England has raised rates four times since August 2006 in an attempt to slow consumer spending and bring the U.K. inflation rate back in line with its 2.0% target. Consumer price inflation eased back to 2.5% in May, its lowest level in seven months, after climbing to 3.1% in March. \u001d  However economists say the BOE is likely to want to see further evidence of a slowdown in consumer spending before it abandons its monetary tightening policy. The BOE's Monetary Policy Committee is expected to raise U.K. interest rates Thursday - to 5.75% - and could hike again before the year end. \u001d  Grant Thornton's Quoted Retail Companies Index reviews the quarterly statements issued by all of 40 General Retailers and Food & Drug retailers listed on the London Stock Exchange. \b \u001d  -By Emma Charlton, Dow Jones Newswires; 44 20 7842 9307; emma.charlton@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 08:36 ET (12:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a34fee17bcc51fae7da87583922ae554","symR":["KOS.T","CA2214781007"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Cossette Commun To Buy U.K. Marketing Agency Dare Digital","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T12:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KOS.T","CA2214781007"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","MED"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Cossette Communication Group Inc.

(\"Vaaldiam\") (TSX:VAA) announces its intention to acquire all of the outstanding shares of diamond producer Elkedra Diamonds NL (ASX:EDN)(AIM:EDN) and diamond explorer Great Western Diamonds Corp. (TSX VENTURE:GWD). The new company formed upon completion of this strategic initiative will be the dominant South American diamond producer and one of Canada's largest listed diamond companies with the following attributes: \b \b- Significant scale of operations: This strategic initiative creates South America's largest diamond producer and positions Vaaldiam as a consolidator of the fragmented small and mid-tier diamond sector. \b \b- Diversified long-life production: Vaaldiam will diversify its production with 100% ownership of two producing diamond mines with very attractive expansion potential. Production is expected to be: \b \b \b  - 50,000 carats in 2007 \b  - 85,000 carats in 2008 \b \b \bThe anticipated development of Vaaldiam's Brauna kimberlite project is expected to significantly add to this production in the coming years. \b \b- Unparalleled development pipeline: In addition to being South America's largest diamond producer, Vaaldiam will hold 100% interests in 53 kimberlite deposits and control approximately 1.5 million hectares of diamond exploration concessions in Brazil and Canada, including the following advanced-stage kimberlite exploration properties: \b \b \b  - Brauna Project (Bahia State, Brazil) \b  - Pimento Bueno and Ariquemes projects (Rondonia State, Brazil) \b  - Candle Lake and Centennial projects (Fort a la Corne, Saskatchewan) \b \b \b- Enhanced capital markets profile: Vaaldiam will be a multi-mine diamond producer with a pro forma market capitalization in excess of $160 million, increased liquidity and improved investor awareness attracting the attention of a broader group of international investors. \b \b- Experienced in-country teams: Vaaldiam will benefit from experienced in-country development and operational teams in Brazil and highly-skilled exploration teams in Brazil and Canada, in addition to a proven management team with significant diamond industry experience. \b \bTHE ELKEDRA ARRANGEMENT \b \bUnder the terms of the planned scheme of arrangement, each Elkedra shareholder will be entitled to receive 0.52 of a Vaaldiam share per Elkedra share (the \"Arrangement\"). The board of directors of Elkedra has voted unanimously to support the Arrangement and have agreed to recommend the transaction to shareholders pursuant to a merger implementation deed executed with Vaaldiam. Vaaldiam and Elkedra have each agreed to pay a fee equal to 1% of the enterprise value of the other company in the event the merger does not proceed in certain circumstances. Vaaldiam has executed lock-up agreements pursuant to which a number of existing shareholders of Elkedra have agreed to vote an aggregate of 19.9 million Elkedra shares in favour of the Arrangement, representing approximately 19% of all outstanding Elkedra shares. \b \bThe Arrangement is subject to a number of conditions, including the absence of adverse material changes and receipt of all necessary regulatory, shareholder and court approvals. Full details regarding the Arrangement will be set out in a scheme booklet to be mailed to the shareholders of Elkedra in accordance with applicable securities laws. Elkedra expects to mail the scheme booklet to Elkedra shareholders in August. \b \bTHE GREAT WESTERN OFFER \b \bUnder the terms of the Great Western offer, each Great Western shareholder will be entitled to receive 0.45 of a Vaaldiam share per Great Western share (the \"Offer\"). The board of directors of Great Western has approved the Offer and have agreed to support the transaction pursuant to a support agreement executed with Vaaldiam. Lock-up agreements have been executed pursuant to which a number of existing shareholders have irrevocably agreed to tender an aggregate of 43.6 million Great Western shares to the Offer, representing approximately 49% of all outstanding Great Western shares. \b \bThe Offer will be subject to a number of conditions, including closing of the Elkedra arrangement in accordance with its terms, absence of adverse material changes, and receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. As well, the number of Great Western shares to be deposited under the Offer and not withdrawn at the expiry of the Offer shall constitute not less than 66?% of the outstanding Great Western shares on a fully-diluted basis. The support agreement provides for the payment by Great Western of a break fee of $750,000 and an expense reimbursement fee in the amount of $710,000 payable by Vaaldiam under certain circumstances. Full details regarding the Offer will be included in a formal take-over bid circular to be circulated to the shareholders of Great Western in accordance with applicable securities laws. \b \bVaaldiam's controlling shareholder also indirectly holds a control position in Great Western and for this reason the Offer is an insider bid under applicable securities laws. Accordingly, the boards of directors of both Vaaldiam and Great Western have established independent committees to review and consider the transactions. \b \bAny Great Western shareholder that is (i) a U.S. Person (as such term is defined in Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended) or (ii) holds Great Western shares on behalf of a U.S. Person (each of (i) and (ii) a \"U.S. Shareholder\" and collectively the \"U.S. Shareholders\") shall not be entitled to receive any Vaaldiam shares in connection with the Offer. Instead, Vaaldiam shares that would have otherwise been distributed to U.S. Shareholders will be deposited with the depositary and sold in the market through an orderly sale with the net cash proceeds being remitted to U.S. Shareholders.\" \b \bELKEDRA OVERVIEW \b \bElkedra owns and operates the Chapada diamond mine in the State of Mato Grosso in Brazil, which is expected to produce 25,000 carats of diamonds in 2007, increasing to 36,000 carats annually in 2008. During the past twelve months which was the first full year of operation and included a commissioning phase, Elkedra produced 20,131 carats of gem quality diamonds at an average sales value of US$393 per carat. The Chapada mine is known for producing large high quality diamonds evidenced by the high average size of the diamonds produced at 0.53 carats per stone with a number of diamonds larger than 20 carats having been recovered to date. The largest diamond produced to date at the Chapada operation weighed 27.35 carats, and was sold for US$205,125. Elkedra also holds a large area of exploration tenements in the Chapada mining area which has the potential to significantly expand output at the Chapada mine. \b \bGREAT WESTERN OVERVIEW \b \bGreat Western owns the 830,000 hectare Rondonia diamond project in Brazil, situated to the north-west of Vaaldiam's 248,000 hectare Pimenta Bueno property. The Rondonia property encompasses eight kimberlite pipes, five of which are known to be diamond-bearing based on the limited sampling completed to date and has significant potential for new kimberlite discoveries. In Canada, Great Western is engaged in a three-year detailed evaluation program of the Candle Lake project, which consists of two large macro diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes located at the northern end of the Fort a la Corne kimberlite trend, which hosts Shore Gold Inc.'s (TSX-SGF) Star and Orion properties in Saskatchewan. Great Western also is actively exploring for new kimberlite pipes on the Centennial Project located in west-central Saskatchewan and around the known diamond-bearing kimberlite fields of north-central Alberta. \b \bOVERVIEW OF THE COMBINED COMPANY \b \bThe combination of Vaaldiam, Elkedra and Great Western will create a leading diamond production, exploration and development company with a pro forma market capitalization of over $160 million. The new company is projected to have the ability to materially fund the advanced-stage kimberlite exploration and development costs from cash flow, thereby reducing dilution to its shareholders. The combined company will have strong management expertise and the financial capacity to realize the value potential of its exploration portfolio and to capitalize on future acquisition and consolidation opportunities. \b \bKen Johnson, President and CEO of Vaaldiam, commented: \"The combination of Vaaldiam with Elkedra and Great Western positions our company as South America's largest diamond producer marketing high quality diamonds with a combined average sales value of over US$300 per carat. The transaction also strengthens our management, operational and technical teams to clearly establish Vaaldiam as a leader in the diamond sector. The unique combination of the assets of Vaaldiam, Elkedra and Great Western provides all three companies' shareholders with the benefits of high value production to accelerate the exploration and development of our pipeline of exploration projects ranging from early exploration stage kimberlite projects through to feasibility stage projects.\" \b \bSam Randazzo, Elkedra's Executive Director, said today: \"The proposed bid from Vaaldiam creates an exciting opportunity for Elkedra shareholders. The combined group will be a clear leader in the South American diamond sector with significant production of high quality gem diamonds. Importantly, it also offers our shareholders immediate exposure to a number of advanced kimberlite projects in Brazil and Canada and brings together management teams with a proven track record in exploration, project development and mine operations. This is evidenced by the successful implementation of the Chapada project by Elkedra and the Duas Barras project by Vaaldiam.\" \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a547906674fdeb3b1d44af2827340795","symR":["LSE.LN","GB00B0SWJX34"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"THE SKEPTIC: Crack Needed Of FSA Whip","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T05:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LSE.LN","GB00B0SWJX34"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","SCR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (This story was originally published Tuesday) \b \u001d  By Sean Walters \u001d  A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--There is something rotten in the City. \u001d  Almost a quarter of takeover announcements made to the London Stock Exchange in 2005 were preceded by suspicious equity-trading transactions, according to the Financial Services Authority, the U.K. regulator. \u001d  That's an improvement over 2004, though no better than in 2000 just before stricter insider-trading rules came into play. \u001d  That doesn't say much for the effectiveness of controls companies and their advisors have in place to prevent leaks of sensitive information to the market place. \u001d  But the FSA shouldn't be let off the hook when such prevalent insider trading risks damaging the City's reputation as a place where all investors get equal treatment, not just those with the best connections. \u001d  Of course, companies should be doing more to stamp out insider trading, but at the moment there is too little motivation for them to do so. \u001d  The FSA is encouraging whistle-blowing. The authority has called for immunity to be given to those who can provide it with hard evidence of wrongdoing. \u001d  This alone won't change much when the FSA's own record is so poor. \u001d  It's all very well priding yourself for not being an enforcement-led regulator, but the lack of significant progress in tackling this problem indicates it's time for improve on the 8% of resources it currently devotes to enforcement. \u001d  The FSA has successfully prosecuted just 15 cases of insider trading since 2002, a year after the Financial Services and Markets Act was passed, aimed specifically at detecting and prosecuting insider traders. \u001d  In contrast, the SEC has filed over 300 cases in the past six years, exploiting a budget that's 61% bigger than the FSA's. The SEC managed to settle some cases out of court, with the accused parties paying out financial penalties. \u001d  Now a knee-jerk reaction resulting in the implementation of more stringent regulations in the manner of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation in the U.S. might reduce the incidents of insider trading, but have far-reaching and unintended consequences for the City's attractiveness as a financial center. \u001d  London's principles-based regime has benefited the LSE over the heavily regulated NYSE.

Including assumed debt, the Basell offer was worth around $9.6 billion. \u001d  The deal with Basell can be terminated if Huntsman gets a better offer. The U.S. group said its transaction committee is evaluating the terms of Hexion's offer, adding it could \"reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal,\" than the agreed deal with Basell. \u001d  If the deal with Basell is terminated, the Dutch group will be entitled to a $200 million break-up fee. Hexion has agreed to directly fund $100 million of this fee if its proposed deal goes ahead. \u001d  Under the latest proposal, Huntsman would receive a $325 million fee if Hexion failed to get regulatory approval or secure financing for the deal, while the U.S. chemicals group would have to pay a $225 million fee to Hexion if it terminated the deal. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 12:31 ET (16:31 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b50610fa92ee864ff7571a63d578521f","symR":["12027.FR","12057.FR","SNY","TOT","FR0000120271","FR0000120578"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: Sanofi-Aventis Faces Uncertainty - Oddo","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T11:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12027.FR","12057.FR","SNY","TOT","FR0000120271","FR0000120578"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","OIL","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\u001d  1152 GMT [Dow Jones] Sanofi-Aventis (SNY) faces uncertainty, as the group must take new strategic decisions, after the recent rejection of Acomplia by the US FDA Advisory Committee, Oddo says.

It also gave a stable outlook on all the company's ratings. \u001d  This upgrade came only two days after Fitch Ratings (FTH.XX) had also upgraded Rosneft's debt to BBB- from BBB+ and assigned the planned Eurobond issue a BBB- rating. \b \u001d  Company's Web site: http://www.rosneft.ru \b \u001d  -By Lidia Kelly, Dow Jones Newswires; +7 495 974 80 55; lidia.kelly@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 04:33 ET (08:33 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b5f65d2d509bba911f302249e380de1d","symR":["ABT.T","CA00386B1094"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Absolute Software Tgt Raised To C$28 From C$23: Versant >ABT.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T11:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ABT.T","CA00386B1094"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 07:46 ET (11:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b6114cc7c48cd53b158a37efba2f4d92","symR":["ITV.LN","GB0033986497"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ITV: ITV Family Share Of Commercial Viewing -3.1% At 41.5%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T08:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ITV.LN","GB0033986497"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 04:38 ET (08:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b62985635b206a4d62cb0a85c28be860","symR":["RYA.DB","RYAAY","IE00B1GKF381"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Ryanair 12 Mos Load Factor 82%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T09:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RYA.DB","RYAAY","IE00B1GKF381"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 05:01 ET (09:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b636a3facc59059fcd2d1121e268b16a","symR":["RY","RY.T","CA7800871021"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": RBC Asset Management Inc.

Sorrells \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  BERLIN (Dow Jones)--European government bonds were lower Wednesday, pulled down by equity market strength and a disinclination to make bold moves a day before the European Central Bank announces its interest rate decision. \u001d  With U.S. markets shut for the Independence Day holiday, the market suffered from a lack of liquidity and European traders were without their usual cues from Treasurys. Most attention centered on the EUR6.0 billion reopening of Germany's 10-year benchmark bund.   The auction went well, with the bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand, rising to 1.8 from 1.7 at the previous auction. Analysts had predicted good demand for the auction, due to this week's large volume of coupon payments and bond redemptions. However, one trader said a lack of follow-through buying in the secondary market capped any upside movement. \u001d  The trend led the Royal Bank of Scotland to stick by its previous forecast of bearish flattening. \"We do not believe there is enough priced into the front end,\" said bank analyst Andy Chaytor. \u001d  \"We can't see what would be the trigger for (a change) on a quiet Wednesday with 10y supply...We look ahead to (European Central Bank President Jean-Claude) Trichet's press conference on Thursday, after which the market may feel happy to price in a September hike with greater certainty.\" \u001d  At 1430 GMT, the September bund contract on Eurex was down 0.23 at 110.62. The 10-year benchmark bund was down 0.22 at 97.30, to yield 4.593%.   The September gilt future contract was down 0.19 at 103.58, with the 4% gilt due 2016 down 0.17 at 89.415, to yield 5.484%. \u001d  Preparations for the statement from the ECB, which is expected to hold rates steady at 4%, colored the whole day as speculation jumped ahead to what the ECB might do in September. \u001d  \"The market is priced for a 70% risk that the ECB hikes in September with a full 25 bp nearly priced into the October meeting,\" said Harvinder Sian, a strategist with ABN Amro. \"The pricing has been influenced by two factors. Firstly, the evolution of ECB speak as rates move higher and secondly, the logistics of signaling and moving in September.\" \u001d  The day opened with a negative tone, extending Tuesday's sell-off after U.S Treasurys fell in New York. Insinger de Beaufort's Marc Ostwald attributed this to a market desire to keep 10-year annual yields above 4.50%, while traders noted some concession building ahead of the 10-year auction. \u001d  The little data that came out during the day had little impact on the markets' overall trend. The euro-zone service sector purchasing managers index came in at 58.3, up from 57.3 in May. \u001d  The yield curve between the two-year and 30-year bunds flattened marginally. The yield spread between the two-year schatz and 10-year bund narrowed 0.5 basis point to 11.5 basis points from 12.0. The 10-year/30-year spread narrowed 0.5 basis point to 12.0 basis points. \u001d  Weaker-than-expected U.K. economic data failed to lend support to gilts, which remained hostage to the move lower in bunds, while focus remained firmly fixed on the Bank of England's interest rate decision Thursday. \u001d  The Nationwide building society consumer confidence index fell to 95 in June from 99 in May, while the Halifax reported U.K. house prices rose just 2.0% in the second quarter of 2007, down from a rise of 3.0% in the first quarter. \u001d   While analysts said the data were unlikely to prevent the BOE from raising U.K. interest rates 25 basis points to 5.75% Thursday, the numbers indicated the four interest rate hikes by the BOE since August 2006 were beginning to have an impact. \u001d  \"The Monetary Policy Committee is likely to take comfort from this slowdown (in house prices) and conclude that the past hikes are showing through,\" said Alan Clarke, U.K. economist at BNP Paribas, \"and may provide ammunition for the doves to be cautious with regards to further hikes.\" \u001d  Further evidence of the need for higher U.K. rates came with the release of the June services purchasing managers index, which rose to 57.7 from 57.2 in May. \u001d  The composite of the two PMI surveys, the other being manufacturing released Monday, came in at 56.7, \"still very much in interest rate hike territory and consistent with GDP growth on the high side of trend,\" which according to BNP Paribas' Clarke. \u001d  With volumes reduced because of the U.S. holiday, gilts remained confined to a narrow trading range ahead of the BOE rate announcement Thursday. \u001d  The yield curve was mixed, with the 10-year sector under pressure as the yield on the 10-year gilt rose close to 5.50%. \u001d  The yield spread between two-year and 10-year gilts disinverted 0.5 basis point to -25.5 basis points from -26.0, while the 10-year/30-year spread inverted a further 1.5 basis points to -64.0 basis points from -62.5. \b \u001d  -By Niels C.

(TSX: WTN)(TSX: WTN.DB) and (AIM: WTN) (\"Western\" or the \"Company\") announces the following: \b \u001d  Further to its announcement of April 27, 2007, Western is pleased to announce that Cambrian Mining plc (\"Cambrian\") has completed the acquisition (the \"Acquisition\") of Falls Mountain Coal Inc. (\"FMC\") from Pine Valley Mining Corp. in accordance with the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated April 26, 2007. In accordance with the terms of the Master Agreement dated April 26, 2007 made between Western and Cambrian, Western has paid to Cambrian a fee of C$250,000 for Cambrian's costs associated with the Acquisition and the parties have entered into an Interim Management Services and Employee Supply Agreement under which Western will provide certain services in respect of evaluating and maintaining FMC's Willow Creek Coal Mine and the coal handling, processing and rail car loading facilities owned by FMC. \b \u001d  Under the terms of the Master Agreement, which were disclosed in the announcement of April 27, 2007, for a period of 180 days following completion of the Acquisition and subject to receipt of all requisite consents and approvals, Western will be entitled to acquire FMC from Cambrian. The combination of the FMC properties with Western's properties would provide the opportunity to produce coal with product mix and marketing synergies. \b \u001d  In the interim, Western has the right to use the Willow Creek coal handling, processing and rail load-out facilities. In consideration of such use, Western will pay Cambrian a fee of C$2.50 per tonne of coal loaded through the FMC load out. \b \u001d  Western is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the FMC facilities which offer significant synergies to Western's Brule mine. The Willow Creek processing facility can be used to process Brule's low volatile PCI coal eliminating the need to construct a new plant of Western's Burnt River property and the use of the load-out facility will enable Western to experience significant transport cost savings versus current operations. \b \b   Forward-Looking Information \b \u001d  This release may contain forward-looking statements that may involve risks and uncertainties. Such statements relate to the Company's expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs. As a result, actual future events or results could differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Readers are referred to the documents filed by the Company on SEDAR.

In addition, the company also has three proposals for a more traditional bond issue. \u001d  Both financing options would carry a maturity of 12 years, Guitti said. \u001d  The $500 million would be used to fund a portion of the company's $2.35 billion MMX Minas-Rio project, which includes port facilities, development of the Minas mine, a slurry pipeline and a possible pellet plant. \u001d  Some $1.45 billion will be financed through the Brazilian National Development Bank, or BNDES.

This order is the first tranche of an option provided for within the original contract for 152 ELECTROSTAR cars announced on 31st August 2006. \b \bThe contract value is approximately 53 million euros ($72 million US) which includes vehicle manufacture and the first 7.5 years of a Train Services Agreement for the new vehicles which may extend for up to 30 years. The new vehicles will follow on from the production of the 152 cars, commencing in March 2009, with the last vehicle delivered in May 2010. \b \bThe 75mph Class 378 units are specially designed for suburban operations and are part of the proven and reliable ELECTROSTAR family of products. 1,614 ELECTROSTAR cars are already in daily passenger service with three UK operators, c2c, Southeastern and Southern Railways. \b \bThe new vehicles will be manufactured at Bombardier's production site at Derby and the servicing will be primarily delivered out of a new purpose-built maintenance facility situated at New Cross Gate in East London. \b \bCommenting on this announcement, Colin S Walton, Chief Country Representative UK said: \"Our award winning ELECTROSTAR trains are the most reliable new generation EMUs on the UK network and the similar Class 376 suburban vehicles have already proven themselves in the London area. The vehicle supply will be complimented by our excellent services provision, which has proved highly successful with other UK operators, winning a number of awards over the past year. This order will help secure employment for our highly specialized workforce at Derby.\" \b \bStephane Rambaud-Measson, President of Bombardier Transportation's Mainline Division, commented: \"This important additional order from TfL further demonstrates the benefits and flexibility of the ELECTROSTAR family of trains.

The company offset the negative impact through productivity gains in food activities and labor costs, Landel added. \u001d  Sodexho's core business of food and facilities management services posted 3.2% growth, or 7.4% growth on a like-for-like basis, to EUR9.91 billion as slower growth in Europe dragged on double-digit growth in the region the company calls 'rest of the world' which includes the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. \u001d  The strength of the mining sector in Latin America and Australia and high oil prices drove demand for Sodexho services in the Middle East and Africa, company executives said. \u001d  The fast-growing vouchers business grew 19% to EUR323 million from EUR273 million a year ago. \u001d  Sodexho's vouchers business, which includes gift vouchers and meal tickets, in large part sold to employers who distribute them to employees, was lifted by strong demand in Latin America and Asia. \u001d  The performance of the food services and facilities management division operations in Europe were weighed down by the Netherlands and Italy. \u001d  Stronger growth for this division came from central Europe, especially Spain. \u001d  Sales growth in the U.K. and Ireland was led by contracts in the healthcare sector, the company said. \u001d  At 1016 GMT, shares were up 0.7% or EUR0.39 at EUR54.33, against a slightly higher Paris market, giving the company a market capitalization of EUR8.6 billion. \b \u001d  -Company Web site: http://www.sodexho.com \b \u001d  By Mimosa Spencer, Dow Jones Newswires; +33 1 40 17 17 73; mimosa.spencer@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 06:20 ET (10:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c034e6acb62be8385a56d94967ec2a11","symR":["COPN.EB","IT0004167463"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Cosmo Pharmaceuticals: Positive Results For CB-01-11","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T05:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["COPN.EB","IT0004167463"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \u001d  LAINATE, Italy (Dow Jones)--Swiss-listed Italian company Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA (COPN.EB) Wednesday reported positive preliminary results from its phase II/III study with CB-01-11, or Rifamycin SV MMX, in infectious diarrhoea. \u001d  CB-01-11 is a broad spectrum, semi-synthetic antibiotic that is not absorbed when taken in tablet form. Through the use of Cosmo's MMX technology, which delivers the active ingredient into the colon, bacteria in the gastro intestinal tract that are important for vitamin synthesis are not sterilized. Given that it is practically not absorbed CB-01-11 is potentially applicable for the treatment of long term infections in the colon. \u001d  In the placebo controlled, randomized, double blind trial 120 patients in 8 sites in South Africa were treated with a 200mg tablet, 4 times per day for 3 days.  The trial assessed non-inferiority versus Normix, rifaximin, and the primary endpoint was the time from first ingestion of tablet to the last unformed stool. According to the preliminary reports CB-01-11 met this primary endpoint. \u001d  Mauro Ajani, CEO of Cosmo Pharmaceuticals, commented: \"We are very encouraged about these preliminary results since many of the needs of patients are not adequately met with products currently on the market.

Bolivia is Brazil's main supplier of natural gas. \u001d  According to Ferreira, investments in natural gas-fired projects will only be viable in five years after new reserves have been developed in the Santos basin off the southeast coast and if new finds are made in the Espirito Santo basin. \u001d  CPFL Energia is a holding company for three main business lines: CPFL Paulista, which manages regulated distribution assets, CPFL Geracao, which manages power plants, and the commercialization unit, CPFL Brasil, which sells power to the unregulated market of large-scale customers.

A weaker dollar and a weaker yen are both seen benefiting the U.S. and Japanese economies at a time when both aren't quite as robust as many have hoped. \u001d  And, as far as  domestic euro-zone policy is concerned, interest rates are pointed in the wrong direction. \u001d  As the latest purchasing managers' index for manufacturing industry showed Monday and the index for services industry is expected to show Wednesday, the euro-zone economy is going from strength to strength. \u001d  The manufacturing PMI rose to 55.6 last month instead of staying unchanged at 55.0 as expected. The index for services is forecast to stay at 58.3. \u001d  \"This will mark the fourth year of expansion in the services sector and the second year of expansion in the manufacturing sector,\" noted Mitul Kotecha, chief currency strategist with Calyon in London. \u001d  Other analysts are particularly impressed by the improvement in the labor market. \"The really encouraging news was that the employment index increased to 53.7 - the highest level since October 2000,\" noted Martin van Vliet, a senior euro-zone economist with ING Wholesale Banking in Amsterdam. \u001d  As a result, the ECB is widely expected to hike rates this September and possibly again before the end of the year - taking them up as high as 4.50% from 4.00% now. \u001d  This would certainly ensure that any attempts to push the currency lower would prove futile, especially in a market that continues to be driven largely by yield differentials. \u001d  But perhaps intervention talk at this stage looks even more irrelevant when taken in the context of the continued strength of euro-zone exports. \u001d  \"The ongoing health of the (export-oriented) manufacturing sector in the face of headwinds such as the stronger euro is a confirmation of the euro-zone's economic upturn,\" noted ING's van Vliet. \u001d  \"Despite the increase in official rhetoric about the negative impact of the stronger euro, the export (PMI) component actually strengthened further,\" said Calyon's Kotecha. \u001d  Analysts noted that there should also be little to hamper the euro's advance in terms of positioning. Recent data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange show that euro long positions were pared back to their lowest level this year during May. \u001d  \"The market is not long and will likely need to chase any rally this time round,\" noted the analysts at Barclays Capital. \u001d  Early Wednesday in Europe with the U.S. on holiday for Independence Day, the euro was able to extend its recent push higher - rising to $1.3627 by 0706 GMT from $1.3617 late Tuesday in New York, according to EBS. \u001d  However, the yen found support from a report that Moody's might lift its A2 rating on Japanese domestic debt. The euro was trading hardly changed at Y166.75 from Y166.70. \u001d  The dollar slipped back to Y122.38 from Y122.42 even though U.S. Treasury yields settled well over 5.0%, dispelling recent fears that they were about to fall below that level. \b \u001d  Bloomberg TNI FRX POV \b   Reuters   USD/DJ \b   Thomson   P/1066 or P/1074 \b \u001d  (Nick Hastings has covered the foreign exchange markets and industry for over 15 years.

And on that basis, we're looking to more of a euro-based activity,\" said Jim Dollive, chief financial officer of Kraft Foods said. \u001d  Dollive later confirmed again Kraft's intention to issue debt mainly in euros in the Euromarket. However, he stressed that the dynamics of how the company will issue the debt and the structure of the transaction are still to be finalized. \"We have got some time to put all that in place,\" Dollive said. \u001d  Moody's Investors Service Tuesday placed the Baa1 senior unsecured ratings of Kraft Foods Inc. and subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade following the announcement that it has bid to acquire the global biscuit business of Danone, and that it would fund the purchase primarily with debt. However, Moody's said that any downgrade is likely to leave Kraft with an investment grade rating. \u001d  Standard & Poor's also said it had revised its outlook on Kraft to negative from stable, while Fitch Ratings cut its rating on Kraft to three levels above speculative grade at BBB+ from A-. The agency also downgraded Kraft's senior unsecured debt and the company's existing credit facility to BBB+ from A- and placed the company on watch for another downgrade. S&P rates Kraft's senior unsecured debt at A-. \b \u001d  -By Kate Haywood, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0) 7842 9315; kathryn.haywood@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 05:32 ET (09:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c79bf2ca3ec4ba1be83501ac4b456508","symR":["ARI.LN","GB0002303468"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Arriva To Buy Veolia Danmark","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T08:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ARI.LN","GB0002303468"],"IndustryCodes":["TAT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 04:46 ET (08:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c7de4648b83b6c73ea3a20c2a70513ad","symR":["HCG.T","CA4369131079"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Home Capital Group Inc.

ITV1's advertising revenue declined on an overall basis by 9%, the company said, with overall advertising revenue down 5%. \u001d  The U.K.'s largest commercial terrestrial broadcaster by sales said the U.K.'s overall television advertising market had declined by 0.3% in the first six months of 2007 and was up 10% in July compared with July 2006, fueled by strong growth in telecoms and pharmaceutical advertising, up 7% and 11% respectively although retail, ITV's largest advertising category, was down by 4%. \u001d  ITV1's share of the total adult commercial audience in the first half of 2007 fell 4.7%, the company said, and was down 2.5% in multichannel television homes. \u001d  The company also warned that the U.K. cinema advertising market had continued to perform \"poorly\" and its Carlton Screen Advertising unit was expected to post a full year trading loss, \"adversely affected by falling revenues and onerous contractual commitments.\" \u001d  Revenue generated by Friends Reunited, the Internet company ITV acquired in 2005, was up by 25% compared with the same period in 2006, ITV said, without giving a revenue figure.Revenues from ITV Play, the company's interactive gaming channel, will be down by around 67% to GBP9 million in the first half. ITV Play earlier this year lost its designated channel slot shortly after the company suspended all interactive and premium rate services. \u001d  The company had earlier found it had incorrectly charged some viewers for using some premium rate services. \u001d  Societe Generale analyst Anthony de Larrinaga said the trading statement was broadly in line with market forecasts, although July trading was slightly ahead of expectations.

The merged entity has expanded its customer base, offering low fees for investment trusts and other products sold online. \u001d  But Monex Beans and other online brokerages are at a crossroads. Their margins have eroded as new firms entered the market, driving down commissions. In addition, start-up stock markets are slumping with individuals wary of risk. \u001d  The question is who will take over Nikko's stake in Monex Beans at a time of reorganization for online brokerages. If the stake is sold to a financial institution, the pace of the industry's realignment would accelerate.

Sell-side analysts, as history have shown, aren't necessarily that accurate in estimating a company's fair value, whether they use SOTP or another method. They're notoriously susceptible to influence from management's own earnings guidance. \u001d  SOTP has its weaknesses in that the references for valuing many European companies sometimes come from the U.S. where capital requirements, long-term growth potential, competitive and regulatory environments can be significantly different, undermining the value of the comparison. \u001d  And few sell-side analysts are quick to turn bearish when industry fundamentals deteriorate - there's an innate bullishness to the profession. \u001d  And by using a consensus estimate, C&W management risk benefiting - or missing out - on minority contrarian assessments of the company that turn out to be on the mark. \u001d  Another problem with C&W's LTCIP is that its payable in cash, which cuts across the goal of ensuring the executives are motivated by sustainable shareholder value creation. \u001d  An all-cash reward makes it hard to argue that the current cap of GBP20 million on individual executives' bonuses should be scrapped. \u001d  It would be better if a significant portion of this incentive plan, if not all of it, were paid in shares, stock options, or stock appreciation rights, with a lock-in period. That's how scores of U.S. companies today compensate senior management. \u001d  Dividend payouts and stock appreciation - to which the plan is linked - aren't always an indicator of smart management.  After all, that's also about how well positioned the company is to capture future growth - important for investors in C&W which operates in as competitive and fast-changing industry as telecommunications. \u001d  That said, Chairman Richard Lapthorne's new incentive plan - an unchanged salary of GBP386,000 but a new award of 5.5 million shares if the company makes the FTSE Global Telecoms Sector - is better for being tied to future C&W performance. \u001d  For a company whose shares used to trade at GBP15 in 2000, but now change hands at GBP2 - albeit twice the level of a year ago -  an improved management incentive program to boost value is welcome. But a stock plan would have been more shareholder friendly than a pure cash plan. \b \u001d  (Arindam Nag has covered business and finance for 16 years in Asia, Europe and the United States.

Ltd. (532312.BY) expects the acquisition of U.S.-based Modern Engineering, Inc. to hurt its profitability in the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2008, its managing director and chief executive officer said. \u001d  \"It (the Modern buy) is a drag on profitability. But it adds tremendous value in terms of domain expertise and adding customer base,\" Ravi Gopinath told Dow Jones Newswires in a recent interview. \u001d  Geometric bought a 95% stake in Modern Engineering for $23.75 million in October 2006. \u001d  Gopinath said there are \"high onsite costs\" linked with Modern. \"Plus there are training time and costs associated with gradual offshoring of Modern's operations.\" \u001d  Gopinath was referring to most of Modern's operations being handled from its own location in Detroit and Geometric being in the process of shifting some of these operations to its own low-cost sites in India. \u001d  He said the aim is to take revenue contribution from Modern's offshore operations to around 16% by the fiscal fourth quarter, from about 3%-5% now. \u001d  \"We expect the initial positive impact from the third quarter onward,\" he said. \u001d  Gopinath said the mid-sized company, which specializes in engineering software services, doesn't expect to expand operating margins in this fiscal year because of the Modern buy, but is likely to sustain it at 12%. \u001d  \"Our effort is to see no further dilution in operating margins as compared to what we had last year,\" Gopinath said. \u001d  The company's operating margins in fiscal year ended March 2006 was at 14.4%. \u001d  \"From next year onwards (starting April 1, 2008), as the offshoring starts to increase in volume, then we start driving margins northwards,\" he said. \u001d  Gopinath didn't give any specific earnings forecast for the current quarter ended June 30, but said: \"The Q1 results will on track with the guidance that we gave.\" \u001d  For the current fiscal, the company has forecast its net profit to grow 30%-35% on year and revenue to grow 50%. \u001d  The company had posted net profit of INR374.4 million on revenue of INR3.83 billion in the last fiscal year. \u001d  Gopinath expects revenue from its global engineering business to be around $125 million-$130 million in three years from around $33.2 million now. \u001d  Revenue from global engineering business currently accounts for about 39% of the company's total revenue. \b \u001d  Pricing Under Pressure \b \u001d  Gopinath said Geometric was currently facing a \"challenged\" pricing scenario in the U.S., its largest market, which contributes 63% to the company's total revenue. \u001d  \"The onsite rates in the industrial and automotive sector is under pressure because of huge labor supply,\" said Gopinath. \u001d  \"But we are only signing deals which are in line with our profitability guideline,\" he said. \u001d  He added that the company isn't seeing pressure in the \"higher end activity\" and in the product lifecycle management software services space. He didn't elaborate. \u001d  The company's offshore rates - at its own offices - ranges from $15 to $30 per person per hour, while onsite rates - at client sites - ranges from the high-$40s to mid-$70s per person per hour, Gopinath said. \u001d  Geometric is currently in the running for about 15 \"very high potential deals,\" with sizes varying from \"a quarter of a million dollars to $2 million,\" he said, adding that the sales cycle for the company is about six months. \u001d  To offset the effects of volatile pricing, Geometric is looking to improve the ratio of fixed price contracts vis-&#224;-vis dynamic pricing, he said. \u001d  \"When you are doing a fixed price project, you can execute the contracts at a higher degree of productivity and hence can create bottomline benefits,\" explained Gopinath. \u001d  He said that company's fixed price revenue ratio has already gone up to 15%-16% of total revenue in the latest fourth quarter from 6% a year earlier. \u001d  \"A year from now, revenue from fixed price contracts should be around 35%-40%,\" he added. \u001d  In order to deal with rising staff and real estate costs, the company is planning to diversify its workforce into different low-cost countries. \u001d  It is planning to scale up its staff strength at its engineering centers in China and Europe and is planning to set up such a center in Latin America. He didn't elaborate. \u001d  The company currently has about 2,700 employees and is planning to hire 800-1,000 more by the end of the current fiscal year, Gopinath said. \b   -By Romit Guha, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-9900181471; romit.guha@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Alpana Sarma \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 01:23 ET (05:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d1c3d6736db959d0afaba62b0897ab96","symR":["0005.HK","CPW.LN","HBC","HSBA.LN","PGC.LN","RBS.LN","S0354.MC","ES0114171038","GB0005405286","GB0007547838","GB0008787029","GB00B01JDH34"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Carphone Warehouse Eyeing Mkt, Bond Unlikely This Wk-Sources","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T14:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0005.HK","CPW.LN","HBC","HSBA.LN","PGC.LN","RBS.LN","S0354.MC","ES0114171038","GB0005405286","GB0007547838","GB0008787029","GB00B01JDH34"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","OTS","RTS","SOF","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XHSG","XISL","XNYA","XST5","ZFU"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Kate Haywood and Jessica Hodgson \u001d  Dow Jones Newswires \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Carphone Warehouse (CPW.LN) is unlikely to launch its planned sterling-denominated benchmark bond deal this week and the company is continuing to monitor conditions in the European credit markets with a view to proceeding with the transaction when they improve, people familiar with the situation said Wednesday. \u001d  \"We've made clear that we will tap the bond market at a time of our choosing.

Investor roadshows for the issue ended June 26 through lead managers Barclays Capital, HSBC and The Royal Bank Of Scotland. The bond was expected to price after the roadshows finished, subject to market conditions. \u001d  One person familiar with the transaction said that while book building for the transaction was now unlikely to take place this week, it could go ahead next week if the market backdrop improves sufficiently. \u001d  \"If there is a dramatic improvement in the market on Thursday, then this is a transaction which could move pretty quickly.

ProLogis International (PLD), the world's largest owner, manager and developer of distribution facilities, is also waiting to see whether market conditions improve before launching its 10-year, euro-denominated, benchmark bond issue through lead managers ABN AMRO and Banc of America Securities, a person familiar with the transaction said. \u001d  Conversely, Barry Callebaut (BARN.EB), the Swiss maker of cocoa, chocolate and confectionary, is pushing ahead with its EUR350 million 10-year bond offering.

The altered form of AKT1 appears to cause tumor cell proliferation and may play a role in making cells resistant to certain types of therapies. The findings are reported in an advance online publication (AOP) of the journal Nature. \b \u001d  The PI3-Kinase/AKT pathway is among the most commonly activated cellular pathways in human cancers and members of this pathway are among the most frequently targeted for new cancer drug discovery efforts. Activation of this pathway results in cancer cell growth and cell survival.  Although AKT1 is central to pathway activation, its role in cancer has been that of an intermediary between mutated upstream regulatory proteins and downstream survival signaling proteins. This is the first evidence of direct mutation of AKT1 in human cancer tumors: it was discovered in clinical samples from cancer patients, yet has never been detected in cancer cell lines. \b \u001d  \"This discovery is a seminal finding in cancer biology that confirms AKT1 as an oncogene in breast, colorectal and ovarian cancer.  The mutation alters the electrostatics of binding pocket in the pleckstrin homology domain, the portion of the enzyme that docks with phospholipids on the cell membrane,\" said Kerry L. Blanchard, PhD, MD, Executive Director, Discovery Biology Research, Eli Lilly & Company. \b \u001d  To identify the AKT1 mutation, the researchers analyzed 150 tumor samples from patients with either breast, colorectal or ovarian cancer (50 samples from each tumor type). Analysis of the data showed that 8 percent of breast, 6 percent of colorectal and 2 percent of ovarian tumors had the AKT1 mutation in the samples that were screened in their study. \b \u001d  \"Recently, molecular features such as the AKT1 mutation are beginning to change drug development efforts. This discovery adds to the short but growing list of molecular features that may help guide both current and future cancer drug development,\" said John Carpten, PhD, Senior Investigator and Director of TGen's Integrated Cancer Genomics Division and the study's lead author. \"The next step is to determine the prevalence of the AKT1 mutation in different populations and, hopefully, use the information gained to stratify patients going into clinical trials for AKT inhibitors.\" \b \u001d  If validated by further studies, the identification of this recurring mutation has the potential to impact cancer treatment and drug development. \b \u001d  \"This is a gorgeous study that used a variety of sophisticated techniques to provide new insights into the tumorigenic process,\" said Bert Vogelstein, MD, Director of the Ludwig Center for Cancer Genetics & Therapeutics at The Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. \b \u001d  James E. Thomas, PhD, of Lilly's Cancer Discovery Research division, ex- plained, \"AKT1 is a protein kinase or enzyme that plays a key role in activating survival, proliferation and metabolic pathways. Interestingly, other cellular proteins that regulate this network have also been shown to be mutated in a variety of cancers including lung, breast ovary, prostate, colorectal and brain cancers. This mutation in AKT1 is striking direct evidence for the role of AKT1 in cancer formation.\" \b \u001d  The identification of the AKT1 mutation was a collaborative effort between Eli Lilly & Company and TGen. \"This discovery demonstrates the importance of studying the genetic make up of cancers at the clinical level rather than re- lying on model systems,\" adds Jeffrey Trent, PhD, Scientific Director of TGen. \b \u001d  \"This is a key study highlighting Lilly's commitment to translational re- search approaches in cancer drug discovery and development. Furthermore, this work is a great example of a successful public-private partnership at a global level that involves Lilly Research Laboratories in Indianapolis, TGen in Phoenix, Lilly Singapore Centre for Drug Discovery, and the Economic Development Board of Singapore,\" adds Richard Gaynor, MD, Vice President of Oncology Discovery at Eli Lilly & Company. He added, \"This mutation further validates AKT1 as an attractive drug target, and it also will be a valuable tool for the stratification of patients for targeted therapies. This paradigm of identifying specific defects in cancer cells to successfully develop innovative therapies has been validated with oncology drugs such as Gleevec in leukemia and Herceptin in breast cancer.\" \b \b    About Lilly \b \u001d  Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing portfolio of first-in-class and best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with eminent scientific organizations.

This is crucial for the company, which is under pressure from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other investors to quickly turn itself around. \u001d  The Osaka-based electronics maker will expand production lines at two of its plants in Japan to raise output of lithium-ion rechargeable batteries to 70 million a month from 60 million this business year ending in March, a company spokesman said. \u001d  Sanyo plans to build a new rechargeable battery plant in Japan in fiscal 2008, but it hasn't picked a site for the factory yet, he said. \u001d  Despite recalls of its lithium-ion laptop batteries earlier this year, Sanyo is betting the business will power its reform drive. \u001d  Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in portable consumer electronics because they are lightweight and hold charge well when not in use. Demand for the batteries has been strong and is expected to increase. \u001d  The global market for the round batteries used in laptop computers and some digital cameras is expected to shoot up 10% this year to Y157 billion, after a 16% rise last year, according to Japan market research firm Fuji Kezai Co. \u001d  Sanyo is in the midst of a major restructuring that has included job cuts, factory closings and exits from unprofitable businesses. Last year the company received a Y300 billion bailout from Goldman and other investors. \u001d  In March, Lenovo Group Ltd., the Chinese computer maker that bought IBM's PC business, said it was recalling 205,000 lithium-ion laptop batteries made by Sanyo because they could overheat after being struck at a certain angle. \b \u001d  -By Kazuhiro Shimamura, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; kazuhiro.shimamura@dowjones.com \u001d  (Hiroyuki Kachi contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 05:45 ET (09:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d5842b3c6fdc4fbc0902710e0f1ab895","symR":["12040.FR","HLT","IHG","IHG.LN","MLC.LN","NHH.MC","NHHEY","SOL.MC","WTB.LN","ES0161560018","ES0176252718","FR0000120404","GB0005622542","GB00B1KJJ408","GB00B1WQCS47"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Europe's Hotel Stocks Rise On Hilton Buyout","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T08:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12040.FR","HLT","IHG","IHG.LN","MLC.LN","NHH.MC","NHHEY","SOL.MC","WTB.LN","ES0161560018","ES0176252718","FR0000120404","GB0005622542","GB00B1KJJ408","GB00B1WQCS47"],"IndustryCodes":["LOD","RES","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XFT1","XIBEX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Michael Carolan \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Hotel stocks across Europe were higher Wednesday as investors reacted to news of Blackstone's $26 billion bid for U.S. hotel giant Hilton Hotels Corporation (HLT). \u001d  In the sector's largest ever buyout, the board of Hilton Hotels agreed Tuesday to be acquired by Blackstone for $18.5 billion in cash plus the assumption of $7.5 billion in debt.    The deal had an immediate knock-on effect in Europe as positive sentiment returned to the sector and investors began looking for the next takeover target. \u001d  In a slightly higher London market, Intercontinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG) shares rose 66 pence, or 5.2%, to 1323 pence, Whitbread PLC (WTB.LN) rose 95 pence, or 5.4%, to 1848 pence, Millennium & Copthorne PLC (MLC.LN) rose 32 pence, or 4.8%, to 684 pence. In Paris, Accor SA (12040.FR) shares were up 7.1% at EUR69.5 while in Madrid, shares of both NH Hoteles S.A. (NHH.MC) and Sol Melia S.A. (SOL.MC) were higher. \u001d  Teather & Greenwood's Mark Reed said the Hilton deal wouldn't necessarily increase the likelihood of further deals in the hotel sector, but it would certainly boost confidence. \u001d  The price of the Hilton deal represents a premium of 40%over Monday's closing stock price. \u001d  Numis Securities' Richard Carter said the sector is at a point in the cycle where deals which seemed unthinkable 12 months ago are now happening apace. Carter expects Whitbread to come under pressure to spin off its Costa Coffee unit and adopt a more innovative property ownership structure. \u001d  Bridgewell's Kate Pettem says that the read-across to Whitbread (WTB.LN) is not directly comparable, as most of Hilton's earnings come from franchised operations. Whitbread runs the U.K. budget hotel chain Premier Inn. \u001d  \"It does give us comfort though, that a hot market for hotel deals has not diminished, and apparently high multiples are still being paid,\" she said. \u001d  One analyst said investor focus would now naturally shift to Intercontinental Hotels. \u001d  IHG's strong position in emerging markets - especially China - and its GBP1 billion worth of property assets make it an obvious target for private equity. \u001d  Accor SA (12040.FR), meanwhile, has its own private equity interest to deal with. Colony Capital Tuesday said it had raised its stake in the French hotels group to 10.3% after converting EUR500 million in bonds to shares. \u001d  Colony Capital invested EUR1 billion in Accor debt in May 2005, comprising EUR500 million in exchangeable bonds and EUR500 million in convertible bonds. \u001d  The private equity firm pushed the hotels group to change its management and strategy, shedding non-core assets and restructuring its real-estate portfolio. \u001d  Analysts said the stake increase does not change Accor's valuation. \u001d  \"We believe that Colony, in the recent interest rate environment, is increasing its exposure to equity markets,\" said Matthias Desmarais, analyst with Societe Generale. \b \u001d  Company Web sites: http://ichotelsgroup.com \u001d                     http://www.whitbread.co.uk \u001d  -By Michael Carolan, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9278; michael.carolan@dowjones.com \u001d  (Mimosa Spencer in Paris contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 04:25 ET (08:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d5b955055bfb575cb0dac75d3bf08628","symR":["EML.AE","NL0000345692"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Endemol 1Q 07 Sales EUR341.9M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T06:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EML.AE","NL0000345692"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","MOV","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 02:07 ET (06:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d661d9c5b67ffcbdad8d3fe0772f787a","symR":["UKDAY","UKDAY"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EUROPEAN MORNING BRIEFING: Stocks Flat Ahead Of Meetings","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T05:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\bDJIA       13577.30  +41.87  +0.31% \bNasdaq        2644.95  +12.65  +0.48% \bS&P 500       1524.87   +5.44  +0.36% \bFTSE 100      6639.80  +49.20  +0.75% \bXetra DAX     8050.68  +92.44  +1.16% \bCAC40         6069.84  +42.89  +0.71% \bAbove are closing prices \b \bNikkei 225   18178.68  +28.78  +0.20% \bHang Seng    22114.88  +63.74  +0.30% \bS&P/ASX 200   6330.50   -3.30  -0.11% \bTaiwan Index  9070.97  +74.77  +0.80% \bS.Korea Kospi 1834.22  +28.72  +1.60% \bDow Future    Closed \bNASDAQ Future Closed \bS&P Future    Closed \bAbove are as of 0450 GMT \b \bUSD/JPY      122.41-44    +0.02% \bRange        122.51  - 122.23 \bEUR/USD      1.3615-18    +0.01% \bRange        1.3617  - 1.3607 \bAUD/USD      0.8572-75   +0.34% \bRange        0.8577  - 0.8545 \bGBP/USD      2.0174-79    +0.02% \bRange        2.0184  - 2.0159 \bUSD/CHF      1.2149-51    -0.06% \bRange        1.2163  -  1.2149 \bAbove are as of 0450 GMT vs NY close \b \bUSD/JPY Vol Option Contract 7.00%/7.30% \bEUR/USD Vol Option Contract 5.05%/5.20% \bAUD/USD Vol Option Contract 7.65%/7.90% \bGBP/USD Vol Option Contract 5.10%/5.30% \bUSD/CHF Vol Option Contract 5.40%/5.70% \bAbove are 1-Mo prices as of 0400 GMT \b \b2Y Tsy  99 31/32  -2/32  4.89% +3.3 \b5Y Tsy  99 23/32  -6/32  4.94% +4.1 \b10Y Tsy 95 27/32 -10/32  5.04% +4.3 \b10Y JGB 1.9100% +0.0300 \bClosing Treasury prices vs prior NY close; JGB as of 0400 GMT \b \bAsian Spot Gold $653.15  +$0.15 +0.02% \bComex Gold      $656.10  +$0.70  +0.1% \bBrent Crude Oil  $72.77  -$0.16  -0.2% \bAbove are as of 0400 GMT vs NY close \b \u001d  EUROPEAN OUTLOOK & US/ASIAN SUMMARIES: \u001d  European stock markets are likely to open little changed with the U.S. closed for a holiday. Government debt is under slight pressure, the euro and oil are on the defensive and gold is slightly higher. \u001d  STOCKS: \u001d  European shares are pegged to open largely flat, as investors sit tight ahead of the central bank meetings Thursday. \u001d  Spreadbettor Cantor Index is calling the FTSE up 1 point at 6641, the DAX down 6 at 8045, the CAC unchanged at 6070 and Eurostoxx off 2 at 4353. \u001d  U.S. stocks ended higher in a holiday-shortened session Tuesday, helped by news that Apple could see higher-than-expected profit margins from its iPhone and data showing a rise in factory orders. Wall Street is closed for a holiday Wednesday. \u001d  Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke LLC, said investors shouldn't breathe a sigh of relief just yet. \"In general, volatility levels have been rising over the last couple of weeks. You're likely to see a pickup in volatility in the third quarter,\" Sheldon said. \u001d  In deal news, Hilton Hotels agreed to be acquired by Blackstone for $18.5 billion in cash plus the assumption of $7.5 billion in debt. \u001d  Buyout firm KKR filed to raise $1.25 billion in an initial public offering, following in the footsteps of arch rival Blackstone Group. \u001d  In Asia, Japan's market edged up but held steady in a confined range. \u001d  The Australian market was largely flat, having failed to sustain an early rise on the back of gains on Wall Street and by BHP Billiton. \u001d  \"I just think there's a lack of any catalysts at the moment,\" said David Halliday, associate director at Macquarie Private Wealth. \"BHP and Rio are strong and there are plenty of reasons to buy them, but outside of that it becomes a bit difficult. So in the absence of any macro catalysts, the market is probably going to range trade.\" \u001d  FOREX: \u001d  The euro is on the defensive Wednesday against the dollar and yen after Moody's placed Japan's A2 government rating on review for upgrade, says a trader at a Tokyo securities company. \u001d  Against the dollar, the euro is expected to hold in a narrow range amid expectations for U.S. and euro zone interest rates to rise. \u001d  On Tuesday, the euro was little changed. The dollar on Tuesday showed \"some stability after losing much ground (Monday) on global interest rate considerations,\" said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Bank. \"The markets are awaiting interest rate announcements from the Bank of England and European Central Bank...as well as the U.S. employment numbers.\" \u001d  BONDS: \u001d  European government bonds are expected to start under slight pressure, after they traded lower Tuesday because of stronger equity markets and weakness in euro/dollar exchange rates. \u001d  A general feeling of confidence in the U.S. economy are keeping bond prices from skyrocketing, analysts said. \u001d  \"Only if this confidence is undermined again will the bulls gain the upper hand,\" analysts at Commerzbank said in a research note. \"Until then, the bears may annoy them for some time yet.\" \u001d  Jason Simpson, an analyst at ABN AMRO, said he still sees room for a market bounce as fears about subprime markets weaken equity sales and terrorism fears promote safe haven flows. The recent selloff may have run too far, indicating a need for a move in the opposite direction, he said. \u001d  Finally, technical factors could point to a rebound, especially when the euro area has EUR14.5 billion in coupons and EUR28.9 billion in redemption payments due this week and only EUR11.5 billion in new issuance to soak up liquidity, Simpson said. \u001d  U.S. Treasury prices closed lower Tuesday, with stock gains and stronger-than-anticipated factory orders counteracting anemic housing data and concerns about potential terrorist activity. The bond market is closed Wednesday in observance of a U.S. holiday. \u001d  Broad gains chalked up by stocks overseas and on Wall Street contributed to decreased demand for government bonds. The market did draw some support from ongoing worries about subprime mortgage loans and possible terrorist activity. \"Continued credit and event risk fears are ... keeping a bid in the Treasury market,\" wrote analysts at Action Economics. \u001d  In Japan, prices of government bonds fell on worries that the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates. \u001d  ENERGY: \u001d  Oil prices retreated Wednesday amid quiet trading and light profit taking after crude futures in New York rose to a new 10-month high Tuesday. August Nymex dropped 20 cents to $71.21 a barrel. The contract rose 32 cents to settle at $71.41 a barrel Tuesday. \u001d  METALS: \u001d  Spot gold was up 15 cents at $653.15/oz in Asia on expectations that the metal will rise to $700 later this year because of strong demand. \u001d  LME 3-month copper hit a 7-week high at $7,800/ton, up $80, as shorts moved to cover, said a Hong Kong-based LME broker. \u001d  CALENDAR: \bWednesday, July 4, 2007 \bGMT                                                         Expected Previous \b0700  UK   Jun     House Price Index                        +0.4%MM   +0.3%MM \b                                                            +10.8%YY +10.6%YY \b0745  ITA  Jun     Italy NTC / ADACI PMI Svcs               56.9      56.5 \b0750  FRA  Jun     France NTC / CDAF PMI Svcs               58.5      57.9 \b0755  GER  Jun     Germany NTC / BME PMI Svcs               58.0      57.5 \b0800  EU   Jun     RBS / NTC Euro-zone PMI Svcs              58.3      58.3 \b0830  UK   Q1      BoE Quarterly Mortgage Equity            GBP15.0B GBP14.6B \b0830  UK   Jun     CIPS PMI Svcs                               57.2      57.2 \b0900  EU   May     Retail trade                             -0.3%MM   +0.2%MM \b                                                            +1.0%YY   +1.6%YY \b0900  GER          Reopening of 10-Yr Bond Issue \b0930  UK   Jun     Shop Price Index \bN/A   UK   Jul     BoE Monetary Policy Committee meeting with \b                   interest rates decision Thursday \bN/A   US           Fourth of July holiday; all markets \b                   closed \u001d  -By Dennis Baker; Dow Jones Newswires; dennis.baker@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 01:00 ET (05:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d6d139295119aef6cf74350bab9d86fd","symR":["5801.TO","MS","JP3827200001"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"India Govt OKs $465 Mln Invest Plan By Morgan Stanley","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T10:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5801.TO","MS","JP3827200001"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","SCR","X225","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  NEW DELHI (Dow Jones)--The Indian government Wednesday said it has approved 10 foreign direct investment proposals totaling INR23.39 billion ($577.82 million), including a plan by the Mauritius unit of Morgan Stanley (MS) to invest $465 million in its local subsidiary. \u001d  The Foreign Investment Promotion Board has approved Morgan Stanley Mauritius Co.

(\"Genesis\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the acquisition of a 617 acre land parcel adjacent to the hamlet of Delacour, northeast of Calgary and within 10 minutes of driving time from the Calgary International Airport, for a total purchase price of $31,385,500 ($50,868 per acre). A large portion of the land parcel (approximately 306 acres) has area structure plan approval from the Municipal District of Rockyview while the remaining land is directly adjacent to the approved lands. The total combined lands when developed are anticipated to yield approximately 2,500 single-family lots with additional multi-family development. Development of the lands is targeted to commence by 2009. To finance the acquisition, Genesis has launched a Limited Partnership offering that will be sold as a \"Prospectus Exempt\" security using the regulations set forth in National Instrument (NI) - 45-106, using either the \"Offering Memorandum\" or \"Accredited Investor\" exemptions across most provinces in Canada. A copy of the offering documents can be obtained by contacting Genesis directly. \b \bMr. Gobi Singh, President and CEO of Genesis, had the following comment, \"We are excited to be able to secure additional land inventory (Genesis presently has 13,000 multi-family units, 12,000 single-family lots and one million sq. ft. of commercial space in its undeveloped inventory) in the Calgary metropolitan area. This transaction is of significant size and will contribute in augmenting our lot and residential housing production while allowing the Company to plan a comprehensive future development incorporating single-family residential, multi-family residential and commercial components.\" \b \bFor the three months ended June 30, 2007, Genesis closed a total of 52 lot sales to external home builders and 35 single-family home sales. Through the first six months of 2007, Genesis has closed a total of 114 lot sales to external home builders and 73 single-family home sales. The production levels over the last six months of 2007 are anticipated to increase from the levels achieved in the first six months of the year and the Company is on track to meet its targeted levels of 180 single-family home sales and 350 - 400 external lot sales in 2007. \b \bGenesis Land Development Corp. is a Calgary based land development company with an inventory of more than 24,000 future residential building sites (single-family and multi-family) and over 300 acres of commercial/ industrial lands in Western Canada, of which more than 13,000 residential lots and over 300 acres of commercial/industrial lands are located in the Calgary metropolitan area. \b \bCertain statements in this news release could constitute forward-looking statements.

Some carriers have reported some softness in the intra European market owing partly to higher interest rates and increased ticket taxes, while the weaker dollar is hitting the flow of passengers into Europe from the U.S. \u001d  BA said passenger traffic - measured in revenue passenger kilometers which factor in how far people are flown - declined 1.4% with premium traffic up 1.4% and non-premium down 1.9%. Actual passenger numbers fell 2.5% to just over three million. The growth in premium traffic is positive for BA as it makes much of its profits from big-spending first- and business-class passengers. \u001d  The London-based carrier said market conditions remain broadly unchanged and it is too early to assess how the latest security measures at British airports might hit forward bookings. It said weakness in the U.S. dollar to sterling isn't helpful for revenue but is having a positive impact on costs. \u001d  Dublin-based Ryanair, the fast expanding Irish budget airline, meanwhile reported an 18% rise in seats sold to 3.67 million. The company is taking delivery of a net 30 new planes this year and has indicated that it may have to discount its fares this summer to fill its planes amid tough competition. \u001d  By 1336 GMT BA shares were up 3.8%, or 16 pence, at 434 pence with Ryanair up 2.2%, or 11 euro cents, at EUR5.20 in Dublin. \b \b   Company Web sites: http://www.ba.com \b                      http://www.ryanair.com \b \b   -By Rod Stone, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 9295; rod.stone@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 09:59 ET (13:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e85ff59c3b790edb00c5a0985437539d","symR":["SEO","STEAV.HE","FI0009005953","FI0009005961"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Stora Enso Upgrades Board Quality At Its Imatra Mills","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T12:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SEO","STEAV.HE","FI0009005953","FI0009005961"],"IndustryCodes":["PAP","XDJGI","XHEX","XNYA","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Edited Press Release \b \u001d  STOCKHOLM (Dow Jones)--Stora Enso Wednesday said it is investing EUR15 million to upgrade board manufacturing at its Imatra mills in Finland to meet customers' developing quality requirements. \u001d  The project is scheduled to start in July 2007 and be completed in September 2008. \u001d  As a consequence of this quality-driven investment, the annual production capacity of board machine 5 will increase from 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of liquid packaging board. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 08:07 ET (12:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e875b7ea6a8f1d6ef4f0f3391e94924c","symR":["OMX.SK","SE0000110165"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": OMX Nordic Exchange Stockholm Will Not Take Any Actions against Racon Holding AB","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T15:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OMX.SK","SE0000110165"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XHEX","XSXA"],"Story":"\bSTOCKHOLM, Sweden--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 04, 2007-- \u001d  On June 12th, 2007, four institutional investors filed a complaint to the Nordic Exchange about Racon Holding AB contravening with the exchange's takeover rules in connection to the public bid to acquire Invik & Co AB.

(\"Elbit Systems\") (NASDAQ: ESLT) announced it was advised that a claim was filed by certain minority shareholders of ImageSat International N.V. (\"ImageSat\"). The claim was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against ImageSat, Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. (\"IAI\"), Elbit Systems and certain current and former officers and directors of ImageSat. ImageSat's largest shareholder is IAI, holding approximately 46% of ImageSat's issued share capital. A subsidiary of Elbit Systems holds approximately 14% (7% on a fully diluted basis) of ImageSat's issued share capital and is entitled to nominate one director to ImageSat's board. The former and current directors of ImageSat named as defendants include, among others, Michael Federmann, Joseph Ackerman and Joseph Gaspar, Elbit Systems Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. \b \u001d  ImageSat is engaged in the operation of satellites and in providing satellite imagery. The claim contains various allegations that the defendants allegedly breached their fiduciary and/or contractual obligations to the detriment of the plaintiffs, who are certain of ImageSat's minority shareholders. The claim alleges various causes of action and damages aggregating hundreds of millions of dollars, not all of which are alleged against Elbit Systems and/or each of the former or current ImageSat directors. \b \u001d  Based upon a preliminary review of the claim, Elbit Systems believes that there is no merit to the allegations made against it or the current or former ImageSat directors who were nominated by Elbit Systems' subsidiary. Elbit Systems views the claims against it as baseless and will vigorously defend against them. Moreover, Elbit Systems believes that the nature of the alleged claims provides a basis for counterclaims by Elbit Systems against the plaintiffs. \b \b    About Elbit Systems \b \u001d  Elbit Systems Ltd. is an international defense electronics company engaged in a wide range of defense-related programs throughout the world.

(MRK) after the company rejected sharp price reductions demanded by Brazil. \u001d  A compulsory license allows a country to manufacture or buy generic versions of patented drugs while paying the patent holder only a small royalty. \u001d  It was the first time Brazil overrode a patent of an anti-AIDS drug, after having threatened to do so for many years. \u001d  \"The signing of this agreement symbolizes what can be achieved when governments and companies negotiate with the interests of patients in mind,\" Heather Mason, vice president of Latin American and Canada Operations at Abbott, said in a company release Wednesday. \u001d  \"It makes it easier for the government of Brazil to afford medicine that a growing number of its people will need.\" \u001d  Brazil's Health Ministry estimates that currently 600,000 people live with HIV in Brazil. Kaletra, a protease inhibitor, is one of the most commonly used anti-AIDS drugs in Brazil. \u001d  The price reduction of Kaletra will result in savings of about $10 million for the Brazilian government, Abbott said. \b \u001d  -By Bernd Radowitz, Dow Jones Newswires; +5521-2553-7322; bernd.radowitz@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 16:20 ET (20:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f6732f0db45118e147d7809bfc92f3d7","symR":["532868.BY","DLF.ZZ","INE271C01023"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Symbol for DLF Ltd.

Patrick and Jason Singer \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) has approached several private equity funds involved in bidding for Cadbury Schweppes PLC's (CSG) U.S. drinks business about buying Cadbury's Snapple iced tea brand, according to people familiar with the situation. \u001d  If successful, such a purchase could significantly expand Coke's range of non-soda drinks, a key priority for the company which wants to increase its presence in the fast-growing market for healthy drinks, juices and waters. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal's Web site, WSJ.com) \u001d  Speaking in Geneva Wednesday, Coke Chief Executive E. Neville Isdell told a Reuters reporter that the company was evaluating a bid for Snapple. \"That is a valuation that we undertake - whether it (Snapple) is of interest to us, or whether we can do it on our own,\" he said, according to Reuters. \u001d  A Coke spokesman in Atlanta confirmed Isdell's comments and declined to comment further. \u001d  Two groups of private-equity firms have lodged bids to buy Cadbury's drinks business. The two groups of private equity firms have already heard presentations from Cadbury management and their second-round bids are due by next week, a person close to the matter said. A decision is expected by the end of July. \u001d  The sale of the U.S.-based drinks business is expected to bring in more than $10 billion for Cadbury, which said it would shed the business in March after activist investor Nelson Peltz purchased a stake in the company. \u001d  Peltz bought Snapple in 1997 for $300 million and sold it, along with some other brands, three years later to Cadbury for $1.45 billion. \u001d  London-based Cadbury said in March it split in two, separating its U.S. drinks business - which includes Dr. Pepper, 7 Up and Snapple among other brands - from its candy business which includes Trident gum and Cadbury dairy milk chocolate and others. \u001d  A person familiar with the situation said Coke hasn't approached Cadbury about buying Snapple, and Cadbury had no plans to sell the brand separately from the rest of its drinks business. \u001d  But Coke has had talks with some of the private equity firms bidding for the drinks unit about buying Snapple from them, according to people familiar with the situation. The private equity firms aren't leaning toward a pre-sale, but given recent market wobbles, if such a deal would make a purchase easier and comes at an attractive price, they would consider it. \u001d  For Coke, Snapple would be the latest in its drive to broaden its drinks portfolio. In May, Atlanta-based Coke agreed to pay $4.1 billion for Energy Brands Inc., which makes vitamin-enhanced water, in the strongest sign yet of its intention to grow its business outside its core soda brands. It was the largest deal in Coke's history. \b \u001d  -By Aaron O.

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP)--U.K. reporter Alan Johnston, looking pale and tired, was released Wednesday after nearly four months in captivity in the Gaza Strip and said it was \"fantastic\" to be free after an \"appalling\" ordeal. \u001d  The British Broadcasting Corp. correspondent said his captors threatened his life a number of times in various ways but were rarely violent, although they hit him in the final moments before he was released. They kept him in solitary confinement throughout his captivity and at one point, chained his hands and ankles for a 24-hour period. He also said he got sick from the food. \u001d  \"It is just the most fantastic thing to be free,\" Johnston said in a telephone interview with the BBC hours after he was freed. \"It was an appalling experience, as you can imagine, 16 weeks kidnapped, sometimes, occasionally, quite terrifying and frightening,\" he said, speaking from the Gaza home of deposed Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh. \u001d  Shortly afterward, Johnston set off in a convoy for Jerusalem in the company of U.K. diplomats, a U.K. consular official said. \u001d  As recently as last week, Johnston's life appeared to be in serious peril when the group holding him posted a video on a militant Web site in which the journalist appeared to be wearing an explosives belt that he said his captors would detonate it if there were an attempt to free him. \u001d  While he was in captivity, a civil war raged on the streets of Gaza around him and Israel was bombarding Palestinian militants with airstrikes. \u001d  \"It became almost hard to imagine normal life again,\" Johnston told the BBC in a steady and composed voice. \"And I literally dreamt many many times of being free and always woke up back in that room and now it really is over and it is indescribably good to be out,\" he said. \u001d  \"I didn't know where it was going to end,\" he said. \"I think I'm OK after an extraordinary level of stress and psychological pressure for a long, long time ... I probably got out of it as well as I could have.\" \u001d  He said he had a radio throughout most of his captivity and was able to follow the support and interest in his case, which was \"a huge psychological boost.\" \u001d  Johnston was kidnapped by a shadowy, little-known group known as the Army of Islam from a Gaza City street on March 12 and held far longer than any other foreign reporter in Gaza. \u001d  After his release, he was taken to the home of Haniyeh in Gaza City's Shati refugee camp. Before entering, Johnston told an Associated Press reporter, \"I'm OK, really, I'm OK.\" \u001d  Television footage showed him sitting beside Haniyeh and surrounded by other Hamas officials. He thanked Haniyeh and Hamas. \u001d  The BBC also reported Johnston had spoken to his father since his release. \u001d  Asked by Al-Jazeera television whether he would return to Gaza, which he had covered for three years, Johnston said: \"After many months of kidnapping, I think I need a break.\" \u001d  Television footage showed Johnston emerging from a building in Gaza surrounded by a throng of armed Palestinian men and escorted into a waiting car while cameras flashed around him. \u001d  There was no immediate comment from Johnston's former captors. \u001d  Hamas had demanded Johnston's freedom since it violently seized control of Gaza last month, in an apparent bid to curry favor with the West. \u001d  But a senior Hamas leader, Mahmoud Zahar, denied that Hamas acted in an effort to improve its relations with the West, which is boycotting the Islamic group over its violently anti-Israel ideology. \u001d  \"We didn't work to receive favors from the British government. We did this because of humanitarian concern, and to achieve a government aim to extend security to all without fear,\" Zahar said. \u001d  On Tuesday, Hamas gunmen took positions around the Army of Islam's stronghold, stepping up the pressure to secure his release. Hamas officials said they were tightening the siege on Johnston's kidnappers and would spare no efforts to free him. \u001d  Still it was not immediately clear why Johnston's captors chose to release him at this time or under what specific terms he was freed, but Hamas said there would be no crackdown on the Army of Islam. \u001d  Ayman Taha, a Hamas spokesman, said Johnston's captors had responded positively to recent efforts by tribal and religious leaders to end Johnston's ordeal. Taha said the Army of Islam would not be dismantled or disarmed in return for freeing the reporter. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 00:43 ET (04:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fd8ad248ce1d046a5eb6ba95e97c22b4","symR":["ENTU"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Entrust Targeting 2H 2007 Rev Of $55M, Loss Of 2c/Shr","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T19:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ENTU"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 15:02 ET (19:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fda0068127be5413634f97065b90bf80","symR":["ESLT","ESLT.TV","IL0010811243"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Elbit Systems: Claim Filed By Minority Shareholders Of ImageSat International>ESLT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T14:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ESLT","ESLT.TV","IL0010811243"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","DFN","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 10:25 ET (14:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fdca466fdb1f1e8bc58846a63a2042c8","symR":["ITV.LN","GB0033986497"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ITV: ITV1 Performance Begins To Stabilise","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T08:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ITV.LN","GB0033986497"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 04:37 ET (08:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fdd84d70a8bfc56f1485f50600d55d52","symR":["GALP.LB","PBR","PETR4.BR","BRPETRACNPR6","PTGAL0AM0009","GALP.LB","PBR","PETR4.BR","BRPETRACNPR6","PTGAL0AM0009"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Portugal Galp Signs Biofuels Pact With Brazil Petrobras","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T15:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GALP.LB","PBR","PETR4.BR","BRPETRACNPR6","PTGAL0AM0009"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI","XNYA","XP20"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 11:34 ET (15:34 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fdf9a062abe82ce6ddb7fcc1ec0e9f8a","symR":["NSU.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006757008","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Audi 1H China, Hong Kong Deliveries +27% On Yr At 49,267 Cars","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T08:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NSU.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006757008","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Audi AG (NSU.XE) said Wednesday that deliveries in China, including Hong Kong, rose 27% on the year in the first six months to 49,267 cars from 38,838 in 2006, adding that the company expects \"continued growth\" in the second half of the year. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 04:03 ET (08:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"fef43133ed86beca9ff8cc668ae99a23","symR":["2382.HK","KYG8586D1097"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"HK Bourse: Announcement From HK Sunny Optical","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T06:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["2382.HK","KYG8586D1097"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \b    For full details, please click on the following link: \b \bhttp://main.ednews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/20070704/LTN20070704098.HTM \b \bSource: Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing \b \b \u001d  Corrected July 4, 2007 02:21 ET (06:21 GMT)\u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 04, 2007 02:06 ET (06:06 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"ff4c8c5269d018f619de4bb99b6b6eb3","symR":["NSU.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006757008","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-07-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Audi 1H China, Hong Kong Deliveries +27% At 49,267 Cars -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-04T08:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NSU.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006757008","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Audi said it delivered 45,571 locally produced cars to customers in China in the first six months, up 23% on the year.
