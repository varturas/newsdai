Sears \u001d  Mythology often shapes, and reshapes, Wall Street's perceptions. Companies and chief executives become symbols and caricatures so investors can more easily relate to them. Lehman Brothers, the story went, was too small and narrowly focused to survive once American Express dumped it in 1994. But the bank and its head, Richard S. Fuld Jr., instead came to embody Wall Street pluck by defying the consensus and outlasting many bigger rivals with broader business lines. \u001d  Once again, Lehman (ticker: LEH) is going up against perceptions. It's battling to join the likes of Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) as an elite international investment bank. Yet the firm is having a tough time getting its due as it recalibrates its strategy to leverage its core fixed-income expertise and increase international revenue. \u001d  Strong second-quarter earnings released last week helped its case, but Lehman is still perceived as a plodding bond house with a potentially damaging exposure to risky mortgages. In many ways that's a myth, though bonds and their many derivations do dominate Lehman's revenues. The fact is that it has made substantial strides in equities and investment banking here and abroad. In the second quarter, net revenue from equity capital markets nearly doubled over the year-ago period to $1.7 billion, helping offset weakness in bond trading. \u001d  Lehman's stock, however, lags behind its more heralded, faster-growing peers. After leading the brokerage sector for several years, the shares, which have risen just 1% this year, are up 29% over the past 12 months -- well behind Goldman's 63% gain and Morgan Stanley's 61% rise. Its book value is also substantially less. \u001d  \"There is a level of questioning and malaise about Lehman, not because of cracks in the armor, but because you have to ask questions when a company is underperforming the peer group after outperforming for some time,\" says brokerage analyst Guy Moszkowski of Merrill Lynch. \u001d  But for investors comfortable going against the crowd -- or at least advancing slightly ahead of it, these questions offer an opportunity to buy the weak stock of a firm with a stable franchise that could ultimately join the ranks of the top investment banks. In fact, a case could be made that buying Lehman shares is like owning a position in a smaller, more risk-averse Goldman Sachs. Applying Morgan Stanley's 2.57 multiple of price to book value would lift Lehman shares by about 24% to 99; at Goldman's 2.93, they'd jump 38%. Lehman's book value, at $37.15 at the end of the second quarter, has gained 124% over the past five years. \b \u001d  Fuld knows his firm is misunderstood. \"Whether the world catches on today or tomorrow, I've got plenty of time for that. I like that we're not fully appreciated,\" he recently told Barron's. \"We have so much to do here as we build out Europe and India and China.\" \u001d  Fuld makes no apologies for moving slower than some competitors to expand overseas. Ditto for not going after as many private-equity deals. And ditto for curtailing the firm's risk-taking in 2006 when he found some \"disquieting\" factors at work in the markets. \u001d  Now Lehman seems intent on taking on more trading and deal risk, and using its balance sheet to commit more capital -- without losing sight of risk scenarios. If bankers sell themes and ideas, traders assess risk. And Fuld is a former bond trader. But even critics concede he also has a great record of delivering on his plan. \u001d  Fuld says a lot of bad deals have been made to look good because of easy credit. When Lehman finds a good deal, he says, it commits capital as it has in participating in the $32 billion buyout bid for utility TXU (TXU). Want more proof? Lehman bought Eagle Energy Partners, which provides it with a global energy and commodities platform. Still more? It made a 20% investment in D.E. Shaw, the world's fourth largest hedge fund, and has signed on to the proposed $15.2 billion buyout of Archstone-Smith, a real-estate investment trust, with Tishman Speyer and Bank of America. \u001d  Lehman's investment bankers are advising on some of the world's biggest mergers and acquisitions, including those for ABN-AMRO, Endesa and Alcoa. \u001d  \"Our goal,\" Fuld says, \"is to be a provider of capital. I don't want to go to auction on assets. We're doing partnerships with clients and getting assets at reasonable levels.\" \u001d  Fuld's distinction is important. Many investment banks today, especially Goldman, are chided for competing with their customers rather than helping them make money. He's following a different route. \b \u001d  The complaint about Lehman is that its balance sheet isn't big enough to do many big deals. At about $600 billion, it isn't nearly as large as Goldman's $912 billion or Morgan Stanley's more than $1.2 trillion. Citigroup's (C) balance sheet is about $2 trillion, while JPMorgan's (JPM) is roughly $1.4 trillion. \u001d  To be sure, Lehman does not want to be all things to all clients, and $600 billion still offers the flexibility to do back flips to win selected deals. But building an investment-banking franchise is more challenging if a bank is not recognized as willing to make major financial commitments readily. \u001d  This is a significant issue when relationships are effectively being auctioned: Lehman's risk appetite will set the pace of its advance up the league tables. In 2006, the firm ranked ninth in global leveraged buyouts based on value and market share and seventh in global completed M&A. Goldman and the other firms with larger balance sheets dominate these rankings. \u001d  \"Lehman's made huge strides relative to the Lehman franchise,\" says Lauren Smith, a Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst. \"But they haven't really broken into the top tier and gone toe-to-toe with the global bulge-bracket competitors.\" \u001d  Lehman's response appears to have been creating a senior position tasked with managing strategic partnerships, principal investing and risk. David Goldfarb, the firm's former financial and administrative chief, now supervises all principal investments, mergers and acquisitions and strategic joint ventures. He also oversees the internal investment businesses of global trading and principal strategies. \u001d  \"Risk appetite is something they have to come to terms with,\" says Merrill analyst Moszkowski. \"They've opened up the risk book a little and they've closed some of that gap relative to others. They're doing it judiciously and effectively and it is starting to make a difference.\" \u001d  Lehman, like other investment banks, trades at 10 times forward earnings. This influences the revenue multiples it pays for deals because anything above 10 times earnings is not immediately accretive. \"We see tons of opportunity, and in all fairness we're trying to pick the right one,\" Fuld says. \"We're buying at lower levels when some guys think they should go at 25 to 30 times earnings. When we buy earnings or capabilities, we want to create shareholder value.\" \u001d  Paradoxically, price-to-earnings ratios are not particularly relevant in assessing brokerage firms' shares. The ratio is chronically low in reflection of the difficulty in forecasting volatile earnings. The more relevant measure is price to book value, where it trails Goldman and Morgan (see chart). \u001d  Lehman shares' relative weakness suggests something's amiss. Sure, Lehman lacks scale in high-margin businesses like proprietary trading, which has a cross-cycle pre-tax margin of 29% to 44%, or prime brokerage, which offers pre-tax margins of 20% to 53%, but it is still increasing revenue and earnings -- just not as much as competitors. \u001d  Lehman on Tuesday reported a 27% gain in second-quarter net income on the strength of equities trading, investment banking and international operations. But analyst questions on the subsequent conference call focused on subprime mortgages --  which Lehman has said are about 3% of revenues. It seems analysts may be having a hard time seeing the emerging story line at Lehman because they're so concerned about mortgage risk, which did hurt earnings at Bear Stearns and Goldman. Lehman's earnings beat consensus estimates by 18%, suggesting the analysts are too cautious. \u001d  As a mile marker, Lehman's second-quarter earnings demonstrate that the firm is progressing toward its goal of diversifying revenues by asset class and geography. Formerly lethargic investment-banking revenues increased by 55%, and non-U.S. revenues reached 48% of the firm's total. Equity trading set a record. Fixed income, the traditional driver of Lehman's growth, fell 14% from the previous year as U.S. subprime- mortgage originations were flat. \u001d  Until recently, Lehman's rivals were doing better, and growing faster. But on Thursday Goldman's stock fell 3% when it reported a 1% gain in quarterly profits following a sharp drop in once-strong trading revenues. Bear's second-quarter result fell short of a reduced earnings-consensus estimate, reflecting ongoing mortgage woes. Lehman, in its fourth straight year of record revenue, also has a higher return on equity and pretax margin than Bear, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. \u001d  Lehman's risk levels aren't as high as Goldman's or Morgan Stanley's. Value at risk, a measure of a firm's market risk, was $78 million in the second quarter at Lehman, well below Goldman's $133 million and, in the first quarter, Morgan Stanley's $90 million.The volatility of Lehman's quarterly earnings is almost half that of the typical brokerage firm (see chart). Lehman thus offers investors a way to profit steadily from the rise of global capital markets without assuming high proprietary trading risk or the possible downside to aggressive deal making. \b \u001d  For the first time in Lehman's history, the head of fixed income -- responsible for about 49% of the firm's annual revenue -- is based outside the U.S. Roger Nagioff, a former co-head of global equities, is in London. Nagioff's appointment is a clear sign of Lehman's intention to internationalize its fixed-income machine across Europe, Asia and the Middle East, while also expanding investment banking and equity trading. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"078a27735be57a3e2842272a3dabe0ae","symR":["BP","BP.LN","GSPBEX.RS","TNBP.RS","GB0007980591","RU0007661625","RU000A0HGPM9"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"TNK-BP Edges Toward Accord With Gazprom -FT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T11:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BP","BP.LN","GSPBEX.RS","TNBP.RS","GB0007980591","RU0007661625","RU000A0HGPM9"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","OIS","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Anglo-Russian oil venture TNK-BP (TNBP.RS) is inching toward an agreement with Gazprom (GSPBEX.RS) over the state-controlled gas giant taking a stake in its Kovykta gas field, the Financial Times reported Saturday, quoting two people close to the company. \u001d  The move comes as Russia again delayed a decision on whether to revoke TNK-BP's license. \u001d  The newspaper quoted one person close to TNK-BP as having said negotiations between TNK-BP, BP (BP.LN) and Gazprom were moving ahead after a \"number of discussions\" during a major investment forum in St Petersburg that was attended by BP's new chief executive Tony Hayward last weekend. \u001d  Russia had first been due to make a decision two weeks ago on revoking TNK-BP's license to develop its vast east Siberian Kovykta gas field over production violations. But a decision was delayed for up to two weeks amid warnings that withdrawing the license could further damage Russia's investment climate, the FT reported. \u001d  According to the FT, Senior Gazprom officials have acknowledged the gas company was in discussions over entering the project. \u001d  The newspaper said that BP is believed to be offering Gazprom participation in several of its international projects as part of a broader deal to resolve the standoff. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.ft.com \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9330 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 07:57 ET (11:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0a976326937e2d6a54f66e233e49ccff","symR":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Barron's Roundtable: Room To Run -6-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","BAN","BNK","BRD","BVG","CHC","CHM","CMT","CNO","CPR","CSV","CTS","DST","FAC","FOD","FTS","HIM","IDD","ISV","LOD","MED","OFP","OIS","RES","RTS","SAP","SEM","SFT","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTT","XSTX","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  A: Waiting. The one stock that continues to interest me now is Citigroup [C]. Big-caps are coming back into favor, but this one hasn't been smiled upon. It didn't do that badly last year, but is down 3% year to date. Citi has started to pay attention to fundamentals, such as non-interest expense relative to revenue. In the most recent quarter, revenue was up 15% and non-interest expenses were up 10%, and the the company announced it was laying off 17,000 people. \u001d  Citi is a genuine 10%-12% grower, in my view, with a 4% yield, and it is selling for just a tick over 10 times next year's earnings. That's a steal. The market is going to get around to it, and you'll see more attention-getting numbers. Citi could get back to a market multiple. If it earns $5.90 a share in 2009, at a 13x multiple that gives you 39% appreciation, plus the yield. \b \u001d  Q: What is behind hedge-fund manager Eddie Lambert's investment in Citi? \u001d  A: He might be looking at some of the same fundamentals, though I don't know him or his views. A number of people have talked about breaking up the company, which is not a good idea. Citi has economies of scale that give you the kind of growth I'm predicting, particularly in emerging markets. I'd like to keep that under my wing. The CEO, Chuck Prince, finally has turned his attention and his company's attention to making sure non-interest expenses go up less than revenue. He has done a reasonably good job and deserves more time and attention paid to his results. \b \u001d  Thank you, John. \u001d  MARC FABER \b \u001d  Q: What was the U.S. market's recent pullback telling us? \u001d  Faber: The economies of the rest of the world have been very strong in the first five months of 2007, whereas U.S. consumption has slowed. If GDP and the rate of inflation were measured properly, we would see the U.S. already has reached the no-growth stage, but with some inflation -- in other words, stagflation. The housing downturn has hurt consumers, and retail sales have been disappointing. If nominal GDP is 6% and inflation is 2%, you get 4% real growth. But if inflation is 5%, you get only 1% growth. In other ways, too, the world has a dual economy. A lot of money flows into the pockets of affluent people, as evidenced by the continued rise of London property prices, art prices at auctions, fine wines and so forth. The economy of the middle class and the workers is not doing particularly well. \b \u001d  Q: What does this mean for the stock markets of the world? \u001d  A: The U.S. stock market, like all other asset markets, is in cuckoo land. We have bubbles everywhere, which hasn't happened before. The 19th century saw occasional bubbles in canals and railroads. Share prices entered a bubble in 1929; gold, silver and oil in 1980, and Japan and Taiwan in 1989. In 2000 there was a huge bubble in one sector: TMT, or technology, media and telecommunications. This time around, since 2002, everything has gone up: home prices, real estate and art prices, stock prices, commodity prices and even, until recently, bonds. \u001d  We are going to see a gradual narrowing of the bubbles, or perhaps they will all break at the same time. The Dow Jones industrials and the S&P 500 are in an incredible bubble phase. For foreign investors, the rise in the S&P mostly has been offset by weakness in the dollar, so U.S. assets aren't terribly expensive relative to other assets. Sure, the market sells for only 15-16 times forecast earnings. But if you take out the gains in energy and financial-sector earnings, the market is selling above 20 times earnings. Given that you can buy a two-year Treasury note yielding 5%, that is not an attractive valuation. I would rather be a seller of the stocks around the world than a buyer here. \b \u001d  Q: Is there any market you consider attractive? \u001d  A: I still own a few stocks in Asia, where the fundamentals are favorable. In countries such as Malaysia [see page M12], Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand, valuations are attractive compared to the the local yield on bank deposits and bonds. The same goes for Japan. But those markets have become correlated with the U.S., so if the S&P goes down 5%-10%, nothing much will go up. If the S&P drops 10%, emerging markets easily could drop 20% or more. \b \u001d  Q: Are you predicting a 10% decline in the S&P? \u001d  A: Yes. The S&P either will really begin to correct, or continue to move up, perhaps until August, and, like in 1987, have a very sharp setback in the second half. The U.S. economy has been in an expansion mode for 67 months, starting in November 2001. The expansion is old. The stock market hasn't had a 10% correction since March 2003, which also is unusual. There are lots of symptoms of speculation around. Share buybacks are great because they are driving up the share market, people say. But there were enormous share buybacks and equity shrinkage in 1985, '86 and '87, and the market dropped 40% between the summer of '87 and October of that year. The shrinkage of equities frequently is a negative rather than a positive sign. \b \u001d  Q: What, if anything, are you buying these days? \u001d  A: Thailand is a relatively inexpensive market. The outlook is not brilliant, but you can find a lot of stocks that sell for 8-12 times earnings and yield around 6%. I still like Thai Reinsurance [THRE.Thailand], which I've mentioned in the past, and DSG International [DSGT.Thailand], which makes disposable diapers. Then there's Singapore Airport Terminal Services [SATS.Singapore], a catering company. In January I recommended Oishi Group [OISHI.Thailand] and it went down. The risk is minimal at current levels. The company sells fruit juice. I also like Tipco Foods [TIPCO.Thailand]. \b \u001d  Q: In January you also recommended shorting the 30-year bond. We presume you're still bearish. \u001d  A: Yes, although near-term these bonds are oversold. It is a great error to think that in an economic slowdown, the rate of inflation automatically drops. Don't tell me your cost of living is increasing by only 2% a year. On the commodity side I recommended cotton, which may be at the beginning of a sizable upward move. I still like it. The same goes for sugar, where the downside risk is low. \u001d  As for a new idea, I'd try to short U.S. retailers, excluding Wal-Mart [WMT]. You can use the consumer discretionary SPDR [XLY]. It won't do as badly as the rest of the industry. There will come a time when middle-class households exact their revenge and do better relative to the Wall Street crowd. The problem with Wall Street is this: If you take away the fees earned by structured products and investment banking and mergers and acquisitions, there won't be much left. I admire Wall Street and the banking system, which when faced with collapsing commission rates invented structured products from which to earn so much. But one day it will dawn even on financial institutions, and on state pension funds, that they are paying a high fee for a very large basket of hedge funds. Some hedge funds are superstars. But out of 7,000 hedge funds, not all are superstars. And it's not just hedge funds. The whole system is geared to taking a lot of money out of the pockets of clients. Where are the customers' planes? \b \u001d  Q: Excellent question. Let's talk about China. \u001d  A: The Chinese stock market has quadrupled from its low in June 2005, when it was at a relatively depressed level. Clearly the market is in a bubble, but following a correction it might make a new high. In 1987 we had a bubble in Japan and Taiwan. The Taiwan market crashed, falling 50%, and then went up another four times to its final peak. \u001d  Economically, China is expanding at breakneck speed. Industrial production is rising by 16% to 18% per annum. At some stage there will be indigestion and disappointing news. The rate of inflation in China has accelerated quite a bit. Food prices have become a larger percentage of total consumption. Look, everything has reached the bubble stage, but bubbles can grow bigger. If you step into the market and buy here, use stop-loss orders. \b \u001d  Thanks, Marc. \u001d  OSCAR SCHAFER \b \u001d  Q: Is there much juice left in this market, Oscar? \u001d  Schafer: The stock market is not going to do all that much the rest of the year, despite all the talking heads gabbing about new highs. The major averages are up less than 10%. As for the economy, one of the three bears is going to get Goldilocks one of these days. Interest rates are going up, but they're rising due to demand for money, not inflation. That means earnings will be OK, and so should the stock market. But if the Goldilocks economy -- not too hot, not to cold -- is challenged, the stock market will have a problem. \b \u001d  Q: But not this year. \u001d  A: Right. I read about banks lending to LBO firms with no covenants, and investment banks having outsized bridge-loan commitments relative to their equity. Then there are liar loans, where people fib about their income. The whole housing situation is scary. But unless things change radically, as long as people are employed, the market will climb the wall of worry or stay where it is. \b \u001d  Q: How does your portfolio look these days? \u001d  A: We're about 100% long and 30% short. We're acting like a true hedge fund, having made almost 6% on the short side. \u001d  Is there much worth selling short? \u001d  No. It continues to be a tough place to pick your spots because the economy is pretty strong. There are too many hedge funds shorting the same kinds of stocks. We don't talk about our short ideas, but I have two long ideas. In last year's Midyear Roundtable I recommended Kos Pharmaceuticals at 37. In November Abbott Laboratories [ABT] announced it would acquire Kos for 78 a share. Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings [ENDP] is similar to Kos in that concerns about its main product are overstated. It has a significant net cash position, strong product franchises and an underappreciated pipeline; a strong management team and a stock that is trading at a significant discount to other specialty-pharmaceutical companies. Endo could be a very attractive asset for Abbott or other strategic buyers. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"190865be667d9107d46be090f1fd019d","symR":["7203.TO","F","GM","TM","JP3633400001","US3704421052"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Toyota Is Best-Selling US Auto Brand For First Time -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T10:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["7203.TO","F","GM","TM","JP3633400001","US3704421052"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--While Ford and Chevrolet continue their perennial fight for dominance in the U.S. car and truck market, Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) has slipped in under the radar to claim the top spot as the best-selling automotive brand in the country, The Detroit News reported Saturday. \u001d  Through May, Toyota led all brands with U.S. unit sales of 954,000 vehicles, a razor-thin 5,200 units ahead of General Motors Corp.'s (GM) Chevy brand and 40,000 better than the Ford Motor Co.'s (F) Ford brand, the newspaper said. \u001d  The Toyota brand's lead is far wider when it comes to all-important retail sales, which exclude low-margin sales to car rental companies and other fleets, according to the paper. In April, Toyota's namesake brand claimed 15.8% of the U.S. retail vehicle market, compared with 11.9% for Chevy and 11.1% for Ford, according to an analysis of national sales transaction data prepared for The Detroit News by R.L. Polk & Co. \u001d  The Toyota figures include its youth-oriented Scion models because they are sold through the same dealer network, but exclude its luxury Lexus brand, the paper said. \u001d  Toyota spokesman Irv Miller said the company is aware of its position in the market but believes there is little value in leveraging it for promotional purposes because most Toyota buyers are more interested in attributes such as quality and fuel economy, the paper reported. In the same vein, Toyota has played down the fact that it passed GM in worldwide sales volumes in the first quarter of this year. \b \u001d  Newspaper Web site: www.detroitnews.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 06:31 ET (10:31 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1b88647323b927de125cb2ca49ade3af","symR":["VOD","VOD.LN","GB00B16GWD56"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Vodafone Chief Exec's Pay Rises 18% -FT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T11:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VOD","VOD.LN","GB00B16GWD56"],"IndustryCodes":["CTS","TLS","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Arun Sarin, chief executive of Vodafone (VOD.LN), saw his pay package rise nearly 20% in the last financial year as he achieved many of the mobile phone group's internal performance targets, the Financial Times reported Saturday. \u001d  The newspaper said that Sarin, who received GBP2.89 million in shares from a long-term incentive program, took home more than GBP3.2 million, a rise of 18% on last year after receiving GBP1.27 million in salary and GBP1.93 million in share awards, according to figures from the group's annual report, published Friday. \u001d  Last month Vodafone beat market forecasts after announcing operating profit would be potentially flat in the coming financial year while it forecast that 2008 sales would exceed some estimates because of higher growth in emerging markets, the FT reported. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.ft.com \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9330 \b \u001d  Order free Annual Report for Vodafone Group PLC\u001d  Visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B16GWD56 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028\u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 07:12 ET (11:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"255ae292da1cf6418218cd6a116df944","symR":["BVV.XX","OPTM","PCS"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) High-Powered Battery","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BVV.XX","OPTM","PCS"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","CPR","CTS","FIS","TLS","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Jack Willoughby \u001d  The name Battery Ventures probably isn't familiar to most investors. But the Waltham, Mass., venture-capital firm has a strong knack for a tricky business and, over the past year, has helped bring several technology and communications companies public. \u001d  \"It's not so much that the tech sector is strong,\" says Morgan Jones, the company's communications engineering partner. \"The companies coming public now have grown up strong and profitable in a challenging environment;[they're] built to last. During the boom years, they were built to be sold.\" \u001d  Maybe that's why, as Jones notes: \"In the past two years, less than 26 technology offerings were made, only a fraction of the 150-plus-deal years familiar during the dot-com boom.\" And the newest deals are likely to generate average returns in the teens to low 20s, rather than the 30%-plus common in the 'Nineties. \u001d  Battery Ventures, like many other venture-capital firms, struggled and slimmed down after the tech bubble burst and 9/11 further hurt the market. The company, which once had 65 employees, now has 53. At the same time, it's broadened its scope, recruiting people qualified to look at a wider variety of companies in tech and related fields. \"It's a question of taking what you know and applying it to new and unexpected areas,\" says Battery Ventures general partner Thomas Crotty. \"Embracing what you know but continuing to extend into new areas less crowded with competitors.\" The company also has widened its geographic reach. It now has offices on both U.S. coasts, Israel and India. Soon, it hopes to plant its flag in China. \u001d  The venture-capital game has never been easy, but now there's a new twist. With all the private-equity money sloshing around and with Sarbanes-Oxley rules in effect, some entrepreneurs prefer to sell their businesses privately or to list them overseas, rather than in the U.S. These people worry about the cost and time needed to meet Sarbox's extensive disclosure regulations and are concerned about the legal liability the law imposes on top executives. \u001d  Case in point: Battery owns a stake in a small Indian firm called Tejas Networks, which builds high-quality, low-priced equipment for Nortel. \"Five years ago, there would be no question. The Tejas Networks IPO would have been done via the Nasdaq,\" says Crotty. \"When it does come public, it will be going on the Bombay exchange.\" \u001d  Such changes add to the challenge that Battery Ventures faces. \"Sure we have a number of deals in registration,\" adds Crotty, a Notre Dame grad with an MBA from Wharton. \"But the ones in registration only represent the survivors. For each one, there is at least another that we let die as we worked our way through the tech slowdown.\" \u001d  In the pipeline right now are several potential IPOs, including one for Netezza, a maker of data-warehouse devices and another for BladeLogic, a computer-server management specialist, Both have already filed to go public. \u001d  Each year, Battery Ventures looks at up to 4,500 companies that potentially could go public. The list quickly is winnowed to a couple of hundred. This group, in turn, is trimmed to 50 with the potential to become \"hot\" deals. A Battery Ventures principal and two assistants are assigned to each of these. Their aim: to nurture the company through the IPO startup process and successive rounds of financing. At every step of the process, a three-person investment committee scrutinizes the project. The panel wants to ensure that the principal and assistants don't \"go native\" -- become so enamored of a prospect that they're blinded to its risks. \u001d  Battery Ventures usually is approached by companies dreaming of a public offering. But, frequently, it takes the initiative. Sparked by something they, say, read in the newspapers, its associates will solicit promising startups. The firm also will draw candidates for the public market from later-stage buyout and private-equity firms, such as Boston's TA Associates. \u001d  \"They're not the first names you see on those high-profile deals, but they have earned a really well-respected name in the business,\" says Donald Stanley, Battery Ventures' former chief financial officer, who now works for another VC firm. \"They have a willingness to take on risk that's not obvious. Anyone can do a tech deal when everyone else is doing them, but Battery Ventures is often in the lead.\" \u001d  The firm oversees $2.2 billion in investments, via seven venture-capital funds, open mainly to institutions, which normally invest $10 million to $15 million for 10 years. Of the seven funds, six have returns that are in the first quartile of their peers, according to the company, based on their showings over their durations. The net returns to investors have ranged from 13% to 165%. \b \u001d  Having $2.2 billion to invest would have been a stunning luxury when Battery Ventures was founded 24 years ago by Rick Frisbie, an investment pro with both a venture-capital and law background. \u001d  To kick-start the operation, Battery Ventures first used the Yankee Group's technology analysts, but soon came to rely on its own staff. Frisbie remains as a partner, and an adviser on management and strategy. \"At the time, we were one of the few firms that specifically focused on information technology and communications software,\" he recalls. \u001d  From the beginning, the company emphasized teamwork. Says Frisbie: \"The idea has been to build a franchise in which people believe, not to glorify individual dealmakers. This team approach is difficult, because the venture-capital field is dominated by individualists.\" This means that no one person can block -- or push through -- a deal. At the same time, he says, it means that, \"to be successful at Battery Ventures, you can't be a wimp, because you'll never get any deals done. You have to have confidence in your own ability. But not be arrogant. We want to have guys around who are fun. Around here, even in the most serious meeting, you're going to hear laughter.\" \u001d  As is the norm in its high-risk, high-reward business, Battery Ventures has both feasted on some fat successes and unhappily gnawed on \"bagels,\" as failed deals are known (an allusion to zero). \u001d  The company's biggest deal was for Qtera, an optic-networking outfit sold to Nortel for about $3.25 billion. Battery's return on the sale, done at the height of the tech bubble, was $1 billion on an $8.4 million investment. Morgan Jones, who has engineering degrees from Harvard and Stanford, \"was instrumental in helping to start the company,\" recalls Stanley. \"Qtera's founders thought so much of him and his contribution that they cut him a significant piece of their own positions in the company at the time of the sale.\" \u001d  In late 2000, Battery Ventures teamed with the Blackstone Group to buy the money-losing London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. A year later, a revitalized LIFFE was sold for $800 million to Euronext, earning Battery and Blackstone more than $100 million apiece on an investment one-third the size. \u001d  Another triumph came in 2004, when Battery Ventures became an investor in Fingerhut, a Minneapolis-based direct marketer that was liquidated after suffering large losses. \u001d  With advice and capital from Battery Ventures and Bain & Co., the company's managers turned Fingerhut into a money-maker again. The key was employing a state-of-the-art computer system to reconnect sales, credit, collections and marketing, to get the most from Fingerhut's very loyal customer base, many of them homemakers with low incomes. \u001d  Brian Smith, Fingerhut's CEO, says that Battery Ventures knew enough about operations to improve the business, but had the discretion to let its managers manage. Last year, Fingerhut produced \"very healthy profit\" on $310 million in revenue. The company, in which Battery Ventures still has about a 20% stake, thinks it can grow at a 25% annual clip over the next five years. \u001d  A newer IPO that's worked out was for MetroPCS (ticker: PCS), which raised $1.3 billion. The wireless concern's stock was priced at $23 two months ago. It's now in the 30s. \b \u001d  Not everything succeeds. Last October, Battery Ventures helped bring fiberoptics specialist Optium public in a $91 million transaction. The shares (OPTM) priced at 17.50 and and got as high as 27 before they began tumbling on concern about earnings; the stock recently was at 11.30. \u001d  And, lest anyone in the firm get too cocky, Battery Ventures keeps the icon of its all-time, highest-profile catastrophe on display in the office -- a sock puppet from the ill-fated Pets.com. \u001d  Says Crotty: \"Half of the deals you do you take a complete loss or get cents on the dollar back. On roughly one in four, you make between one- two- three-times your money back. The remaining one in four deals you hope to make 8 to 10 times invested capital or even higher to make up for the losses.\" \u001d  For nearly a quarter-century, Battery Ventures has been able to make this treacherous math work. And, given its funds' history, it doesn't look as if it's lost its touch. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"25710fd4b9b312af8aaa6cc5bf0c04f9","symR":["CEN","CSTR","GY","INTL","ITG","NETM","SAVB","VC","VTRU","YANB"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) 13D Filings: Investors Report To The SEC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CEN","CSTR","GY","INTL","ITG","NETM","SAVB","VC","VTRU","YANB"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","ARO","BNK","CMT","DFN","FAD","ICS","MED","OTA","SCR","SOF","SVC","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \u001d  13Ds are supposed to be filed within 10 days of an entity's attaining more than 5% of any class of a company's securities.

 Black: Let's start with valuation. I'm sticking with my '07 estimate for S&P 500 earnings: $87, up 6.7% for the year. That means the index, at current levels, sells for 17.6 times earnings. The market is about 10% overvalued. That doesn't mean it can't go up, but the median P/E [price-earnings multiple] has been 16 since 1946. As for individual companies, we screen 11,000 stocks, and there just aren't that many low-P/E, low-price-to-enterprise-value stocks out there. Many that show up on our screens, like the Bermuda reinsurers, we already own. At the beginning of the year, oil stocks were cheap. They are not cheap any more at 10, 11, 12 times forward earnings, and 6, 7, 7.5 times discretionary cash flow. It's the same with metals stocks. At 11-12 times expected earnings, they're not cheap. For a deep-value player, this has been one of the toughest markets in a long time. You have to find fallen angels or obscure companies. \u001d  Another problem is the casino mentality of many market players. Between the hedge funds trading in and out and the private-equity people chasing stocks at very inflated multiples of price to enterprise value, it reminds me a bit of the Michael Milken era -- the leveraged-buyout binge of the late 1980s. And there seems to be no fear. Look at the bond market. Investment-grade debt yields only 83 basis points over Treasuries, the lowest spread in nine years. [A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.] High-yield debt is 232 points over Treasuries -- a record low. There is no risk premium built into equities, and there is certainly none built into bonds. This belies the real economy, which slowed in the first quarter to about 0.6% growth. \b \u001d  Q: How do you explain the divergence? \u001d  A: The world is awash in liquidity. Last year there were $3.7 trillion worth of deals done, followed by another trillion in the first quarter of this year. All those stocks were retired, and the money has to get recycled. As supply shrinks, demand seems to increase, and it clears the market at higher prices. The run-up in prices is more of a technical event than one based on the fundamental earnings power of companies. \b \u001d  Q: What could break this cycle? \u001d  A: You almost need to have a hedge fund blow up, or a couple of private-equity deals go south. The private-equity business is more of a fee-gathering business now than an investment-performance business. If you attract a lot of money and you have to pay higher prices, returns at the margin go down. \u001d  One more thing: I criticized Ben Bernanke last June for talking too much after he became chairman of the Fed. In hindsight, he has done an excellent job. He is trying to navigate a delicate balance between ramping inflation down and avoiding a recession. Core inflation is 2.3% year over year, above the Fed's 2% comfort zone, so Bernanke is not going to cut rates as quickly as everyone thought. But he is not going to lift rates, as inflation isn't accelerating. If the economy stagnates, he will cut, choosing a whiff of inflation over recession. But I don't expect it to stagnate; even with $3.15 gasoline and a weaker housing market, the consumer is spending. The stock market is rising, and overall household net worth is near record highs. \b \u001d  Q: Now that you have apologized officially to Mr. Bernanke, tell us about a fallen angel you like. \u001d  A: I recommended American Eagle Outfitters [AEO], an apparel retailer, at the 2006 Roundtable. It had a big run, we sold, and the stock has fallen back to 27.20. In the past five fiscal years, ending Jan. 31, revenue has compounded by 19.1% a year. Operating income has grown to $587 million from $158 million, up 38% a year. Operating margins have climbed to 21% from 11.4%. Sales per square foot have risen to $642 from $460. Earnings per share are $1.70, up from 46 cents. Return on equity is 28%. There is no debt and $827 million in cash on the balance sheet. \u001d  With those numbers, the stock should get more respect. \u001d  American Eagle is the Rodney Dangerfield of retail stocks. It has 914 stores. Its bread and butter is the American Eagle stores, which cater to 15-to-25-year-olds. Girls generate 65% of the revenue, boys 35%. A second format, Martin+Osa, caters to 25-to-40-year-olds. This is not a fashion-oriented business. They like to say they are on trend, but they are not ahead. They compete against Abercrombie & Fitch [ANF] and its Hollister unit and Pacific Sunwear [PSUN], and at the lower end, Aeropostale [ARO]. \u001d  American Eagle has a lot of customer-relations databases. They put in a new enterprise-software system and point-of-sale systems. The typical customer buys two items for $20 apiece, or $40 per visit. The company wants to grow square footage by 9% to 11% a year, mostly at American Eagle stores, and has budgeted for 4% to 5% comparable-store growth. Operating margins long term probably can exceed 21%, which gives you earnings-per-share growth of 15% or more. \b \u001d  Q: What are your estimates for fiscal '08? \u001d  A: Revenue will rise 15%, to $3.2 billion. Divide $439 million in net income by 225 million fully diluted shares, and you get $1.95 a share for the year, versus $1.70 in fiscal '07. They probably will buy back more shares. The stock trades for 13.9 times fiscal '08 estimates. The company will generate about $290 million in free cash flow this year, up from $276 million. This is a money machine. If they don't buy back shares, their cash position will increase to more than $1 billion. In the year ending January '09, earnings could grow to $2.25 a share. The P/E on fiscal '09 is 12.1. Many large-cap growth companies -- the Coca-Colas and Campbell Soups -- are 5%-6% top-line growers and 9%-10% bottom-line growers, and they're trading at 18 and 20 times earnings. American Eagle is ridiculously cheap. Yes, gasoline prices are up, but the company hasn't seen any decline in store traffic. The stock has come down substantially. This is a good entry point. \b \u001d  Q: How about another name, Scott? \u001d  A: ChipMOS Technologies [IMOS] is a small Taiwan company that trades in the U.S. via American depositary receipts. It sells for 6.49, and there are 73.8 million fully diluted shares, for a market capitalization of $479 million. Semiconductor testing is 60% of revenue, and assembly 40%. ChipMOS has a broad base of customers, including Hynix, Samsung, National Semiconductor, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu. It serves four different markets: DRAM, flash memory, liquid-crystal display and mixed-signal. Consumer electronics is a big driver of growth. \u001d  In the past, the business has been cyclical. Earnings peaked at 79 cents a share in 2004, and return on equity at 18.8% Last year they did 74 cents and 16.7% ROE. Earnings will rebound this year. Book value is $8.55 a share, so the stock sells at 0.76 times book. There is almost no goodwill. The debt-to-equity ratio is about 0.5. Free cash flow could be about $50 million this year. ROE will come in around 11%-12% but is on track to get above 15%. \b \u001d  Q: Why the downturn? \u001d  A: Revenue was up 31% in the first quarter, though earnings were down a few pennies as the average selling prices on test and assembly fell 5% to 10%. Conservatively, ChipMOS will do about $750 million in revenue this year. It could net $71 million after taxes, or 96 cents, fully diluted. If margins come back a little, it could do $1.04. The midpoint is $1, so let's use that. The stock trades for roughly 6.5 times earnings. It's cheap. And 39% of current capacity is booked through 2009 on long-term contracts. It would help if DRAM prices firmed a bit, but we own Micron [MU], and the same dynamics that might make that go up 15%-20% could push this stock up two or three points, or 35%-40%. \b \u001d  Thanks, Scott. \b \u001d  JOHN NEFF \b \u001d  Q: Are you still sanguine about the market, John? \u001d  Neff: I'm using $100 for S&P 500 earnings in 2008, which would mean a gain of about 8%, based on my '07 estimates. The market sells for 15.3 times my '08 number, which isn't outlandish, particularly relative to the alternatives. The bond market doesn't look attractive, and commercial real estate has had an awfully good move and in some cases looks overdone. The stock market looks OK until we have a recession. An 8% increase in earnings and a 2% dividend yield give you a total return of 10%. That's attractive. A couple of things bother me, though. \b \u001d  Q: Such as? \u001d  A: One is the abundance, if not overabundance, of private-equity deals and leveraged buyouts. You're creating a great deal of debt among target companies, and inviting the possibility of some sort of accident, given that higher leverage. Also, I'm bothered by the outrageous investment fees charged by so-called hedge funds. Twenty percent of profits and 1% or 2% of assets in fees is outlandish in terms of a money manager's ability to succeed by enough of a margin to make a good return for the shareholder. It's just too much to give away. Some funds are going to have to take bigger risks, which could lead to bad headlines that disturb the confidence of the market, as \"Wrong-Term\" Capital Management did in the 1990s. Having said all that, the subprime-mortgage problem was bad, but didn't affect the market's confidence or performance. I'm still in the market, though I've taken something off the top since stocks moved up. The accounts I manage are 11% to 15% in cash. I can't find anything to buy. But stand by. \b \u001d  Q: Uh-oh. You have been a long-time bull on housing. Do you see any signs of recovery in that market? \u001d  A: The housing market is looking for a bottom. Maybe it will happen this year, and you'll crawl out next year. No. 1, housing has become more affordable, particularly on the coasts. No. 2, mortgage rates are still pretty friendly. No. 3, the economy is decent and there is a growing demand for new houses. I've got about 7% in home-building stocks. \b \u001d  Q: Are you buying, selling or waiting it out? \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"33269ba1b1514599173c0418e1f1a131","symR":["AV.LN","UBI.MI","GB0002162385","IT0003487029"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UBI Banca Targets EUR1.4B Net In 2010, Mulls Higher Div","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T12:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AV.LN","UBI.MI","GB0002162385","IT0003487029"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","INL","INS","XDJGI","XFT1","XMIB","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MILAN (Dow Jones)--Italian bank Unione di Banche Italiane ScpA (UBI.MJ), or UBI Banca said late Friday it is targeting a net profit of over EUR1.4 billion in 2010, net of nonrecurring items, adding that the plan doesn't include the effect of potential partnership in the non-life bancassurance, consumer finance and corporate banking units. \u001d  UBI Banca, Italy's fourth largest bank with a market capitalization of EUR13.7 billion, also said it has EUR1 billion of free capital to give to shareholders. \u001d  The board of directors of UBI Banca met Friday to approve its first business plan for the 2007-2010 period since the merger between Banche Popolari Unite SCARL and Banca Lombarda e Piemontese was effective. \u001d  The banks said in the statement that results don't include the effects of the allocation of the merger differences, which is estimated could have a net negative impact of around EUR100 million over the business plan period. \u001d  Bergamo-based UBI Banca also said it aims to pay a dividend of at least EUR1.30 per share in 2010, up from EUR0.80 per share in 2006. \u001d  It also said that annual synergies from the merger should be more than EUR400 million in 2010, ahead of initial estimates of EUR365 million. \u001d  In the last six months UBI Banca shares were unchanged, undeperforming the S&PMib index. \u001d  UBI Banca also said it will reorganize its asset management activities by merging its Capitalgest unit into BPU Pramerica as well as extend its partnership with Prudential Plc's (PRU.LN) to the entire group.

Central bankers are lionized, technologists appreciated, businessmen lauded as they fill the government's coffers, gurus and charlatans elevated and economists cheered as they explain why the business cycle is no longer relevant. Capital is cheap and plentiful, taken for granted and abused. \u001d  Bottoms are grueling, demoralizing, faith-shattering and so lonely you can hear a pin drop. As bust exposes the boom's sins, the curtain is pulled back on its leading authorities. Risk-taking is punished, scandals revealed and scapegoats pilloried. Liquidity dries up, bids disappear and capital becomes precious again. \u001d  Where are we now? Despite the recent spike in 10-year Treasury yields and an uptick in volatility, investors appear unflappable. Guest commentary on CNBC continues to be universally upbeat. Even reporters routinely interject their own optimism and scoff at the occasional skeptic. \u001d  Earlier this year, strategists at 12 large firms were unanimous in forecasting higher stock prices this year for the first time since the end of 2000 (when the S&P 500 proceeded to drop 33% in two years). Over the past 453 weeks, Investors Intelligence's poll of investment-newsletter editors has recorded more bears than bulls just nine times. \u001d  Money-market-fund balances are near an all-time low, 21.1% of mutual-fund and exchange-traded-fund assets. The Investment Company Institute reports equity-fund cash levels are at a paltry 3.7%, breaking the historic low of 3.9% set in May 1972 (prior to the worst bear market since the Great Depression). \u001d  Gurus have emerged to tell the masses what they want to hear. While Mad Money host James Cramer \"just wants to make you rich,\" money manager and Forbes columnist Ken Fisher insists he invests by \"knowing what others don't.\" Both recently published best-selling books, and both are very bullish. \u001d  A record $1.55 trillion in domestic takeovers took place in 2006, according to Standard & Poor's, and deal flow is running 60% higher this year. The \"Bloomberg 20\" investment banks raked in $34.9 billion in fees last year from mergers and acquisitions, up from $10.6 billion in 2002. \u001d  An estimated $7 billion resides in bear-fund and short ETF assets against $7.0 trillion in stock-fund assets. The Strunk Short Index used to track 25 short-bias hedge funds; that number has dwindled to eight or nine out of more than 9,200 hedge funds. \u001d  Speculators convinced of enduring asset inflation are standing-room only at the credit casino. The beneficiaries have been lenders, brokers, real-estate developers, money shufflers and purveyors of discretionary consumer items. From 2001-2005, 40% of new jobs were provided by real estate and construction. Over 45% of corporate profits now come from financing activity. The No. 1 S&P 500 sector weighting is financials at 22%. Of the current Forbes 400 members, 140 made their fortunes from real estate, investments or finance. Today 24 of 72 major sports stadiums have granted naming rights to financial firms, 14 of them banks. (Recall that 19% of the Stadium Class of 2000 -- including PSINet Stadium and Enron Field -- went bankrupt within five years.) \u001d  The residential real-estate bubble of 23 months ago has transmogrified into a professional-speculator bubble, adding appendages such as commercial real estate, hedge funds, and private equity. These \"alternative investments\" have been driven up by institutions attempting to generate outsized returns in a yield-starved world, simply by applying leverage. \u001d  There are now more bells ringing than at an Austrian downhill ski race. \u001d  On Feb. 9, Fortress Investment Group became the first hedge-fund manager to go public in the U.S. Although the offering was not exactly shareholder-friendly (negative book value, rich valuation, principals selling shares), \"FIG\" soared 68% its first day. \u001d  \"The New King of Wall Street,\" Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, graced the March 5 cover of Fortune, which featured the top 10 private-equity players. Blackstone recently sold a $3 billion stake to the Chinese and is expected to go public next week. A successful offering could raise Schwarzman's net worth to $12 billion, vaulting him from 73rd on the Forbes 400 into the top 20. \u001d  Goldman Sachs, arguably the greatest beneficiary of the booms in trading, hedge funds, private equity and structured finance, grew its balance sheet 21.8% annually over the past five years. During the February quarter, total assets exceeded total bank credit at the Federal Reserve for the first time. \u001d  \"Liquidity\" has become the siren song of the bulls. BusinessWeek apotheosized this rationale with its Feb. 19 cover, \"It's a Low, Low, Low, Low-Rate World: Why money may stay cheap longer than you think.\" \u001d  With so many on Wall Street singing the same optimistic tune, is it time to get defensive and grab a chair before the music stops? Perhaps the adage by the late Humphrey Neill, the father of modern contrarian theory, applies here: \"When everybody thinks alike, everyone is likely to be wrong.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  Kevin Duffy is a principal of Bearing Asset Management. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:02 ET (04:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3a794acd67c9bb25546df58aefdd4c53","symR":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Barron's Roundtable: Room To Run -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","BAN","BNK","BRD","BVG","CHC","CHM","CMT","CNO","CPR","CSV","CTS","DST","FAC","FOD","FTS","HIM","IDD","ISV","LOD","MED","OFP","OIS","RES","RTS","SAP","SEM","SFT","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTT","XSTX","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  A: In 2009 or '10. Deals with covenant-lite provisions can cover two years of economic challenges. At the end someone will overpay, there will be an episode of insider trading, or something. A lot of garbage will surface. My major concern about deals is no different than my major concern about the stock market: There is so much leverage, and the use of derivatives has built in so much leverage below the surface. Also, asset managers, even ordinary money managers, are telling pension plans and other clients, \"Let me be your hedge fund. Give me a dollar and I'll buy $130 of stocks, but I'll short $30 worth.\" The dynamics are in place for a stress test of the whole system. That could be Bernanke's first big test. \b \u001d  Q: What are you buying? \u001d  A: We see a big catalyst in Aruze [6425.Japan], a Japanese operator of pachinko parlors. Gambling is coming to Japan. Aruze trades at 4060 yen. The company's main asset is 24 million shares of Wynn Resorts [WYNN]. Wynn trades for 95, so you get three-tenths of a share of Wynn per share of Aruze. Add up Aruze's debt, cash and Wynn shares, and you get the underlying business for free. \b \u001d  Q: How is that business doing? \u001d  A: There are three speculative elements here. In the next three years, Japan will probably license gambling, and Wynn will have a center-row orchestra seat. Second, the Chinese are passionate gamblers, and will travel to Japan. Third, Goldman Sachs just bought a 9% stake in Aruze. \u001d  Next, an update on Cablevision. The stock [CVC] is 35.60, and the value of the company is $50-plus. The controlling shareholders, the Dolan family, have stepped up their buyout price to $36.26 since January, but the value of the company has gone up dramatically. The deal they first had on the table allowed shareholders to get a true-up in value if the company was resold in coming years. That's not the case with this new offer. Cablevision is worth substantially more than its market price, and we think we'll get it. \b \u001d  Q: What else attracts you? \u001d  A: The food sector is fertile for deals. At Cadbury Schweppes [CSG], something already is happening. Cadbury has two businesses -- confectionery and beverages. They are selling off the beverage business and will do a major capitalization shrink with the proceeds. The confectionery business fits like a glove with Hershey [HSY] and Kraft Foods [KFT], both of which would be good strategic partners. Cadbury sells for 687 pence in London and the American depositary receipts are 55. We're buying it in London. After the cap shrink and an earnings increase, the stock could be worth 840p. \u001d  We also like Hilton Hotels [HLT]. Steve Bollenbach is retiring as CEO. Matt Hart is the new CEO. There are 385 million shares outstanding, and the stock trades for 35. \b \u001d  Q: What is the bullish case for Hilton? \u001d  A: The growth in demand of hotel rooms in countries like India. There are about as many hotel rooms in all of India than there are in Las Vegas. Hilton is franchising its brand. There is a global consolidation of the hotel industry, and a lot of private-equity activity. We expect to earn 50% on our money in a couple of years if Hilton agrees to be taken over. If not, at these prices it's a conservative way to play the need for hotel rooms in emerging countries. \u001d  Next, Midas [MDS] is an auto-parts company. It's thinly traded, so be careful how you buy it. There are 14.8 million shares outstanding, and the company is converting its business into a franchise model. They brought in Alan Feldman from McDonald's in January 2003, and he has done everything right. He got rid of manufacturing and is trying to rejuvenate the stores. Midas could earn 90 cents a share next year, despite a drop in fees from Europe. It's a 15% to 20% grower. I'm trying to convince management to find another brand to franchise, just as Yum! Brands [YUM] has three brands: Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell. \b \u001d  Q: Smart idea. \u001d  A: My next stock is an old friend, Sequa. There are 11.4 million shares outstanding, and an A and B stock. SQA-A trades for 108. The chairman, Norman Alexander, died, and his daughter just became chairman. The play here is simple: Split the company in two. One part will have all the businesses except Chromalloy, which will have 2008 revenue of about $1.3 billion. It can earn a 13% to 14% Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] margins and be worth the value of the entire company, plus debt. Chromalloy, which provides repair and service to airplane engines, is the crown jewel. A Boeing study just said there will be 28,000 planes flying in the next 20 years. Sequa could be worth 50% more. \u001d  Finally, we have made a lot of money in wireless telephony over the years. Now we're focused on U.S. Cellular [USM], which has six million customers. In round numbers, '08 earnings will be $3.50 to $4 a share, growing at 25% to 30%. They own 5.5% of a franchise in Los Angeles that is owned by Verizon Communications [VZ]. That alone is worth $800 million. They have a lot of hidden assets. U.S. Cellular is worth about $130 a share based on the price at which Alltel [AT] was sold. It is trading for 88-89. It is 82%-owned by Telephone & Data Systems [TDS]. We own both stocks. Verizon is rolling up its wireless partnerships much the way Sprint Nextel [S] rolled up its partnerships and franchises. At some point Verizon could buy TDS and U.S. Cellular. \b \u001d  Thanks, Mario. \u001d  MERYL WITMER \b \u001d  Q: The year must be treating you well, Meryl. Your January picks are up by double-digits. \u001d  Witmer: But I have been wrong so far about the broad market. I thought it would be flat to down this year, but it has gone up sharply. Today I have only one stock to recommend, which might be an indication there aren't a lot of cheap names out there. We look at where companies are trading and try to figure out what they are worth and buy with a decent spread. There are fewer companies now with big spreads between price and value. Things are frothy, with private-equity buyers buying up everything. \b \u001d  Q: Have they bought up any of your stocks? \u001d  A: FKI [FKI.UK], the British engineering company I recommended in January, has been approached with a buyout offer. One of our favorite stocks now is Heineken, which trades in the Netherlands. We buy the holding-company stock, Heineken Holding, which is less liquid than the operating company but trades at a 14% discount. The holding company sells for around 37 euros, and the operating company for 43.51 euros. They pay the same dividend: 0.60 euros per share per year. \b \u001d  Q: What do you like about Heineken, other than, we presume, the beer? \u001d  A: It is one of the best known premium brands in the world, and has an aggressive new CEO, Jean-Francois van Boxmeer, who took the helm in 2005. He is driving growth, innovation and profitability, all with a sense of urgency. There is an opportunity in the stock because many of their initiatives are in the early stages. Current profits understate the earnings power of the company. They are spending money to make money, with the payoff to come later. \u001d  Two issues facing Heineken when van Boxmeer became CEO were slowing revenue growth and a lack of focus on costs. On the growth side he has responded with a multi-pronged approach: introducing new products into the market's fastest-growing segment, light beer; channel expansion; entry into faster-growing international markets and innovative packaging, like the five-liter draft. \b \u001d  Q: And on the cost side? \u001d  A: Management has announced broad-based cost-cutting programs and tied compensation to the achievement of new cost targets. Aggressive and energized management teams with strong international experience are being injected into Heineken to jolt the culture toward faster decision-making and calculated risk-taking. An example of a successful new-product launch in 2006 was Heineken Premium Light. Combined with Amstel Light and Tecate Light, Heineken's U.S. beer portfolio is one of the strongest in the sweet spot of the industry: imported light beer. \u001d  The near-term downside of Heineken Light is that the company is spending heavily to build the brand. Recent expansion into rapidly growing markets such as Russia and Central and Eastern Europe has caused the company to earn less-than-average profits there. Restructuring programs are now under way. Heineken also has renegotiated some partnership agreements in Asia, South America and Canada, which will improve profits and growth potential. The company will grow free cash flow per share from 2 euros in 2006 to easily more than 3 euros after taxes in 2010, we estimate. If they don't make an acquisition, they'll have net cash. Our two-year target is 50 euros to 55 euros. \b \u001d  Q: Aren't beer sales under pressure generally as spirits grow more popular? \u001d  A: That is somewhat true, but sales of imported beer are growing rapidly. It is an aspirational product. Imported and specialty beers grew 11% in 2006. Having two Mexican brands -- Tecate and Sol -- also has been great. Heineken will start advertising Tecate heavily. The real key, though, comes from the top down. Our analyst met with the top managers, and they are just so excited and energized to be with the company. Van Boxmeer is only in his mid-40s. \b \u001d  Q: What is the knock on the company, if any? \u001d  A: It is not as exposed to emerging markets as Carlsberg, but that is an opportunity. \u001d  Cheers, and thanks. \u001d  FRED HICKEY \u001d  Q: It's been a grim year for the bears, Fred. Have you surrendered yet? \u001d  Hickey: The year isn't over. It is a perpendicular market, a manic market, the kind of market that precedes a crash, and that is what I expect. \b \u001d  Q: Care to put a date on it? \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3f4f5b451f3f6fd50efb1a1ed2978948","symR":["3182.KU","3336.KU","4197.KU","5142.KU","5304.KU","5347.KU","5398.KU","MYL3182OO002","MYL3336OO004","MYL4197OO009","MYL5142OO004","MYL5304OO000","MYL5347OO009","MYL5398OO002"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Asian Trader: Malaysia's Run Looks Far From Over","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["3182.KU","3336.KU","4197.KU","5142.KU","5304.KU","5347.KU","5398.KU","MYL3182OO002","MYL3336OO004","MYL4197OO009","MYL5142OO004","MYL5304OO000","MYL5347OO009","MYL5398OO002"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","CON","ELC","IDD","LOD","STL","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By William J. Holstein and Assif Shameen \u001d  Malaysian prime minister Mohamad Mahathir achieved some major coups for his country -- the Petronas Twin Towers, once the world's tallest buildings, loom over central Kuala Lumpur. The new government capital complex at Putrajaya has streets reminiscent of the grand boulevards of ancient Rome. And fast trains run from Kuala Lumpur to a gleaming new airport that Mahathir built. \u001d  But Mahathir created a climate of conflict with Anglo-Saxon investors and, in particular, Jewish financiers like George Soros, whom he once blamed for the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998. Tough controls on foreign capital and curbs on the ringgit's convertibility, imposed after that crisis, didn't help. As a result, Kuala Lumpur's Bursa (stock market) has languished in global investing's backwaters for a decade. \"After the Asian crisis, all my American clients simply closed their Malaysian accounts,\" recalls Cheston Chua, then a broker and now research chief for ECMLibra Avenue Securities, Malaysia's second-largest investment bank. \u001d  But now Mahathir is 82 and has been in and out of hospitals for heart-related problems. His successor, Abdullah Badawi, is beginning to steer a different course by easing capital controls and restrictions on foreign investments and moving away from Mahathir's \"crony capitalism.\" \u001d  External trends also are blowing in the Bursa's favor -- a surge in commodity prices has been a boon because palm oil may become Asia's equivalent of ethanol. A political crisis in nearby Thailand means that fund managers are shifting dollars allocated for Southeast Asia into Malaysia. And the market's conviction that China is overpriced means that some funds are moving to less speculative markets. Malaysia's average P/E is about 17, versus 45 to 50 on China's frothy domestic exchanges. Corporate earnings are growing strongly too -- an estimated 18% this year. Last week, Malaysia reported surprisingly strong GDP growth of 5.3% for the first quarter. \u001d  Add it all up and the results are not surprising -- the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index is up 26% in U.S. dollars. Not including the currency effect, the market was up 13% last year and over 20% this year. \"The market has been moving up on increased global interest from the beginning of this year,\" says Lorraine Tan, an equities analyst for Standard & Poor's based in Singapore. Adds Chua Hak Bin, director of Citigroup's Asia Pacific Economics and Market Analysis group: \"We expect the overall momentum to be sustained.\" \u001d  Hedge funds, capitalizing on a combined currency and equity play, have helped drive those results. \"These guys are smart,\" says Tan Chong Koay, founder and chief strategist of Pheim Asset Management (Asia), whose assets have just crossed $1 billion. \"They know the U.S. currency will weaken and the Asian currencies are strengthening.\" \u001d  The conviction in Kuala Lumpur is that there is room left to run, so the question is which stocks to target. One obvious play: plantation companies such as Sime Darby (ticker: 4197.Malaysia), which is rated overweight by Bear Stearns. At the government's behest, Sime Darby is driving a consolidation of the country's three largest plantation companies and will become the world's largest plantation owner. S&P's Tan says weather conditions are \"conducive for another good year\" for palm-oil plantations but cautions that \"for palm oil to be viable as an alternative, oil prices have to be at a certain level.\" Palm oil has traditionally been used mostly for cooking and soap, but Europeans are interested in using it as \"biofuel\" for vehicles because they don't have a large corn crop -- the source of America's ethanol. \u001d  Stocks recommended by Bear Stearns include Gamuda (5398.Malaysia), a builder of toll roads and tunnels; IJM (3336.Malaysia), which has construction contracts in Argentina, China, India, Pakistan and the Middle East; and Genting (3182.Malaysia), a gaming company with a license to build a casino in Singapore. \u001d  Would-be multinationals such as IJM are run primarily by ethnic Chinese and Indians, who see good prospects outside Malaysia. Wah Seong (5142.Malaysia), for example, a maker of coatings for pipeline and refinery pipes, is working in China and the Mideast. Another favorite is Tenaga Nasonal (5347.Malaysia), the national utility company. With the government having removed a 25% limit on foreign shareholding, its stock is up 38% in a year. Another hot area is financial services, as Malaysian banks such as Malayan Banking (MLYB) carve out roles in global Islamic finance. \u001d  One sector to avoid is automotive: the national car company Proton Holdings (5304.Malaysia) is faltering. \u001d  Institutions have no trouble buying Malaysian shares in Kuala Lumpur. Individual U.S. investors can trade Southeast Asia funds or pure-play Malaysian funds. One ETF is the iShares MSCI Malaysia Index (EWM) from Barclays Global Investors. And investors interested in a large- and small-cap blend will soon be able to buy into Tan's Pheim Asset Management group through Merrill Lynch. \u001d  --- \u001d  William J.

Savitz \u001d  I've been thinking a lot about television lately. That hardly makes me unique, of course. Here in Silicon Valley -- and down in L.A., and back in New York -- people are spending a lot of time trying to figure out exactly how and when the Internet is going to kill off the traditional TV business. I'd agree that things really are changing, but not necessarily in the way -- or at the rate --  that the more aggressive proponents of 'Net video would have you believe. \u001d  First, let me say that I believe in Internet video; it is here to stay. I'm warming up to Joost, and its cable-like channel structure; I frequently watch clips on YouTube and other sites; I regularly caught up on missed episodes of 24 this season by streaming them free from Fox. As I see it, the problems come when people try to extrapolate from there. 'Net video is nifty, but it won't replace conventional television for a long, long time. If ever. \u001d  Despite the new competition, I remain as bullish on the cable-television business now as I was when, in a cover story more than two years ago (\"Home Front,\" March 7, 2005), I declared the industry to be the best bet for investing in the home-media market, or, a few months earlier, I wrote an upbeat cover piece on Comcast (\"The Cable Company That Could,\" Dec. 27, 2004). Skeptics see all sorts of threats to cable, though. They worry that the Bells are going to knock them off with fiber-optic TV systems. They fret about content providers delivering their stuff to consumers directly over the 'Net. They fear that the widespread adoption of digital- video recorders will screw up the TV industry's advertising model. And that's fine. All that worrying is good for investors; it has created cheap stocks. \u001d  As I noted on my blog a few days ago, cable analyst Craig Moffett of Bernstein Research recently issued a report that demonstrates just how negative the Street has become on cable stocks. Moffett took a look at the valuations of the nonfinancial stocks in the S&P 500 on the basis of multiples of Ebitda -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a common measure of cash flow -- and found that the stocks in the sector look incredibly cheap. In fact, Moffett contends Comcast (ticker: CMCSA), by far the largest player in pay television, ranks among the 15 cheapest stocks in the S&P 500. Moffett, perhaps the Street's most astute cable analyst, last week raised his price targets on both Comcast and Time Warner Cable (TWC), as well as satellite-TV providers DirecTV (DTV) and EchoStar (DISH). \u001d  There are all kinds of reasons to be bullish on cable. Their voice-over Internet Protocol operations are taking market share from the Bells in local phone service. They are direct beneficiaries of plunging prices -- and consumer enthusiasm -- for high def. (If you have a high-def set, you want high-def content.) And they are becoming less-capital-intensive businesses -- ergo, they are becoming cash-generation machines. \u001d  OK, you say, but cable is going to get killed, or at least wounded, by the spread of video content on the Internet...isn't it? Well, Internet video poses a challenge for Comcast and its brethren, but it isn't going to kill them off. Or even wound them. Moffett notes that just 1% of all video consumed is delivered via Internet Protocol; 2% is from DVD rentals; traditional TV accounts for the other 97%. He also notes that the number of hours of traditional TV consumed per household keeps rising; in 2006 it hit a record higher of 57.62 hours a week. \u001d  Meanwhile, keep in mind that Comcast is the nation's largest provider of broadband Internet access and keeps taking market share from DSL. In any case, I simply do not see very many people pulling the plug on their cable box in favor of Web-based video. If nothing else, it is still too hard to get high-def content over a conventional Internet-access line. Note that the video on iTunes, for instance, is not high-def; in fact, it is below DVD quality. High-def video files are too large for the average 'Net connections to handle in a reasonable time period. \u001d  And another thing: Think for a moment about the enormous buzz around the final episode of The Sopranos, which may have been the single most anticipated hour of television since whoever-it-was shot J.R. (I think it involved Phil Leotardo, back when he was whacking guys in the oil patch.) The Sopranos was old-fashioned appointment TV -- even if you had the appointment with your DVR, as I did. It provided something online video lacks: a shared experience. The morning after the episode aired, the chatter about that abrupt cut to black, the suspicious dude at the bar and Meadow's parallel-parking troubles was almost deafening. Let's see a YouTube video do that. \u001d  Let me give you a few more factoids on the overstated demise of conventional television. Apple (AAPL) has become cautious in its view of the AppleTV devices, which link iTunes content to flat-panel televisions; Steve Jobs now describes AppleTV as \"a hobby,\" as opposed to a business. And at a media briefing in San Francisco last week, Sony (SNE) said it plans to sell a line of low-priced flat panels via Wal-Mart, Target and other discounters. It was a sign flat panels are going mainsteam -- another positive for cable companies. \u001d  And here's one more: There are growing signs that Hollywood is getting comfortable with the concept of releasing movies on DVD and on cable pay-per-view at the same time. The current approach is to release on DVD first, pay-per-view later. But tests show that in places where the new approach has been tried out, DVD sales actually improved. Rentals dipped; but the studios make a lot more on PPV. Good for Comcast, not so good for Netflix (NFLX). \u001d  Speaking of Netflix, I noted last week that I was not buying rumors it was about to be acquired by Amazon.com (AMZN). Subsequently, the buzz faded and the stock retreated. Adding pressure: Blockbuster (BBI) last week made an aggressive move to cut prices on DVD-by-mail rental plans. The news was a blow to the Netflix bulls, who had been hoping that Blockbuster would raise prices and enable Netflix to do the same. There is going to be a market for DVD-rental services for years to come, but the sector faces increasing threats from many directions, not the least of which is an expanded set of choices on cable video-on-demand systems, combined with wider adoption of DVRs. There's video everywhere. I don't need to rent more of it. My family dropped Netflix months ago; I see little urgency to come back. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: eric.savitz@barrons.com. \u001d  --- \u001d  Visit my blog at blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"40b2fb171e6a528c0dccac74bf89c8b2","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Airbus CEO Reiterates EADS Doesn't Need To Raise Money Now","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","ARO","ASP","XCA4","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XMDAX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 08:00 ET (12:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4281064a4765f12fef845cb38733d3d3","symR":["6361.TO","JP3166000004"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Ebara Develops Effective Cancer Drug Delivery System -Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T16:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6361.TO","JP3166000004"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","FAC","X225","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Ebara Corp.

The one-time telecom highflier has been mired in one scandal after another. Yet for some value-oriented optimists, it continues to fuel starry-eyed dreams of a turnaround. \u001d  Their misguided bets seem to keep the shares from hitting zero, despite the company's failure to file earnings reports since last June and its potential delisting by Nasdaq. That's to say nothing of ongoing investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission into alleged options backdating and insider trading. For good measure, the feds are conducting separate inquiries into various bribery accusations. \u001d  The latest red flag to fly at the Alameda, Calif., company was the June 1 resignation of co-founder Ying Wu, who had been head of the company's bulwark China operations. Not only is Wu the linchpin between UTStarcom (ticker: UTSI) and key bureaucrats and business leaders in China -- by far, its most important market -- he also was supposed to be the next CEO. \u001d  The shares have plunged 21%, to a recent 5.71, since Wu quit, and are a fraction of their bubble-era high of 87.50, hit in March 2000. UTStarcom was formed by a merger between Wu's Starcom Network Systems, an equipment reseller to Chinese telecoms, and Unitech Telecom, a developer of wireless technology aimed at China, which was started by current UTStarcom CEO Hong Liang Lu. The merged company was backed by Masayoshi Son, the dot-com billionaire who founded Japan's Softbank. It went public in 2000, amassing a post-IPO stock-market value exceeding $5 billion. Son, who hit a home run with his 1990s investment in Yahoo!, was UTStarcom's chairman until March 2003. \u001d  The reason for Wu's abrupt departure is unclear. A company spokesman says Wu left because of \"differences of opinion in strategy.\" One thing is clear: He's now free to unload some of his 4.7 million shares. \u001d  Frankly, it's darn near impossible to know what's going on, because UTStarcom hasn't provided meaningful information in nearly a year. Even when making mandatory filings, UTStarcom is stealthy. On the Friday before last Christmas, it revealed that it had received an SEC Wells notice -- a notification that the agency may begin enforcement proceedings -- several days before. \u001d  The money-losing company (as of its last filing) hasn't filed financials with the SEC for the past three quarters because of a self-imposed internal investigation into options backdating, the spokesman says. The company will update shareholders on the probe when it finally reports financials, says the spokesman, who couldn't say when that would be. \u001d  Before the company went quiet, sales of its broadband gear, wireless gear, handsets and services were slipping. But UTStarcom is still out there pitching. A publicist invited me to see its latest wares -- Internet video technology -- at the coming week's megatelecom trade show, NXTcomm, in Chicago. Critics contend that the company's IPTV products are more hype than substance. \u001d  Before UTStarcom acquired Audiovox's cellular unit in late 2004, its key product had been its personal-access system, a low-end wireless phone that linked China's swelling urban masses to land lines. As higher-end phones provided by the likes of China Mobile (CHL) became more affordable, sales of UTStarcom's handsets have been in decline. So has the company. \u001d  --- \u001d  e-mail: mark.veverka@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"45939d86e1c5ab96aa0336b0b89ea58f","symR":["LEH","US5249081002"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) The Rise Of The House Of Lehman: -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LEH","US5249081002"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\u001d  Lehman today earns more money overseas than any investment bank besides Goldman.

And even before his dreaded knock on the door, the mere premonition of his presence exerts a heart-stopping chill. \u001d  Just ask poor Stephen A. Schwarzman, the guiding genius behind the rise of the private-equity goliath Blackstone Group. \u001d  Mr. Schwarzman, who has spent countless sweaty hours digging up prospective acquisitions and hammering out deals -- dark and dirty work that he uncomplainingly undertook because of a profound conviction that someone had to do it -- is on the brink of reaping a well-deserved reward for his valiant labors. But that joyous moment has been suddenly shrouded by the long shadow of the tax man. \u001d  What makes the sorrow of this rude intrusion all the more poignant is that Mr. Schwarzman, in a noble show of altruism, desired that ordinary folk partake of his good fortune by enabling them, through the agency of an initial public offering, to participate in Blackstone's bountiful future. It speaks volumes about his innate generosity that even the threat of the heavy hand of government has not stayed his determination to share ownership of Blackstone with Jane and John Q. Public. \u001d  Alas, even as we write, the Congress is devising ways and means to tamp down the entrepreneurial spirit that burns so brightly in brave risk-takers like Mr. Schwarzman by subjecting them to a painful tax bite. \u001d  More specifically, private-equity outfits and hedge funds, once they are publicly traded, will become subject to the 35% tax that your typical corporation must pay, instead of the less-onerous 15% rate levied on capital gains they now enjoy. (Congress is showing unwonted sensitivity, lest it cause too much pain to the fine citizens who run private-equity enterprises and hedge funds, not a few of whom also happen to be substantial campaign contributors, by delaying for five years the day the sharply higher rate would take effect). \u001d  To a lesser mortal than Mr. Schwarzman, this prospective change could prove traumatic, for it means that because of the impact on the likely market value of Blackstone, he no longer will be a $7.5 billion man, but merely a $6 billion man. To his credit, this stunning reduction in net worth has not caused him to shed so much as a tear -- at least in public. Nor has it deterred him from unselfishly pressing ahead with Blackstone's IPO. \u001d  On that score, we are fully confident that the ogre of a stiffer tax rate down the road will not discourage other private-equity groups and hedge funds from following the lead of Blackstone, and hedge-fund giant Fortress in going public. \u001d  For not the least of the commendable things that impels them to take the plunge is an exquisite sense of timing, manifest in an eagerness to cash in while the cashing in is so incredibly good -- a worthy sentiment only intensified by the market's scorching rebound that all but wiped out the damage and the memory of the previous week's tumble. \u001d  In short, if by some mischance you fail to get any Blackstone on the offering, don't despair. For unless the portents are all wet, there'll be plenty of opportunity to own a piece of private equity or a hedge fund, whose managers are just as avid as Mr. Schwarzman to share the wealth with even the humblest investor. \b \u001d  There's no inflation -- except for such necessities of daily sustenance as food, gasoline and The Wall Street Journal (which, in case you were too busy having a jolly time at the beach to notice when it was disclosed, next month will fetch $1.50 a copy rather than the current buck). But those are obviously exceptions that prove the point, for none constitutes a component of core inflation, so, in the larger economic scheme of things, how significant can any of them be? \u001d  Once again last week, confronted by a disquieting indication that inflation is alive and virulent -- namely, that the producer-price index shot up 0.9% in May -- the Emile Coue chorus in the Street rushed to reassure the investing masses by singing their anthem of everything gets better every day, citing the much more demure 0.2% rise in core producer prices as incontrovertible evidence. And, we're pleased to say, the masses were sufficiently reassured to shrug off the downbeat data and send the market bounding ahead. \u001d  And, of course, fresh fuel for the bulls came the very next morning as that same Coue chorus -- or should we more properly call them \"core-ists\" -- seized on release of the consumer-price index as confirmation that all's well on the inflation front. What better proof, they exulted, than the miserly 0.1% uptick in the CPI -- once you take out pesky items like food and energy. As for the 0.7% rise in the CPI when food and energy are included, \"pshaw,\" they scoffed, that's just the \"headline number\"! \u001d  For the life of us, we must confess, we don't quite understand why \"headline\" is a pejorative. Do those contemptuous of us benighted souls who award it more serious notice laugh and sneer when a banner headline in their daily proclaims, \"War Is Declared\" or \"World's Tallest Building Collapses\" or \"Mets Win\"? \u001d  We've no objection, of course, to anything that makes people happy, even if it's a patently ersatz invention of the Federal Reserve conceived in the '70s when that august body was desperate to find a semantic antidote to the heaving inflation of the time. So at the behest of the then cantankerous chairman, Arthur Burns, it tossed out first energy and then food from the standard calculation of inflation. The result, lo and behold!, was \"core inflation,\" which has served nicely over the years to dim the perception of inflation and buoy spirits on Wall Street, if not in the real world whose inhabitants have to cope best they can with rising prices. (Please don't accuse us of being anti-semantic; our source is the redoubtable Steve Roach, who was one of the economic-spear carriers at the Fed back then.) \u001d  And we're also aware that the price of certain commodities has plummeted. DRAM prices, as we noted some weeks back, have suffered a huge markdown. Moreover, the Journal reports that a gram of cocaine, which sold for around $200 barely a decade ago, can be bought these days for as little as $20 (which perhaps tells you more about the no-inflation crew's recreational habits than the legitimacy of their overall analysis). \u001d  Bur for ordinary folks like us who don't dabble in DRAMS or do coke, such instances of lower prices might as well be snippets of fluff. The stuff, essential and not so essential both, we must fork over our hard-earned dough to acquire has been getting inexorably more costly for quite a spell now. And to judge by the action in the commodities markets -- wheat at an 11-year high, crude at a nine-month peak, etc. after sad etc. -- we might as well grimace and bear it, and draw what solace we can from the knowledge that core inflation is so meek. \b \u001d  With the stock market in full throttle again, it may seem silly to talk about new ways to sell short, very much akin to holding a serious discussion on new ways to lose money. We mean, why should anyone give a darn? \u001d  Well, if curiosity killed a cat, a lack of it has proved innumerably more fatal. Besides, one thing we do know about the stock market is that when everyone is gazing skyward, it's never a bad idea to take a quick peek down. And, stubborn cuss that we are, we can't shake the notion that denial and delusion are positively toxic as long-term investment guides, no matter how rewarding they are when the market's in a manic mood, as it has been these past few years. \u001d  Forgive our homilies and we'll get down to the point. Chatting with an old buddy who boasts a long history of successful investing -- mostly, we should note, on the long side -- we got the distinct impression that he was more than slightly antsy about the investment climate. A little impolite probing (we said he's an old buddy) revealed that while he hadn't by any means emptied his portfolio of stocks -- he favors big boring things that, come what may, are apt to be around, as he expects to be, for the next 100 years or so -- he has been seeking a little protection against a bad turn with some short sales. \u001d  When pressed for names, he went mute, but finally owned up to being very bearish on commercial REITs, a sector recently covered in a well-wrought negative story in this very magazine by Andrew Bary. We were particularly struck, though, by the medium through which he chose to do his shorting: namely, the latest members of the exponentially growing population of exchange-traded funds, managed by an outfit called ProShares. \u001d  Besides the relative rarity of funds that satisfy a bearish bias, our friend points out that, in contrast to an outright short sale, such ETFs offer the possibility of gaining long-term capital-gains treatment. They do so because the investor who acquires their shares goes long; he actually buys the ETFs, which, in turn, do the shorting of the stocks. The 29 such ETFs in the ProShares stable encompass a wide range of stock indexes and sectors. \u001d  They've been introduced over the past year, which obviously hasn't been an especially auspicious stretch to be negative on equities, as their performances by and large are melancholy reminders. But, as ventured at the top of this screed, markets do go down and sometimes sharply. And should that happen one of these months, the bears will come roaring out of the woods, even out of the woodwork. \u001d  At the very least, we thought it couldn't hurt to know about this particular permutation in ETFs, just in case. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4af84a76af3dddcd270536bb88039e7b","symR":["BA","US0970231058"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Boeing, Jet Airways Bring New Look and Comfort to Paris","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T19:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BA","US0970231058"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LE BOURGET, France, June 16 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Displaying its new livery, Jet Airways' recently delivered Boeing (NYSE: BA) 777-300ER arrived Saturday in Le Bourget, France, ahead of Monday's opening of the 47th Paris Air Show. \b \u001d  The airplane's livery isn't the only change for India's largest private airline.

And so, last week's inflation numbers -- high on the headline, tame on the \"core\" -- were rendered as good enough excuses to rally. \u001d  It's fashionable on Wall Street to strike a maverick's pose and carp that \"nobody\" recognizes the real threat of inflation that's being papered-over by the supposed deceit of government data pushers. Yet the just-released Merrill Lynch fund-manager survey for June shows a net 47% of respondents saying core inflation will be higher in the next year, up from a net 11% in March. \u001d  So, looking for more inflation is anything but a contrarian stance. And if there's a buildup of inflationary danger, it's in the process of being absorbed by the market. \u001d  What stocks were suggesting is that they're not finished going up just yet, and have no interest in letting patient investors in. As soon as bond yields quit levitating on Tuesday, stocks fed off the rapidly accumulated investor anxiety of the prior week to rebound to new highs. \u001d  It confirms, for now, the silver-lining aspect of the bond selloff: The surge in 10-year Treasury yields above 5.25% was not mainly about inflation expectations, but rather a readjustment of growth prospects, observable in abiding strength in corporate-credit markets. \u001d  Perhaps it's a bit unsettling that the stock market has tried to discount the interest-rate move so rapidly. If that sharp but brief scare was all we're to get in the way of pullbacks, it will probably produce the market's version of the belligerent drunk's \"liquid courage.\" Too much pain-deadening liquidity leads to picking battles with increasingly dangerous opponents, to painful ends. \u001d  We didn't get a true fear-propelled purge of stocks producing a washed-out state and a low-risk entry. Now we're back to a condition where stocks couldn't easily shrug off another upleg in rates or a drought-induced commodity shock or another rupture in the subprime-mortgage market. \u001d  Professional traders now have the tools to lunge at stock exposure quickly when the strong stuff gets flowing again, as exhibited by the massive surge in Standard & Poor's 500 exchange-traded-fund assets last week. Foreigners, never great market timers, have also been heavy buyers this year. \u001d  And yet, the public has no time for stocks, with traditional domestic stock funds losing still more assets. The absence of public excitement is probably the largest factor arguing against an imminent market top, despite the age of this bull market, the stretched earnings cycle and the unattractive valuation of the average stock. \u001d  Two consecutive pages of a fresh Ned Davis Research presentation packet neatly illustrate the opposing currents in the market. The first is a chart of the trailing price/earnings ratio of the median S&P 500 stock. Now above 20, it's at a level that implies subpar forward market returns. \u001d  Yet the next page shows the historically massive volume of equities being taken off the market by buyouts and buybacks over the past 12 quarters, a streak only about half as long as similar runs in the '80s and '90s. \u001d  The supply/demand setup and the tape's resiliency are the central reasons to give the market the benefit of the doubt. This, however, is no secret: Stocks have risen the past 13 Fridays in a row anticipating merger Monday, so the hunt for the increasingly price-insensitive marginal buyer is well entrenched in the Wall Street psyche. \b \u001d  Anyone seeking the perfect stock to satisfy the market's most intense fetishes could do worse than CB Richard Ellis (CBG). A big commercial real-estate broker, it sits where easy money flows into overpriced office buildings. And, it's a China/India story. And a busy acquirer. \u001d  The stock has more than tripled in the past two years, to a new all-time high of 39.40 at last quote, and fetches 18 times aggressive 2007 profit forecasts. It has outperformed real-estate investment trusts, as investors figure that CB Richard Ellis is a mere facilitator of extreme property values. The Street is unanimously in love with the stock -- nine analysts, nine Buys. \u001d  CEO Brett White addressed office values in the Wall Street Journal of June 6: \"You still have this massive wall of liquidity looking for a home. Since 2001, commercial real estate as an asset class has been viewed very favorably relative to other asset classes.\" \u001d  There you have it again, \"liquidity\" as the one-word non-answer to \"what's it worth.\" Only believers in the youth of the liquidity/hard-asset melt-up should buy this stock. \u001d  --- \u001d  e-mail: michael.santoli@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"53a96e9e595f7cfbcb7282a6abc64c99","symR":["BID","BSC","DJ","EVST","FIG","GS","NKE","PENN","PSO","PSON.LN","UA","GB0006776081","US38141G1040"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) The Trader: In The Mood For A Rousing Rally","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BID","BSC","DJ","EVST","FIG","GS","NKE","PENN","PSO","PSON.LN","UA","GB0006776081","US38141G1040"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","CLO","CNO","CSV","FOT","MED","PUB","SCR","TEX","XDJGI","XFFX","XFT1","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Kopin Tan \u001d  The numbers did not look great. Retail sales improved 1.4% in May, but the rise was boosted by pricier gas. Consumer prices jumped 0.7% last month, the fastest pace in 20 months, though economists who acknowledged neither food nor gas saw a more benign uptick. Late payments and foreclosures on adjustable-rate mortgages rose to an all-time high. And oil futures pushing $68 a barrel suggests pump prices are headed higher. \u001d  But a stock market that lately has had more mood swings than a teenage girl tapped into its inner optimist last week and concluded the world just looks better. So what if Treasury yields near a five-year high point to rising borrowing costs that could slow profit growth? The important thing is that they've stopped climbing -- for now. \u001d  And so what if stocks aren't screamingly cheap? In a liquid world, and compared with real estate, bonds or metals, the stock market manages to look...somewhat safe and chaste. That honor may seem as dubious as being called the least-ugly contestant in a beauty pageant, but it was enough for a winning performance. \u001d  The stock market rebounded late last week from its early-June selloff, giving the Dow Jones Industrial Average its best three-day percentage-point gain since November 2004. The blue-chip benchmark even nudged briefly above its June 4 record close on Friday; it ended the week up 215, or 1.6%, to 13,639. The Standard & Poor's 500 has rallied in five of the past six sessions and added 25, or 1.7%, to 1533. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased 53, or 2.1%, to 2627, while the Russell 2000 index of small stocks climbed 13, or 1.5%, to 848. \u001d  Bulls, of course, relish the emphatic rebound. But market pullbacks increasingly have gotten shorter and shallower largely because money managers rush faithfully to buy every dip, a strategy that pays off...until it doesn't. \u001d  There are reasons for such optimism, not least of which is the bull run's unflinching recent track record. But there was also a growing sense that rising bond yields were egged on not by inflation but by global economic strength, and the hope that long-term rates might stabilize in a new range not quite high enough to thwart growth. \u001d  \"The bond market is now priced more appropriately for rebounding economic activity, rising rates overseas and major foreign buyers diversifying away from dollar-denominated debt,\" says Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. He sees the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield flitting between 4.75% and 5.25%. \u001d  Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin recently counted 18 companies within the S&P 500 scheduled to be bought, representing some $232 billion in market value. All but two of these pending mergers are all-cash deals, and Kostin expects \"a large portion of the cash received by investors will probably be redeployed to the current constituents of the S&P 500.\" \u001d  Higher borrowing costs take time to exact their toll on private-equity profits; until then, the prowl for targets is apt to continue putting a floor beneath stock prices. \u001d  Last week, shares of the energy market Nymex (ticker: NMX) jumped 13% on speculation it is mulling a merger. Dow Jones (DJ), the publisher of Barron's, ticked up Friday on reports that Pearson (PSO), publisher of the Financial Times, is rallying partners and contemplating a bid. And Penn National Gaming (PENN) agreed to be acquired by private-equity firms including Fortress Investment Group (FIG). But Fortress' own stock sagged 6% on worries over proposed legislation seeking to raise private-equity taxes. \u001d  Eventually, woes once brushed aside return to dog the market. The subprime fallout -- anyone remember the subprime fallout? -- was blamed last week by Bear Stearns (BSC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) for crimping second-quarter profits. The investment banks say subprime delinquencies haven't spread to other parts of the mortgage market, but caution that the worst isn't yet over. \b \u001d  It was another busy week for buyout and hedge-fund types. Oh, there were companies to be browsed, but that's what the staff is for. The serious buying was being done at Art Basel, the contemporary art fair where recurring red dots were this year's most prominent motif. And in London, the Russian art sale set another record as Konstantin Somov's \"The Rainbow\" fetched six times its top estimate. \u001d  Sotheby's shares (BID) climbed 5.8% on the week amid the continued art-buying clamor. At about 49, shares have rallied 42% since they were flagged in Barron's last fall (\"Time to Bid!\" Oct. 9, 2006), but they could climb higher still. \u001d  Summer was traditionally a lull in the art world, and the established trade was to sell Sotheby's at the height of the spring auctions, when the stock price peaked with the annual buzz. And, indeed, Sotheby's shares have pulled back since late April. But the throngs of billionaires from the world's assorted booms (oil, metals, private equity) have padded the art-world calendar, and expansive new lofts call for -- no, need! -- a Rothko, or a Pollock, or a Warhol... \u001d  So this week, the conspicuous consumers will flock to London for the Impressionists and contemporary art sales, and the recent track record suggests Sotheby's estimates may again be conservative. Record New York sales in May already bode well for the second-quarter earnings Sotheby's will report in early August, and Robbert van Batenburg, Louis Capital's head of research, expects earnings per share as high as $1.72 to beat consensus estimates of $1.34. The third quarter will kick off with the much-anticipated auction of Turner watercolors in London. \u001d  Among other catalysts: nearly $297 million in auction guarantees for which the mid-estimate sale prices are adding up to $329 million, and the profit boost from the sterling pound's 7% surge this year against the dollar. \u001d  A duopoly with privately held Christie's ensures strong pricing power, and both auction houses raised commissions this year by more than 10%. With Christie's snagging more market share in 2006's fall auctions, and Sotheby's regaining some of that this year, Sotheby's is \"carrying considerable momentum into the back half of 2007\" and faces easier year-over-year comparisons, notes Wedbush Morgan analyst Rommel Dionisio. \u001d  Sure, the art-auction business has famously high costs, and Sotheby's as a play on big spenders isn't a new idea. But recent skepticism works in the stock's favor. The billionaire Eli Broad last week pronounced Art Basel prices overvalued -- even as he reached for his first purchase of a Jeff Wall photograph. More than 11% of Sotheby's float is sold short, hardly a picture of runaway optimism seen at a stock peak. \u001d  Gasp-inducing prices for new art further increase demand for the kind of established works handled by Sotheby's and Christie's. Sotheby's June show, for example, includes a rare Monet (\"Nympheas\"), a Matisse (\"Danseuse dans le fauteuil\") and marquee names that quicken status-conscious pulses. \u001d  More important, record prices motivate \"otherwise reluctant owners to bring their pieces to the market,\" Van Batenburg adds. \"This emergence of more highly valued works of art not only generates higher revenue with higher margins, but also fuels the auction hype.\" The art boom won't last forever, but it can last a little longer (and typically crests only after the stock market does). Van Batenburg sees the stock pushing 66 by year end. \b \u001d  The boxing-equipment company Everlast (EVST) has a bantamweight market cap and a middleweight brand, but the fight over its future has all the drama of a heavyweight brawl. \u001d  In one corner is a management team that has nimbly steered shares up 560% over the past 19 months, but which delivered a surprise blow this month that floored some investors: a curiously hasty agreement to sell Everlast for a curiously low price. In the other corner is a growing group of short-changed stockholders who vow to fight the deal. \u001d  At stake is a New York company, founded in 1910, that makes an expanding line of sports apparel. But Everlast is most famous for the boxing gloves, punching bags and assorted gear worn by the likes of Muhammed Ali and Mike Tyson -- and by big-screen bruisers from Stallone to Swank. \u001d  The first uppercut landed June 1. Management announced an agreement to sell Everlast for $146 million, or $26.50 a share, to the Hidary Group, an investor outfit well-acquainted with the brand since it's one of its licensees. The all-cash deal offered investors a premium of 14.5% to the stock's May 31 closing price, or 30% above the average price in May. That may seem adequate were it not for the stock's upward trajectory, and the recent regularity with which Everlast raises forecasts and then beats them. \u001d  A 30-day \"go shop\" clause for Everlast to find a better bid looks insincere next to the $4.5 million breakup fee. Also curious was the June 4 agreement by CEO Seth Horowitz to vote the 19.2% of shares he controls in support of the Hidary offer --  even if a better offer emerges. It also did not escape investors' notice that Horowitz's employment contract was recently amended to remove limits on payments he might receive following a change of control. \u001d  The reply came swiftly. Aquamarine Capital, which holds a 2.3% stake, says it will vote against the low-ball offer. Since price is the decisive arbiter of cash bids, \"why didn't the board of directors run an auction or actively take other measures to get the best possible price?\" asks Jeff Lick, managing member of Galt Investments, which holds a 4% stake. Lick believes logical buyers including Nike (NKE), Adidas, Puma and Under Armour (UA) -- all hefty enough to flick away management if they bought the brand -- weren't contacted. \u001d  The unasked question among these firms' carefully lawyered missives: Why would management agree to an un-shopped lowball offer from an affiliate? Through a representative, Horowitz declined comment. \u001d  Meanwhile, Everlast shares have climbed above the bid and are trading at about 27.50. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"56d6252c96a4569de7c1595fbba28c9a","symR":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Barron's Roundtable: Room To Run -4-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","BAN","BNK","BRD","BVG","CHC","CHM","CMT","CNO","CPR","CSV","CTS","DST","FAC","FOD","FTS","HIM","IDD","ISV","LOD","MED","OFP","OIS","RES","RTS","SAP","SEM","SFT","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTT","XSTX","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  A: Zulauf: The primary trend in equities remains bullish and intact. We are going through the business cycle and the financial-market cycle in steps, and the first step is usually disbelief after a recession. The second step is belief and growth, as the numbers come through in the corporate sector. Then we go into over-belief. The market probably is at the threshhold of over-belief. The fundamentals are fine. I do not see anything that should stop the world economy from expanding. We probably have another two to three years to go, because interest rates are still relatively low in most countries compared to growth rates. \b \u001d  Q: Does it trouble you that this seems to be the consensus view? \u001d  A: Not yet. So far the valuation case for equities remains intact. In Europe, corporate-bond yields are up to 5% or so. Large-cap equities -- and my thesis applies only to large caps -- trade at around 14 times trailing earnings. This gives you an earnings yield of 7%, versus a 5% bond yield, which provides a cushion for the stock market. The spread is a bit less in the U.S., but the economic framework is in favor of equities and not in favor of bonds. \u001d  In January I thought the market would probably have a decent year, although with a mild and a sharp correction. We had a mild and short correction in late spring, and likely will get a sharper one in the third quarter. But this is not going to be the end of the bull market. It will shake out a lot of investors, and then the market will go up again. Eventually, the difference between a 7% earnings yield and a 5% bond yield will be arbitraged away through all sorts of merger and acquisi-tion activity, corporate buybacks, private-equity deals and such. \b \u001d  Q: In other words, bond yields will rise? \u001d  A: Suddenly, it seems, everyone agrees the secular downtrend in yields is over, and cyclically and probably secularly yields are on the way up. So far the back-up in yields has not been driven by rising rates of inflation, because inflation in industrial and emerging economies is behaving well. In the later stages of the cycle, inflation will turn up, but it's the supply/demand situation that is driving bonds now. There is less demand. The corporate sector is seeing deteriorating free cash flow because of more capital expenditures. Private-equity companies are buying equities and selling bonds. Also, nations that are running large surpluses, like China and Russia, have announced they plan to buy more equities and other assets, not just government bonds. It's a step-by-step process. \u001d  It's possible that some of the big guys -- not only hedge funds and private-equity funds, but pension funds and insurance companies -- will lose their nerve as bond yields push higher, which could cause a snowball effect. Everybody is a short-term hedger these days. A steep selloff in stocks would be bad for those who have big long positions and are very leveraged. But it also offers opportunities to re-enter the market on the long side. You'll want to re-enter by buying the leaders and dominant themes. These days, it's all about the rise of China. \b \u001d  Q: That's a broad theme. How would you play China's rise? \u001d  A: Chinese shares may be in the early stages of a bubble. I'm not recommending them at 40 times earnings, but they could easily trade at 100 times earnings in 12 to 18 months. As an alternative, you could buy the Hong Kong H shares, which are half the price. These companies are registered in China, but trade in Hong Kong. I also like emerging markets, such as Korea and Brazil, which I would buy on a correction for a 12-month play. The Canadian market, which is largely a bet on natural resources, looks good too. It plays into the China theme. Capital-goods, industrial, materials and energy companies also will be core leaders in this cycle. \u001d  You can still buy the grains, particularly wheat. There has been quite a euphoria regarding corn, which suggests the wheat harvest may disappoint in quantity. If the weather turns bad, wheat could take off in a big way. On the negative side, look at acutely interest-rate sensitive companies and industries, such as real-estate companies in Spain and the U.K. The Spanish housing boom has been much, much bigger as a proportion of the Spanish economy than the boom in the U.S., and the excesses are much greater. Domestic Spanish banks also look risky. \b \u001d  Q: That stands to reason, if they have loaned to the real-estate companies. \u001d  A: In January, I recommended buying volatility through the VIX index, which still makes sense. If the market goes from belief to over-belief, volatility will increase. I'm also a big fan of natural gas at current prices, around $7.50 per million Btu. There have been production cuts in Canada, and about 10% of U.S. natural-gas fields have been depleted. The supply side is going to tighten up, and inventory levels are close to average. If the summer proves hot, demand could rise and the market could be tight, leading to a run in prices. Also, natural-gas facilities could sustain damage during the hurricane season. Natural gas still is trading well below the equivalent price of crude oil. It is a good value. \b \u001d  Q: How do European markets look to you, Felix? \u001d  A: It is interesting that American investors aren't very excited about Europe, except for those in the financial-services industry. In several European countries, you're seeing tax cuts, which is new and a positive development. The election of Nicolas Sarkozy as president of France is good for Europe because his agenda to reform France, and the French economy is supply-side driven. He's no Ronald Reagan, but at least it is a step in the right direction. Also, Europe is the cheapest major market. Large-cap companies are trading for only 14 times trailing earnings. \b \u001d  Sounds good. Thank you. \b \u001d  ARCHIE MacALLASTER \b \u001d  Q: Where does the market go from here, Archie? \u001d  MacAllaster: I see 2 1/2% inflation, 2 1/2% GDP growth and profits up maybe 6% or 7% on the year. The S&P 500 trades for just under 17 times earnings. It is a stockpicker's market -- the kind of market I like. When they're selling everything, it's no fun, and when they're buying everything, you can't make a difference. I thought the market would be flat this year, and it is up incredibly. By year end, who knows? \b \u001d  Q: At least you're honest. \u001d  A: If you take a longer-term view, stocks are not that expensive. A lot of bank stocks are cheap. I own four of the five largest, but I want to concentrate on Wells Fargo [WFC]. It is trading at around 35 and pays out $1.12 a share. The yield is 3.15%. It has shown consistent growth over many years. For the past 20 years Wells has averaged 14% annual growth in earnings, on 12% revenue growth. For the past five years earnings have increased by 21% a year, on average, and revenue by 11%. This year both will be up 10%-11%. The stock sells for 12 times our 2008 estimated earnings, compared with 16 or 17 times for the S&P. Wells Fargo will earn about $2.75 a share this year and $3 to $3.10 next. It is cheap, though it trades at a premium to most other large-bank stocks. But it deserves to. Under 12 times earnings, it's a buy. It consistently earns a 19%-22% return on equity, which is quite unusual. \b \u001d  Q: Wouldn't a back-up in interest rates pose problems? \u001d  A: No. Wells says it has 80 different businesses. If they get squeezed on interest rates a bit, other businesses will take up the slack. Besides, a spread is opening between yields on two-year and 10-year Treasuries that will help these banks. The company has raised its dividend for 19 years. They will probably raise it at least three cents this year, which is a gain of more than 10%. That gives you a yield of 3.5%. Wells Fargo is in the fastest-growing part of the country -- the West. My 12-month target price is 42. \b \u001d  Q: How about another recommendation? \u001d  A: I have recommended refinery stocks before, and they have worked out well. Valero Energy [VLO] is the biggest. It sells for 74 a share, and the dividend is 48 cents. It yields less than 1%. Valero is the largest refining company in the U.S., with daily capacity of more than three million barrels. This is roughly 30% of the total refining capacity in the U.S. and Canada. Spreads [between crude and refined oil prices] have been enormous and most people caution that this is a cyclical business, or at least it has been in the past. But it has become enormously expensive to build refineries, and none has been built in the U.S. for years. Valero will make a lot of money with these spreads. \b \u001d  Q: How wide are they, exactly? \u001d  A: They've been running as high as $20 a barrel, on average. Valero's spreads are high to begin with. About 65% of its feedstock is heavy crude, which is much more complex to refine, so that increases spreads plenty. My earnings estimates are higher than most analysts'. In 2007 they will earn between $9 and $9.50 a share. Next year they'll do between $10 and $11.50. The stock is good for 100 bucks within 12 months. \u001d  Additionally, Valero bought back about 5% of its stock last year and intends to buy in another 5% or possibly much more. The company is selling a refinery in the Midwest on which they have had three or four bids, and will end up cash-rich. They could even pay some kind of special dividend. \u001d  Lyondell Chemical [LYO], which I recommended in January, might be in play. A Russian-American billionaire, Leonard Blavatnik, bought options to purchase about 8% of the company through Merrill Lynch. He was one of three or four people who bid on General Electric's [GE] plastics business, which was sold to the Saudis. He bid $8 or $9 billion, and has enough money to make a bid for Lyondell. \b \u001d  Q: What could the company go for? \u001d  A: About 44 or 45 share. It currently trades for 37. If a deal doesn't happen and you wait a few more years, you'll get even more. \b \u001d  Thanks, Archie. \b \u001d  SCOTT BLACK \b \u001d  Q: What do you make of this market, Scott? \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5c17ab6e0f8183f190e6f48296b72c8b","symR":["000001.SZ","R","CN0005810378","US7835491082"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Shenzhen Devt Bank Plans Up To CNY8B Hybrid Bond","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["000001.SZ","R","CN0005810378","US7835491082"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","TRS","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"661c4b5201a49e932cf8de156b61f8cd","symR":["NWA","US6672801015","NWA","US6672801015"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Northwest Airlines Begins Detroit-Brussels Nonstop Service","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T13:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NWA","US6672801015"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA"],"Story":"\b   Brussels is Northwest's sixth nonstop trans-Atlantic destination \bEAGAN, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2007-- \u001d  Northwest Airlines (NYSE:NWA), in cooperation with its joint venture partner KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, today continued the expansion of its European flight network with the start of daily nonstop service between Northwest's WorldGateway at Detroit hub and Brussels, Belgium.

Norton \u001d  What looks good to corporate China? U.S. stocks. \u001d  That's what the steward of the purse at one of China's largest insurers, Ping An Insurance, says. If he's right, that eventually could be very good news for U.S. equities, as Beijing moves to ease rules curbing capital outflows to slow the swift buildup of foreign currency that is putting upward pressure on the yuan. \u001d  To get a bigger return on its $1.3 trillion foreign-exchange pile, China is venturing into higher-risk investments, including a nearly 10% stake in private-equity group Blackstone. In coming weeks, Beijing is widely expected to let Chinese insurers boost the percentage of assets that they can invest outside the mainland, to 15% from 5% now, and to allow insurers to invest in shares in London and in New York. \u001d  Thus, John Pearce, Ping An's chief investment officer, is reviewing his global strategy. Pearce and Ping An's chief financial officer, Louis Chi Yan Cheung, won't speculate on the forthcoming changes, and it's too early to know what they'll do, given their positive outlook on China's economy and its appreciating currency. Still, Pearce says, \"The U.S. is looking pretty good. The central bank has done a good job, and I have no reason to believe the U.S. won't do anything but have a soft landing.\" \u001d  Moreover, he observes, \"the runup in U.S. shares was driven largely by small-caps. \"The S&P 500 is only back to where it was five years ago, and earnings are about 45% higher.\" U.S. large-cap stocks, in his view, trade at \"very reasonable\" multiples and \"are heavily leveraged to the global economy, which is expected to grow strongly. This will feed into earnings and underpin higher valuations.\" \u001d  Investing in higher-yielding vehicles is a boon to Ping An, which in recent years has had a tough time matching assets to liabilities as Chinese interest rates stayed low. This year, Chinese stocks have surged, helping offset meager returns from fixed-income investments. \u001d  At home, Ping An (ticker: 2318.Hong Kong) has been diversifying into infrastructure and private-equity plays. The coming changes should let the company, which had $65 billion in assets last year, invest up to $10 billion abroad. (Currently, non-Chinese equities can account for no more than 10% of the $1.75 billion in foreign-currency reserves that it raised in its 2004 initial public offering.) \u001d  Beijing is giving insurers greater latitude to battle ever-stiffer competition from foreign joint ventures. In March, Ping An won a license to manage assets in Hong Kong, which would help it to invest outside the Mainland for both domestic and overseas clients. \u001d  Its money-management business is growing briskly. In a recent test in the wealthy southern city of Shenzhen, just over the border from Hong Kong, the company collected $2 billion from wealthy individuals. The biggest potential client -- and one that Pearce and Cheung salivate over -- is Beijing itself, whose foreign-exchange pile is swollen by its need to buy dollars to maintain the yuan's peg to the U.S. currency. \u001d  Ping An, whose earnings jumped 88% in 2006 and which topped the list of high-returning stocks that Barron's profiled last year (\"Winning Policies,\" March 13, 2006), is also sitting on $5 billion it raised by selling stock in Shanghai this year. (The insurer went public in Hong Kong in 2004.) \"We are very eager to get some of this business,\" says Cheung. \u001d  It's no mystery why, after a year-long search, Ping An hired Pearce, who had been CEO of Australia's largest money manager. Australians have been leaders in investing abroad in infrastructure and other alternative plays. They simply have had to, as laws to encourage savings swamped their own capital markets with cash -- a situation similar to what China is experiencing as its trade gaps with many other nations balloon. Infrastructure investments can produce steady long-term cash flows and attractive yields, perfect for pension funds' long-term liabilities. Pearce, 44, pushed his former employer, Colonial First State, outside equities and into fixed-income and alternative investments, and struck alliances with outside investment boutiques. \u001d  Ping An has been investing in highways, power stations, structured loans and real estate -- grade-A office buildings and shopping malls, including the Citic Plaza arcade in Shenzhen. \"Going forward, we have big well-known assets the state is looking to privatize,\" says Pearce. \"Expect to see Ping An well-represented in those deals.\" \u001d  The insurer has invested heavily in the initial public offerings of domestic financial companies. Ping An owns A and H shares of Bank of China (3988.Hong Kong). A shares are the domestically listed shares open to Mainland investors and qualified foreign institutions, while H shares are listed in Hong Kong. And it has H shares of China Construction Bank (939.Hong Kong) and PetroChina (PTR), plus 4.9% of the A shares of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (600000.China). Recently, it bought A shares of China Minsheng Banking (600016.China). And Ping An is enthusiastic about its own industry's prospects: It owns both A and H shares of China Life (LFC), the only domestic life insurer larger than Ping An. \u001d  \"The banking sector is an excellent proxy for the Chinese economy,\" says Pearce. \"The growing affluence of the population and ongoing deregulation will enable the Chinese banks to attain steady growth in the long run.\" \u001d  For all that some investors fret about Chinese stocks' 130% runup last year and 50% spurt this year, Pearce isn't alarmed. True, he acknowledges, \"a market valuation of 30 times 2007 earnings certainly is not cheap.\" But, he notes, Chinese stocks are delivering earnings growth superior to that being generated by equities in the other BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China.) countries. \"Among the BRICs, China is the only market where earnings revisions are still on an uptrend,\" says Pearce, who sees Corporate China's earnings jumping 24% this year. \u001d  \"At this point, earnings can justify very high P/Es,\" he argues. \"Most Chinese investors are still bullish about domestic prospects and renminbi appreciation. The market has had a great run, valuations are on the high side, but we're long-term investors, and these [gains] are underpinned by earnings.\" He notes that China's banking system has RMB36 trillion in deposits that needs \"to find a home.\" \u001d  He's also optimistic about the outlook for emerging markets, particularly China's neighbors, even if the U.S. slides into recession, which he considers unlikely. Says Pearce: \"The Chinese and Asian economies have a lot of internal growth momentum that will help cushion a U.S. economic shock. . . . Emerging markets offer far superior growth prospects than developed markets, supported by more efficient markets, massive liquidity and better governance, so risk factors have also declined. We obviously cannot rule out the possibility of another Asian Crisis, but the attraction of emerging markets certainly appears to be supported by good fundamentals at this stage.\" \u001d  And as Mainland investors broaden their horizons, that will only be good news for U.S. shares, emerging markets and Ping An itself. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"703edb83f11b98ac197fdf2872e59743","symR":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Barron's Roundtable: Room To Run -8-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","BAN","BNK","BRD","BVG","CHC","CHM","CMT","CNO","CPR","CSV","CTS","DST","FAC","FOD","FTS","HIM","IDD","ISV","LOD","MED","OFP","OIS","RES","RTS","SAP","SEM","SFT","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTT","XSTX","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  A: Our analysts like Valero. It offers exposure to a favorable refining cycle. Refining capacity is constrained, and many projects that had been expected to come on stream have been delayed. Demand remains quite resilient. Our analyst concludes refining margins will stay strong, though there will be short-term volatility. Also, Valero is expected to buy back shares. Goldman's earnings estimates for this year are notably above the consensus. We think the company could do $12.25 a share, which implies a P/E of about six times earnings. For next year, our estimate is $12.50, and the P/E is 5.8. Consensus estimates for Valero are $9.50 for '07 and $7.91 for '08. If refining margins stay at current levels or move higher, estimates could be revised upward. \b \u001d  Q: What else do your colleagues like? \u001d  A: Hewlett-Packard [HPQ] is another margin-improvement story. Margins will improve in large part because of cost reductions, and earnings will grow in excess of revenue in the next few years. There will also be some revenue growth. HP is doing well in its core business, printers, and has gained share in software. It is also buying back stock. Our concerns are that the stock is widely owned, and has performed well in 2007. You have to take a longer view with regard to the company's ability to improve margins. Also, Hewlett-Packard benefits from international exposure, which exceeds 60% of their sales. Our earnings estimates are very close to consensus: The company could earn $2.78 a share in the fiscal year ending October, and has a P/E of 16.3. We estimate earnings of $3.15 in fiscal '08, and long-term earnings growth of 18%. \u001d  Another stock we like -- it's a new recommendation from Goldman Sachs -- is Pier 1 Imports [PIR], a turnaround situation. Pier 1 and its shareholders have gone through a difficult four years, and the stock is down 70%. \b \u001d  Q: Where does it trade these days? \u001d  A: It's around 8.60 a share. The company's margins have eroded significantly, as has its market share, but the possibility of a turnaround has improved. There is new management in place, and while Pier 1 will still have negative earnings for the next several quarters, it will become less cash-flow negative. The turnaround story has to do with cost reduction, in combination with improved spending on merchandising. We expect some reductions in overhead expenses, and some store closings. There is also room for improvement in Pier 1's supply chain. In recent years, the company lost market share as discounters came into their category and they were unable to distinguish themselves. New management understands what the issues are and will go after some bad merchandising decisions and unpopular marketing decisions. \b \u001d  Q: And your earnings estimates? \u001d  A: Goldman's estimates are well above the consensus. For this fiscal year ending February 2008, our earnings estimate is minus 68 cents. Ebitda will be negative this year but only slightly negative in fiscal '08. There is still the possibility of failure at Pier 1, but we feel increasingly comfortable the new management will be able to execute a turnaround. \b \u001d  Thank you, Abby. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"70efe506b1e7f43c7480ec50edf8b503","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Airbus CEO: If Euro Value Rises, New Actions May Be Needed","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","ARO","ASP","XCA4","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XMDAX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 08:00 ET (12:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"722c148aee93f87b06a1e809d2ff22ca","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Airbus CEO:Prolonged Strikes Could Threaten Delivery Target","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","ARO","ASP","XCA4","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XMDAX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 08:00 ET (12:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"73edd7b4f3d70a5791ce24ffad07fd65","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Airbus CEO Sees 440-450 Airplane Deliveries During '07","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","ARO","ASP","XCA4","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XMDAX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 08:00 ET (12:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"76c549afcb8c04f92c6f67413715b6ee","symR":["00913.AE","AKZOY","ICI","ICI.LN","GB0004594973","NL0000009132"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Akzo Nobel In Final Stages Of Preparing Bid For ICI - Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T11:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["00913.AE","AKZOY","ICI","ICI.LN","GB0004594973","NL0000009132"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XFT1","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Dutch chemicals giant Akzo Nobel (00913.AE) is in the final stages of drawing up a bid for ICI (ICI.LN), the Daily Telegraph reported Saturday, without naming sources. \u001d  The newspaper said that Akzo Nobel is understood to have mandated Morgan Stanley to advise it on a bid for ICI, maker of Dulux paint.

For instance, it will have access to Thomson's trove of institutional-investment tools and real-time data feeds from which to draw new products, ideas and expertise. \u001d  A retail portal, Thomson Investor Network, fell flat some time ago, although it still offers earnings.com, which runs Webcasts and posts calendars of earnings calls and annual meetings. \u001d  But a spokesman says Reuters will continue to focus on individual investors: \"We see no reason why this would change.\" \u001d  Reuters' offerings are enhanced by its global news-gathering force. But its investing portal offers much more than excellent business and economic reporting (Barron's parent, Dow Jones, competes with Reuters in several areas). It covers markets and industries and provides good portraits of individual stocks. Mutual- and exchange-traded-fund research and data come courtesy of Reuters' Lipper unit. You can catch up on commodities, bonds and currencies, and look for analyst research reports, too. \u001d  Reuters.com's screening tool isn't particularly friendly, but it's incredibly powerful; some prebuilt screens like Technology Bargains and Accelerating Growth are also available. And there are two good investor-oriented blogs on the site: the Deal Zone, which features Reuters reporters commenting on mergers and acquisitions and other corporate deals as well as dealmakers, and MediaFile, \"where media and technology meet.\" \u001d  Reuters' Web presence goes far beyond its retail-investor portal. Lipper's mutual-fund Website (www.lipperweb.com) supplies news and commentary, analytical tools and mutual-fund information to the individual investor. The latter includes some access to research studies, a simple fund screener, Lipper's benchmark indexes, plus an overview of individual mutual funds that displays Lipper Leader Scorecards (a rating system for funds that takes into account total return, consistency of return, capital preservation, tax efficiency and expense). \u001d  HedgeWorld (www.hedgeworld.com) is also a part of the Reuters family. It's home to the Lipper TASS hedge-fund database, which offers more than 350 fields of information for 4,000-plus hedge funds and more than 300 commodity trading advisers (over 8,000 funds are covered). \b \u001d  Some content is free, including news stories and a daily newsletter and monthly magazine; articles covering hedge funds from more than 4,000 publications, through Lexis-Nexis; and tools for customizing your news delivery. You also get limited access to the Lipper TASS database Live Funds Module, and alerts when fund-performance numbers are updated. \u001d  Not surprisingly, $795 a year gets you more, including exclusive news not available at other subscriber levels, either daily or weekly, as well as charts and tables and access to archives (two-week trial subscription). Gold-Level members ($5,495 a year) get access to some features of the Lipper TASS database and premium search features. \u001d  Reuters has several professional and enterprise products. And its news and data appear on Websites such as Yahoo!Finance (finance.yahoo.com) and Google Finance (finance.google.com). Reuters also recently announced a kind of MySpace for market pros, a social-networking platform set up to foster an exchange of research, opinions and trading models around market activity, says the spokesman. \u001d  There's more, but suffice it to say that Reuters is on the job and that its pending link with Thomson ultimately should serve individual investors well. \b \u001d  New or Notable: Some of the old Gains-keeper folks have launched a new site, Geezeo (www.geezeo.com). Right now, it consists of Geezeo Mobile, which lets you view your balances at a bank or broker from your cellphone, and Geezeo Student. Geezeo has partnered with Simple Tuition (www.simpletuition.com) to offer an impressive network of potential lenders for consolidating or refinancing student loans . . .

Like Berkshire, Alleghany (ticker: Y) focuses on insurance and equity investments. Like Berkshire (BRK-A), Alleghany has a great balance sheet with considerable excess capital. Like Berkshire, Alleghany has a conservative CEO and board that primarily measure their performance the old way -- by growth in shareholder equity, or book value. Like Berkshire, Alleghany communicates little with Wall Street. Like Berkshire, Alleghany has a strong long-term record, delivering a 15% annualized return since 1967, five percentage points better than the S&P 500 index, although shy of Berkshire's great 21%-plus yearly gain under Buffett. \u001d  Also like Berkshire Hathaway, Alleghany refuses to split its shares, resulting in one of the highest stock prices on the Big Board. At $362 Friday, the company's market value was $3 billion, versus Berkshire's $168 billion. (Berkshire's A shares fetch almost $110,000 apiece.) \u001d  Alleghany's admirers like its management, led by Chief Executive Weston Hicks. They favor its mix of insurance businesses and consider its stock inexpensive, trading at 1.3 times its March 31 book value of $271 a share. \"The company is stocked with cash, and you have a smart guy at the helm,\" says Jeffrey Bronchick, chief investment officer at Reed Conner & Birdwell, a Los Angeles investment manager that holds about 3% of the outstanding shares. \"Alleghany is one of those sleepers. The downside is boredom -- a 10% return each year --  and the upside is 50% over the next two or three years,\" he adds. \u001d  Alleghany trades for a lower valuation than Berkshire, which commands 1.5 times book. Berkshire's advantage is a better set of businesses. Berkshire's disadvantage is sheer size. Buffett must invest in billion-dollar chunks, while Alleghany has a much wider array of opportunities, since it can move the needle with a $100 million investment. \u001d  Alleghany can't match Berkshire's investment record, but it has done well. Its largest equity holding is Burlington Northern (BNI), the railroad company. Berkshire caused a stir when it disclosed two months ago that it had purchased $3 billion of Burlington shares. Alleghany beat Berkshire to the stock by a decade, paying just $12 a share for its five million shares, versus Friday's price of $90. In fact, Burlington accounts for half of Alleghany's $1 billion equity portfolio. Most of the rest of its holdings are energy shares such as Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP), which are up an average of 50% since Alleghany bought them in 2005. \u001d  The Burlington investment was made by John Burns, Hicks' predecessor, and the energy investments by Hicks, a 50-year-old former insurance analyst who joined Alleghany in 2002 after a one-year stint as chief financial officer at the insurer Chubb. \u001d  Hicks wouldn't talk with Barron's, reflecting Alleghany's penchant for minimal media contact. Investors who want to understand Alleghany must do their own work because no analysts cover it. The company doesn't even hold quarterly conference calls or investor meetings. \u001d  In its annual report, Alleghany makes clear that \"conservatism dominates our management philosophy,\" adding that its goal is \"double-digit\" annual growth in book value \"without employing excessive amounts of financial leverage or taking undue amounts of operating risk.\" \u001d  Bronchick credits Hicks with \"moving Alleghany into the 21st century.\" Since his arrival, Hicks has transformed a company that was little more than a pile of cash into a mini insurance conglomerate. Alleghany's largest insurance unit is RSUI Group, a property and casualty specialist that has produced $240 million of underwriting profits since its purchase in 2003. Alleghany also owns 55% of Darwin Professional Underwriters (DR), an insurer that was taken public last year after Alleghany formed it in 2002 by financing a well-regarded group of insurance executives led by Stephen Sills. The Darwin stake is now worth $220 million. In 2006, Alleghany paid $120 million for 33% of Homesite Group, a home insurer. In April, it purchased Employers Direct, a California-based specialist in workers' compensation, for $195 million. \u001d  Alleghany's insurance units made $28 a share in 2006, accounting for the bulk of the company's $30-a-share in full-year earnings. Last year marked a big improvement over 2005, when Alleghany lost $5 a share from insurance operations, largely due to a $313 million hit from Hurricane Katrina and other storms. \u001d  In the first quarter, Alleghany earned $8.28 a share from insurance. Those profits probably can't be sustained through the year because there were minimal catastrophe losses in the period. Hurricanes usually are most prevalent in the third quarter. Still, it's not unreasonable to project that the insurance units can earn $25 a share annually. If the equity portfolio returns 12% yearly, that would contribute another $10 a share each year to book value, helping the company hit its goal of double-digit growth in book. \u001d  The chief risks with Alleghany are the potential for large insurance losses, although Alleghany has substantially trimmed its catastrophe exposure since Katrina; a big drop in the stock market, and a sharp rise in rates, which would hurt its $2.8 billion bond portfolio. Another danger: The property and casualty insurance cycle may be peaking, threatening underwriting profits. \u001d  The company sits on about $1 billion -- or $125 a share -- of excess capital. Alleghany shares, meanwhile, are only about half as volatile as the S&P 500 index. Like Berkshire, the company pays no cash dividend, even though it could easily afford one. \u001d  Looking ahead to the end of the current quarter, Alleghany's book value could top $285 a share, based on insurance earnings and a rally in Burlington Northern and oil shares. That suggests that Alleghany now trades below 1.3 times forward book value. \u001d  That book value, moreover, probably is understated because the company carries its Darwin stake, plus real estate it owns in the Sacramento area, at below-market-value prices. Adjusted for this, the June 30 book value could be $300. This suggests that Alleghany stock is priced reasonably despite its high absolute price. \u001d  Hicks is only Alleghany's third CEO in the past 40 years. His predecessor, Burns, ran the company from 1992 to 2004. The chief executive before Burns was Fred Kirby, who took the helm when his father, Allan Kirby, had a stroke in 1967. \u001d  Alleghany dates to 1929, when it assembled a group of railroads -- just before the stock-market crash and the Depression. Alleghany managed to survive, making a shrewd purchase of Investors Diversified Services in the 1940s. That business, known as IDS, eventually was sold at a huge profit to American Express in 1984. \u001d  Fred Kirby, now 87, retired as chairman at the end of 2006. He owns 12% of Alleghany. The Kirbys, including Fred's brother, Allan, 75, together control about a third of the company's thinly traded shares. Alleghany likes its independence, but there's a chance of some future corporate transaction, given the key shareholders' ages. \u001d  Reed Connor's Bronchick argues that Alleghany doesn't get full credit for its insurance operations, notably RSUI, which he compares to such well-regarded outfits as Markel (MKL) and RLI (RLI), which command as much as twice book value. \u001d  Hicks isn't likely to be rash about investing Alleghany's $1 billion of excess capital. The company has favored insurance investments because it knows the field and doesn't face competition there from insatiable private-equity buyers, who can't use leverage as easily in insurance. \u001d  Investors now are paying only a modest price for the company Hicks has energized. If Alleghany's book value can expand at a double-digit rate in the next few years, the stock could rise 50% by 2010 -- not bad for a low-risk investment. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:10 ET (04:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"97e1c32f3f113218e8361889a8100ab5","symR":["AMGN","CMCSA","CMCSK","DIS","GE","IBM","JNJ","KO","MER","MS","ORCL","PEP","S","T","TGT","WFC","US00206R1023","US0311621009","US1912161007","US2003002001","US20030N1019","US2546871060","US3696041033","US4592001014","US4781601046","US5901881087","US68389X1054","US9497461015"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) The Striking Price: A Strategy Built For Bulls","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMGN","CMCSA","CMCSK","DIS","GE","IBM","JNJ","KO","MER","MS","ORCL","PEP","S","T","TGT","WFC","US00206R1023","US0311621009","US1912161007","US2003002001","US20030N1019","US2546871060","US3696041033","US4592001014","US4781601046","US5901881087","US68389X1054","US9497461015"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","BRD","BTC","BVG","CTS","DRG","FTS","IDD","MDV","MED","RTB","RTS","SCR","SFT","SOF","TLS","TSX","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF","XSTT","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Steven M. Sears \u001d  Opportunity often resides between contradiction and fear. \u001d  As bond yields rise and the volatility of many equity options floats higher in anticipation that stocks may go lower, a paradoxical trade is emerging, just as the second-quarter earnings season begins. Goldman Sachs' wily options strategists recommend selling put options to express a bullish view on mega-cap stocks, even as some investors fret that stocks will slip during the lazy days of summer. \u001d  The rationale for this seemingly contrarian trade is a market call by Goldman's portfolio strategist, who thinks stocks may advance into the summer because investor expectations are too conservative, especially for big companies. Sound familiar? First-quarter profits also were expected to be lackluster. But they beat expectations, helping to propel stocks to new highs. \u001d  Many stocks have recovered nicely since the recent 3% decline in the S&P 500, yet Goldman's options strategists, Maria Grant and John Marshall, have identified 15 mega-caps with elevated options prices, and strong fundamentals that are worth betting on. After screening their universe of liquid options -- about 350 names -- they found that the implied volatility of stocks with market capitalizations above $40 billion were significantly higher than that of smaller issues. These stocks' implied volatility -- essentially, price -- had risen, on average, 5.1% in the previous week, versus 2.7% for smaller stocks. Implied volatility also is higher for mega-caps than it is elsewhere in the market. \u001d  To benefit from these discrepancies, the strategists recommend selling three-month puts on Target (TGT), AT&T (T), PepsiCo (PEP), Coca-Cola (KO), Comcast (CMCSA), Oracle (ORCL), Sears (S), IBM (IBM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Merrill Lynch (MER), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Morgan Stanley (MS), Amgen (AMGN), General Electric (GE), and Disney (DIS). \u001d  To qualify for the list, stocks had to be rated Buy by Goldman's equity analysts, have three-month volatility among the most expensive of the past year and boast a market value above $40 billion. Target's three-month options volatility, for example, is at its highest level of the year, and AT&T, Pepsi and Coca-Cola options aren't far behind. \u001d  Goldman's portfolio strategist, David Kostin, believes second- quarter consensus earnings estimates are too low. He views large-caps as more attractive than small-caps, in part because big stocks have about double the exposure to fast-growing international markets, and this helped them report better-than-expected first-quarter net. Moreover, large-caps are less sensitive to interest rates and widening credit spreads, owing to their generally well-managed balanced sheets. In addition, based on measures such as price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, large-caps are at the bottom of their 20-year average, and hedge funds \"have recently began to shift\" into large- and mid-cap stocks and away from small-caps. \u001d  If the trades work, investors will be in for an end of summer treat. If not, they'll get a chance to own some good stocks, and that's not bad either. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: steven.sears@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"a0437639ed313f974bd62defaf6d8d02","symR":["AGP.YY"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":":ASDA Declares Price War With &#163;250m Of Rollbacks","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AGP.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["FDR","RTS"],"Story":"\u001d  Research Shows Average Family's Disposable Income is &#163;146 \u001d  ASDA fired the first salvo in a &#163;250m supermarket price war today ( 16 June), lowering 10,000 prices across food, George and general merchandise to celebrate winning the Grocer's lowest price supermarket award for the tenth year running. \u001d  The move is especially pertinent after ASDA research, released for the first time today, shows that the average British family has only &#163;146 per month of disposable income after they've paid all the bills*. \u001d  The price move builds on ASDA's consumer championing history following a decade of winning Britain's lowest price supermarket award.

But the immediate problems lie in the boardroom, rather than in geographic diversification. \u001d  HSBC has been battered by the U.S. subprime-mortgage mess. But the banking concern, whose American depositary shares trade on the Big Board under the ticker HBC, looks better when judged over a longer span. Its shares have outpaced those of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.U.K.), Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC), especially since 2004, when the Fed started raising interest rates. (The ADSs were trading early Friday around 92.50 -- about midway between their 52-week high and low.) \u001d  The longer view shows that HSBC shares fare better than their peers when systemic risks -- macro fundamentals  -- go against the banking industry. Reason: The company's earnings streams come from various global regions and are less correlated with one another than are the sources of some other big banks' profits. \u001d  Standard Chartered (STAN.U.K.) has outperformed HSBC because most of its earnings come from emerging markets. But StanChart is also riskier; its 52-week beta -- a measure of how much more it rises or falls when the overall market moves -- is 1.4, nearly three times that of HSBC. \u001d  The return-per-unit-risk advantage would be lost if HSBC were broken up. HSBC Asia would alone be riskier than HSBC as a whole. This also would be evident in HSBC's cost of capital and ability to act as counterparty on derivative transactions. A breakup would result in similar disadvantages for the bank's other parts. \u001d  Two additional risks would arise if HSBC's Asia business were spun off. First, the Asian growth story may be overheating and is due for a pause, especially in China, where the government is desperate to tighten. \u001d  Also, Asian economies are increasingly integrating. Bilateral trade between India and China, for instance, is up to $18 billion today from $2 billion six years ago and is expected to jump to $100 billion by 2015. That means the economic cycles of these two Asian growth engines will become increasingly correlated. \u001d  For a standalone HSBC Asia, that would be good news during boom times, but highly risky during a downturn. \u001d  What HSBC needs isn't a breakup, but rather a tighter hold over its global assets. More skill at transferring best practices, technologies, products from one region to another. It hasn't been able to integrate acquisitions quickly. \u001d  Investors should urge HSBC to fix its board of directors, which lacks diversity. It needs a new chairman, one who's not a former HSBC CEO. \u001d  Undoing past mistakes will take longer. Most of its independent board members are from the U.K. More balance, with greater understanding of HSBC's major markets, would be preferable. \u001d  Non-executive directors should meet more often without management present. HSBC's non-exec directors met only twice last year. Their counterparts at Citi met seven times. Improving corporate governance would add shareholder value, as well. \u001d  --- \u001d  Arindam Nag is a contributor to The Skeptic, a Dow Jones Newswires column on which this European Trader is based. \u001d  --- \b                      DOW JONES GLOBAL INDEXES \b \bRegion/ \bCountry \b   DJ Global          DJ Global           DJ Global     Point \b    Indexes,           Indexes,            Indexes,      Chg.    % Chg. \b Local Curr.

It would also leave extra cash to redevelop some of the property portfolio. \u001d  Tchenguiz has a declared stake in Sainsbury of about 5%, but the FT said his actual holding, including derivatives, is near 10%. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.ft.com \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9330 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 06:36 ET (10:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b07d2a8967e1125d63e0af65c49456e1","symR":["500180.BY","AGIBY","ANGL.DB","BATS.LN","BBV","BBVA.MC","BTI","HDB","TSCDY","TSCO.LN","JVIAX","ES0113211835","GB0002875804","GB0008847096","IE00B06H8J93","INE040A01018"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Fund Of Information: Growth And Value Power A Fund's Big Gains","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["500180.BY","AGIBY","ANGL.DB","BATS.LN","BBV","BBVA.MC","BTI","HDB","TSCDY","TSCO.LN","JVIAX","ES0113211835","GB0002875804","GB0008847096","IE00B06H8J93","INE040A01018"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FDR","RTS","TOB","XDJGI","XES","XFT1","XIBEX","XNYA","XST5","ZFU"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Lawrence C. Strauss \u001d  Rajiv Jain, who took over the Phoenix Foreign Opportunities fund in early 2002, has consistently beaten most of his peers. \u001d  His secret? \u001d  Getting enough picks right to more than offset his mistakes, as any successful active money manager must do. Among other things working against him were his light exposure to energy, and his relatively low exposure to China, which Jain maintains is overvalued compared with other world markets. He also avoids corporate restructurings and cyclical companies. \u001d  But clearly, he's gotten a lot right. His portfolio (ticker: JVIAX) has a five-year annual return of 20.3%, putting it in the top 6% of Morningstar's foreign large-blend category. Lipper points out that the fund has outperformed most of its peers while having just an average risk profile, as measured by standard deviation. So relative to rivals, Jain isn't betting the ranch to get these results. \u001d  Although light on China, Jain does have a big stake in Indian companies, which account for about 8% of the portfolio, including HDFC Bank (HDB). \u001d  His long-term winners include food retailer Tesco (TSCDY), British American Tobacco (BTI) and Anglo Irish Bank (AGIBY). \u001d  They're all part of his growth-at-a-reasonable price bent. \"Every company we own should be a growing enterprise,\" explains Jain. \"Having said that, you don't want to pay for the growth.\" \u001d  Jain is comfortable holding a stock for years. The load fund, whose annual expense ratio is 1.37%, has assets of just over $1 billion. \u001d  It's a concentrated portfolio. The top 10 holdings account for about 40% of the fund, although he doesn't like to let individual stocks exceed 5%. \u001d  Compared with the global index MSCI EAFE, Phoenix Foreign Opportunities is underweight Japan. Elsewhere, it has a relative overweighting in the United Kingdom, whose banking sector Jain believes is undervalued. His holdings there include the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBSPY). \u001d  Another country where he sees opportunity is Spain. Holdings there include Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBV), which also has extensive operations in Latin America, mostly Mexico. \u001d  The fund's strong performance has prompted fast asset growth, which can turn into a problem because the investing universe diminishes. That's a key challenge for Jain, and shareholders should monitor it. Jain, however, maintains that nearly all of the best new ideas are in larger-cap stocks, with market capitalizations of at least $8 billion. \b \u001d  Daniel Wiener isn't among those fretting over the effects of higher bond yields. The editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors points out that there have been three occasions since the early 1990s when the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose sharply. Each time, he notes, real gross domestic product continued to grow, and small- and large-cap stocks mostly continued to make gains, although bond mutual funds took a big hit. Rates above 5% (the 10-year Treasury topped 5.2% last week) will increase borrowing costs, Wiener says, \"but this is not going to derail an economy\" that's \"slowing but still growing.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: lawrence.strauss@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d            Scoreboard \b \u001d      Natural Resources Lead the Way \b   -- U.S. diversified stock funds rose an average 1.93% in the week ended Thursday, says Lipper, Reuter's fund-tracking arm.

No one knew that March 10, 2000, would be the end of the dot-com bubble. It could be a month from now. It could be today! I would be surprised if it doesn't happen by the time January rolls around. We have real, serious problems. The dollar is deteriorating against almost all currencies. Bond yields are backing up big-time, causing all sorts of ripple effects. Potential leveraged buyouts might not get done. Huge pyramids of leverage could start to implode. The back-up in rates comes at a time when the U.S. consumer has finally had it. Month after month retail sales disappoint. In April, 75% of retailers missed their same-store-sales targets. The consumer, facing hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgage-rate resets, now gets hit with rising rates. Wrong timing. Housing prices are falling nationwide. Mortgage-equity withdrawals have collapsed. In May, foreclosures were up 90% year over year. Gasoline prices are up 30% from the first quarter. We are looking at potentially the greatest food-price inflation in 30 years. Higher health-insurance costs. Lower benefits. You can't have a worse scenario for the consumer. \b \u001d  Q: At least people are employed. \u001d  A: The government's employment numbers are bogus. They reported a gain of about 230,000 jobs in the past two months, but 520,000 of them came from a computer model -- the birth/death model. If we had real numbers we would know we are already in a recession. \b \u001d  Q: Are you out of the market completely? \u001d  A: In January, I had lots of cash; gold and silver, which have done well, and Canadian bonds, which have been fantastic. I also had some gold and silver stocks. I am so nervous that I sold those. I intend to repurchase them when it looks like the Fed will be forced to come to the rescue. Right now I'm 97% in U.S. Treasuries, Canadian bonds and gold and silver. I'm 3% short against the stock market, almost entirely through put options. Oh, and I have one millionth of 1% in EMC [EMC] calls. \b \u001d  Q: Earlier this year, you recommended shorting Apple and Research In Motion, both of which have rallied sharply. What should investors do with those stocks now? \u001d  A: I short stocks by buying puts because shorting can be so dangerous, as these examples illustrate. Also, these positions are just a tiny portion of my portfolio. In Apple's case [AAPL], revenue growth continued to decelerate in the latest quarter, and iPod sales were down. But the bottom line was up sharply because of a one-time collapse in memory prices. They guided revenue estimates lower. What happened? The stock went up on hopes for the iPhone. This is a product no one has tried. The cost is huge. It runs on the slowest network there is. The keyboard is unusable for e-mail. And these are the flaws we know about. New investors should wait until the iPhone comes out and then short the stock, again using puts. \u001d  As for Research In Motion [RIMM], both companies can't win on the iPhone's launch. RIM has focused on the business market, but now is targeting consumers, which is bad. I have long thought RIM could be the next Palm, which was a hot stock and hot product in the dot-com era. Every executive and every housewife in Greenwich had to have a Palm Pilot. Not any more. RIM has less than 1% of the 1 billion-unit handset market. It is up against huge competition. If the iPhone is a hit, RIM is in trouble. Maybe both will be losers. Theoretically, my short position is down 17% since January, but I plan to add to it via puts because the valuation makes no sense. You're paying $31 billion for a company with a 1% market share. \b \u001d  Q: Have you any other advice? \u001d  A: Buy two-year Treasury notes. It sounds boring, but cash is not trash. At times like this, you want to have cash because you'll be able to buy amid the rubble. The two-year note yields 5.1%, which is pretty darned good. \u001d  On the negative sid, I'm shorting NetLogic Microsystems [NETL], again through puts. NetLogic is a semiconductor company that provides components mostly to the network-equipment market. Cisco Systems [CSCO] generated two-thirds of their revenue in the latest quarter. A few weeks ago Cisco, IBM [IBM], EMC and Sun Microsystems [SUNW] all said their U.S. enterprise revenue was weakening. Cisco warned in May of lower growth. But that may be the least of NetLogic's problems. \b \u001d  Q: What else could go wrong? \u001d  A: New competitors are moving in, including Integrated Device Technology [IDTI] and Renesas, a Japanese semiconductor company. They are undercutting NetLogic on price and Cisco is diversifying its supplier base. Worst of all, Cisco recently bought SpansLogic, a direct competitor to NetLogic. NetLogic trades for 30. It is selling for 6.5 times sales and 30 times this year's estimated earnings. Sales growth in the next two quarters is expected to be zero. Earnings per share for the next two quarters are expected to be down 19% and 15%. \b \u001d  Q: That sounds grim. \u001d  A: There is a lot of pressure on me and others to be bullish, but I can't. In 2002 I got out of all of my puts -- my shorts -- and went long. But I knew that posture ultimately couldn't be sustained. \u001d  Thank you, Fred. \u001d  ART SAMBERG \b \u001d  Q: Do the market's prospects still impress you? \u001d  A: Samberg: The market's multiple has shrunk two years in a row. You might not like everything you see out there, but people are employed and things move forward. Corporate profits are growing at a 10% annual rate and the market is not up 10% yet. The other driver for stocks is the wad of money in private-equity hands. It is absurd, but I have learned one thing in life: It is very important to recognize absurdity, but also very stupid to get in the way of it. I don't see the private-equity boom abating. If corporate profitability in the U.S. is OK, the rest of the world is continuing to grow and private-equity deals are driving stock action in the U.S., the market could be up about 10%. this year. \b \u001d  Q: It's up more than 5% already. \u001d  A: The S&P 500 is up about 7%, or 15% on an annualized basis. That's too much, so I'm sure we'll get hit over the head soon. Adjustable-rate mortgages really started resetting in May and the resets peak around January, so housing-market troubles could impact the stock market in the second half. There will be another consumer scare between here and the end of the year. We'll get some kind of a correction. But the big drivers are corporate profitability and all the money sloshing around. Not much has changed since January. \b \u001d  Q: One thing has changed: Most of your January picks are higher, including the for-profit-college stocks. Do you still like them? \u001d  A: Hopefully, the group's earnings will start coming through. Apollo Group [APOL], which is around 48, could double from here. My cotton pick hasn't worked as well, and I'd like to reemphasize it. I expected the Chinese to swoop in and buy up cotton, but I neglected to mention one thing in January: U.S. inventories were high at more than 10 million bales. Inventories get depleted or added to based on Chinese demand and the timing of China's orders, and for several months China didn't place many orders. Inventories are finally beginning to drop. \b \u001d  Q: So China finally has made its move? \u001d  A: I think so. When the data comes in on this year's cotton crop, the amount that comes to market could be even less than expected. There is dry weather in Georgia and Texas, and according to the data 20% less cotton was planted this year. All the elements of this trade are still in place. \u001d  I also recommended two Brazilian home builders in January -- Gafisa [GFSA3.Brazil] and Brascan Residential Properties [BISA3.Brazil] -- and the outlook for both is still terrific. The Selic, Brazil's lending rate, is down since the beginning of the year to 12%. Land prices are up 40% year over year. Gafisa is flat but Brascan is down about 20%, which is silly. It's due to technical factors. About seven other developers were slated to come to market, and investors got scared about an excess supply of home-building stocks. In the end the IPOs didn't happen, but Brascan sold off because of the expected overhang. It is much more of a local stock than Gafisa, which is partly owned by Sam Zell. The story for both is just as strong as it was in January, if not stronger. I'm still recommending both, but with the emphasis on Brascan. \b \u001d  Q: How about a new name? \u001d  A: Research In Motion is a new old name, which I have recommended before. As I see it, RIM sells an enterprise solution, not a consumer product. To view it as a consumer product is to miss the annuity stream and value of the business. Last year the company introduced the BlackBerry Pearl, a hand-held device aimed at the consumer market. It didn't sell as well as expected. Now it has entered a new enterprise cycle and introduced the 8800 and Curve 8300, which looks like a phenomenal device. It is going to sell like hot cakes. We think RIM may be ready to launch a Japanese-language version of the product in the fall, with NTT DoCoMo. I don't really care what Apple's iPhone looks like, because that's not what RIM is about. Someday this company shouldn't even make handsets, but concentrate solely on enterprise-software solutions. Someday it will also be part of another company. \b \u001d  Q: RIM trades for 170. How much higher can it go? \u001d  A: In the fiscal year ending February 2009, which is mostly calendar '08, the company could earn as much as $6.50 a share and the stock could sell for more than 30 times earnings. It is a $200-plus stock. \b \u001d  Q: What is your view of the tech sector in general? \u001d  A: It continues to be boring. Wireless telephony interests me. Companies in the 3G area are doing well. I also recommended Baidu.com [BIDU], the Chinese Internet search engine, in January. It sold off at the beginning of the year and then rebounded, though it isn't up hugely. Speculation in the Chinese A-shares market isn't happening with Baidu, which has more appeal to Western institutional investors. The fundamentals are great. \b \u001d  Thanks, Art. \b \u001d  FELIX ZULAUF \b \u001d  Q: You were fairly upbeat in January, Felix. Are you still? \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b1f8bb80609a70f5be290cf9159886eb","symR":["RIO","RIO.AU","RIO.LN","RTP","VALE5.BR","AU000000RIO1","BRVALEACNPA3","GB0007188757"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Follow-Up: Mining Shares May Have Peaked","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RIO","RIO.AU","RIO.LN","RTP","VALE5.BR","AU000000RIO1","BRVALEACNPA3","GB0007188757"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XATI","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL","XNYA","XORD","XST5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Tom Sullivan \u001d  Seemingly insatiable demand for base and precious metals, fueled in part by China's growth, has helped give a powerful lift to mining-company shares. But those shares now look fully valued. \u001d  Barron's has been a fan of the sector for the past year (\"Prospecting for Bargains,\" June 19, 2006), based chiefly on the outlook for commodities prices. That story focused on Brazil's Companhia Vale Do Rio Doce, known as CVRD (ticker: RIO) and Anglo-Australian Rio Tinto (RTP). CVRD's American depositary receipts have more than doubled since, to 46.88 from 21. Rio Tinto's stock is up 53%, to around 308. \u001d  Much of the advance came from sky-high commodity prices. But the stocks also have gotten help in recent months from buyout speculation. Investors would do well to treat that speculation with caution. In fact, it's hard to make a case there's much upside left in the pair. \u001d  Like most companies in the metals sector, CVRD and Rio Tinto are considered well run, which suggests there would be little room for a buyer to make operating improvements. Any sale prices would likely be high, especially in view of the high level of commodities prices. It's hardly an opportune environment for takeovers, says Damien Hackett, global head of mining research at the brokerage Canaccord Adams. \u001d  In general, he thinks the shares are fully valued. Most stocks in the sector, he says, are trading at nine or 10 times estimated earnings for the year ahead -- about where they should be, given the record commodity prices. \"It's hard to imagine commodity prices going up in the next six to eight months,\" Hackett adds. \u001d  Hackett, who is based in London, expects shares of the major players in the metals sector \"to drift sideways for the next three to six months . . . until the economic outlook changes.\" If the global economy slows, as he expects, the sector could take a hit. \u001d  As the folks in the mining industry have always known, all that glitters isn't gold. That goes for high-flying stocks, too. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b5b87adcf250bce353d4668229596398","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Airbus CEO: Aim Isn't To Sell More Planes Than Boeing","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T12:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","BA","NL0000235190","US0970231058"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","ARO","ASP","XCA4","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XMDAX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 08:00 ET (12:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bb4aa38b8a001b1b025166f9afa79d15","symR":["BID","BSC","DJ","EVST","FIG","GS","NKE","PENN","PSO","PSON.LN","UA","GB0006776081","US38141G1040"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) The Trader: In The Mood For A -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BID","BSC","DJ","EVST","FIG","GS","NKE","PENN","PSO","PSON.LN","UA","GB0006776081","US38141G1040"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","CLO","CNO","CSV","FOT","MED","PUB","SCR","TEX","XDJGI","XFFX","XFT1","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\u001d  Stockholders will reflexively argue that their stake is worth more, but Everlast's prospects indeed look bright.

The company's stock (ticker: FWLT) also has been a beneficiary, soaring almost 700%, to a recent a 107, from the 13.43 at which it stood when we first wrote about the company's turnaround (\"Survivor,\" Jan. 31, 2005). The shares aren't particularly expensive, however, because Foster's earnings also have skyrocketed. Earnings are expected to rise to $5.46 a share this year, almost double last year's $2.78. Analysts forecast continued earnings growth in 2008, to $5.95. \u001d  The shares are changing hands at just 18 times next year's estimates, roughly even with the broad market's price-earnings multiple and below the 22 times earnings sported by peers Fluor (FLR) and Jacobs Engineering Group (JEC). Foster Wheeler's discount typically is attributed to its near-death experience in 2004, when too much debt and cost overruns resulted in a major restructuring. \u001d  With corporate headquarters in Hamilton, Bermuda, and operating headquarters in Clinton, N.J., Foster Wheeler remains confident it's business still has room to run, based on the volume of projects still in the conceptual stage. \u001d  If the preliminary work \"proceeds to project, it suggests that this market is with us for at least five more years,\" says an optimistic Ray Milchovich, the company's CEO. \u001d  Vance Brown, a principal at Grisanti, Brown & Partners, a New York money manager, sees Foster earning an above-consensus $7 a share in 2008. Giving the stock a 20 multiple on those earnings, he arrives at a target price of $140. \u001d  A large chunk of the company's business comes from building refineries and oil and gas facilities. So one risk is a sharp drop in oil prices, now about $68 a barrel, could scuttle projects. Milchovich seems unfazed: \"Our view is that these projects all proceed at $45 oil or maybe even less than that,\" he says. \u001d  Investors often overlook another Foster Wheeler business: supplying boilers and other equipment to power providers like utilities. This business, accounting for about 23% of cash flow, looks to be picking up as the world's power needs expand. The could give the company -- and its stock -- an even bigger surge. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf18c4f8ef9cc084283fc1a1a36f40c4","symR":["CVC.YY","CVN.YY"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Cinven Set To Win BUPA Hospitals Auction -Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T12:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CVC.YY","CVN.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Private equity firm Cinven (CVN.YY) is set to win the GBP1.5 billion contest for the U.K. private hospitals of health care provider BUPA, The Times of London reported Saturday, quoting unnamed people familiar with the situation. \u001d  The newspaper said that Cinven and CVC (CVC.YY) were the final bidders on the shortlist but CVC was told last night that it was out of the race. \u001d  According to the Times, the sources said Cinven was in the final stages of contract negotiations Friday night and that an announcement could come as soon as this weekend, although the sources cautioned that the deal could yet fall apart. \u001d  It also needs the approval of the Department of Health, the newspaper said. \u001d  BUPA put the 26 U.K. hospitals up for sale in April and the auction attracted interest from a string of private equity bidders, drawn by the value of the property portfolio, strong cash-flows and an ability to sell services to the NHS. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.timesonline.co.uk \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9330 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 08:21 ET (12:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c424ce55341308c5558e7183081e8b01","symR":["005490.SE","PKX","KR7005490008"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Posco Mulls Lifting Steel Plate Output By 1.5MT-2MT By 2008","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T07:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["005490.SE","PKX","KR7005490008"],"IndustryCodes":["STL","XATI","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 03:09 ET (07:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"cbc3a5e90684940640a017e40a9ef504","symR":["CVGRX","SHRAX","VIGRX"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Profile: Left On The Dock","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CVGRX","SHRAX","VIGRX"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By J.R. Brandstrader \u001d  Dave Herman is a man of leisure. He spends his time visiting the grandkids in St. Louis, playing golf three or four times a week and traveling to exotic places like the Galapagos. He owes his prosperity to mutual-fund investing, which he's been doing since 1982, usually with success. \u001d  \"I got hurt in 1987, but I left it all in and eventually made it all back,\" says the 64-year-old part-time personal trainer, who is retired from the New York City Board of Education. Thecrash of 2000-2002, which was triggered by the bursting of the tech bubble and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, was a different story. \"We took a hit just like everybody else,\" he confesses. \"We didn't clear our positions fast enough. We had heard the market was frothy the year before, but it was greed versus fear, and we were piling up money.\" \b \u001d  These days, Herman keeps a sharper eye on his investments, tracking them via Yahoo! Finance, one of a growing number of sites offering free tools that make it easy to produce instant readings on how your portfolio has done over any period. \"I find them very easy to use,\" he observes. \"You can track [a fund] on a daily basis, a yearly basis against its peers and how much is being made. If the fund goes ex-dividend, you can edit the portfolio to add those shares in.\" \u001d  New tools to follow how the investor, rather than the fund, performs are creating a sea-change in mutual-fund investing. The industry generates reams of disclosure documents every year, but until recently most investors had little idea of how they were really doing. The difference between the typical individual's return and the return a fund reports can be startling. \u001d  If you deposited $10,000 at the beginning of a one-, three-, five- or 10-year period and just held it -- never depositing more and never withdrawing -- your return would match the marquee total. Few investors, however, enter on the first trading day of a year and then sit tight, neither buying nor selling, for precisely the same periods that funds focus on in prospectuses and ads. And the reality is that a mutual-fund investor's real returns depend greatly on when he sells or buys shares and the amounts involved in the transactions. \u001d  But most funds don't make it easy for their shareholders to tell precisely how well or poorly they've done over any given period. \b \u001d  \"I have been complaining about this for a decade,\" said John Bogle, who founded Vanguard, the big mutual-fund company, and now runs Bogle Financial Markets Research Center in Valley Forge, Pa. \u001d  Examples of the difference between published returns and what an investor actually gets are plentiful. To cite just two: Calamos Growth A Mid-Cap Growth (ticker: CVGRX) gets five stars from Morningstar for its 10-year return of 18.75%, but the average investor's return was 9.76% in that stretch -- a gap of 8.99 percentage points. Legg Mason Partners Aggressive Growth A (SHRAX), which has four stars from Morningstar, posted a 14.33% average annual return over 10 years (ended March 31) -- 6.50 percentage points better than the 7.83% the typical investor received. \u001d  In an e-mail, John P. Calamos Sr., the head of the Calamos fund group, concedes that the calculation is interesting but writes that it \"does not reflect the true investor experience but rather a weighted average of what Morningstar perceives to be an experience. Our long-term investors have participated in tremendous performance of the fund despite what this calculation may say.\" A Legg Mason spokesperson declined to comment. \u001d  And the return gap isn't confined to actively managed funds. Vanguard Growth Index (VIGRX) has returned 6.29% over 10 years (ended May 31), while the average investor got just 1.81%, for a 4.48 percentage-point difference. \u001d  One thing that hurts investors in such funds is a propensity to pour money into them when the market is rising and thus their share prices are climbing, too, and a reluctance to add money when the market is going south and share prices are on the downswing. Thus, they let opportunities to make big gains steam away, but are on board when their investment ship is about to founder. They buy high and sell low. \u001d  In great part, this accounts for a dismal statistic: \"The average equity investors' annualized return between 1986 and 2005 was 3.9%, while the Standard & Poor's return was 11.9%,\" says Lewis Harvey of Boston-based investment-research firm Dalbar. \u001d  In short (to borrow from the ancient Roman historian Sallust), investors are, to a large extent, the architects of their own fortunes. Even if the world's greatest stock selector is at the helm of a fund, his work can be futile if his shareholders get in -- or leave -- at the wrong time. \u001d  One particularly perilous period: the end of a quarter, when some portfolio chiefs engage in \"window dressing,\" recasting their holdings to make it look as if they contain many of the stocks that have gained the most over the preceding three months. \u001d  \"Managers don't want to be caught with a dog in the portfolio during their quarterly reporting, so they swap an underperformer for a top performer that makes you look good to your clients,\" says Jonathan D. Pond, author of You Can Do It: The Boomer's Guide to a Great Retirement. \u001d  The mutual-fund industry hasn't been eager to broadcast the discrepancy between reported returns and those that the typical investor gets. It wasn't until last October that Morningstar introduced its Investor Return reading: a dollar-weighted gauge, rather than total return, which is time-weighted. \u001d  \"We had actually been running the data on a one-off basis for a number of years where we had been looking at cash flows in and out of funds, and we thought it would be a real valuable addition to the investor tool kit to roll it out for all of the funds,\" says Christine Benz, director of mutual-fund analysis at the Chicago-based investment-research outfit. \u001d  Don't count on finding the investor return for every fund that Morningstar rates. The company won't calculate it unless it has complete cash-flow data for a given fund. \u001d  Craig L. Israelsen, who teaches family finance at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, says that investor return is a good metric because, in his view, accounting for asset flows in the measurement of performance is a crucial issue. \u001d  Financial planner Lewis J. Altfest of New York's L.J. Altfest & Co. doesn't think investor return will steal total return's thunder. \"It is an additional item that should be looked at, just like risk-adjusted returns,\" he says, cautioning that \"you are preaching all of this complicated stuff to people who need to know basics.\" \u001d  In any case, Altfest believes that the personal rate of return trumps all other metrics. \"People don't look at [their investments' showing] relative to a benchmark. They look at their own performance. If you get a new client when the market goes down, you have a 50% chance of losing that client,\" he said. \u001d  If you want to track your own performance, you can try a formula provided by Henry K. \"Bud\" Hebeler, the author of J.K. Lasser's Your Winning Retirement Plan: Before-tax return % = 100 x (year-end balance minus beginning-of-year balance, minus the sum of annual deposits plus the sum of annual withdrawals) divided by (beginning-of-year balance plus 1/2 x the sum of annual deposits minus 1/2 x the sum of annual withdrawals). \u001d  Got that? If this seems too time-consuming, you can track your investments through free interactive charts provided by Google Finance, Yahoo! Finance and Morningstar. \"In our portfolio-manager tool, you can see your individual return on a given fund, based on the timing of your purchases and sales in a tab called 'My Performance,'\" says Morningstar's Benz. \u001d  Unfortunately, some people don't pay close attention to their personal rate of return, but rather focus on whether the bottom line is growing or shrinking. \u001d  What's a lazy investor to do? \"Buy good funds in moderate proportion and hang on to them,\" says Pond, who manages about $100 million. \"Over time, there shouldn't be a big gap between stated performance and your dollar-weighted return.\" \u001d  You also can invest in mutual funds with companies that provide personal investment returns on statements. Among them, according to Dalbar, are Allianz Global Investors, American Century Investments, BlackRock, Delaware Investments, Oppenheimer & Co., and Pimco. In addition, some fund groups, like T. Rowe Price, track the average price clients pay for funds -- an important tool for calculating returns. \u001d  --- \u001d  J.R.

Our 21 target assumes ACMR should trade at 1 time our projected long-term earnings-growth-rate of 20%, or 20 times our 2008 earnings per share estimate of $1.03 . . . based upon its longer-term strong organic growth potential in the profitable arts-and-crafts industry. \b \u001d  Anadarko Petroleum \u001d  -- APC-NYSE \b \u001d  Buy/Aggressive \u001d  -- Price 49.65 on June 12 \u001d  by A.G. Edwards \b \u001d  We recently met with Anadarko's Rockies VP, Jim Kleckner, and a number of [other] personnel, focusing on the Greater Natural Buttes/Uinta Basin, Wattenberg/DJ Basin, Powder River Basin/Wyoming coal-bed methane areas and Rockies transportation and pricing. . . . Based on the successful restructuring (asset sales and debt reduction) of APC, multiple operational and financial catalysts, and a still-depressed asset valuation, we are raising our price objective. . . . APC is currently trading at 6.1 times 2007 estimated EV-Ebitda [enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization], 5.5 times 2008E, or roughly a 4% premium to the group, but at only 100% of year-end '07 projected net asset value of $50.28, or 30% below the peer group average. In addition, APC's YE07 proved reserves are trading at . . . a 26% discount to the group. Our revised price objective of $58 [raised from 52] is based on reaching 6.7 times 2007 EV/Ebitda and 115% of NAV, well within historical ranges of 4.5 to 7.5 times and 80% to 150%. \b \u001d  Carlisle Companies \u001d  -- CSL-NYSE \b \u001d  Outperform \u001d  -- Price 43.30 on June 11 \u001d  by R.W. Baird \b \u001d  Announced departure of current CEO, [which] while surprising, was part of orderly internal transition process. . . . CSL maintains relatively stronger pricing power than other diversified industrials (particularly in roofing). Pricing actions have essentially offset higher materials costs. Management goal of 10% operating margin in primary businesses appears achievable . . . Despite ongoing capital-expansion initiatives, we expect FCF [free cash flow] to expand in '07, providing support for increased acquisition activity and/or financial de-leveraging. A new tire and wheel facility in China should bring $60 million of outsourced product back in-house, [and] 50 new tire [types] are in development at that plant, which should benefit '08 sales . . . Our 53 target is based on a 15 times multiple applied to our 2008 EPS estimate, the average forward P/E [price/earnings ratio] accorded the shares since 1995. \b \u001d  Coley Pharmaceutical Group \u001d  -- COLY-NNM \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 8.16 on June 12 \u001d  by Merriman Curhan  Ford & Co. \b \u001d  COLY announced the acquisition of clinical and late preclinical-stage compounds from 3M Pharmaceuticals [recently]. Drivers that we believe can provide potential upside for investors in the next year include data from Pfizer's two Phase III clinical trials of PF-3512676 for non-small cell lung cancer, an increased clinical commitment by Pfizer for Coley's compound (PF-3512676) in new cancer indications, and advancement of preclinical drug compounds. . . . Reiterate Buy. In our view, Coley should provide additional upside for investors because of a strong partnered late-stage clinical oncology program, a strengthened pipeline, and potential revenue generation. Data from Pfizer's non-small-cell lung cancer Phase III clinical trials can be expected in late 2007 or early 2008. Market cap: $218 million. Risks: In the biotechnology space, there is always a risk that other companies or universities may have filed or been granted patents [for] technologies similar to [those] used by Coley. Note: there have been patent disputes between Coley and Dynavax. \b \u001d  Fuelcell Energy \u001d  -- FCEL-NNM \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 7.34 on June 13 \u001d  by Lazard Capital Markets \b \u001d  We recently hosted a site visit with FCEL management at the Sheraton Hotel & Towers in New York, where one of the company's Direct Fuel Cell units is installed. The DFC unit has been in operation two-plus years and provides about 10% of the hotel's electricity needs . . . the unit's waste-heat is used for the hotel's hot-water requirements. We are reaffirming our thesis that the company is in a position to receive the largest order in its history, related to Connecticut's Project 100 . . . Bookings prospects in other key markets also remain strong and the company recently received . . . orders in South Korea. \u001d  Management . . . expects to achieve an additional 20%-to-25% cost reduction through volume benefits. As with any company in the early states of commercialization, primary risks include balancing cash burn while establishing key strategic markets. Our 12-month price target of 11 reflects a 30 times multiple on two potential revenue and earnings scenarios, 90 cents to $1.20 over the next five to seven years, discounted back five years at 25%, given the risk associated with early-stage commercial companies. \b \u001d  Interactive Brokers Group \u001d  -- IBKR-NNM \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 28.70 on June 13 \u001d  by Sandler O'Neill & Partners \b \u001d  With 15.9% market share of exchange-listed equity-options volume traded worldwide last year, we believe IBKR is well-positioned to take advantage of the strong secular growth in option volumes. From 2001-'06, the compound annual growth rate from global options was 18%, while U.S. options grew 20.9%, and exchange-traded derivatives grew 34%. This growth has accelerated over the past two years. Penny-pricing, while a risk, is also a potential positive for volume. In January, the Securities and Exchange Commission began a pilot program to trade options on 13 securities in reduced increments. Initial results from the pilot appear to show that volume increases outweigh declines in profitability for market makers. But the SEC has not [yet] decided whether to extend or expand the pilot. While [an] expanded pilot might have negative implications for IBKR's trading profitability, tighter spreads might also lead to volume growth that offsets any effect on trading gains . . . We expect IBKR to earn $1.32 per share in 2007 and $1.58 in 2008. Our $32 price target is based on a 20 times multiple of our 2008 EPS projection. We justify this multiple based on our projection for 19.7% earnings growth in 2008 and a P/E to growth ratio of 1 time. \b \u001d  McAfee \u001d  -- MFE-NYSE \b \u001d  Outperform \u001d  -- Price 35.12 on June 13 \u001d  by Pacific Crest \b \u001d  At [recent] analyst day in New York City, CEO Dave DeWalt articulated a bullish plan targeting new opportunities and further operational efficiencies. Overall, it reinforced our thesis that McAfee will continue to gain market share in its consumer and corporate businesses as well as improve operating margin. We believe that DeWalt and new senior level executives are working to streamline McAfee and drive further operational efficiencies in its various business segments. In our view, this should lead to expansion of operating margin in 2008 beyond our 25.8% forecast. The company said it will likely have its internal options review completed . . . by the end of June. While full financials are not likely to be filed until late Q3 . . . our fundamental outlook is unchanged. Our price target of $43 is based on 23 times our 2008 EPS estimate of $1.85. Market and macroeconomic condition could interfere with this price target, [yet] . . . McAfee is benefiting from the sector's ongoing strength. The company has eliminated its underperforming and nonstrategic Sniffer, Magic and NAI Labs business units and is focusing on its core competency. \b \u001d  NeurogesX \u001d  --NGSX-NNM \b \u001d  Buy \u001d  -- Price 7.95 on June 12 \u001d  by Pacific Growth Equities \b \u001d  NeurogesX's topical capsaicin patch and follow-on, high-dose capsaicin liquid formulation have the potential, in our opinion, to become the standard of care for the treatment of [several types of pain, such as pain from post-herpetic neuralgia, HIV digital-sensory neuropathy and diabetic neuropathy] . . . While there are no publicly disclosed plans at this time for studies in these settings, we do not believe these opportunities should be ignored when considering NGSX . . . we estimate NGSX has sufficient cash to late 2008 (without European partnership) and into mid-'09 . . . the emerging role of topical treatments in the very large osteoarthritis and back-pain markets could tip the economics in favor of a global transaction. We project NGSX should achieve product sales in the U.S. in 2012 of $287 million and royalties from European sales of $14 million. Based upon 18 times and 7 times multiples of our fiscal-year $14 million and $287 million royalty and sales estimates or 30 times our FY12 $6.28/share EPS estimate, and 30% discount rate, we put the potential fair value of NGSX at approximately 49 to 52 per share. \b \u001d  RBC Bearings \u001d  -- ROLL-NNM \b \u001d  Outperform \u001d  -- Price 39.91 on June 13 \u001d  by Barrington Research \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d22f28ac1186fdac45b9c7c7c64cece5","symR":["AEO","CAT","PGR","TGT","UTX","US9130171096"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Speaking Of Dividends: Dow Duo Vote Raises","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AEO","CAT","PGR","TGT","UTX","US9130171096"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","INP","INS","RTB","RTS","SAP","TRQ","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Shirley A. Lazo \u001d  Dividends are taking off again at United Technologies. \u001d  Wednesday, the $48 billion aerospace and building-services conglomerate boosted its quarterly common payout 21%, to 32 cents a share from 26.5 cents. Holders of record Aug. 17 are scheduled to receive the enhanced payout Sept. 10. The ex-dividend date is Aug. 15. At a 52-week high Friday above 72, the stock yields 1.78%. \u001d  Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies (ticker: UTX) has nearly tripled its dividend in the past six years, and this is the 14th consecutive year in which it has hiked it. \"The board's action reflects consistently strong cash flow and affirms our confidence in sustained earnings growth,\" said Chief Executive George David. \u001d  Dividends have been paid without interruption since 1936. The company repurchased $2.07 billion worth of its common in 2006 and has plenty of room left in the current authorization to pick up more. \u001d  United Tech, whose corporate roots stretch back to 1853, when Elisha Graves Otis opened his elevator factory, is best known for its Otis elevators (No. 1 in the world), Carrier heating and air-conditioning systems (ditto), Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Sikorsky helicopters. Its engines power better than 50% of the world's commercial airliners, and its systems can be found on over 90% of the globe's aircraft. \u001d  First-quarter net rose 7% from the level a year earlier, to $819 million, or 82 cents a share, on a 16% gain in revenue, to $12.28 billion. United Tech expects to post full-year per-share net of $4.05 and $4.20 a share, versus 2006's $3.71. Volume is likely to rise 6.7%, to more than $51 billion. \u001d  The company says it's positioned to capitalize on expected strong growth in Asia. \"We have some of the best emerging-market exposure of any company in the world,\" declared David. In addition, as a leading maker of fuel cells, United Tech is looking for ways to recapture energy lost during manufacturing and other operations. \b \u001d  Another of the world's industrial goliaths, Dow component Caterpillar (CAT), sweetened its common dividend Wednesday and, like United Tech, for the 14th year in a row. The new quarterly will be 36 cents a share, up 20% from 30 cents. It's payable Aug. 20 to investors on the books July 20. The stock goes ex-dividend July 18. This is the third straight year in which the Peoria, Ill., company has boosted its disbursement by at least 20%. Yield: 1.78%. \u001d  CEO James W. Owens credits the move to \"directors' continued confidence in Caterpillar's long-term outlook.\" Dividends have been ongoing since Cat's formation in 1925, via the merger of a pair of companies dating back to 1890. \u001d  The Dow industrials Wednesday posted their biggest one-day gain for 2007, and Cat was one of the leaders of the charge, climbing 2.4% and setting a 52-week high of 79.97. Friday it surged above 81. \u001d  The world's No. 1 maker of earth-moving machinery and a leading supplier of agricultural equipment, Cat also is a big maker of truck engines and power generators. The company is projecting 2007 earnings of $5.30 to $5.80 a share on $42 billion to $44 billion in sales-for its fourth consecutive record year. By 2010, Cat expects to be earning $8 to $10 a share on volume of $45 billion to $60 billion. Cat has ample cash flow to continue substantial stock buybacks. \b \u001d  Elsewhere in last week's dividend news, laid-back-clothing producer American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) dressed up its dividend 33%, to 10 cents a share from 7.5 cents. Payouts were initiated in September 2004, and this is the fourth boost, along with two stock splits. A stock-buyback program is in place . . . Giant discount retailer Target (TGT) raised its quarterly two cents, to 14 cents a share, and sweetened its buyback authorization by $3 billion, to $8 billion. Target has more than three decades of dividend growth to its credit . . . The nation's third-largest auto insurer, Progressive (PGR), will use about $3 billion in excess capital to pay a special dividend of $2 a share and to repurchase up to 100 million of its shares over the next two years. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d98f4e5166281fcb7240296b45464b89","symR":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Barron's Roundtable: Room To Run","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","BAN","BNK","BRD","BVG","CHC","CHM","CMT","CNO","CPR","CSV","CTS","DST","FAC","FOD","FTS","HIM","IDD","ISV","LOD","MED","OFP","OIS","RES","RTS","SAP","SEM","SFT","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTT","XSTX","XTSE"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Lauren R. Rubin \u001d  Dow 14,000, or bust. \u001d  Suddenly either alternative seems possible for stocks, as the outlook for interest rates turns murky. The Dow industrials and the Standard & Poor's 500 could race to new highs as corporate profits keep climbing -- or fall amid signs that the greatest party ever is ending for bonds. \u001d  With some notable exceptions, the members of the Barron's Roundtable still take the positive view and expect stocks to log modest gains in 2007, despite a correction, or even two. That's the story these celebrated investors told when we sat them down for their annual grilling Jan. 8, and they're sticking with it: The U.S. economy will grow by about 2% for the year; inflation will stay benign; profits will increase by 6% to 8%, and don't you just love natural-resources shares? \u001d  To be sure, our experts have a few fears: that the housing market's woes could worsen, crippling the consumer, and that there's a ticking bomb somewhere in that mountain of leverage built by the buyout kings. But they predict the fuse won't light -- that is, interest rates and their proxy, bond yields, won't head heavenward -- any time soon. In the pages that follow they explain why, and share their investment picks for the rest of what has become a most interesting year. \b \u001d  BILL GROSS \b \u001d  Barron's: You surely know how to make news, Bill, by turning bearish on bonds. What happened? \u001d  Gross: I raised my forecast for 10-year Treasury yields from a range of 4% to 5.5% to a range of 4% to 6.5%. It now appears the global economy isn't going to slow.To be fair, Pimco and I were impressed by global growth in the past few years, but were also suspicious that something would cause it to slow -- a declining dollar or a change in the current-account deficit or an implosion related to financial leverage. Now some of those fears have been pushed to the background. It looks like China is going to keep growing, and India, too, and that will influence the rest of the world. It's a glass half-full outlook, as opposed to a glass half-empty. \b \u001d  Q: Tell us, how does it feel? \u001d  A: It doesn't feel good. Bond guys are supposed to take the half-empty view. Our charge is like that of the New York Police Department: Preserve and protect. And our positions still suggest there will be a slowdown in the U.S., due to housing. But strong global growth does have repercussions in terms of the building blocks of bond prices -- namely, inflation. A few years from now, labor costs probably will move from having a deflationary to a reflationary impact, at the margin. Most of the cheap labor will be used up, and China's export prices will be revalued higher. Instead of a 2% inflation rate, we might be looking at 2.5% headed toward 3% toward the end of a five-year period. \u001d  The bond market sees some near-term cyclical strengthening in a number of areas. Bernanke [Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke] and the Fed have spoken to the fact that as we move toward the end of 2007, the economy will be moving back toward its growth potential. That's Fed-code for 2%, plus or minus, in the U.S. economy's real growth rate. \b \u001d  Q: But what about the weak housing market, to which you just referred? \u001d  A: We got the housing problem right, and it will continue to be a problem. It just hasn't rubbed off on the rest of the economy in the way we thought, in terms of employment or consumer confidence. It could have a weakening effect on consumers for the rest of the year, but other, more positive things are in place. Still, we are watching housing. We are watching trends in some of the more esoteric leveraged vehicles out there, and in the private-equity market. \b \u001d  Q: How have you changed your portfolio to reflect your altered world view? \u001d  A: We're positioned a little differently than we were in the past month or two. Our bond maturities and durations have moved a little closer to the Lehman Aggregate Index. More important, we're keeping our concentrations toward the front end of the yield curve, certainly in the U.S. That's because of the Fed, which is taking a wait-and-see attitude, and another complicating factor: the trend toward the development of sovereign wealth funds [large pools of money that sovereign nations are investing in stocks, commodities and assets other than government bonds]. This is something you can't model and for which there is little history. The best example, to date, is China's planned $3 billion investment in the Blackstone Group. \b \u001d  Q: That's $3 billion that could have been invested in Treasury bonds. \u001d  A: If money at the margin begins to move away from Treasuries into something else, then, yes, bonds are going to be affected. It helps to explain why bond yields never rose much as the Fed was raising rates since early 2004. As a money manager you want to be out front of the train. If they are not going to be buying Treasuries, maybe we should be unloading some of ours before they unload some of theirs. I am not suggesting China will be dumping Treasuries, but that at the margin Treasuries might not be bought. The Treasuries that won't be bought are the five-years, the 10-years and the 30-years -- the things they own. China and its compatriots own about 65% or 70% of these bonds. The front end of the yield curve is controlled by the Fed as opposed to the Chinese. It is not totally safe, as the Fed raises and lowers rates. But it is safer to analyze what the Fed might do than whether and what the Chinese might buy. Especially if sovereign wealth funds get going, the front end of the curve is the safe place to be. \u001d  On the other hand, you want to stay away from risky types of credits, as spreads are compressed. The typical high-yield index yields about 7% these days, versus the 5.2% yield on 10-year Treasuries. \u001d  That's awfully close for comfort. \u001d  Exactly. You could get 7% instead of 5% for the next six months, but what happens when there's a problem? Smart investors tend to anticipate these things and sell high-yield bonds, which in and of itself can beget more selling. Corporate bonds for the most part, and high-yields, and certainly subprime debt are moving into a vulnerable period, unless the economy really snaps back to its good old healthy self. We don't see that happening. \u001d  We do like some emerging-market debt, despite the attendant risks. Many of these countries in effect are less risky than the U.S. China is not an emerging market; it has a trillion dollars of reserves. The U.S. has only $50 billion, or 20 times less, in the bank. Brazil has $120 billion of reserves and offers interest rates in the 9%-10% category, well above high-yield bonds. It's not like the old days, when countries like Argentina defaulted on their debt. \b \u001d  Q: How about some specific recommendations? \u001d  A: In January, I recommended the iShares MSCI EAFE Index [ticker: EFA], an exchange-traded fund, which has done well in recent years. It represents stocks outside the U.S., in Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It is a play on lower valuations in the rest of the world, and stronger growth. And it benefits by being denominated in foreign currencies. The dollar is weak and getting weaker as we move through 2007. The Pimco Floating Rate Strategy Fund [PFN] offers another good opportunity. It yields 8.9%. It is a floating-rate bank-loan fund, and therefore a defensive holding if rates move higher. It provides first-lien protection if a company falters. \u001d  Thank you, Bill. \u001d  MARIO GABELLI \u001d  Q: How does the second half look to you, Mario? \u001d  Gabelli: We thought the economy would be sluggish in the first half because of inventory corrections in housing and the automotive market. Things have unfolded more or less along those lines, with the rest of the world looking stronger than the U.S. By the second half of the year the inventory correction in automotive will be out of the way. The housing market will remain sluggish, but the inventory correction in that market will be gone in 2008. In the meantime, exports, nonresidential construction, capital expenditures, wages and the wealth effect provide ballast. At the other end of the economy, consumers will suffer from higher gasoline prices and declining home values. Bottom line, the economy muddles through and starts looking brighter in '08. Short-term interest rates will stay at 5%; long-term rates will go up to 5.5%. The dollar will be weaker, particularly relative to the Japanese yen. Put all that in the mix, add a stock-market correction of 10% to 15% at some point, and the market will be up at most 5% for the year. I'm not negative. I just think '08 will be a lot better. \b \u001d  Q: At least the deal market is hopping, something you predicted for years. \u001d  A: I predicted lovemaking by the corporate world. Now the private-equity world has jumped in. The key question people in every corporate boardroom are asking is: Why do we need to protect our triple-A debt rating if the private-equity guys can buy us out and take on eight times our debt? Should we engage in financial engineering, taking on more debt to buy back shares? But the concept of greater leverage hasn't been stress-tested yet. The next time there is an economic slowdown and the banks don't lend as they did, that's when you'll need a healthy balance sheet. Right now boards aren't looking at stress-testing. They are looking at things like debt covenants and \"covenant lites.\" \b \u001d  Q: Explain, please. \u001d  A: Covenants are those elements in a loan indenture that say you need to have some multiple of cash flow relative to interest expense, so much debt to equity, so much interest expense and so on. Covenant lites don't have these restrictions. They allow you to go through a period of economic distress and not have an embarrassing moment. \u001d  On the deal front, corporate buyers are rampant. But the headline grabbers are the private-equity guys, who account for only about a quarter of the deals. We are no longer at the dawn of the fourth major takeover boom since the 1950s. But we are certainly not at the sunset. We are probably just starting the mid-afternoon. \b \u001d  Q: When does the stress-testing come? \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"dd7bc820b95c832c4cdec7218f91ea40","symR":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Barron's Roundtable: Room To Run -7-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["00897.AE","6425.JA","AAPL","AEO","APOL","ARO","AT","BIDU","C","CBRY.LN","CSCO","CSG","CVC","FKI.LN","GE","HLT","HPQ","HSY","IDTI","IMOS","KFT","LYO","MDS","NETL","PIR","PSUN","RIM.T","RIMM","S","SQAA","SQAB","SUNW","TDS","USM","VLO","VZ","WFC","WYNN","YUM","CA7609751028","GB0003294591","GB0006107006","JP3126130008","NL0000008977","US0378331005","US17275R1023","US1729671016","US3696041033","US4282361033","US8668101046","US91913Y1001","US92343V1044","US9497461015","US9884981013"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","BAN","BNK","BRD","BVG","CHC","CHM","CMT","CNO","CPR","CSV","CTS","DST","FAC","FOD","FTS","HIM","IDD","ISV","LOD","MED","OFP","OIS","RES","RTS","SAP","SEM","SFT","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTT","XSTX","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  Endo's core franchise is pain management, and its main product is Lidoderm, the only topical analgesic patch indicated to treat the pain of post-herpetic neuralgia. This product generated $567 million in sales in 2006 and has seen scripts [prescriptions] continue to grow at about 20% this year. Some are concerned about a potential generic threat to Lidoderm, but as of today, no one has filed and we and the company are confident in Endo's patent position. \b \u001d  Q: When do its patents expire? \u001d  A: The patent on Lidoderm has been extended through 2015. It is difficult to develop a generic of this type. Endo has recently launched its Opana franchise, for treatment of moderate to severe pain with the use of an opioid. After a slow initial launch, scripts are starting to accelerate rapidly, consistent with the company's increased marketing effort. Over time, Opana will represent an attractive asset. \u001d  Endo also has an interesting pipeline. It includes several late-stage opportunities, such as a topical ketoprofen patch for the treatment of acute pain associated with soft-tissue injuries, and Rapinyl, a fast-dissolving fentanyl tablet for breakthrough cancer pain. Both are currently in Phase III testing and are expected to be launched in 2009. Other products in development include EN 3285, a topical oral-rinse formulation for oral mucositis, currently in Phase II, and Frova, a long-acting triptan for which Endo is seeking menstrual-migraine-prevention indication, which could enhance the size of its current franchise. The FDA must say \"Yeah\" or \"Nay\" on this by Aug. 19. Endo has a strong and seasoned management team, including President and CEO Peter Lankau; Chief Scientific Officer David Lee and CFO Charlie Rowland. \b \u001d  Q: Where is the stock priced? \u001d  A: It trades for 34. By year end the company will have about a billion dollars, or $7.50 a share, in cash, and no debt. With this cash position, as well as continued strong cash flows, Endo is looking to make strategic investments, which may include acquisitions. We estimate Endo could earn about $2.40 a share in 2008. Excluding cash, that implies the stock is trading for about 11 times 2008 earnings, a significant discount to other specialty-pharmaceutical companies that don't have such pipeline assets or growth prospects. \b \u001d  Q: Are you betting the company will be bought out? \u001d  A: It is not part of the investment case, as it wasn't with Kos. My second pick has a market capitalization of only $300 million. It is relatively illiquid. Uluru [ULUR] is an early-stage company with an exciting technology and tremendous opportunities in large market applications. It is developing a portfolio of products using two innovative delivery technologies. The first is OraDisc, a transmucosal-delivery system, which has been approved by the FDA. The second involves hydrogel nanoparticle aggregate technology. The company already has three FDA-approved products and is in clinical trials on several product applications. \b \u001d  Q: How do these technologies work? \u001d  A: OraDisc can deliver drugs systemically across the mucosal surface or into the oral cavity. The device, which is effectively a small oral patch, can be tailored to various erosion rates to deliver therapeutics over different time intervals. This technology has numerous potential applications including oral, dental, systemic drug delivery and veterinary, and the company has signed several licensing arrangements with industry partners. \b \u001d  Q: What are the benefits of the hydrogel technology? \u001d  A: Uluru's hydrogel nanoparticle aggregate technology has been used to form a bio-material of varying strength and elasticity that has extensive applications in a range of potential uses. The most interesting include an alternative breast implant, projected to be a billion-dollar business; dermal fillers, another billion-dollar market, and advanced wound dressings, part of a $15 billion market. You have this small, white nanoparticle powder in an envelope, and let's say you're wounded in Iraq. Open the package, put the powder on your wound and it turns into a bandage, with antiseptics and antibiotics incorporated in it. \u001d  Uluru has an outstanding management team, lead by President and CEO Kerry Gray, and is in discussions with large numbers of industry players about developing these applications and bringing them to market. It reported positive cash flow in the first quarter and has a low expense structure, but it is too early to track the company on a quarterly earnings basis. It is an investment with a three-to-five-year horizon, which from its current price of about 5 a share could be a five-to-10-bagger. \b \u001d  Q: Nice. How did you happen upon Uluru? \u001d  A: It was brought to me by a friend in the business for 30 years. The company came to see us when the stock was about a dollar. It had a total enterprise value of $50 million. They did a $38 million financing, and we bought $10 million worth. We now own a little less than 20% of the company. \b \u001d  Thanks, Oscar. \b \u001d  ABBY JOSEPH COHEN \b \u001d  Q: You recently raised your 2007 earnings estimate for the S&P 500, as well as your year-end price target. Why? \u001d  A: Cohen: When we revised our estimate of operating earnings to $93 from $92, we also adjusted our year-end S&P price target modestly, to 1600 from 1550. First-quarter earnings came in stronger than we had expected, which gave us a higher baseline. More important, 2008 looks to be another year in which inflation is under control and economic growth continues. Toward the end of 2007, investors should be willing to pay for '08 results. That was our main motivation for 1600; the comparable number on the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 14,000. If our numbers are right, total returns this year, including dividends, will be about 15%. \b \u001d  Q: You're more optimistic than most. \u001d  A: Our forecast is a reflection of several things. The market began the year at attractive valuation levels, whether you look at multiples of earnings or sales, or comparable metrics. This is not a market that looks overdone. Our valuations are based on dividend-discount and discounted-cash-flow models. We use eight different mathematical assumptions that we think are reasonable. We are not reaching for the stars, and in some cases we try to be overly conservative. For example, even though intermediate and long-term interest rates have gone up in the past few weeks, they are still below the numbers built into our models. Also, we plug in earnings-growth estimates that are well below historical trends. \u001d  Many people who were concerned about 2007 pointed out properly that earnings growth would be slowing. Therefore, they couldn't see how stocks would go much higher. Our position has been different; we thought this might be a long-lasting economic expansion, in which case you could have a period of moderate growth and share prices still could rise. Historically inventory corrections bring U.S. economic cycles to an end, but inventories are under control. The expansion of the late 1990s was brought to an end through too much enthusiasm for business investment. That is not happening now. Globally, most established economies are experiencing moderate growth, and core inflation doesn't seem to be rising rapidly. \b \u001d  Q: Do you see any signs that the stock market is overheating? \u001d  A: In the public markets, no. We feel pretty comfortable with the market trading at 15-16 times earnings. The market doesn't look overheated on a price-to-sales basis, either. However, we expressed concerns about bonds prior to the recent selloff, especially lower-grade securities. We expressed concern about the narrow yield gap between high-quality bonds and lower-quality bonds, and now investors seem to have a lessened tolerance for that sort of risk. When volatility began to rise, as we expected, investors began to pay more attention to risks endemic to lower-quality bonds and lower-quality stocks. \b \u001d  Q: What could trip up this market? \u001d  A: There are long-term clouds, not near-term. These include things like U.S fiscal policy, the budget deficit, the aging of the baby boomers, who start to collect transfer payments and stop paying income taxes at very high rates. The long-term health of state and local governments also could prove problematic. There are liabilities associated with pensions, retiree health care and so on. But the real concern should be for other countries, whose populations are aging faster than ours. The U.S. benefits from immigration, and we have a higher birth rate than many countries. Europe, Japan and China all are aging faster. \u001d  In the near-to-intermediate term, the economy will grow at a 2.5%-3% rate. Core inflation will drift upward. The Fed will not undertake ugly policies any time soon. We just don't see the fundamentals disrupting the market. Geopolitical events are in another category, but we don't know how to forecast them. One thing we see is sector rotation. Incremental economic growth is coming from the more cyclical components of the U.S. economy: business investments, capital spending, exports. We still think this is a long cycle in energy. We are going to see renewed investment by energy companies. From the standpoint of S&P 500 earnings, energy companies are still doing extremely well. But their rate of profit growth has decelerated, which is one reason earnings growth overall is not as robust this year. \b \u001d  Q: Which energy companies do you like? \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"df80ce05b60ef0ec72a38be858c6c7a8","symR":["13190.FR","7201.TO","NSANY","FR0000131906","JP3672400003"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/18) Follow-Up: Carlos Ghosn's Comeback: Will It Work?","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["13190.FR","7201.TO","NSANY","FR0000131906","JP3672400003"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","X225","XATI","XCA4","XDJGI","XES"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Jay Palmer \u001d  Ghosn still is riding the trends -- only now they are headed down. In May, Renault's new-car sales plummeted nearly 10% in France, its home market. \u001d  That was only the latest bad news to hit Ghosn, who after becoming chief operating officer of Nissan in 1999 led the Japanese company from a record loss to six consecutive years of record profits. \u001d  Earlier this year, Nissan, 40% owned by Renault, missed its earnings and sales targets for the first time under Ghosn, prompting the company to cut jobs and close production lines. It also admitted that its public commitment to boost worldwide auto sales to 4.2 million vehicles by 2009 -- an 18% increase over the '05 sales number -- was now impossible. Ghosn decided he'd been doing too much and gave up direct oversight of Nissan's North American operations. \"One man can't humanly do what he was trying to do,\" says Pierre Nebout, who manages about 4 billion euros ($5 billion) in French and European stocks at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management in Paris. \"Now I believe the worst is over. Ghosn has a very good comeback strategy and it is on track.\" \u001d  But Renault's stock (RND.France), up almost 30% just since March, may have gotten ahead of the turnaround, Nebout suggests. Nissan's Amercian depositary receipts (NSANY) are down 9% since the start of the year, to 21.80, and could easily fall further if there are more missteps. \u001d  If there was one big flaw in Ghosn's latest three-year plan, it was a lack of new models at both Nissan and Renault in 2005 and 2006, when rivals such as Toyota and Honda were launching improved cars. \u001d  Ghosn means to change that. In North America, Nissan has launched the subcompact Versa and the Infinity G35 luxury sedan. In Japan, it recently introduced the Clipper Rio, a new mini wagon. After the launches of the second-generation Twingo and the budget Dacia Logan early this year, the hope in Europe is to get Renault sales moving higher again with the make-or-break Renault Laguna, a performance car that goes on sale in October. \u001d  Given Ghosn's track record, there's good reason to bet he'll come from behind in this race. Trouble is, too many investors already are waving the checkered flag at the finish line. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e74aa634a806bb71fd17e439f2f35907","symR":["12101.FR","LVMUY","PSO","PSON.LN","FR0000121014","GB0006776081"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Pearson Decision On Les Echos Sale Expected -FT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T11:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12101.FR","LVMUY","PSO","PSON.LN","FR0000121014","GB0006776081"],"IndustryCodes":["CLO","MED","PUB","TEX","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XISL","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--U.K. media and publishing firm Pearson (PSON.LN) is expected to decide on a sale of France's leading financial newspaper Les Echos within weeks after receiving interest from several potential bidders, the Financial Times reported Saturday. \u001d  The newspaper said a sale could raise an estimated EUR200 million (GBP135m) for Pearson.

And since hitting a record high last month, the shares command a premium that leaves little room for disappointment. So, it's no wonder that substantial selling by insiders has raised a few eyebrows (Inside Scoop, May 15). \u001d  \"If you are going to be disciplined about investing, you can't say 'Let's keep watching it go up, up, up,'\" says Brian Bolan, an analyst with Jackson Securities, which downgraded Blue Nile last month to a Sell. \"You have to be disciplined and lock in profits, and this is a time to lock in some profits.\" \u001d  Bolan isn't alone in that view. \u001d  Last month, American Technology Research initiated coverage with a Sell rating, and Lehman Brothers downgraded the stock to Equal Weight from Overweight. \u001d  In addition, ten Blue Nile insiders have sold 662,700 shares worth $32.8 million thus far this year, compared with 255,500 shares sold in all of 2006 by eight insiders, says Ben Silverman, director of research for InsiderScore.com. \u001d  \"When insiders boost the size of their sales and accelerate the rate of profit-taking, it's a good time for investors to step back and take a look at their own position,\" says Silverman. \u001d  A company spokesman declined to comment. \u001d  Founded in 1999 when CEO Mark Vadon purchased the assets and small Website of a Seattle jeweler (he signed a promissory note on the back of a dinner napkin), Blue Nile is a thorn in the side of mom-and-pop retail jewelry stores. \u001d  The company's Website hawks diamond rings, sapphire pendants and pearl earrings, as well as watches and sterling silver jewelry. But Blue Nile gets about 90% of its revenue by selling diamond jewelry. Its bread and butter remains nervous grooms buying engagement rings, says John Baird, a company spokesman. \b \u001d  \"I was skeptical early on,\" says Ken Gassman, president of the Jewelry Industry Research Institute. \"I didn't think anyone would buy diamond rings online.\" \u001d  Blue Nile operates no stores, is disciplined about spending and keeps little inventory. All this guarantees price tags up to 40% lower than those of a traditional jeweler. Shoppers can custom-build a diamond ring on the Website. And they have 30 days to return merchandise for a full refund. \u001d  \"They figured out a way to cut out some of the expenses and pass the value on to customers,\" says Mark Oelschlager, a portfolio manager at Oak Associates. \"Word of mouth helped the business, and people flocked to the Website.\" \u001d  Or as Baird puts it: \"It's Dell with Tiffany wrapping.\" \u001d  Talk about good timing. Online jewelry sales could more than double by 2010 to $6 billion, stealing 10% of the $60 billion U.S. jewelry market. \u001d  But neither Blue Nile nor online jewelry sales are entirely bulletproof. \u001d  Wall Street has set the bar high for earnings growth, projecting annual average gains of 21% over the next three to five years. This year, industry analysts expect the company to post profits of 90 cents a share, up 19% from 2006, and they project another 21% hike in 2008. \u001d  But after a 20% leap last year, the rate of growth for online jewelry sales is slowing, according to IDEX Research. And a weak housing market could lead some consumers to rethink their spending habits. \u001d  Rising diamond and precious-metal costs could put pressure on Blue Nile's gross margins, cautions Tim Boyd, an analyst at American Technology Research. The quarter that ends June 30 historically is a weak one for jewelers. If Blue Nile \"reports merely in-line earnings,\" for that stretch, \"the stock could correct as much as 10%,\" he maintains. \u001d  Meanwhile, store-based retailers, such as Kay Jewelers, are ramping up their online commerce efforts. And Blue Nile's success in selling high-end jewelry could attract larger online rivals, including Amazon.com (AMZN). That company already sells jewelry on its flagship Website. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment on its jewelry plans. \u001d  Like diamonds, Blue Nile's stock isn't cheap. At 63 times projected profits over the next four quarters, the shares trade well above their five-year median of 44 times forward earnings, a 50% premium to the basket of online retail stocks tracked by Thomson Financial. \u001d  To be sure, fans of the stock remain dazzled. And they point to the positives: \b \u001d  With Websites in Canada and the United Kingdom, Blue Nile could enter more markets in the next 12 to 18 months. Meanwhile, in the U.S., online jewelry sales continue to grow and take business away from brick-and-mortar vendors. In addition, the company is buying back stock. \u001d  But the recent rating downgrades could \"keep expectations in check,\" Oak's Oelschlager warns. And, given the stock's big run, Blue Nile will have to put up better-than-expected quarterly numbers to not falter. Finally, despite speculation that someone will buy the company, a takeout seems unlikely at the current stock price. \u001d  So investors hoping to add a little bling to their portfolios would do better to shop elsewhere. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 16, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ef2c301ca5699c96d647c1e8bfe6f61a","symR":["NLN"],"date":"2007-06-16","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": National Lampoon Announces Third Quarter Fiscal 2007 Financial Results","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-16T08:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NLN"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","MOV","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2007-- \u001d  National Lampoon, Inc. (AMEX:NLN), the leading brand in comedy, today released its financial results for the third quarter ended April 30, 2007. \b \u001d  The Company reported revenues of $813,917, compared to $1,537,806 for the third quarter of 2006 along with a net loss of $1,161,000 or ($0.18) per fully diluted share as compared with a net loss of $1,395,000 or ($0.25) per fully diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a pullback from the travel segment of the business, along with a decrease in promotion revenue, partially offset by an increase in advertising revenue, as the Company is now more focused on Internet advertising. The net loss for the third quarter includes non cash costs associated with accrued preferred stock dividends, option grants, and costs related to new Internet and film production initiatives. \b \u001d  \"It is very promising to see the growth in our online advertising revenue. Our relationships with Veoh, Joost, YouTube, and AOL Video, as well as our own properties, NationalLampoon.com, Knuckleheadvideo.com, and TogaTV.com, mean not only that our customers continue to believe in our brand and content, but that we now have even stronger platforms for distribution,\" commented Daniel Laikin, Chief Executive Officer. \"Our Internet content strategy continues to flourish with hits such as 'National Lampoon's 72 Virgins,' 'Star Wars, X-Wing Pilots - the Deleted Scene' and our newest property, 'Fat Guy Nation.'\" \b \u001d  \"I am also excited to welcome the traffic from our newest acquisition, DrunkUniversity.com. We feel this acquisition will be a focal point to our core college age humor market,\" continued Laikin. \"This quarter, we also focused on expanding the breadth of our content by producing motion pictures and publishing books through National Lampoon Press. I look forward to seeing the results as we continue our efforts to expand our film brand, grow our advertiser and user base, and continue to dedicate efforts on building our online platforms and increasing our opportunities.\" \b \u001d  National Lampoon is in post production of its first motion picture, \"National Lampoon's Bag Boy,\" and recently commenced principal photography on its second feature, \"Ratko, the Dictator's Son.\" \b \u001d  The selected financial data, including the results of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended April 30, 2007 compared to 2006, and the financial positions as of April 30, 2007 compared to July 31, 2006, is summarized in the following table: \b \bSelected Financial Data (unaudited) \b \b                                  Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended \b                                      April 30,          April 30, \b                                    2007     2006     2007     2006 \bU.S. $000's, except loss per \b share \b \bResults of operations \b \bTotal revenue                      $   814  $ 1,538  $ 5,931  $ 3,201 \bNet loss                            (1,161)  (1,395)  (1,171)  (4,322) \bBasic and diluted loss per share     (0.18)   (0.25)   (0.28)   (0.79) \b \bNet cash used in operating \b activities                           (657)  (1,367)  (1,189)  (4,860) \bNet cash used in investing \b activities                            (87)     (50)    (102)     (55) \bNet cash provided by financing \b activities                            653       15    1,771    5,310 \b \bFinancial position                     April 30,          July 31, \b                                         2007              2006 \bCurrent assets                     $           1,081  $           884 \bTotal assets                                   5,778            3,458 \bCurrent liabilities                            7,864            4,964 \bTotal liabilities                              7,864            4,964 \bShareholders' deficit                         (2,086)          (1,506) \b \bWorking capital                               (6,783)          (4,080) \b \b   About National Lampoon \b \u001d  National Lampoon, Inc.
