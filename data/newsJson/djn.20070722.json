petition to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and four other ministers by mail, the officials were quoted as saying. \u001d  The government had previously told the IAEA it had decided not to seek an inspection by the nuclear watchdog, rejecting the IAEA's offer to send its inspection team to the power plant. \u001d  \"Problems (at the plant following the quake) have been reported worldwide,

Overall, the transaction values the company at a maximum of EUR236 million. \u001d   Shareholders in the company, which traces its origins back to 1918 and patented the Moka Express coffee maker in 1933, first approved the IPO plan last April. Bialetti had revenue of EUR208 million in 2006, booking more than half of its sales in Italy and 18% in North America. \u001d  The company is selling shares at a price yet to be published, within a range from EUR2.35 to EUR3.15. Trading had been set to begin July 25. \u001d  The sole global coordinator and bookrunner for the listing will be the investment banking arm of Italian bank Unicredito Italiano SpA (UC.MI). \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.bialettiindustrie.it \b \u001d  -By Kenneth Maxwell, Dow Jones Newswires; 39-02-5821-9901; kenneth.maxwell@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 14:19 ET (18:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1cbc2298e7af5e04419772625fb1c14f","symR":["MVW.LN","GB00B03JF317"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Mavinwood PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T08:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MVW.LN","GB00B03JF317"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC"],"Story":"\u001d  Mavinwood PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B03JF317 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 04:37 ET (08:37 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1cde050a55bcb57b9c3163207700f347","symR":["BFY"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock NY Muni Income Trust II (BFY)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T07:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BFY"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  BlackRock NY Muni Income Trust II (BFY): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BFY or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 03:32 ET (07:32 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1d4a152e71c5ed6efc0d7676caa1d960","symR":["GB0001642072","GB0032399312"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Cairn Energy PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T07:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GB0001642072"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  Cairn Energy PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0001642072 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 03:26 ET (07:26 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1d59fdcb005b97dd2128ec977e1805d1","symR":["EPL"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Eagle Plains Resources","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T08:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EPL"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Eagle Plains Resources: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=EPL or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1d836562f6a5f074732cf80c0728b445","symR":["TDG.LN","GB0002570330"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for TDG plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T09:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["TDG.LN","GB0002570330"],"IndustryCodes":["TRS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  TDG plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0002570330 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 05:24 ET (09:24 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1d84366526b99b4b311b7c02e085965c","symR":["AKI.LN","GB00B0XQ4466"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Arthro Kinetics Plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T07:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AKI.LN","GB00B0XQ4466"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC"],"Story":"\u001d  Arthro Kinetics Plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B0XQ4466 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 03:12 ET (07:12 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"1dc0a99b158ef7b77719a09e6f16a0d1","symR":["6501.TO","HIT","JP3788600009"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Hitachi Applying Finger Vein ID Tech To Payment System-Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T21:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6501.TO","HIT","JP3788600009"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Hitachi Ltd.

\u001d  BERLIN (Dow Jones)--TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. (TRW) has pledged that in the case of a takeover of Siemens AG's (SI) VDO unit, it would keep its headquarters in Germany, reports Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, citing people familiar with the negotiations. \u001d  In addition, TRW has also pledged to keep the current workforce of VDO virtually intact, those people told FAS. \u001d  Siemens has said that it is considering offers for the business, while at the same time going through with the preparations of an initial public offering of VDO. Analysts estimate the value of the unit between EUR7.5 billion and EUR12 billion. \u001d  German automotive company Continental AG (CTTAY) is also interested in taking over VDO, and German industry officials have urged Siemens to sell to Continental rather than to a company owned by a foreign firm, fearing that the latter scenario would result in many job cuts, among others. \b \u001d  Newspaper

Hapoalim B.M. (POLI.TV), Israel's largest bank by market share, said Sunday it would sell Bank Massad, a smaller banking unit it owns, by the end of 2007, as it moves into the pension- and life-insurance advising sectors. \u001d  According to an agreement between Bank Hapoalim and The Ministry of Finance, the bank will be allowed to give pension advice to the private sector once it sells Bank Massad, but won't be able to give pension advice to the public sector until August, 2010. \u001d  The agreement also allows Bank Hapoalim, as well as all other Israeli banks, to enter the life-insurance advising market in 2010, Bank Hapoalim said. This agreement is part of the ongoing process of reforms to increase competition in the financial services sector. \u001d  Around 1142 GMT, shares of Hapoalim were down ILS0.19, or 0.88%, at ILS21.42

(NASDAQ: EVVV), a global endovascular device company, today reported financial results for its fiscal second quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  ev3's net sales in the second quarter of 2007 increased 29% to $65.4 million versus net sales of $50.6 million in the second quarter of 2006. Second quarter sales growth was broad-based and reflected a strong contribution from each of ev3's Cardio Peripheral and Neurovascular business segments, as well as a strong contribution from both domestic and international markets. \b \u001d  Jim Corbett, president and CEO of ev3 Inc., commented, \"We are very pleased with our revenue performance this quarter which included consistent and balanced performance across all of our major product lines. We continued to demonstrate the leverage of our sales and marketing investment through increased productivity in our sales forces across business segments and around the world.\" \b \u001d  ev3's net loss for the second quarter of 2007 increased to $11.9 million compared to $10.8 million in the second quarter of 2006. ev3's net loss per common share was $0.20 for the second quarter of 2007 compared to $0.19 per common share in the second quarter of 2006. Total weighted average common shares outstanding used in the per share calculations were 59.5 million and 56.7 million for the second quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively. \b \u001d  ev3's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), excluding charges for non-cash stock-based compensation, was a negative $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2007, compared to a negative $3.6 million in the second quarter of 2006. ev3 uses the non-GAAP financial measure, EBITDA, excluding charges for non-cash stock-based compensation, as a supplemental measure of performance and believes that this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP numbers to ev3's net loss for the respective periods can be found immediately following the detail of net sales by geography later in this press release. This information is also made available on the company's website at www.ev3.net. \b \u001d  Commenting on earnings, Jim Corbett stated, \"While we are very pleased with our revenue performance, progress towards our profitability goals this quarter was hampered by litigation expenses which were higher than anticipated. While we remain committed to achieving positive EBITDA, excluding charges for non-cash stock-based compensation, for 2007, the higher and ongoing level of litigation activity has made this goal more challenging.\" \b \b   Sales Review \b \u001d  In the second quarter of 2007, ev3's Neurovascular segment net sales increased 24% to $24.8 million versus $20.0 million in the second quarter of 2006. Within the Neurovascular business segment, sales of embolic products increased 36% to $12.8 million from $9.4 million, and sales of Neuro access and delivery products were up 12% to $12.0 million from $10.6 million. The primary growth drivers for the Neurovascular segment were the continued market penetration of both the Onyx Liquid Embolic System for the treatment of brain arterio-venous malformations (AVMs) and the Nexus family of embolic coils for the treatment of brain aneurysms. \b \u001d  Cardio Peripheral segment net sales in the second quarter of 2007 increased 33% to $40.6 million versus $30.6 million in the second quarter of 2006. Within the Cardio Peripheral business segment, stent sales increased 38% to $22.2 million from $16.0 million. Sales of thrombectomy and embolic protection products increased 50% to $8.4 million from $5.7 million, while sales of procedural support and other Cardio Peripheral products increased 13% to $10.0 million from $8.9 million. The largest contributors to the growth in the Cardio Peripheral segment were the EverFlex stent and the SpiderFX Embolic Protection Device, sales of which included initial shipments to the company's new marketing partner, Volcano Corporation. \b \u001d  On a geographic basis, ev3's second quarter U.S. net sales increased 29% to $39.6 million, while second quarter international net sales increased 30% to $25.8 million, over the prior-year quarter. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact of approximately $1.1 million on second quarter 2007 net sales compared to the second quarter of the prior year. \b \b   Business Highlights \b \u001d  During the second quarter of 2007, ev3 achieved new milestones both domestically and internationally, including: \b \b   Neurovascular Segment Accomplishments \b \u001d  Axium: ev3 successfully completed initial clinical evaluations of its new Axium coil system in June. Based upon favorable response from first users, ev3 anticipates a full market roll out during the third quarter. \b \u001d  Onyx: ev3's Onyx Liquid Embolic System achieved record net sales in second quarter. Onyx has become the standard of care for the treatment of arterio-venous malformations in many of the major teaching institutions in the United States. \b \u001d  Onyx 500: In April, ev3 received Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) approval from the FDA for its Onyx 500 Liquid Embolic System that is indicated for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Onyx 500 represents a new clinical tool for patients with challenging wide-necked cerebral aneurysms that are difficult to treat with conventional embolic coil technology. During the second quarter, initial cases were successfully completed and physician training began for ev3's proctoring program. ev3 also initiated a clinical trial to further validate the benefits of Onyx 500 in treating wide-neck aneurysms. \b \u001d  SOLO: ev3 continued to make progress with its SOLO stent, the industry's first such product that is fully retrievable. Given its unique design, ev3 envisions several potential applications for SOLO, including temporary placement across the neck of an aneurysm to facilitate packing with coils or a liquid embolic. ev3 continues to expect to launch SOLO in Europe later this year. \b \b   Cardio Peripheral Segment Accomplishments \b \u001d  This quarter saw the Cardio Peripheral segment achieve a number of significant clinical and commercial milestones. Perhaps most notable, was the conditional IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) approval from the FDA to study the use of ev3's Protege EverFlex Self-Expanding Stent System in the treatment of peripheral artery disease. The trial, called DURABILITY II, is designed to demonstrate the stent's long-term patency and fracture resistance in symptomatic patients with PAD in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) as well as the proximal popliteal arteries in the leg. Importantly, this will be the first trial to examine the use of a single stent for treating lesions as long as 16 centimeters. ev3 expects the first patients to be enrolled in this trial during the third quarter. \b \u001d  Consistent with ev3's overall strategy to drive science and clinical indications across the entire ev3 peripheral portfolio, ev3 is planning on a clinical trial with patients with PAG in the iliac artery to study use of its Protege GPS, Protege EverFlex and Primus products. ev3 expects to begin be enrolling patients in this trial in the fourth quarter. \b \u001d  Also during the second quarter, ev3 began enrolling patients in its CREATE carotid stenting post approval study. This study will examine the treatment of high risk patients with carotid artery disease utilizing ev3's Protege carotid stent and SpiderFX Embolic Protection Device. ev3 anticipates having 500 patients enrolled in the CREATE study by year end. \b \u001d  As previously announced, ev3 entered into a joint marketing and distribution agreement in April with Volcano Corporation, allowing Volcano to sell ev3's SpiderFX Embolic Protection Device in conjunction with two of Volcano's products for the endovascular treatment of diseased saphenous vein grafts. During the second quarter, ev3 commenced SpiderFX shipments to Volcano and completed the training of Volcano's sales force. \b \b   International Accomplishments \b \u001d  ev3 opened up an office in Beijing, China during second quarter, with ten employees now on board. With one fifth of the world's population, ev3 believes China represents an important growth market for its products. \b \u001d  Another significant market opportunity for ev3 is Korea. ev3's Nexus product line has been extremely well received in Korea and the company received Korean regulatory approvals for Onyx on June 30, 2007. \b \u001d  Finally, in June ev3 completed the enrollment phase of its DURABILITY trial to evaluate the EverFlex stent for the treatment of SFA disease. This is one of several trials and registries being conducted in Europe this year. Follow up data collection is scheduled at six and twelve months. \b \b   Proposed Merger Transaction \b \u001d  Also today, ev3 and FoxHollow Technologies announced that the companies signed a definitive agreement by which ev3 and FoxHollow will merge in a $780 million cash and stock transaction. The proposed merger would create a new company with a market capitalization of approximately $1.7 billion, based on the companies' closing stock prices on July 20, 2007. Under the terms of the merger agreement, FoxHollow stockholders will receive 1.45 shares of ev3 common stock plus $2.75 in cash for each share of FoxHollow common stock they own. FoxHollow stockholders may elect to receive either $25.92 in cash or 1.62 shares of ev3 common stock for each share of FoxHollow common stock by making an all-cash or an all-stock election, respectively, although such elections are subject to proration to preserve an overall mix of 1.45 share of ev3 common stock and $2.75 in cash for all of the outstanding shares of FoxHollow common stock in the aggregate. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2007. \b \b   Outlook \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 17:00 ET (21:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4a948253023d387bc23d6009253d8a63","symR":["MDW.LN","GB0006633738"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Mediwatch PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T08:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MDW.LN","GB0006633738"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV"],"Story":"\u001d  Mediwatch PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0006633738 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 04:39 ET (08:39 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4aac5cccbc1731b8ee0872be7d3ecc0a","symR":["BDV"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Dividend Ach Tr (BDV)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T07:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BDV"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  BlackRock Dividend Ach Tr (BDV): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=BDV or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 03:20 ET (07:20 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4ad2fad4573d6b68e78deaea35953c2e","symR":["APX"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Apex Municipal Fund, Inc.

(NYSE: TXT) company, today announced details and rolled out a full-scale mock-up of its highly anticipated Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) - the Model 162 SkyCatcher - during a press conference at the opening of the annual Experimental Aircraft Association Convention, also known as AirVenture. This new aircraft brings a combination of experience and innovation to the LSA market. \b \u001d  \"For the past year, we have been soliciting feedback from the market on our proof-of-concept aircraft, and the result is an airplane that we believe is the most advanced and innovative in its class,\" said Cessna Chairman, President and CEO Jack J. Pelton. \"We have had more voice-of-the-customer input into the design of this aircraft than anything we've done in the past, and that has led to many design elements that make it easier for pilots and passengers.\" \b \u001d  The Teledyne Continental O-200D engine was chosen for this aircraft because of its advantages in operations, warranty and maintenance, and customers preferred it. The engine is air-cooled and has a greater mean-time-between-overhaul period than other engines considered, and it demonstrated a lower operating cost. \b \u001d  Other features incorporated in the Cessna LSA include electric elevator trim and mechanical flaps as well as a fixed-seat/adjustable rudder pedal design. The front seats pivot forward allowing easy access to rear baggage space through cabin doors on both sides of the fuselage. In addition, the dual control sticks designed by Cessna provide straight stick functionality and feel, while allowing easy access to pilot and co-pilot seats. \b \u001d  The SkyCatcher will cruise at speeds up to 118 knots and will have a maximum range of 470 nautical miles. The aircraft has a maximum gross weight of 1,320 pounds, a service ceiling of 15,500 feet, a useful load of 490 pounds, and a usable fuel load of 24 gallons. \b \u001d  At an introductory price of $109,500, first flight of the prototype Model 162 is set for the first half of 2008 and deliveries are expected to begin in 2009.

In Evesham, more than 30 guests and staff are still trapped on the upper floors of the Northwick Hotel \u001d  The Gloucestershire town of Tewkesbury remains cut off - and Severn Trent Water is warning householders in the north of the county water supplies could run out by early Sunday evening because a treatment plant has been flooded \u001d  Sutton and East Surrey Water has warned 80,000 households and businesses in Sutton to boil tap water before drinking it after the firm discovered rain had leaked into a tank of water which had gone out to customers. \u001d  Benn praised the way the emergency services had dealt with \"unprecedented\" levels of rainfall and said he had \"total confidence\" in the response of the Environment Agency. \u001d  \"This was very, very intense rainfall, with five inches in 24 hours in some areas, even some of the best defences are going to be overwhelmed,\" he told the BBC's Sunday AM programme. \u001d  There had been a cut in the Environment Agency's forward planning budget, but capital expenditure was being increased to GBP800 million from GDP600 million by 2010/11, he said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July

in July by Klaus Voges who heads up Siemens' power generation unit. \u001d  Siemens' comment, made by a spokesman, are in reaction to a report in German magazine WirtschaftsWoche, which states that French President Nicolas Sarkozy would like to see Areva NP, formerly known as Framatome, become a business completely owned by French companies. \u001d  Siemens' joint venture partner is French state-controlled energy firm Areva (CEI.FR), which owns the remaining 64% and has an option to buy Siemens' stake. \u001d  According to WirtschaftsWoche, Sarkozy's view on the Areva NP issue is part of the president's plan to create a giant French energy group, which would also include a merger of Areva with French construction conglomerate Bouygues SA (12050.FR).

Every store crowned a king and queen of the Ball who were rewarded for having the best costumes. Prizes were awarded for the winners of the Harry Potter Spelling Bee and the \"Great Snape Debate.\" The most coveted awards at Borders stores were a giant poster of the cover art for \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" signed by artist Mary Grand Pre, and the opportunity to be first in line to purchase the new book. \b \u001d  \"We are absolutely thrilled that so many customers chose to spend this very special evening with Borders,\" said Chief Executive Officer George Jones. \"Our store staffs worked tirelessly throughout the evening and early morning hours to give our customers an exceptional experience.

Reduction Begun Last Month, as Two Popular Plans Are Cut by $1 DVD Rentals Fast and Movies Over the Internet Instantly for Even Less \b \b \u001d  LOS GATOS, Calif., July 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The number one rated Web site in the world for customer satisfaction just gave people something more to love: lower prices.  Netflix, Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX), the world's largest online movie rental service, today announced it is dropping the price of two of its most popular subscription plans by $1. \b \u001d  The price reduction will benefit a majority of Netflix's more than six million members, as well as many more who will join Netflix in the coming months for a customer experience rated number one in independent research conducted by ForeSee Results and FGI Research.  For one low fee, Netflix members receive movies and TV series on DVD and can also watch a growing number of them instantly on their personal computers (PCs) over the Internet. \b \u001d  The two Netflix plans being reduced today by $1 provide unlimited DVD rentals and the ability to watch movies and TV series instantly on a PC for no additional charge.  The $9.99 monthly plan is reduced to $8.99 and provides unlimited DVD rentals with one DVD out at a time and the ability to watch nine hours of movies and TV series instantly on a PC.  The $17.99 monthly plan is reduced to $16.99 and provides unlimited DVD rentals with three DVDs out at a time and the ability to watch 17 hours of movies and TV series instantly on a PC. \b \u001d  The $4.99 and $13.99 monthly plans remain unchanged as their prices were already reduced from $5.99 in February and $14.99 in June, respectively.  The company said that positive subscriber reaction to lowering the $14.99 plan to $13.99 for unlimited DVD rental with two discs out at a time was an important factor in today's price reductions. \b \u001d  \"Netflix remains the best movie rental experience on the Internet,\" said Netflix Founder, Chairman and CEO Reed Hastings.  \"Netflix pioneered the online movie rental industry ten years ago and remains its leader by offering convenience, selection and value.  Today, value got a boost.\" \b \u001d  Today's announcement lines up the lowest prices Netflix has ever offered consumers, along with the same industry-leading service that subscribers have come to expect.  It also reinforces the company's credentials as the only online movie rental service to offer the added benefit of immediate gratification.  Netflix members can select movies and TV series from a growing library of more than 2,000 titles and start watching them on their PCs in as little as 30 seconds. \b \b \b \b    Here are the new prices and customer benefits for the three most popular \bNetflix subscription plans: \b \b \b    Price Plan                         Old Price     $9.99    $14.99    $17.99 \b                                       New Price     $8.99    $13.99    $16.99 \b \b \b    Number of DVDs out at a time                         1         2         3 \b \b    Number of DVDs you can rent per month        Unlimited Unlimited Unlimited \b \b    Number of hours you can watch instantly \b    on your PC                                           9        14        17 \b \b \b \u001d  Netflix members are not required to do anything to receive the price reduction.  Their new lower price will automatically be reflected on their next bill, on or after July 24, 2007.  Anyone wishing to try Netflix at no obligation may do so with a free two-week subscription at http://www.netflix.com. \b \u001d  Netflix has been the number one rated Web site for customer satisfaction for five consecutive ForeSee/FGI surveys since 2005.  The service's extensive catalogue; ease of use; fast, free delivery and personalized ratings and recommendations are some of the reasons why consumers rate Netflix so highly. \b \u001d  As previously announced, Netflix will release its second quarter 2007 financial results and business outlook at approximately 1:05 p.m. Pacific Time tomorrow, July 23, followed by an investor conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.  During that call, company management will address the financial implications of this price reduction.  The live Web cast of the conference call will be available on the investor relations section of the Netflix Web site at http://ir.netflix.com. \b \b    About Netflix \b \u001d  Netflix, Inc (Nasdaq: NFLX) is the world's largest online movie rental service, providing more than six million subscribers access to over 80,000 DVD titles plus a growing library of over 2,000 titles that can be watched instantly on their PCs.

\u001d  SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--Online DVD rental pioneer Netflix Inc. (NFLX) is lowering the price of its two most popular subscription plans by a $1 per month, relinquishing millions of dollars in revenue in an attempt to regain the upper hand in a cutthroat battle with rival Blockbuster Inc. (BBI) \u001d  With the reductions announced Sunday, Netflix will charge $16.99 per month for a plan that allows subscribers to keep up to three DVDs at a time with no limit on how frequently the discs can be mailed back in return for another movie. The price for a similar plan that lets customers keep one DVD at a time will fall to $8.99 per month. \u001d  The price cuts, which take effect Tuesday, match the fees charged by Blockbuster for similar online-only services. \u001d  Earlier this year, Los Gatos-based Netflix knocked $1 off two other plans that had previously cost $14.99 and $5.99 per month. \u001d  The latest changes will have a bigger impact on Netflix's finances because the price reductions are being made on the two plans that are most widely used by the company's 6.8 million subscribers. Netflix declined to specify how many subscribers use each plan. \u001d  Management is expected to quantify how much the price cuts will dent its future profits in a Monday afternoon conference call scheduled to be held after the company releases its second-quarter earnings. \u001d  Netflix's stock price already has dropped 24% so far this year amid worries about tougher competition from Blockbuster and video downloading services offered by much-larger companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). \u001d  When Netflix last cut the prices of its most popular plans in late 2004, Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings predicted the short-term financial pain would be worth the long-term market-share gains. \u001d  That prediction panned out. Netflix has added 4.5 million subscribers since lowering the price of its three-DVD plan from just under $22 in November 2004. The company also is making a lot more money, with earnings of $49 million last year compared with a $6.5 million profit in 2003. \u001d  But Netflix's momentum has tapered off since Dallas-based Blockbuster unveiled a new option in its own online service late last year. \u001d  For an additional $1 per month, Blockbuster gives online subscribers the flexibility to return and check out some DVDs in its stores at no additional cost. That convenience represents a significant advantage over Netflix, where all DVD deliveries are made through the mail - a limitation that means subscribers have to wait at least two days before receiving a new movie. \u001d  Netflix offers a selection of more than 2,000 movies and television shows that can be streamed over Internet-connected personal computers for subscribers who don't want to wait for their next disc to arrive in the mail. \u001d  Acknowledging Blockbuster has been eroding its market share, Netflix in April warned Wall Street that it won't add as many subscribers this year as it originally envisioned. \u001d  Stepping up its attack on Netflix also has been hurting Blockbuster, which has had to spend more heavily on DVDs to ensure sure its stores have enough discs to keep up with the additional demand from its roughly 3 million online subscribers. The company lost $49 million in the first quarter. \u001d  Blockbuster may not be willing to endure those kinds of losses much longer, especially with the recent hiring of a new CEO, James Keyes. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last month, Blockbuster said it will modify its online service \"to strike the appropriate balance between continued subscriber growth and enhanced profitability.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 15:06 ET (19:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

\u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--U.S. media company Warner Music Group Corp.

industry sources. \u001d  Analysts suggest the take-out price for Chrysalis would be about GBP100 million, the paper adds, while the Mail on Sunday reports it could be worth up to GBP180 million. \u001d  The Observer says Warner is also considering waiting to see whether Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., the U.K. private equity firm bidding for EMI, will want to offload EMI's recorded music division to reduce indebtedness following the takeover. \u001d  Warner and Chrysalis were not immediately available for comment. \b \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.guardian.co.uk \u001d

\u001d  IPIC earlier this month invited six companies to bid for the deal to build the 360-kilometer line, known as Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline, which will transport up to 1.5 million barrels a day of crude to Fujairah on the United Arab Emirates' east coast from Abu Dhabi. \u001d  Abu Dhabi, the largest U.A.E. sheikdom, plans to build the pipeline to bypass the Strait of Hormuz, the 33-mile-wide channel through which Persian Gulf oil producers ship their crude exports. \u001d  About 17 million barrels of crude oil, or 20% of global consumption, are being shipped through the tanker route every day. \u001d  Oil prices have risen over the past two years partly on fears Iran could block exports from the region through Hormuz if tensions with the U.S. over the Islamic republic's nuclear program escalate. \u001d  IPIC, which manages global energy investments in excess of $10 billion for the Abu Dhabi government, also invited Penspen International Ltd., VECO Engineering and JP Kenny Ltd. to bid for the so-called front-end engineering contract, the investment company announced in early July. \u001d  The Adcop project, targeted for completion in 2009, will involve building storage and terminal facilities for the crude export from Fujairah, which is surrounded by the Hajar mountain range. \u001d  The crude oil will be sourced from the onshore Habshan field in Abu Dhabi. The emirate pumps 95% of the crude in the U.A.E., which is the third-largest oil producer in the Persian Gulf after Saudi Arabia and Iran. \u001d  Contracts to carry out topographical and geological surveys and a study assessing the environmental impact of the pipeline are to be awarded imminently, the people said. \u001d  IPIC is also studying the option to build an export refinery in Fujairah, they said. \u001d  -By Oliver Klaus, Dow Jones Newswires, +9714 364 4961 Oliver.Klaus@dowjones.com \u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July

(AP)--The pilots in a jet crash last summer that killed 49 people left the terminal without receiving four important airport advisories, including one that said the normal taxiway to the main runway was closed, a newspaper reported Sunday. \u001d  The four updates - called Notices to Airmen - were missing from the flight dispatch paperwork the pilots received from Comair, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported, citing information the Air Line Pilots Association submitted to the National Transportation Safety Board. \u001d  Comair also relies on prerecorded messages to get local advisories from the Blue Grass Airport, but the taxiway closing wasn't recorded that day. \u001d  Randy Harris, president of the local National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said he didn't know why the notice was omitted. \u001d  Comair Flight 5191 crashed shortly after mistakenly taking off from the general aviation runway, killing all people aboard but one. The plane taxied to the wrong runway in the pre-dawn darkness. \u001d  Flight data recordings indicated the pilots thought they were taking off from the main runway and may have been confused by the alternate route. \u001d  The NTSB will release its findings and state a probable cause in the crash during a meeting Thursday in Washington. \u001d  The NTSB and the Air Line Pilots Association didn't return calls from The Associated Press on Sunday. \u001d  The pilots - Jeffrey Clay and first officer James Polehinke - also didn't receive information about the airport's general aviation runway being limited to daytime use and about the distance-remaining lights on the airport's main runway being out of service, the Herald-Leader reported. \u001d  Pilots contend the notice system is outdated and isn't always readily available. Anywhere from 300 to 1,000 notices are issued each day across the nation and can contain everything from departure procedures to airport construction. \u001d  Comair is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines Inc.

Cash and ev3 \u001d                                Stock   Transaction Anticipated to Offer Significant Revenue Synergies and \u001d             Enhanced Profitability for the New Company \bPLYMOUTH, Minn. & REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 22, 2007-- \u001d  ev3 Inc. (NASDAQ: EVVV) and FoxHollow Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: FOXH) today announced a definitive agreement by which ev3 and FoxHollow will merge in a $780 million cash and stock transaction. The proposed merger would create a new company with a market capitalization of approximately $1.7 billion, based on the companies' closing stock prices on July 20, 2007. This strategic combination, approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, will create a global leader in endovascular devices with net sales in 2008 projected to be in the range of $585 to $615 million. The combination also will provide the opportunity for the new company to achieve greater critical mass with significant cost and revenue synergies. \b \u001d  Under the terms of the merger agreement, FoxHollow stockholders will receive 1.45 shares of ev3 common stock plus $2.75 in cash for each share of FoxHollow common stock they own. Based on the companies' closing stock prices on July 20, 2007, this represents $25.92 per share of consideration to be received by FoxHollow stockholders, or a total consideration of approximately $780 million, and a premium of over 20 percent to the 30-day average trading price for FoxHollow's shares. Upon completion of the transaction, FoxHollow stockholders would own approximately 41 percent of the combined company, and ev3 stockholders would own approximately 59 percent. \b \u001d  ev3 and FoxHollow's combined scale will create an organization that possesses one of the largest U.S. distribution footprints in endovascular devices with one of the broadest and most technologically advanced product offerings. Upon completion of the transaction, the company's combined product portfolio will include a broad spectrum of products to treat vascular disease in both the peripheral and neurovascular markets, including atherectomy and thrombectomy, PTA balloons, stents, embolic protection devices, infusion catheters/wires, embolic coils and liquid embolics. The combined company will have direct operations or independent distributor presence in over 60 countries with more than 1,500 employees. \b \u001d  Jim Corbett, President and Chief Executive Officer of ev3, commented, \"This combination brings together two organizations that share a deep commitment to advancing the treatment of peripheral and neurovascular disease. By combining our respective strengths, we believe we can develop innovative technologies to address the needs of endovascular specialists and their patients, while also providing significant growth opportunities for employees and shareholders.\" \b \u001d  \"We know John Simpson well and look forward to working with the FoxHollow team to further advance the company's innovative technology,\" Mr. Corbett continued. \"In his role as Chief Scientist, John will work closely with our three business groups to guide technology development.\" \b \u001d  \"This is an exciting day for FoxHollow as we establish an even greater leadership position in the endovascular market,\" said Dr. John Simpson, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of FoxHollow. \"The combined company will enhance our aggressive market building activities and accelerate our clinical and research and development initiatives in this market. By combining our strengths, we will continue to provide our customers with innovative endovascular products for patients with vascular disease.\" \b \b   Key Benefits of the Transaction \b \u001d  Greater critical mass and revenue-generating opportunities. Upon the completion of the transaction, the combined company will possess a comprehensive portfolio of peripheral vascular and neurovascular products to meet a vast majority of the needs of endovascular specialists. A combined ev3-FoxHollow will bring together two experienced sales forces with well-established physician relationships. Leveraging the combined company's expanded product portfolio, the unified sales organization will be positioned to expand revenues through numerous cross-selling opportunities. In addition, ev3's strong international presence and sales infrastructure will be utilized to increase penetration of FoxHollow's SilverHawk(TM) technology outside the United States. \b \u001d  Significant cost savings and enhanced profitability. The transaction is expected to generate approximate annual cost savings in excess of $40 million from enhanced efficiency of sales and marketing efforts, increased purchasing scale, sourcing and logistics efficiencies and shared administrative services. As a result, the combined company expects to generate adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.70 in 2008 and $0.90 to $1.10 in 2009 as further described in the \"Guidance\" section below. \b \u001d  Focused and expanded research and development and clinical trial programs. The operating income of a combined ev3 and FoxHollow will be significantly enhanced, creating added resources to fund ongoing, focused R&D programs, future technology innovations and clinical studies. Additionally, the combined company will be better positioned to grow through external initiatives. ev3 intends to maintain FoxHollow's existing relationship with Merck & Co., Inc., which will further enhance the combined company's opportunity to develop innovative technologies for the endovascular treatment of peripheral vascular and neurovascular disease. \b \b   Guidance \b \u001d  ev3 expects calendar year 2008 net sales of the combined company to be in the range of $585 to $615 million. ev3 expects adjusted earnings per share for 2008 to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70, excluding transaction related expenses. This guidance assumes that only a portion of the anticipated revenue and cost synergies will be realized during 2008. For 2009, ev3 expects net sales of the combined company to be in the range of $700 to $750 million and reported earnings per share to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.10. Excluding all amortization expense, adjusted earnings per share in both 2008 and 2009 would be approximately $0.25 higher than the guidance provided above. The guidance above is based on pro forma, post merger, shares outstanding of approximately 107 million. \b \u001d  ev3's guidance currently anticipates no provision for U.S. Federal or State income taxes, and an approximately $1.0 million provision for foreign taxes. As a result of ev3's existing $468.8 million in U.S. and foreign gross net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\"), the company does not expect to pay U.S. Federal income taxes in 2008 or the foreseeable future. In the event that ev3 deems it necessary to record a provision for U.S. Federal taxes, the company expects that the tax rate would be approximately 35 percent. \b \b   Cash/Stock Election \b \u001d  As an alternative to receiving 1.45 shares of ev3 common stock and $2.75 shares in cash, FoxHollow stockholders may elect to receive either $25.92 in cash or 1.62 shares of ev3 common stock for each share of FoxHollow common stock by making an all-cash or an all-stock election, respectively. Cash and stock elections are subject to proration to preserve an overall mix of 1.45 shares of ev3 common stock and $2.75 in cash for all of the outstanding shares of FoxHollow common stock in the aggregate. As a result, a FoxHollow stockholder making an all-cash or all-stock election may receive a prorated amount of cash and ev3 common stock. It is anticipated that the stock portion of the consideration will be tax-free to FoxHollow stockholders. \b \b   Board and Management \b \u001d  Following the close of the transaction, Jim Corbett will become Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and John Simpson will become Vice Chairman of the Board and Chief Scientist. The combined company's Board of Directors will be comprised of 10 members, with six nominated by ev3 and four nominated by FoxHollow. It is expected that six of the 10 board members will be considered independent under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The combined company will be headquartered in Plymouth, Minn., with operating and manufacturing divisions in Irvine and Redwood City, Calif. The company's principal international office will be in Paris, France. \b \b   Timing and Approvals \b \u001d  The transaction is subject to approval of FoxHollow's stockholders as well as customary closing conditions and antitrust approvals, including expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. \b \u001d  The Boards of Directors of ev3 and FoxHollow have each approved the terms of the merger agreement and FoxHollow's Board of Directors has recommended that its stockholders approve the transaction. The stockholders of ev3 have approved the issuance of shares in connection with the transaction and the amendment to ev3's amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock ev3 is authorized to issue, through an action by written consent of the stockholders signed by Warburg Pincus Equity Partners, L.P., and certain of its affiliates, and the Vertical Fund I, L.P. and Vertical Fund II, L.P., which together beneficially own approximately 56.8 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of ev3. In addition, certain FoxHollow stockholders, including John Simpson and Merck, who together beneficially own approximately 31.7 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of FoxHollow, have entered into a voting agreement with ev3 under which they have agreed to vote all of their shares in favor of the transaction at the meeting of FoxHollow stockholders. \b \u001d  The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2007. \b \b   Advisors \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 17:01 ET (21:01 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9901b26d9e656a1bdd66f5ff15b1563c","symR":["SSO.T","SSRI","CA82823L1067"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Silver Standard Resources Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T09:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SSO.T","SSRI","CA82823L1067"],"IndustryCodes":["PCS","PPM","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  Silver Standard Resources Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=SSRI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 05:31 ET (09:31 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9976ff3750f1321e812c2cd66d7be891","symR":["CBST"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T07:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CBST"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=CBST or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 03:52 ET (07:52 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"99f746c8e21fd494fe88ca1edb6c62b5","symR":["HYV"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund, Inc.

Televisa said the agreement, which follows several months of negotiations, covers 22 channels including broadcast channels two, four, five and nine. \u001d  The signing comes a week after antitrust regulars placed \"must offer\" and \"must carry\" conditions on Televisa for its planned acquisition of a 49% stake in cable TV operator Cablemas SA (CBMAS.MX). Under those conditions, Televisa must offer its broadcast content to other pay TV operators under non-discriminatory conditions and must carry local broadcast channels on its Sky Mexico satellite TV system. \u001d  Televisa, Mexico's top broadcaster and the world's biggest producer of Spanish-language television programming, is boosting its cable TV holdings to take advantage of \"triple play,\" or the offering of phone, Internet and video service over the same network. Its cable unit Empresas Cablevision SA (CABLE.MX) added phone service this month to its television and broadband Internet offerings. \u001d  Televisa said Sunday that Maxcom will become the first phone company in Mexico to offer triple play service. The country's largest phone operator, Telefonos de Mexico SA (TMX), or Telmex, plans to launch video service in early 2008. \u001d  In a joint press release, Maxcom chief executive Rene Sagastuy was cited as saying the contract shows \"Televisa's willingness to give access to its audiovisual content to all pay TV concessionaires.\" Sagastuy said Maxcom plans to carry Televisa content to other cities in the near future. \b \u001d  -By Anthony Harrup, Dow Jones Newswires; (5255) 5080-3450; anthony.harrup@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 13:57 ET (17:57

\u001d  LOS ANGELES (AP)--Two guys named Chuck and Larry edged out a teenager named Harry at the weekend box office. \u001d  Adam Sandler and Kevin James' comedy \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry\" overcame bad reviews to debut ahead of \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\" according to studio estimates Sunday. But they were close enough that there was a slight chance rankings could change when final weekend figures come out Monday. \u001d  Universal - a unit of NBC Universal, which is a subsidiary of General Electric Co. (GE) - reported that \"Chuck & Larry\" took in $34.8 million, while Warner Bros. - a unit of Time Warner Inc. (TWX) - reported \"Order of the Phoenix\" at $32.2 million. Other studios were tracking \"Chuck & Larry\" in the $33 million range, which could make the No. 1 movie too close to call. \u001d  \"I think it'll be decided Monday morning,\" said Dan Fellman, head of distribution at Warner Bros. \u001d  Universal head of distribution Nikki Rocco said the weekend was no contest. \u001d  \"I'm not going to underestimate Adam Sandler and his fan base in the middle of summer,\" Rocco said. \"We're by far the No. 1 film.\" \u001d  New Line - another unit of Time Warner Inc. (TWX) - debuted its musical \"Hairspray,\" featuring John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah in an adaptation of the Broadway smash, which opened a strong No. 3 with $27.8 million. \u001d  Hollywood had a solid weekend no matter which movie ends up No. 1. The top 12 movies took in $147.6 million, up 3.5% from the same weekend last year, when \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" was No. 1 with $35.2 million. \u001d  To report weekend numbers, studios use actual grosses from Friday and Saturday and make estimates for Sunday based on past performance of similar movies. Being the first report on weekend business, the estimates draw more audience attention than Monday's final figures, so the No. 1 spot Sunday is a coveted position. \u001d  \"These estimates are in some ways more important than the final Monday figures,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Media By Numbers. \"They're often the first impression and for some people maybe the only impression they have of the box office for the weekend.\" \u001d  \"Chuck & Larry\" stars Sandler as a firefighter who poses as a gay partner for a widower colleague so his pal can maintain life insurance for his kids. \u001d  The movie followed the usual pattern for Sandler comedies: Critics trashed it but loyal fans turned up. \u001d  \"The beauty of Adam Sandler is his fan base adores him, and he delivers on comedy,\" Universal's Rocco said. \"Adam is a star, and I can tell you we know we're on the way with another $100 million movie for Adam.\" \u001d  \"Order of the Phoenix,\" which debuted at No. 1 the previous weekend, raised its domestic total to $207.5 million. \u001d  Fellman said the movie lost some business this weekend because of the mania over Saturday's publication of J.K. Rowling's final book in the fantasy series, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.\" \u001d  \"They wanted to get that book Saturday, lock themselves in the house and read it, because they didn't want their other friends by Monday telling them who made it and who didn't,\" said Fellman of Warner Bros. \u001d  \"Hairspray\" follows the musical adventures of a tubby teen who sets out to racially integrate a TV dance show in the 1960s. The stage musical on which it is based was in turn adapted from John Waters' 1988 cult flick. \u001d  Women made up just more than two-thirds of the \"Hairspray\" audience, said David Tuckerman, head of distribution for New Line. The studio hopes good word of mouth will keep the crowds coming and bring in more men in subsequent weekends, Tuckerman said. \u001d  \"We knew getting the guys on opening weekend was going to be difficult. We knew 'Chuck & Larry' would get the guys and we wouldn't,\" Tuckerman said. \u001d  In limited release, sci-fi tale \"Sunshine\" - from News Corp. (NWS) unit Fox Searchlight - opened to big numbers, pulling in $235,477 in 10 theaters.

Auckland Airport chairman's comment and context.) \b \u001d  By Shri Navaratnam \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Monday made a NZ$2.6 billion (US$2.05 billion) takeover bid for Auckland International Airport Ltd. (AIA.NZ), aiming to acquire up to a 60% stake in New Zealand's main visitor gateway. \u001d  Auckland Airport said in a statement that Dubai Aerospace is offering up to NZ$3.80 a share to acquire an interest of between 51% and 60% in the airport company. \u001d  Directors of Auckland Airport unanimously recommended the offer to shareholders in the absence of a superior offer. \u001d  Auckland Airport Chairman John Maasland said the proposal, which values the company at NZ$5.6 billion, involves the establishment of a new company, Auckland Airport Ltd., in which the Dubai company will invest up to NZ$2.6 billion. \u001d  The Dubai Aerospace offer provides Auckland Airport shareholders a range of options to achieve an equivalent value of up to NZ$3.80 a share, Maasland said.   The offer is a 14.8% premium to the airport company's closing price of NZ$3.31 on Friday.   The base proposal is for shareholders to receive NZ$2.34 a share in cash or a new stapled security in Auckland Airport, as well as a final, fully-imputed dividend of 7 cents a share. \u001d  Shareholders can elect a preference to take \"more stapled securities and less cash\" or vice versa, Maasland said. \u001d  The Dubai company will also provide an additional pool of up to NZ$312.75 million for shareholders who want to receive more cash, and whose preference isn't initially able to be met. \u001d  From this additional cash pool, the Dubai company will acquire stapled securities at NZ$1.39 per security. \u001d  \"This increases the ability of those shareholders who elect the 'more cash' offer to be satisfied and could see (Dubai Aerospace Enterprise's) shareholding increase to a cap of 60%,\" Maasland said. \u001d  Maasland said there has been a \"significant increase\" in interest in Auckland Airport from a wide range of parties including infrastructure and pension funds. \u001d  He didn't identify the parties, but Auckland Airport said last month that Canada Pension Plan Investment Board had approached some shareholders of the airport company with a bid of NZ$3.10 a share. \u001d  Auckland Airport has appointed independent adviser Grant Samuel & Associates to prepare a report on the merits of the proposal. \u001d  The transaction is subject to 75% of Auckland Airport shareholder approving the takeover plan, and also requires Overseas Investment Office approval. \b \u001d  Company Web sites: http://www.auckland-airport.co.nz \b                      http://www.dubaiaerospace.com \b \u001d  -By Shri Navaratnam, Dow Jones Newswires; 64-4-471-5990; shri.navaratnam@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Brooke Donovan \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 17:24 ET (21:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b53942789db4bd81d93e6c67575e7840","symR":["AKR"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Acadia Realty Trust","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-07-22T07:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AKR"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Acadia Realty Trust: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=AKR or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 03:01 ET (07:01 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b546042c35003eade1f333e16de15447","symR":["MEN"],"date":"2007-07-22","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock MuniEnhanced Fund, Inc.

\u001d  TOKYO (AP)--The International Atomic Energy Agency should be invited to inspect a nuclear power station damaged in an earthquake in northwestern Japan to help restore public confidence, the prefecture's governor said Sunday. \u001d  The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant - the world's largest in terms of capacity - disclosed a barrage of leaks and malfunctions in the wake of Monday's magnitude 6.8 quake, which killed 10 people and injured more than 1,000. \u001d  Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co., or TEPCO, and nuclear regulators have stressed that the amounts of radioactivity leaked were extremely low and posed no threat to the environment or local residents. \u001d  But the damage has raised concerns about the plant's safety, prompting the government to order it shut  indefinitely until its safety can be confirmed. \u001d  Governor Hirohiko Iizumida of Niigata prefecture sent a letter to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trade Minister Akira Amari and four other senior officials. \u001d  The governor said that while the plant's problems and leaks have not resulted in bodily harm, they are creating \"great unease\" among local residents. \u001d  \"Furthermore, images of the accident have been broadcast everywhere around the world and are creating misunderstandings,\" Izumida said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by The Associated Press. \u001d  \"It is making this country's citizens uneasy, too, and may lead to harmful rumors about the prefecture's tourism and agriculture industries,\" he said. \u001d  To counteract this and ensure that accurate information gets out, the letter concluded, the government should ask the U.N.'s IAEA to inspect the plant \"as quickly as possible.\" \u001d  Earlier this week, IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei said that a thorough review of the plant's problems was crucial, and offered to have his Vienna-based agency pull together global experts. \u001d  Japan told the agency Friday that it was passing on the offer, though the government left the door open to receiving an inspection team in the future, according to news reports. \u001d  Monday's earthquake resulted in a raft of malfunctions, damage and mistakes at the plant, including a fire that charred an electrical transformer, planks that toppled into a pool of spent nuclear fuel and the overturning of 400 barrels of atomic waste. \u001d  The problems - exacerbated by TEPCO's delays in notifying the public - were capped by news that radioactive water had sloshed out of a tank and was flushed out to sea, and that radioactive material was vented into the air in two separate instances. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 06:04 ET (10:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

\u001d  By Ian McDonald \u001d  Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPE \b \u001d  U.K. life insurance companies Friends Provident PLC (FP.LN) and Resolution PLC (RSL.LN) are expected to say they are in merger talks in a statement Monday. A deal between the two firms would create an insurer with a more than GBP8 billion market value and could stoke consolidation elsewhere in the crowded UK insurance market. \u001d  Friends and Resolution have discussed a merger of equals in recent weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter. While negotiations could still founder, a pact to create the U.K.'s fourth-largest insurer could come within the next two weeks, this person said. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  In London Friday, shares of Friends Provident rose 4.3%, and Resolution's were up marginally in a falling market. In adherence with local rules, the companies are expected to end speculation by confirming the talks in a joint statement Monday. Spokespeople for each insurer declined to comment Sunday. At current prices the firms have roughly the same market value. Combined, they would leap-frog Standard Life PLC (SL.LN), which has market value of about GBP7 billion, potentially pressuring Standard Life and others to weigh their strategic options. \u001d  Deal chatter has swirled around the two firms and other small companies in recent months. In the crowded U.K. insurance market, it has become increasingly difficult to compete against bigger players with more marketing muscle and bigger operations in faster-growing markets like market leader Aviva PLC (AV.LN). Talks of deals have percolated on and off since Aviva's GBP17 billion offer was spurned by rival Prudential PLC (PRU.LN) last year. A Friends-Resolution merger could make sense for both parties. Friends Provident's group chief executive officer, Philip Moore, had set an aggressive goal to triple its new-business profits in the U.K. by 2008, but he warned early this year that it may miss that target. Analysts have questioned whether the company's existing business generates enough cash to fund the growth initiatives. The company's share price is off 14% so far this year. \u001d  Meantime, Resolution, which mainly purchases blocks of life policies from other insurers, generates ample cash flow. That said, the company could see its growth constricted if fewer policies are put up for sale and more bidders surface for them. The company's shares are down about 2% in 2007. \u001d  Together, Resolution's business could help fund Friends Provident's growth, potentially earning a higher market value for each business. \u001d  The two companies' talks were reported by the Financial Times and London's Sunday Times. \u001d  A key issue in negotiations will be management. While roughly the same size in terms of market value, the companies have different cultures and histories. Moore is a former business consultant running a long-established firm. Friends Provident started out in the 1800s as a life insurer to Quakers in the U.K. and became a public company in 2001. \u001d  Resolution is an upstart founded by entrepreneur Clive Cowdery in 2003. Cowdery is currently Resolution's chairman, and Michael Biggs is the company's chief executive. In current talks, one model of the combined firm would be managed by Biggs with Moore as his deputy and Cowdery as the company's chairman. Roles could shift as negotiations continue. \b \u001d  -By Ian McDonald, The Wall Street Journal Europe \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  July 22, 2007 15:23 ET (19:23 GMT)\u001d

\u001d  (Updates with Borders Group Inc. sales figures, other details) \b \u001d  NEW YORK (AP)--The books are out; the word is spreading. \u001d  \"The last Potter is amazing. It has definitely gone way beyond what I expected,\" Deb Kiehlmeier, 16, of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, said of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\" which was released Saturday worldwide. \u001d  \"Harry Potter fans are always trying to predict what will happen next, and J.K. Rowling always gives them something different,\" Kiehlmeier told The Associated Press. \u001d  On Day 1 of the A.H. (After Harry) Era, reviewers and readers mourned the end of a historic series that proved young people can still crave the written word like the crispiest French fry. It was a day for the sleepless and the sleepy to enjoy and to recall one last, fresh taste of Potter. \u001d  Critics bowed before Rowling's achievement. She was compared to the greats of children's and fantasy authors - J.R.R. Tolkien, L. Frank Baum, Roald Dahl - and held in awe for living up to the most intimidating standards. \u001d  On Saturday, bookstores around the world welcomed eager readers, young and old, in glasses and capes, some shivering, some sweaty, all joined by the thick hardback book with the opening words: \"The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit lane.\" \u001d  For many of the hardcore Potter-maniacs, the place to be was Waterstone's bookstore on Piccadilly in central London. More than 5,000 people lined up for hours before the midnight opening, in a festive, colorful line stretching around the block. Among the fans from as far away as Finland and Mexico were dozens of witches and wizards, a couple of house elves, a pair of owls and a woman dressed as Hogwarts castle. \u001d  About 100 devoted readers donned witches' hats, wizards' robes and other costumes at a party early Saturday in the courtyard of Berlin's oldest castle, the Zitadelle. As the book was finally released, a shower of sparks lit up the castle's stone walls and a man dressed as Hagrid, the half-giant game and grounds keeper at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, pulled a copy of \"Dark Hallows\" from a golden kettle. \u001d  Even people in war zones are reading Harry Potter. About 50 foreigners working in Afghanistan got their hands on a copy of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" on its release date, beating many of their friends back home. \u001d  John Connolly, an executive with Paxton International, a logistics and moving company, bought 50 copies of the book in Dubai at 3:01 a.m. Saturday, the exact time of the book's release in London. He boarded a plane to Kabul a couple hours later with the books on board. \u001d  \"Harry Potter is released worldwide at the same time. As a logistics company based in Afghanistan for five years, we saw every reason to include Afghanistan,\" said Connolly, who asked customers to donate a book to the American University in Kabul in exchange for the free shipping on the book. \"It was not on the publisher's list, that's for sure.\" \u001d  Potter is a pastime and a business. Before the release date, booksellers competed worldwide to sell the book, with some cutting the price by two-thirds. Now, the re-sales are starting. On Amazon.com (AMZN), some individuals were hawking used copies, and some new ones, for as little as $16, $1.99 less than Amazon's price. On eBay (EBAY, where just a few days ago a pre-release copy was worth $250, \"Deathly Hallows\" was offered Saturday for immediate purchase for $10.99. \u001d  The first six Potter books have sold more than 325 million copies, and in some places demand for \"Deathly Hallows\" is already exceeding supply. \u001d  Borders Group Inc. (BGP), the second-largest U.S. bookseller, said Sunday it had sold about 1.2 million copies of \"Deathly Hallows\" worldwide on the book's first day of sales, the best single-day performance of any title in company history. \u001d  Sales on Saturday of the final Potter book at more than 1,200 Borders and Waldenbooks stores topped the 850,000 copies of book six \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" sold by Borders on its first day of sales in 2005. \u001d  Seven of the top 10 best sellers on Amazon.com were Potter books Saturday, including a box set of the whole series coming out in September with a list price of $195. \u001d  The U.K. retailer Asda Group Ltd., which discounted \"Deathly Hallows\" to $10, said Saturday it had sold 450,000 copies of the book between midnight and 4 p.m. and was selling it twice as fast as the previous Potter. Waterstone's said that at the height of the overnight sales frenzy, staff members were serving 20 customers a second. \u001d  The Harry Potter books are published by Bloomsbury Publishing PLC (BMY.LN) in the U.K. and Scholastic Corp.

PAD results from plaque that accumulates in the arteries and blocks blood flow in the legs. These blockages can result in severe pain for patients and very limited physical mobility. The company's SilverHawk Plaque Excision System is a minimally invasive method of removing the obstructive plaque and restoring blood flow to the legs and feet. The company's Rinspirator thrombectomy system removes thrombus, or blood clots, from occluded arteries in patients suffering from PAD or coronary artery disease. For more information, please visit our website at http://www.foxhollowtech.com. \b \b   Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures \b \u001d  In addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), ev3 uses the non-GAAP financial measures, such as \"adjusted EPS\" as supplemental measures of performance and believes these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by variations in capital structure, tax positions, depreciation, non-cash charges and certain large and unpredictable charges. ev3 also believes that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors in evaluating the company's operations, period over period. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. When analyzing ev3's operating performance, investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures as a substitute for net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP. \b \b   Forward-Looking Statements \b \u001d  This press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" about ev3 and FoxHollow within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the business combination transaction involving ev3 and FoxHollow, including the potential accretion of the transaction to ev3, potential synergies and cost savings and the timing thereof, future financial and operating results, the expected timing of the completion of the transaction, the combined company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions with respect to future operations, products and services; and other statements identified by words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"may,\" or words of similar meaning and any other statements that are not historical facts. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of ev3's and FoxHollow's management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of ev3 and FoxHollow. Actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. \b \u001d  The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statement: general business and economic conditions; the ability to obtain governmental approvals of the transaction on a timely basis; the failure of FoxHollow stockholders to approve the transaction; the competitive environment; the failure to realize synergies and cost-savings from the transaction or delay in realization thereof; the businesses of ev3 and FoxHollow may not be combined successfully, or such combination may take longer, be more difficult, time-consuming or costly to accomplish than expected; and operating costs and business disruption following the merger, including adverse effects on employee retention and on our business relationships with third parties, including physicians, providers and distributors. Additional factors that could cause ev3's and FoxHollow's results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in ev3's and FoxHollow's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and ev3's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 1, 2007 and FoxHollow's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

and believes these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by variations in capital structure, tax positions, depreciation, non-cash charges and certain large and unpredictable charges. ev3 also believes that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors in evaluating the company's operations, period over period. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Martina Cruz Riquet \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--U.K. financial and healthcare software company Misys PLC (MSY.LN) Sunday took the latest step in its business turnaround, setting out plans to dispose of some of its hospital-related operations. \u001d  Misys, which provides core banking information technology systems as well as software to doctors, said the move was part of its plan to rebalance its healthcare portfolio. \u001d  It will sell its Arizona-based diagnostic information business unit to Vista Equity Partners for GBP186 million in cash. The unit, which classifies large volumes of clinical data for hospitals, employs 750 people. \u001d  Misys will also sell its California-based hospital data collection service, CPR business, to QuadraMed Corp. for GBP16 million in cash. It has agreed with both companies that they will sell its Misys Connect technology, and Vista will also market the Misys Electronic Medical Record product. \u001d  Proceeds from the sales will be partly used to pay down debt. \u001d  Chief Executive Mike Lawrie, who was brought in to the company last year to instigate a three- to five-year turnaround plan, said in a statement: \"These disposals rebalance our portfolio and enable us to accelerate execution of our strategy.\" \u001d  In May, the software developer said it would sell its Sesame independent financial adviser business to Friends Provident PLC (FP.LN), instead of selling it to the company's management as had previously been agreed. \u001d  Last year Misys was dogged by a long-running management buyout and sales process, which was aborted in autumn after it failed to secure a buyer. \u001d  Lawrie said, when Misys reported full-year results Jan. 18, that it still had some \"real serious performance gaps\" in its healthcare unit, but said it was taking actions to address them. \u001d  \"This is a three- to five-year process and there's no silver bullet, \" he said. \u001d  Misys shares closed Friday at 235.5 pence, valuing the company at around GBP1.2 billion. \u001d  The company will hold a conference call for analysts at 0800 GMT Monday. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.misys.com \b \u001d  -By Martina Cruz, Dow Jones Newswires;
