The Essen-based company itself has projected net profit to increase by more than 40% on the year in 2006. \u001d  The improvement mainly comes from a EUR700 million book gain from the sale of U.K. water unit Thames Water Holdings PLC and a EUR600 million gain from a German corporate tax rebate. \u001d  Last October, RWE agreed to sell Thames Water to Kemble Water Ltd., a consortium led by Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd. (MBL.AU), for EUR11.9 billion. \u001d  In December, RWE said 2006 net profit will be boosted by a tax rebate as part of a new version of Germany's corporate income tax code. \u001d  This will likely result in an increased dividend payout for full-year 2006, given that RWE has pledged to increase its dividend payout ratio to 70% and 80% for 2006 and 2007. The company paid EUR1.75 per share for 2005. \u001d  Analysts said high European power and natural gas prices should also have continued to drive earnings and sales in 2006. \u001d  However, an outage at RWE's nuclear power plant Biblis, stretching over several months, as well as regulatory intervention into grid fees will likely show a negative impact on earnings, analysts said. \u001d  As a result, analysts expect full-year operating profit to grow only 15% to EUR6.19 billion from EUR5.37 billion, but still higher than the 5% to 10% growth forecast by the company itself. \u001d  Analysts also said they expect full-year sales to increase around 12% to EUR44.14 billion from EUR39.49 billion. \u001d  RWE is Friday expected to give an update on its plan to publicly float its U.S. water unit American Water Works. The company previously said an initial public offering could happen in the second half of 2007. \u001d  Investors' focus Friday will also be on RWE's comments on its growth strategy in a consolidating European energy sector and a full-year 2007 outlook. \u001d  In the past, RWE said it was focusing on organic growth, while monitoring the market for small- and medium-sized acquisition opportunities to round off its business portfolio. \u001d  RWE has ruled out that it would make a headline-grabbing acquisition despite the book gain from the Thames Water sale and the expected proceeds from the American Water IPO. \u001d  At 1201 GMT, RWE shares traded down EUR0.35, or 0.4%, at EUR82.10 in a firmer broader market. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.rwe.com \b \u001d  -By Jan Hromadko, Dow Jones Newswires; +49 69 29 725 503; jan.hromadko@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 07:05 ET (12:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0230722633336fc73200eedf97bd8053","symR":["BEI.UN.T","CA0966311064"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Boardwalk Tgt Upped To C$50 From C$39.50 By RBC>BEI.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T15:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BEI.UN.T","CA0966311064"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 10:04 ET (15:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"027ca42cea3debe69b23f36e53e88193","symR":["MAR.T","CA5658511020"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Update To Preliminary Economic Assessment On Marathon PGM-Cu Project Indicates 13 1/2 Year Mine Life>MAR.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T18:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MAR.T","CA5658511020"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG"],"Story":"\bTORONTO, Feb. 19 /CNW Telbec/ - Marathon PGM Corporation (\"the Company\") (TSX: MAR) is pleased to report that an update to the June 2006 Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") has been completed on the Company's Marathon PGM-Cu property by P&E Mining Consultants Inc. of Brampton, Ontario (\"P&E\").

Average Daily Vessel Expenses are computed using the number of days in the period which OMI owned the vessel. \b \b   (1) Consistent with general practice in the tanker shipping \bindustry, we use TCE revenue (defined as voyage and time charter \brevenues less voyage expenses) as a measure of equating revenue \bgenerated from a voyage charter to revenue generated from a time \bcharter. TCE revenue, a non-GAAP measure, provides additional \bmeaningful information in conjunction with Revenues, the most directly \bcomparable GAAP measure because it assists us in making operating \bdecisions about the deployment of our vessels and their performance. \bVoyage expenses comprise all expenses relating to particular voyages, \bincluding bunker fuel expenses, port fees, canal tolls and brokerage \bcommissions. Under time-charter contracts the charterer pays the \bvoyage expenses (except brokerage commissions), whereas under voyage \bcharter contracts the shipowner pays the voyage expenses. TCE Revenue \band Expenses includes revenue and expense generated by the Libra \bproduct carrier pool. As of December 31, 2006, the Libra pool included \b1 of OMI's product carriers (beginning in November 2006) and 1 product \bcarrier (beginning in December 2006) owned by another pool member. \b \b   (2) During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006, \bOMI recognized profit sharing revenue of approximately $1,844,000 and \b$19,426,000, respectively, compared to $190,000 and $14,922,000 for \bthe three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005, respectively. \b \b   (3) In 2006, 5 product carriers (4 handymaxes and 2 handysize) \bwere delivered from the shipyard: 1 in January, 1 in February, 2 in \bMarch and 1 in May. In 2006, 5 product carriers were sold: in March, 2 \bPanamax vessels were sold and leased back (operating lease) on a \bbareboat charter arrangement; in October, 1 vessel was sold; in \bNovember, 1 vessel was sold and leased back (operating lease) on a \btime charter arrangement; and in December, 1 vessel was sold and \bentered into the Libra pool by the new owner.

In fact, it belies the whole laid-back, collegial feel of the biotech company, with its scattered waterfalls and Zen garden inhabiting a 194-acre campus in Thousand Oaks, Calif. But in Sharer's sunlit office is a statue of a fearsome Chinese warrior; we found Sharer in a similar mood. Sitting ramrod straight, the 59-year-old CEO looked every bit the former Navy man he is. The Amgen chief is going head-to-head with both Johnson & Johnson and Roche in the marketplace and the courthouse to defend Amgen's franchises. It's more than just business. When asked if he ever wished to emulate venerated pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson, Sharer snaps: \"Never. Never. Never. We are complete foes.\" \u001d  Sharer started his career in the U.S. Navy; by 27, he was a lieutenant commander on a nuclear submarine. Figuring he could rise faster in a corporation than in the military, he jumped ship to McKinsey & Co., then later to General Electric and MCI. Sharer joined Amgen as president and chief operating officer in 1992 and quickly learned the language of biotechnology, which uses genetic engineering to find cures. Eight years later he was named chief executive. \"The development of biopharmaceutical drugs is the most difficult managerial job I've ever had,\" says Sharer. \"Nothing is remotely close.\" \u001d  Once at the helm in 2000, Sharer made waves with a startling $11 billion acquisition of Immunex, best known for Enbrel, its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug. He then swept the management decks and injected some regimentation into what had been Amgen's free-spirited startup culture. Today Amgen has grown-up problems: It faces unprecedented competition in its anemia drugs, legislators are threatening to reduce Medicare reimbursement, and Wall Street keeps demanding more and more blockbusters to maintain double-digit growth. Because all of this makes running a nuclear submarine look easy, SmartMoney senior writer Dyan Machan sat down with the Amgen chief to solicit his thoughts. \b \u001d  SM: Your anemia drugs Epogen and Aranesp, which make up half of Amgen's  $12.4 billion in sales, are under some serious competitive attack. \u001d  KS: It's our biggest single market, but we have three other multibillion-dollar products. \b \u001d  SM: Okay, but in the meantime, Roche is expected to introduce its anemia drug Cera this year. \u001d  KS: We are suing for patent infringement to stop them. Roche introduced its product in Europe because Epogen was going off patent in Europe. Since they had it already, they decided to take a free shot at the U.S. market [where Amgen's Epogen patent remains]. My opinion is that they offer no innovation. \b \u001d  SM: Some very smart people are betting you're going to lose. \u001d  KS: It sounds like the same people who said we would lose the patent case in 2003. We did not. [In 2003 a federal appeals court ruled that Transkaryotic Therapies' Dynepo drug infringed on two Amgen patents.] \b \u001d  SM: You have a Hatfield-McCoy history with J&J. Can't you two just get along? \u001d  KS: Everyone needs a tough competitor to be good. So I respect that. However, we're going to fight J&J everywhere for a long time. We've been doing that for 15 years, and it will never stop. \b \u001d  SM: Johnson & Johnson is suing Amgen for antitrust violations; it claims your practice of bundling the competition-free Neulasta [a drug that bolsters white blood cell production and is used by chemotherapy patients] with anemia drug Aranesp [which competes with J&J's drug Procrit] hinders competition. \u001d  KS: Physicians can buy our drugs individually. But if they want the very best price, they have to combine it. It is not an unusual tactic. Giving discounts for bigger combinations was pioneered by J&J. \b \u001d  SM: What's in your pipeline? \u001d  KS: Vectibix, for colorectal cancer, is just out. It has multibillion-dollar potential. The reception has been great. Also coming is Denosumab for osteoporosis and for cancer; key data will be available in 2008. \b \u001d  SM: Denosumab won't come to market until the next decade. How does that help now? \u001d  KS: Stocks tend to move on clinical data. If revenue doesn't show up, that's another issue. The year 2008 is going to be an important one. We should have a ruling on the Roche patent case, and we will have data on Denosumab. \b \u001d  SM: Why not have your scientists make a wrinkle cream for a big payout? \u001d  KS: We find cures only for grievous illnesses. We won't make a drug for a toenail infection. Drug development is hard; you can't do everything. These illnesses present large, unmet needs. We aren't completely altruistic. But we do ask ourselves: What did you do that counts? It helps us attract good people. \b \u001d  SM: You have raised your research and development budget every year. This year you promise another double-digit advance. That sounds desperate. \u001d  KS: It's the opposite. There are so many promising areas where we want to invest -- Alzheimer's, Diabetes, Parkinson's. \b \u001d  SM: Your biggest customer is Uncle Sam. The new Congress makes no secret that it wants to negotiate lower prices for Medicare patients. \u001d  KS: There is a societal need to better manage health care costs. \b \u001d  SM: Diplomatic answer. Now set Congress straight! \u001d  KS: The new leadership of Congress may be surprised at how effective the private plans have been in negotiating prices. I think they'll find government negotiations won't be the financial bonanza they imagine. \b \u001d  SM: Speaking of anemia, your stock sells at half the multiple of Genentech. Why? \u001d  KS: When I started, Amgen had a 70 price-to-earnings ratio, largely because Aranesp was new. Genentech has a big product right now -- Avastin [for lung and colorectal cancer]. We have some uncertainty. \b \u001d  SM: You're sounding unsure about the case against Roche. \u001d  KS: We are going to win. If we beat Roche and Denosumab is a success, Amgen is a very good value, and now is the time to buy. If you think something else, you buy someone else. I think as CEO if you're not betting your job, the company is not going to move ahead. \b \u001d  SM: Are you willing to bet your job right here and now? \u001d  KS: If Denosumab fails, if we can't defend against Roche and if J&J beats us -- I won't be in such good shape. \b \u001d  SM: Is running Amgen more difficult than running a nuclear submarine? \u001d  KS: I was the No. 3 officer and 27 years old. I was overmatched then. I've had a lot of time to prepare for this job. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:00 ET (11:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"05a2b404e1d49d557b1a4bb53a80dd28","symR":["G.T","GG","GPJ.H.V","CA3809564097","CA38386N1033"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"GPJ To Pay $200M Cash, Issue 155M Common Shrs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T08:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["G.T","GG","GPJ.H.V","CA3809564097","CA38386N1033"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","MNG","PCS","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 03:06 ET (08:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"05dd11e76bdc040cfcea39dd412fef2d","symR":["SIRI","XMSR"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"WSJ: XM Satellite, Sirius In Final Merger Talks","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T18:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SIRI","XMSR"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XNQ1","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \b   By Dennis K. Berman and Sarah McBride \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Satellite radio operators XM Satellite Radio Holdings (XMSR) and Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. (SIRI) are in final merger discussions, a person familiar with the matter said Monday. The two are nearing an agreement but have yet to ratify a definitive contract, this person said. \u001d  If completed, a deal would create a single satellite-based giant, a fact that could prove a difficult issue for antitrust and communications regulators. Already Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin has signaled some resistance to a coupling of the two services, which feature rival menus of sports, music and talk-radio programming. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  But the two sides are likely to argue that the proliferation of Internet-based radio, digital music players, and new Hybrid Digital-radio formats creates a vigorous competitive market for such media.

Since then, the company has bought back some $3 billion of shares, a company spokeswoman said. An announcement Wednesday that it would add to that amount would \"send a strong message of management's confidence on the outlook for 2007,\" said Credit Suisse in a note. \u001d  Mining companies have been generating large profits from strong demand for commodities, as Asian economies industrialize. Large-scale capital return programs like that predicted from Anglo American have become a common feature of mining company earnings updates, as commodity producers strive to keep their balance sheets lean. \u001d  BHP Billiton PLC (BHP), the world's biggest mining company by market capitalization, unveiled a $10 million share buyback with its half-year results Feb. 7. \u001d  Analysts are also watching for progress on the company's demerger of Mondi, its paper and packaging division, and its disposal of its 41.8% stake in world No. 3 gold producer AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AU). \u001d  Anglo American is seeking a higher valuation for its business by becoming more focused on its core mining assets. The company's paper and packaging division is a lower-margin business than its key base metals and platinum assets, and Anglo believes a separate listing for Mondi will mean investors rate both companies' stock more highly. \u001d  Anglo has said it will move on with plans for Mondi's London and Johannesburg IPO in the second quarter of this year. Talks on the IPO plans are under way with the U.K. and South African regulators, an Anglo spokeswoman said. \u001d  The market also will be watching Wednesday for an update on Anglo's plans to exit AngloGold Ashanti. So far the company has said it plans to sell out in the next two to three years. \u001d  A press report Sunday said Russian gold giant OAO Polyus Gold (PLZL.RS), a gold company spun out of Russia's biggest mining company by market capitalization OAO Norilsk Nickel (GMKN.RS), had approached Anglo American to buy the stake in the gold miner. Polyus doesn't currently have any AngloGold Ashanti shares. \u001d  But a person familiar with Polyus' thinking told Dow Jones Newswires that such a move didn't appear to be a logical step for Polyus. \u001d  According to three analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires, Anglo American is expected to report earnings before interest and tax of $9.826 billion for the 12 months to Dec. 31, 2006, up from $6.376 billion the previous year.    The company's base metals division - which produces metals including copper, nickel and zinc - is expected to be its strongest performer. Anglo's gold, diamond, platinum and iron ore subsidiaries have already made their earnings public. \u001d  At 1431 GMT Monday, Anglo American's shares were trading up 2.7%, or 69 pence, at 2607 pence, outperforming a mildly positive mining sector. One analyst said the company's shares had gained on investor hopes for increased capital return Wednesday. \u001d  The market also will be interested to get any insight into incoming Chief Executive Officer Cynthia Carroll's plans for Anglo American. The former Alcan Inc. (AL) executive formally becomes CEO on March 1, but officially joined the company Jan. 15. \u001d  Sector watchers said former aluminum executive Carroll will be looking to improve the company's operational performance and make progress on the restructuring, but also to put the company on a stronger footing at a time when it's often named as a takeover target. \u001d  Amid rapid consolidation in mining and metals industries, broker Numis Securities describes Anglo American as a \"large but tempting target.\" Diversified mining company Xstrata PLC (XTA.LN) is frequently named by sector watchers as a potential buyer. Xstrata declined to comment. \u001d  Numis said a deal to buy Anglo American \"could be financed through the sale of assets with minimal reorganization required.\" The fact that some of the company's subsidiaries are listed makes them easier to value, and a deal easier to do, the broker added. \u001d  A spokeswoman for Anglo American declined to comment on the potential for any additional capital return, selling AngloGold Ashanti shares to Polyus and the company as a takeover target. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.angloamerican.co.uk \b \u001d  -By Jackie Range, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 9257; jackie.range@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 09:48 ET (14:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"07a2eb73ca441d3033c007652e80c18d","symR":["CAH"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Cardinal Health Names Michael C.

Merchant shippers, among the earliest share companies, would simply fold after each voyage. The value of the goods the ship returned with -- hopefully more than it set out with -- was divided among investors. \u001d  The rise of permanent stock-issuing companies like Dutch East India in 1602 was made possible by periodic profit distributions, otherwise known as dividends. Dutch East paid dividends sporadically through 1635 but yearly thereafter; payments sometimes topped 60 percent. The larger dividends sparked strong demand for shares. They multiplied sixfold in value by 1650. \u001d  For most of the time since then, that relationship has held. Big dividends have tended to drive share prices higher. \u001d  This column, were it written 80 years ago, would be an easy affair. We'd simply look each month for strong companies with low share prices relative to their dividend payments (otherwise known as high dividend yields) and call them bargains. \u001d  The \"Dogs of the Dow\" strategy, popularized by Michael O'Higgins in his 1991 book Beating the Dow, uses just such a strategy. It chooses the 10 highest-yielding of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the start of each year. Money poured into investment trusts based on the strategy in the mid-1990s. The sales pitch wasn't difficult; the Dogs had beaten the Dow by about three percentage points a year over the 50 years ended 1995. \u001d  Then the strategy stopped working. Though they handily beat the Dow last year, the Dogs have disappointed since 1996. They've averaged annual gains of 6.7 percent and dividends of 3.4 percent, versus 9.4 percent and 2.1 percent for the index. Those 11 years could be just a fluke, but there's evidence to suggest the Dogs strategy needs a makeover. The good news is that an updated version I'll explain in a moment might help you collect big dividends and beat the broad market's total return by five percentage points a year. For young investors, that's easily enough to buy a decade of early-retirement time. \u001d  Dividends began losing their predictive power in the early 1980s with the rise of stock \"repurchases.\" By repurchasing their shares, companies can reduce their share counts. That makes remaining shares more valuable, since a lower share count results in greater earnings per share. Both dividends and repurchases represent companies' returning profits to shareholders, but the latter are more tax-efficient. Dividends have been taxed as investor income since the launch of the U.S. income tax in the early 20th century-unfairly, some argue, since the payments have already been taxed once as corporate profits. Funds spent on buybacks aren't taxed as investor income. \u001d  You'd think share repurchases would have long ago eclipsed dividend payments because of the tax efficiency, but companies showed little interest in buying their own shares before the 1980s. Perhaps that's partly because they feared being viewed as share-price manipulators. Unscrupulous companies had in the past used big stock purchases to pump up their share prices and get other investors buying, only to start issuing heaps of new shares at the higher prices. In 1982 the Securities and Exchange Commission created rule 10b-18 in order to prevent such activity. It placed restrictions on the volume and timing of buybacks. In doing so, it guaranteed companies that follow the new rules freedom from suspicion (so long as they don't base buys on inside information). As a result, the volume of repurchases exploded. Today they make up about half of all shareholder payouts (dividends plus repurchases), up from around 10 percent before the SEC rule. This surge has raised new questions about the usefulness of the dividend yield alone. Wouldn't a new yield that represents dividends and repurchases better represent how much cash companies lavish on shareholders? And if dividends have historically been a good predictor of share-price gains, wouldn't this new yield be a better one? \u001d  A new study scheduled for publication in the Journal of Finance in April offers answers. Four finance professors -- Jacob Boudoukh, Roni Michaely, Matthew Richardson and Michael Roberts at Arison (Israel), Cornell, New York University and Wharton, respectively -- studied dividends, share repurchases and stock returns for thousands of companies over the 32 years ended 2003. The period was a particularly good one for stocks; their entire sample averaged annual returns of just over 13 percent. The four studied stocks with high dividend yields and found that they outperformed the entire sample by a couple of percentage points a year -- interesting but, statistically speaking, hardly a reason to get your broker on the phone. Then they ranked stocks by what they call net payout yield. It consists of the money spent on dividends and share repurchases, minus funds raised through new-share issuance. Stocks with the highest net payout yields, the researchers found, outperformed their sample by five percentage points a year. Over their  study period that would have been the difference between turning $10,000 into a half million dollars and turning it into more than $2 million. \u001d  The implication for growth-and-income-style investors is clear. Don't focus solely on companies that pay big dividends. Rather, look for those that spend freely on shareholders, regardless of whether they use dividends or repurchases to do so. The study compared the original Dogs of the Dow strategy with an updated one based on dividends and share repurchases between July 1983 and December 2003. The original Dogs returned an average of 16.2 percent a year, easily beating the Dow's 13.4 percent return. But the new-and-improved Dogs returned 19.1 percent a year. \u001d  Tracking down repurchase spending is cumbersome but not that difficult. Companies report the dollar amounts they spend on dividends and stock repurchases each quarter on their cash-flow statements. SmartMoney.com, for one, lists the information on its stock-quote pages. (Click the \"financials\" tab.) Calculating your own net payout yield is straightforward: Add the past four quarters' worth of dollars spent on dividends to dollars spent on repurchases over the same period, and divide the result by the company's market value. If you use a different source for cash-flow statements, just keep in mind that the numbers are often reported cumulatively. So what looks like dollars spent in the third quarter might be dollars spent in the first three quarters combined. If the numbers are snowballing from quarter to quarter by fairly regular amounts, it's a cumulative statement. \u001d  Searching for stocks with high net payout yields requires a powerful stock screener. I used the one at Reuters Research to compile the list below. Starting with the 30 Dow Industrial stocks, I calculated their net payout yields as described above and selected the top 10. That's it. \u001d  The companies are all familiar names. All but two of the 10 -- Exxon and Disney -- have underperformed the Dow over the past year. That's to be expected. Payout yields become larger, after all, as share prices drop. Both the original Dogs strategy and this one are, in effect, attempts to methodically pick stocks that are out of favor in order to score bargains. The average stock on the list produced a gain of 7.9 percent over the past year, underperforming the DJIA by 5.2 percentage points. But the companies aren't struggling to make money, and their shares might be cheap. On average, the companies produced a profit return of nearly 18 percent on the capital they used over the past year, versus  11 percent for all 30 companies in the index. Their shares trade at an average of 16 times forecast earnings for this fiscal year. The index's price/earnings ratio is 17. \u001d  --- \u001d  JACK HOUGH can be reached by e-mail at jhough@smartmoney.com. \u001d  --- \u001d  SmartMoney.com: To run your own stock screens, go to  www.smartmoney.com/stockscreener. \u001d  --- \b                     THE NEW DOGS OF THE DOW \b \b  By focusing on both dividends and share repurchases, investors can find \bstocks likely to outperform. \b \bCompany                         Industry \bA           B        C        D         E         F \b \b3M (MMM)                      Conglomerates \b77.42    57,009    1,355    2,085      2.4       6.0% \b \bCaterpillar (CAT)             Construction machinery \b60.22    39,175      700    3,050      1.8       9.6 \b \bCitigroup (C)                 Money-center banks \b54.77   269,122    9,665    9,561      3.6       7.1 \b \bE.I. du Pont de Nemours (DD) Chemicals \b48.05    44,197    1,379    3,248      3.1      10.5 \b \bExxon Mobil (XOM)            Oil & gas \b73.24   427,171    7,570   25,674      1.8       7.8 \b \bIntel (INTC)                 Semiconductors \b21.10   121,663    2,226    6,669      1.8       7.3 \b \bMicrosoft (MSFT)             Software & programming \b29.64   291,375    1,743   14,267      1.2       8.9 \b \bPfizer (PFE)                 Drugs \b26.30   189,635    6,589    4,180      3.5       5.7 \b \bProcter & Gamble (PG)        Personal products \b63.50   201,299    4,726   11,035      2.3       7.7 \b \bWalt Disney (DIS)            Broadcasting & cable TV \b34.19    70,721      490    6,890      0.7      10.4 \b \bDow Industrials (Avg.)

ComEd also has added new energy-efficiency tips for renters. \b \u001d  \"Everyone can take steps to reduce their energy use and lower their bills, no matter what type of home you have,\" said Anne Pramaggiore, senior vice president, ComEd regulatory and external affairs. \"By providing customized energy-saving information and tips for electric space heaters and renters, we hope even more ComEd customers will embrace energy efficiency to save money and help protect our environment.\" \b \u001d  About 190,000 customers, or 6 percent of ComEd's residential customer base, use electricity as their primary source of heating for their home, rather than heating with natural gas. These electric space heat customers face a slightly higher annual average electric bill increase of roughly 28 percent over their past bills. During the winter months, these customers will see higher increases because the steep rate reduction they previously received for heating their homes with electricity is gradually being reduced. In the summer, these customers will experience a significantly lower increase. \b \u001d  Customers with electric space heat can particularly benefit from reducing their energy use during the winter heating season. ComEd offers the following money-savings tips for residential electric space heat customers. \b \b \b     -- Keep your thermostat between 68 and 70 degrees -- every degree you can \b        lower your temperature setting will save you an average of 3 percent \b        on your heating bill. \b     -- Lower your thermostat at night and during unoccupied hours. \b     -- Clean vents and registers to optimize air flow. \b     -- Use your ceiling fan to move warm air from the ceiling into the living \b        space. \b     -- Open your drapes during sunlight hours and close them at night. \b     -- If you have a fireplace, close your fireplace dampers and doors. \b     -- Close vents to rooms that are not in use. \b \b \b \u001d  There also are plenty of way renters can reduce their energy bills too. Following are some changes that renters can make to lower their bills. \b \b \b     -- Turn off unnecessary lights, unplug electronics when not in use, and \b        adjust your thermostat (higher in summer, lower in winter) before \b        leaving for work. \b     -- Keep your refrigerator setting at 40 degrees and your freezer at zero \b        degrees. Lower temperatures will not improve food preservation and \b        will only cause higher usage. Also clean your refrigerator coils \b        (located in the back) regularly to help it operate efficiently. \b     -- Wait until your dishwasher is full before you run it. \b     -- When buying consumer electronics and appliances, look for the ENERGY \b        STAR(R) label.

The company said it will cancel the remaining A$1.3 million balance of a A$200 million buyback announced last August. \u001d  The drinks group said factoring in the cash requirements of the proposed buyback, it remains confident it will reduce net debt to less than A$3 billion by June 2008. \u001d  The result included a A$190 million gain from asset sales, including the sale of the Foster's brand in Europe and its Asian brewing assets. \u001d  Total earnings in the Australia, Asia and Pacific region rose 2.5% to A$442.2 million. Foster's has elected to report earnings along regional lines rather than separate its beer and wine businesses. \u001d  Foster's said beer, which includes Australia's top selling brand Victoria Bitter, continued to perform well in the region, but its wine business was \"disappointing\". \u001d  Foster's blamed part of the disappointing performance on its new multi-beverage sales distribution system, where sales staff sell across the company's portfolio of beer, wine and spirits to customers. \u001d  The company said it remains committed to the model but will increase the focus on wine sales. \u001d  Foster's said consumer and customer response to the relaunch of its Rosemount brand, which suffered a sales slump last year, has been strong. \u001d  To achieve its targeted return on capital from its global wine business in fiscal 2008, Foster's said it plans to eliminate inefficiencies in wine packaging and Australian export logistics; and improve its multi-beverage sales model. \u001d  Group sales for the half year rose 3.5% to A$2.4 billion from A$2.3 billion a year ago. \u001d  Foster's declared an interim dividend of 10.75 cents a share up from 9.75 cents a year ago. \b \u001d  -By Susan Murdoch, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9671-4393; susan.murdoch@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Paul Dekkers \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 17:27 ET (22:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"09b3c13a8a451b677b9c588de4f7f88d","symR":["PTY"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Annual Report for PIMCO Corp.

Reiten said the takeover \"is on track.\" \u001d  Analyst Morten Normann of Kaupthing said Hydro's overall aluminum division clean operating profit was slightly higher than Kaupthing's estimate. \u001d  He added that the aluminum metals subdivision's performance was more disappointing, with a loss on a London Metals Exchange contract. Even taking that loss into account, there was a negative deviation from forecasts \"that was not explained by specific one-off items,\" Normann said. \u001d  Ongoing restructuring within Hydro's aluminum business resulted in a shift to operating profit for Hydro's total aluminum activities of NOK413 million in the fourth quarter versus a loss of NOK1.099 billion in the same period of 2005. Despite this, Hydro said operating income was \"heavily influenced by write-downs, costs and charges relating to the restructuring of its downstream aluminum operations.\" \u001d  In its outlook on aluminum markets, the company said that key economic indicators signal \"somewhat slower growth\" in European, U.S. and Asian aluminum markets in 2007. \u001d  It forecast a 7% increase in global primary aluminum consumption in 2007, driven largely by Chinese demand, with European consumption growth expected only 2.5% higher on the year, and U.S. consumption seen 1% lower. \u001d  Hydro's first-quarter 2007 aluminum products operations are expected to be positively influenced by progress in its plant rationalization programs, the company said. \u001d  Meanwhile, Hydro's oil and energy division saw realized oil prices increase 4% in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2005, while gas prices rose 6%. In the year as a whole, realized oil prices rose 18% compared with 2005 and realized gas prices lifted 27%. \u001d  In the fourth quarter, Hydro produced an average of 595,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 6,000 boe/d more than a year ago. For the full year, average oil and gas production increased to 573,000 boe/d from 563,000 boe/d in 2005, exceeding its revised target of 570,000 boe/d. \u001d  Despite the year-on-year rise, Hydro said production was negatively impacted by production interruptions on partner-operated fields on the Norwegian continental shelf together with lower-than-expected output from its international portfolio. \u001d  Hydro retained its 2007 production target of 605,000 boe/d, which represents a 6% increase on realized production in 2006. \u001d  At 1005, GMT Hydro shares traded down NOK0.75, or 0.4%, at NOK195. \b \u001d   Company Web site: http://www.hydro.com \b \u001d  -By Elizabeth Cowley, Dow Jones Newswires; +47 22 20 10 58; elizabeth.cowley@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones

Teitelbaum \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--As HSBC Holdings PLC (HBC) expands its retail insurance business, it is likely to reveal  something about the value of a global brand. \u001d  The banking giant already has one of the world's largest branch networks and commands the kind of balance sheet required to ride out the often long insurance cycles. But HSBC also has a sometimes overlooked asset in its red \"hexagon\" label, which analysts say it will leverage in markets around the globe as it pursues its goal of doubling profit from insurance over the next five years. \u001d  \"HSBC is by far the strongest bank in terms of building a global brand,\" says Jasmine Montgomery, deputy managing director of FutureBrand, a branding consultancy. \u001d  She says that HSBC, unlike most financial institutions, can deploy the value of its brand name to virtually \"guarantee demand\" at the more than 9,500 offices in 81 countries where it has a presence. And because its brand is so instantly recognizable around the world, she says that for HSBC, \"the cost of entry in new products is much lower.\" \u001d  By most measures, HSBC has room to grow in insurance; its relative under-representation in the insurance market stands as a significant missed opportunity. \u001d  In 2005, HSBC's retail life and non-life insurance business contributed about $2.6 billion, or just over 10%, to group pretax profit of $21 billion, with half coming from the manufacture of life and non-life products and half from distribution. \u001d  By comparison, Royal Bank of Scotland PLC (RBS.LN), its nearest U.K. competitor in terms of size and global reach, gets nearly 13% of its annual profit from insurance, while Lloyds TSB Group PLC (LYG) gets more than 26% of its profit from insurance and investments. \u001d  Patrick McGuinness, a spokesman for HSBC, concedes that insurance is a sector in which the bank punches below its weight. He says that with 125 million clients worldwide, \"we should be able to better penetrate our own customer base\" to target demographic shifts and long-term savings trends. \u001d  HSBC signaled its growth intentions last year by elevating Clive Bannister to the post of Group Managing Director, Insurance. Bannister, formerly chief executive of Group Private Banking, is credited with HSBC's highly successful expansion in private banking since the late 1999s. His success at HSBC Private Bank came from anticipating trends and making well-timed acquisitions that added services. \u001d  \"They buy pretty distressed assets at bargain basement prices,\" said Collins Stewart analyst Alex Potter. Among the key acquisitions Bannister made at HSBC Private Bank was the tax advisory service of Arthur Andersen at auction for $15 million after the parent collapsed in the Enron scandal. \u001d  But private banking and insurance are quite different activities, says Potter, who warns that building an insurance business with a policy manufacturing capability \"takes time and money,\" and time is in short supply for some senior management as shareholders fume over HSBC's poor share performance over the past year. \u001d  Potter points to HSBC's past \"retrenchment\" in investment banking as an example of its unwillingness to commit to businesses that don't produce profit quickly. \u001d  HSBC shares were virtually flat in 2006 and have since slipped by nearly 2%, in part due to a profit warning that followed news of a sharp rise in provisions to cover loans made in the souring U.S. subprime mortgage market. \u001d  Around 1542 GMT Monday, HSBC shares were down 2 pence, or 0.2%, at 912 pence in a higher U.K. shares market. \u001d  The market for insurance and investment products in the U.K., the world's third largest, has seen healthy growth in recent years due to changes in investment and retirement planning. According to the Association of British Insurers, annual premium equivalents grew nearly 20% from 2004 to 2005. A similar trend has been underway through much of western Europe, while globally, growth in insurance has accelerated due to demographic changes and wealth creation in emerging economies. \u001d  Chris Wheeler, analyst at Bear Stearns, says HSBC could start to address its past failings and show quick results by leveraging its name and branch network. \u001d  \"They could link up with some of the biggest insurance players in the world\", he says, adding that any one of these would be thrilled to have HSBC put its brand on their product as \"they have a fantastic distribution network.\" \u001d  Selling other insurers' products under HSBC's brand  meshes well with HSBC's strategy for launching financial \"megastores\" where it can offer the widest possible range of banking, insurance and investment products. \u001d  Ije Nwokorie, senior consultant at branding consultancy Wolff Olins in London, sees opportunity here because many banks are \"searching for the purpose and meaning of a branch\" in an increasingly commoditized banking industry. \u001d  He sees concepts like the megastore as a way for HSBC to differentiate its brand through a customer experience that can \"truly integrate with our lives.\" \u001d  HSBC has plans to launch a megastore in London this year and is considering the concept for other major U.K. cities. \u001d  Bruno Paulson, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. says insurance is a \"natural thing to sell\" at a bank, with  considerable overlap between banking and insurance services.    But he says that in the cross-selling of insurance and investment services, U.K. banks are \"still vastly behind the rest of Europe.\" \u001d  A strategy relying on other insurance providers' products carries fewer risks, notes Bear Stearns' Wheeler, who warns that in the insurance business it's not always apparent how to value what you're buying. \u001d  That's what Lloyds TSB discovered in 2000 after it paid GBP7 billion to acquire insurance, pensions and asset management group Scottish Widows at what turned out to be the top of the market. \u001d  The bank struggled for years with that acquisition before the market recovered. Lloyds TSB is now seeing healthy growth at Scottish Widows, which increased its contribution to parent company results by 15% in 2005 and is expected to grow this even faster in 2006. A spokeswoman for Lloyds TSB, Mary Walsh, said \"because we have Scottish Widows we are able to design and manufacture products tailored to the needs and appetite of retail customers and market these through the branch network.\" \u001d  Whether HSBC needs this same manufacturing ability on a global scale is open to question. Bernstein's Paulson says this capability may be useful to own, but is more likely to be justified in \"underpenetrated\" markets for insurance and investment products. \u001d  Even then, he says a bank must consider whether its banking market share is big enough to make the investment worth its while. In Europe, for example, Paulson says it often doesn't pay for a bank to manufacture its own insurance because customers are more interested in seeing a wide choice of options. \u001d  \"You have to look at it on a market-by-market basis,\" he says. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.hsbc.com \u001d  -By Henry Teitelbaum, Dow Jones Newswires; 44(0)20 7842 9486; henry.teitelbaum@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 11:13 ET (16:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0e8bc9a5e7356e9f7440ff695cabb661","symR":["GLH.UN.T","CA3906311095"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Great Lakes Hydro Income Fund Declares Cash Distribution For February 2007>GLH.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T14:29:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GLH.UN.T","CA3906311095"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bGATINEAU, QC, Feb. 19 /CNW Telbec/ - (GLH.UN) - Great Lakes Hydro Income Fund today declared a cash distribution of 10.417 cents per unit for the month of February 2007, payable by March 30, 2007 to unitholders of record on February 28, 2007.

(XMSR) and Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. (SIRI) have agreed to merge, the two companies said Monday. \u001d  The deal would consolidate the only two companies in the emerging business of subscription-only satellite radio, and is sure to face tough scrutiny from federal regulators. Investors and analysts have been speculating about a deal for months. \u001d  The two companies said in a statement that Mel Karmazin, the CEO of Sirius, would become chief executive of the new company while Gary Parsons, the chairman of XM, would remain in that role. XM's CEO Hugh Panero will remain to oversee closing the of the deal, they said. \u001d  The deal would face significant regulatory hurdles in Washington, including a Federal Communications Commission rule that clearly states that one satellite radio provider cannot buy the other one. However, that rule could be waived. \u001d  A combination would also have to meet antitrust approval from the Department of Justice. The companies are expected to argue that they compete not only with each other but also with a growing base of digital audio sources such as iPods, mobile phones, and non-satellite digital radio. \u001d  XM and Sirius have both posted significant financial losses as they built up their programming lineups and recruited subscribers. Both stocks declined more than 40% last year on concerns about their continued growth in subscribers and softness in the retail market, but investors have held out hopes that a merger could bring costs down significantly. \u001d  Shareholders of XM and Sirius would each own approximately 50% of the combined company. XM shareholders would receive 4.6 shares of Sirius stock for each share of XM they own. \u001d  That would value XM shares at $17.02 each, based on Friday's closing prices, representing a premium of 22% from XM's closing value of $13.98 Friday. Markets were closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday. \u001d  The companies didn't say what the new company would be called, though they described it as a merger of equals. The new company's board will have 12 members, including Parsons, Karmazin, four independent directors named by each company, and one representative each from General Motors Corp. (GM) and Honda Motor Co. (HMC). \u001d  News of a possible merger was reported earlier Monday by the New York Post. \u001d  On Friday, a Bear Stearns analyst said in a research note that a merger would have a good chance of overcoming regulatory obstacles. \u001d  Other analysts remain less sure. Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said he gives the deal a \"50-50\" chance of passing regulatory muster. \u001d  Moffett said the deal could have a particularly tough time getting through the FCC, and is likely to opposed by the National Association of Broadcasters, a lobbying group that includes radio broadcasters.

(AP)--Monday marked the final day that white-collar Ford Motor Co. (F) workers could accept buyout or early retirement offers as the ailing company looks to cut costs. \u001d  Ford, which reported a $12.7 billion loss for 2006, is hoping that 10,000 salaried employees accept the offers after 4,000 left the company last year. The goal of 14,000 salaried workers represents about 36% of the automaker's white-collar work force. \u001d  The Dearborn-based automaker has said that if it doesn't meet its target, it could institute layoffs to make up the difference. \u001d  \"It's just a little too early for us to know at this point,\" Ford spokeswoman Marcey Evans told the Detroit Free Press. She said the company would resort to layoffs \"only if it's necessary.\" \u001d  Ford in November announced that 38,000 hourly workers had accepted buyout or early retirement packages. The No. 2 domestic automaker wants to reduce its total North American work force by 29%, or to about 92,000 by the end of 2008 from the current level of 130,000, and close 16 plants. \u001d  Salaried workers who accept the deals will have another seven days to change their minds. Evans said information about the number of workers who accept the deals won't be available until April, when Ford releases its first-quarter financial results. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 08:13 ET (13:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"131420b836831ca6b9542a5a97f20a9e","symR":["OMM"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": OMI Corporation Reports 2006 -5-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T20:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OMM"],"IndustryCodes":["MAR","XDJGI","XNYA","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  At December 31, 2006, we had Cash and cash equivalents of $156,611,000 and Marketable securities (short-term auction bonds) of $26,700,000. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, we received net proceeds of $499,754,000 from the disposal of 9 vessels, repaid $347,904,000 in debt ($321,216,000 of which was unscheduled repayments) and spent $118,332,000 for capital expenditures, primarily for the final payments for the acquisition of 5 vessels under construction.

The aggregate contract cost for the vessels is $91,300,000. The initial payment of $9,130,000 was made in January 2007. The remaining installments and final payments are scheduled as follows; an additional $9,130,000 in June 2007, $13,695,000 in 2008 and $59,345,000 in 2009. \b \b   Projected Expenditures for Drydock \b \u001d  OMI evaluates its vessels to determine if a drydock, special survey, both a drydock combined with a special survey or a postponement is appropriate for each vessel. We have vessels inspected and evaluated regularly in anticipation of a drydock during the year. Currently, we plan to drydock approximately 10 vessels in 2007 with an aggregate cost to be approximately $9,300,000. We project that the vessels will incur approximately 220 off-hire days in aggregate. \b \u001d  The following is a breakdown by quarter of the projected drydocks for 2007, as well as the estimated drydock cost (in thousands) and off-hire by vessel segment and charter type (spot or TC): \b \b \b          1st Quarter     2nd Quarter    3rd Quarter     4th Quarter \b \b         Off-            Off-           Off-            Off- \b         hire Projected  hire Projected hire Projected  hire Projected \b         Days   Costs    Days   Costs   Days   Costs    Days   Costs \b        -------------------------------------------------------------- \bCrude \b Fleet: \bSuezmax \b -spot     -         -     -         -   50  $  2,500    25  $  1,200 \bSuezmax \b -TC       -         -     -         -    -         -    25     1,200 \bClean \b Fleet: \bProducts \b -TC      40  $  3,000    20  $    350   20       350    40       700 \b        --------------- ------------------------------ --------------- \bTotal     40  $  3,000    20  $    350   70  $  2,850    90  $  3,100 \b        =============== ============================== =============== \b \b   Contracted Time Charter Revenue \b \u001d  The contracted TC revenue schedule below does not include any estimates for profit sharing in the future periods; however, actual profit sharing for 11 vessels aggregating approximately $23.9 million earned during the year ended December 31, 2006 is included. We have reduced future contracted revenue for any estimated off-hire days relating to drydocks. \b \u001d  The following table reflects our current contracted time charter revenue through 2012, including synthetic time charter contracts: \b \b                            Actual \b                             2006    2007    2008    2009   2010-2012 \b                            ------- ------- ------- ------- ---------- \b(In millions) \bTC Revenue                  $284.0  $303.9  $245.3  $135.5      $73.7 \bNumber of Vessels (a)           36      32      21      10         (b) \bVessels with \bProfit Sharing (a)              15      13       9       4          - \bVessels related to \b synthetic TC's               3.75    3.75     3.5       -          - \b \b   (a) Number of vessels at the end of each year assuming no \badditional extensions or new charters. \b \b   (b) The remaining charters expire as follows: 8 charters, 2 with \bprofit sharing, will expire in 2010 and 2 charters with profit sharing \bwill expire in 2012. \b \u001d  We recognize profit sharing, if any, for each vessel with a profit sharing provision in the time charter contract when the minimum threshold is met, which is the minimum charter hire revenue. Historically, we have recognized profit sharing on or about the anniversary of each time charter contract. The table below reflects the number of vessels for which we recorded profit sharing in 2006 and expect to record profit sharing in future years, by quarter: \b \b \b \b                                       Actual \b                                        2006  2007  2008   2009  2010 \b                                       ------ ----- ------ ----- ----- \b \bFirst Quarter                              1     3      3     1     0 \bSecond Quarter                             5     7      6     6     3 \bThird Quarter                              4     4      4     2     1 \bFourth Quarter                             1     1      0     0     0 \b \b                                       ------------------------------- \b                                          11    15     13     9     4 \b                                       =============================== \b \b   ABOUT OMI \b \u001d  OMI is a leading seaborne transporter of crude oil and refined petroleum products operating in the international shipping markets. We believe our modern fleet of 46 vessels (before the 2007 sale of vessels), approximately 3.5 million dwt, is the youngest large fleet of tankers in the world, with an average age at December 31, 2006 of approximately 3.3 years (see Note (1)), which is significantly lower than the industry average. Our customers include many of the world's largest commercial and government owned oil companies and oil trading companies. \b \b   OMI trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"OMM.\" \b \u001d  Note (1): All averages referring to vessel age in this release are weighted averages based on dwt and are calculated as of December 31, 2006. Dwt, expressed in metric tons, each of which is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms, refers to the total weight a vessel can carry when loaded to a particular load line. \b \b   EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL \b \u001d  OMI Corporation will hold an earnings conference call presentation on Tuesday, February 20, 2007 at 10:30 a.m. (Eastern Time).

For the full year, average oil and gas production increased to 573,000 boe per day, compared with 563,000 boe per day in 2005. \u001d  Production for 2006 was negatively impacted by production interruptions on partner-operated fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) as well as lower-than-expected production from fields in our international portfolio. Hydro has targeted 605,000 boe per day for 2007, an increase of around 6% compared with realized production in 2006. \u001d  Oil demand is expected to be relatively strong in 2007, but an anticipated increase in oil production capacity from both non-OPEC and OPEC producers is expected to increase global spare capacity somewhat from 2006 levels. \u001d  Start-up of new gas infrastructure, as well as warmer-than-expected weather, have led to lower European gas prices this winter than during the winter of 2005-2006. British gas production is declining, but comfortable gas-storage levels and new supply sources coming on stream are expected to improve supplies to Europe in 2007. With more normal seasonal temperatures, demand should improve in the winter of 2007-2008.    In addition, some of the LNG scheduled for delivery in the European market may be rerouted to either the U.S. or Asia, expected to create a more balanced supply situation than during this winter season. \u001d  Hydro said global primary aluminum consumption is expected to grow by close to 7% in 2007. Developments in China continue to be a main driver of industry fundamentals. China's growth in consumption and production is expected to continue at a high level in 2007, close to 20%. Consumption growth in Europe, however, is expected to slow to about 2.5% in 2007, somewhat lower than the expected increase in industrial production. A minor decline of about 1% is expected for the U.S. A moderate surplus is expected in the global metal balance in 2007. \u001d  Results for Hydro's aluminum products operations in the first quarter 2007 are expected to be positively influenced by continued progress on plant rationalization programs. However, additional rationalization expenses are also expected, Hydro said. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 02:01 ET (07:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"13c7b2e09ded5d3cce2a546965021c07","symR":["BPT.UN.T","CA09951T1066"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Boralex Power Income Fund Declares Cash Distribution>BPT.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T13:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BPT.UN.T","CA09951T1066"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  MONTREAL, Feb. 19 /CNW Telbec/ - Boralex Power Income Fund (the \"Fund\") has today declared its monthly cash distribution in the amount of $0.0750 per trust unit. \b \bThe distribution will be paid on March 21, 2007, to unitholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2007. \b \bBoralex Power Income Fund is an unincorporated open-ended trust that indirectly owns ten power generating stations located in the province of Qu&#233;bec and the United States producing energy from different sources including wood-residue or natural gas-fired thermal and cogenerating facilities as well as hydroelectric power stations.

But parent DaimlerChrysler needs to get the unit off its balance sheet first. \u001d  An outright sale to a single willing buyer looks a tall order because Chrysler's financial and operational weaknesses are too onerous for a single party to take on. \u001d  This leaves the German company with one solution. \u001d  Retain a one-third stake in Chrysler, offer another third to either private equity or public investors and offer the balance to an existing automaker who would benefit from Chrysler's U.S. franchise. \u001d  DaimlerChrysler knows it wouldn't be allowed to wash its hands of its U.S. unit if it went bankrupt in the future after a sale. \u001d  U.S. courts and the American tort system would reach out to Daimler to ensure it plays a part especially if a case can be made that the German company hadn't invested enough in the business. \u001d  The German company will have to ensure Chrysler can stand on its feet particularly when Daimler has a bigger market capitalization than GM and Ford combined, and a stronger balance sheet. \u001d  An outright exit from Chrysler, without any financial commitments from Daimler, wouldn't be palatable for a new buyer. Chrysler's pension liabilities are under control. \u001d  But Daimler is likely to be asked to pump in a sizable amount in other post-employment benefits, like healthcare expenses. That's what Goodyear, the tire maker, had to do recently to reach a deal with the auto union, the UAW. \u001d  Daimler has got to protect the value of the Mercedes brand too. A rush to jettison Chrysler ahead of next year's presidential election in the U.S. would be dangerous, jeopardizing the success Mercedes has had in the world's biggest car market since 2001. \u001d  That leaves the big questions of how much Chrysler is worth and whether that's within the reach of possible buyers. Right now, given its financial position - losses and liabilities - it has perhaps no value in most analysts' spreadsheets. \u001d  However, some guidance can be had from company forecasts. Chrysler aims for a 2.5% operating margin by 2009 after cost savings of EUR3.5 billion or $4.5 billion. \u001d  If you assume Chrysler achieves little topline growth in the next two to three years, you're talking about operating earnings of roughly EUR1.2 billion, valuing all assets, net of cash, at around EUR10 billion on the basis of the industry's median EV/EBITDA multiple of 7X to 8X. \u001d  Those focusing just on equity, like public investors, may look at market cap' to sales. Ford is trading at 0.10X trailing sales, GM is trading at 0.12X sales. \u001d  Given that Ford and GM have already agreements with UAW in place and are doing better than Chrysler in terms of product reshuffle, Chrysler has to be valued below Ford. At 8% to 9% of sales, that's roughly EUR4 billion to EUR5.5 billion. \u001d  So for a strategic investor like Renault-Nissan - which only last year was pursuing alliance talks with GM - GM itself, or a private equity firm, an investment valued on Chrysler's assets or equity doesn't look that much of a stretch. \b \u001d  (Arindam Nag has covered business and finance for 15 years in Asia, Europe and the United States.

(5730.FR) said more time was needed to finalize exactly where its new airplane would be built. \u001d  In a short statement, EADS said its board late Sunday opted to interrupt work on Airbus' Power8 restructuring plan that is expected to include thousands of job cuts and some outsourcing of operations. \u001d  It said the board will meet again in the next few days to find an agreement with European nations on how to share the workload on the development of Airbus' planned mid-sized A350 XWB airplane. \u001d  Airbus bosses were scheduled to meet the company's works council Tuesday to detail the Power8 program, but the meeting has now been postponed, EADS said. Airbus Chief Executive Louis Gallois was expected to outline the program at a news conference Tuesday afternoon in Toulouse. \u001d  The A350 XWB airplane, which was officially launched at the end of 2006, is Airbus' answer to rival Boeing Co.'s (BA) strong-selling 787 Dreamliner. The four main European countries that Airbus operates in - France, Germany, the U.K. and Spain - are all seeking to have involvement on the A350 program to safeguard jobs. The Power8 program is expected to outline exactly where and how the new airliner will be built. \u001d  Politicians in Germany and France are calling on EADS to keep any job losses through Power8 to a minimum and spread the burden throughout the company. Trade unions have also expressed concern in recent weeks, and early this month more than 10,000 Airbus workers in Germany rallied against the possible job losses. \u001d  In a statement, Airbus CEO Gallois - who is also joint CEO at EADS - stressed there was a need to quickly find a solution \"that overcomes national issues.\" \u001d  \"I made proposals, which I deem balanced, both from an industrial and a technological point of view, and which serve our objective of economic competitiveness,\" Gallois said. \"I wish that they can lead to the consensus we urgently need.

An EADS official - who asked not to be named - told Dow Jones Newswires separately that threatened job losses are likely to be a major reason for the delay in the announcement. \u001d  A Paris-based analyst said the delay comes after strong pressure from French and German unions and the German government. He said the delay is \"worrying\" as Airbus is in \"desperate\" need of restructuring and there's a risk the plan could be scaled down. \u001d  EADS has said Airbus likely have made an operating loss last year due to costly delays in its double-decker A380 program and initial restructuring charges. \u001d  EADS is due to release 2006 results in early March. \u001d  The Power8 program is designed to improve Airbus' internal efficiency and competitiveness against Boeing amid a weaker U.S. dollar.

In addition, GGOWL recently received permission to connect the wind farm to the electricity grid via a substation at Sizewell from Suffolk Coastal District Council. \b \u001d  The planned wind farm will produce 500MW of electricity via 140 wind turbines sited around the Inner Gabbard and The Galloper sandbanks. It will be the first UK offshore wind farm to be built outside territorial waters and will provide green electricity for more than 415,000 homes equivalent to the domestic demand of Suffolk. The east coast of England is a key area for offshore wind projects with approximately 6.5 GW of capacity currently planned out of a total of 10 GW for the whole of the UK. \b \u001d  The Greater Gabbard offshore wind farm project will make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emission by almost 1.5 million tonnes p.a. which is the equivalent of removing 350,000 cars from the road every year. \b \u001d  Receipt of planning consent allows the joint venture to progress the project design and to structure the project financing arrangements as well as the power purchase agreements that are required to allow the project to achieve financial close which is scheduled for second half of 2007. \b \u001d  GGOWL is already focusing on pre-construction activities: Fluor has been appointed as EPC contractor. The procurement process for turbines and other equipment has commenced, with offshore construction planned to commence in 2009. \b \u001d  Commenting on the project, Eddie O'Connor, Airtricity CEO said, \"This is a great boon for the United Kingdom. Wind on such scale will bring strong economic and environmental benefits for the UK. When the wind blows free generation replaces generation that costs. Wind reduces risk because the cost of the power offered will be fixed in price and offers price benefits for the consumer. Such large scale offshore wind provides consistent power and will push down the prices for fossil fuels. This price decrease is caused by the diminishment in demand for fossil fuels, something we've seen frequently in Northern Europe. Greater Gabbard will save money as well as contributing to the amount of electricity generated from emissions free sources. \b \u001d  Fluor's Managing Director, Patrick Flaherty said, \"We are pleased to have achieved this important milestone and we look forward to working with all involved stakeholders to progress the project to financial close during 2007 so that we can begin the construction works in time to support the government's 2010 renewables target Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Limited will play a vital part in supplying green electricity as part of the wider programme to produce 6-7000MW of electricity to the UK.\" \b \u001d  Notes for editors: The Duke of York, Prince Andrew, met with Airtricity Chief Executive Eddie O'Connor, and Fluor Managing Director Patrick Flaherty, on February 5th as the two companies prepared to receive a planning decision for the Greater Gabbard Offshore Wind Farm. \b \u001d  In his capacity as the UK's Special Representative for International Trade and Investment, the Duke of York visited Ireland to highlight the strong economic links between the UK and Ireland. Part of the visit included a private meeting with both Airtricity and Fluor, as well as the unveiling of a plaque in Airtricity's Dublin offices to commemorate the event. \b \b   About Airtricity \b \u001d  Airtricity is a world leading renewable energy company. As an integrated utility, the company is both a generator and supplier of green electricity and currently supplying renewable electricity to over 45,000 commercial customers in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The Spanish bank walked away from Italy's Banco Nazionale del Lavoro because the deal wouldn't meet strict criteria for value creation. But it is showing a different side of its character in the U.S. In paying $9.6 billion for Alabama-based Compass Bancshares, BBVA looks ready to pay dearly to fulfill its appetite for American assets. \u001d  Compass is more expensive than might be suggested by the 8.2% premium BBVA is paying to Thursday's closing share price. Compass stock had already been inflated by bid speculation, having been on the block for weeks. At 3.5 times book value, BBVA is paying more for Compass than its other U.S. acquisitions, and a premium of more than 40% to the multiple at which other US banks trade, according to Fox-Pitt, Kelton. \u001d  BBVA will have trouble making the deal stack up. The benefits it will get won't be enough to make Compass wash its face any time soon, even factoring in revenue synergies, which investors consider more flaky. Taxed and capitalized, the total synergies of $240 million that BBVA will get from the deal are worth about $1.5 billion. The book value Compass is going for implies that BBVA is paying a premium of twice that much. What's more, the benefits won't be enough to take the returns BBVA will get from the deal in 2010 far beyond 8%, well below the group's cost of equity of about 10%. \u001d  This looks like a piece of empire-building by BBVA's chairman, Francisco Gonzalez, who, at 62 years old, may be approaching the end of his tenure. At least the bank's jaw-dropping request for capital -- the second in three months -- gives shareholders a chance to ask him some tough questions. \b \u001d  Sonaecom/PT \b \u001d  Sonaecom's ruling de Azevedo family blinked first. Despite warning for months that they wouldn't raise their offer of 9.50 euros ($12.48) a share for Portugal Telecom, the owners of the rival Portuguese telecoms group have now done just that. They have jacked up their offer to 10.50 euros. \u001d  In the macho world of hostile takeovers, this may look like a climbdown, and it is. But it isn't an irrational one. And it certainly hasn't done Sonaecom's share price any harm. The group may have raised its PT offer by 11%, but its own share price has risen by more than 20%. To understand why, consider some simple math. Sonaecom is worth 2.9 billion euros. If its shares had risen just in line with the telecoms sector, it would be worth only 1.6 billion euros. That's a measure of where the stock might fall to if its bid were to fail. On the other hand, assume that PT's fair stand-alone value is 9 euros a share. The 10.50 euros offer represents a premium of 1.7 billion euros. The synergies from the deal are hard to assess. The market had estimated they were worth 2.5 billion euros; but numbers of up to 3 billion euros are being bandied about. Even at 10.50 euros a share, Sonaecom would still capture some 800 million euros to 1.2 billion euros of value for itself. That means it could be worth between 2.4 billion euros and 2.9 billion euros if it bagged PT at its new offer price. \u001d  But if the de Azevedos have been rational, that doesn't mean they will succeed with their new offer. PT's shareholders, having seen Sonaecom's own share price soar, may feel they are being short-changed. The main problem they have is that they can't make the de Azevedos blink again. Sonaecom's new offer is final, so it is a simple case of saying yes or no. \b \u001d  GM/Chrysler \b \u001d  It's easy to imagine a finale to DaimlerChrysler's disastrous American road trip. Why not hand over its money-losing Chrysler division to the biggest car maker in the world -- General Motors? By crunching plants, models and brands, there would be huge cost savings. They might even create value for investors. \u001d  Here's how a deal might work. Daimler hands Chrysler over to GM. The two agree on a value for the business -- something like $10 billion, give or take a few billion depending on Chrysler's liabilities. In exchange, Daimler gets no cash, but a big stake in the combined GM-Chrysler. Daimler is, after all, used to holding investments in public companies such as EADS, the defense concern. This gives it an option on a Detroit turnaround. \u001d  Daimler also hammers out an alliance with GM along the lines of the one Carlos Ghosn fashioned between Nissan and Renault -- and tried unsuccessfully to bring GM into. Because Daimler needs such an arrangement as much as GM, the automakers' bosses would be in a position of equal strength in negotiating a deal. By combining procurement, purchasing and some other functions around the world, everybody wins. \u001d  Now comes the hard part, and the reason a deal might never get beyond an investment banker's spreadsheet. For a merger to work, GM and Chrysler would need to crunch costs like crazy. Again, on paper this is conceivable. There are overlapping brands, dealer networks, factories, operating plants and white-collar work forces galore. \u001d  If they cut costs equal to 2% of sales -- a common M&A metric -- the savings, once taxed and capitalized would be worth about $30 billion, roughly equal to the two car makers' value. But pushing these cuts through won't be easy. For starters, neither firm has shown much stomach for eliminating brands, although with so much overlap in the SUV market between them, they'd have little choice. \u001d  Dealing with the fallout from the unions could be harder. A merger would require firing many thousands more than the 13,000 staff in Chrysler's latest restructuring plans. Then there are the dealers.

(TSX:NAC)(\"the Company\") reports: \b \bNorth Atlantic Resources is pleased to announce that it has started its first drilling program on the Kourouba gold project in southern Mali. The Company announced that it acquired an option on the 185 square kilometer Kourouba gold exploration permit in southern Mali on February 5, 2007. The Kourouba project is located in the Koulikoro Region, 110 kilometers southeast of the capital, Bamako. The property covers a strike length of 14 kilometers of prospective stratigraphy in the Birimian Yanfolila greenstone belt. \b \bThe main target of the drilling program is a north-trending, continuous, gold in soil anomaly, with samples containing at least 100 parts per billion gold over a nominal strike length of 2,500 meters and a peak value of 1,420 parts per billion (1.42 grams per tonne gold). The gold anomaly is illustrated on the attached map. \b \bThe Company plans to complete an initial 3,700 meters of air core drilling to determine the location, nature, and trend of gold concentrations in saprolite and bedrock over a strike length of 2,500 meters. Contingent upon the results of the air core drilling, the Company will complete an induced polarization survey and additional drilling. \b \bThe Company has 8 gold projects comprising 1,676 square kilometers of mineral rights in Mali. Since 2002, the Company has made gold discoveries at the Kantela project (2004), FT project (2005), and Massala project (2006). \b \bThe FT gold deposit is estimated to contain 4,977,000 tonnes grading 1.0 grams gold per tonne for a total of 218,800 ounces of gold in the inferred category and 5,956,000 tonnes grading 1.15 grams gold per tonne for a total of 160,700 ounces of gold in the indicated category. The Company is currently reviewing the results of the latest phase of drilling and assaying completed in 2006. The purpose of the review is to (i) construct a geological wire frame to compliment the existing assay wire frame, (ii) to re-sample certain drill holes to verify the quality of previous assays, as part of routine quality control, and (iii) to make recommendations for further work on the deposit and on exploration targets elsewhere on the property. It is anticipated that an induced polarization survey will be completed over the deposit and its extensions in February, 2007, before the next phase of drilling is completed. The Company anticipates that future drilling would be greatly optimized by the ongoing review of the geology and grade distribution of the deposit. \b \bThe drilling at the FT Gold Deposit was completed by the professional staff of West African Drilling Services. The drill core samples were both HQ and NQ size and were cut in half by a diamond saw on site. Half of the core from one meter long samples was shipped to the Analabs Morila facility, and ALS Chemex, Vancouver and analyzed for gold by fire assay-AA on a 50 gram sample charge. Two meter long intervals of RC samples were split on site and sent to Analabs Morila facility and analyzed for gold by fire assay-AA on a 50 gram sample charge. The Company inserts a standard, duplicate, and blank in each batch of 20 samples analyzed to monitor laboratory accuracy and precision. The drafting was completed by Burt Consulting Services. \b \bAt the Kantela project, the Company is completing a review of the drilling at Zone 2 in order to complete a preliminary model of the gold zone, and to complete additional drilling, if warranted. \b \bAt the Massala project, the Company is planning to complete an induced polarization survey in the area where a reverse circulation drill hole intersected 12 meters grading 3.26 grams per tonne gold in 2006. Contingent upon the results of the geophysical survey, the Company will complete additional drilling in order to trace the extensions of the gold zone. \b \bIn addition to the aforementioned gold projects, the Company continues to review data from several promising gold exploration prospects in Mali and anticipates that additional projects will be acquired in 2007. \b \bIn the neighboring Republic of Niger, the Company acquired the Abelajouad uranium exploration permit in 2006 and has 4 pending uranium exploration permit applications in Niger. The Company anticipates that it will begin exploration work on its uranium exploration projects in Niger in the first quarter of 2007. In addition, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Selier Energy Ltd., has acquired the 20,000 square kilometer Macina oil and gas exploration permit in central Mali and, is preparing an appropriate plan for the financing and exploration of the project. \b \bThe technical information contained in this release was compiled by Jon North, Ph.D., P.

(VLO) Sunday made tangible progress toward repairing and recommissioning its McKee refinery in Sunray, Texas, but the area will remain \"highly sensitive\" for at least three more days, and returning units to normal may be a lengthy process. \u001d  The fire that began burning Friday in the refinery's propane deasphalting unit was finally extinguished by Sunday morning, and some essential workers were allowed to return to the plant. But two days after shutting McKee due to a fire, Valero continued to avoid providing a time-table for a restart. New details also emerged Sunday about the factors behind the refinery shutdown, an unusually extreme response in the oil industry. \u001d  About 55 employees and 30 to 40 members of the emergency response team were at the plant on Sunday, according to Valero spokeswoman Mary Rose Brown. The emergency operations command center, which had been set up outside of the refinery moved to the plant's administration building, she said. \u001d  Although the police removed blockades that had cordoned off streets around the refinery, Brown said access to the plant remained severely limited. \u001d  Because heavy winds here, which raised dust-storms throughout the day, could ignite embers at the refinery, she said only critical personnel would be allowed to enter the plant, and some sections of the plant would remain inaccessible. \u001d  Due to the limited access to the facility, the severity of the fire and work required to recommission the plant, restart is unlikely to commence before midweek, she said. Brown couldn't say precisely how long the efforts would take once the restart begins. \u001d  \"The next three days are a critical time,\" she said. \u001d  Some with detailed knowledge of the refinery say it could be even longer before restart. Generally, refineries are not \"turned off\" in their entirety. Rather, individual sections are shut for maintenance work. Friday's emergency shutdown of the facility marks the first plant-wide emergency shutdown in at least 25 years, said one person familiar with refinery operations. \u001d  Because the refinery was shut quickly, and has been off-line for three days, efforts to return the units to operating condition may be lengthy, this person said. The steam system, which is essential for the refinery's operation, is located close to the unit in which the fire broke out. Although Brown suggested that the majority of the damage was confined to the deasphalter, a person familiar with the plant said that the steam-lines around the unit would need to be carefully reviewed. \u001d  \"Until they're absolutely certain that it's safe, they won't let it go,\" said one person of Valero's efforts to restart the refinery. \u001d  Since restarting from this state is highly unusual, it's impossible to gauge how long the inspections and restart will take, this person said. \u001d  To compensate for the outage at the plant, Brown said that the company's commercial operators are working \"around the clock\" to meet Valero's customers' needs. The McKee refinery generally supplies products to Colorado and West Texas. \u001d  Valero said it has purchased fuel and made other arrangements to cover its immediate supply requirements but industry observers have expressed concern. An operations halt of more than about a week could meaningfully affect supply in Colorado and perhaps more broadly, two analysts said soon after the fire occurred. \u001d  Although national petroleum inventories are fairly high by historic standards for this time of year, analysts have expressed concern about the impact on the Rockies, especially in light of upcoming maintenance at other refineries in the region. \u001d  \"This could affect Colorado substantially,\" said Roy Turner, executive vice president of the Colorado/Wyoming Petroleum Marketers Association in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. \u001d  Valero provides about 30% of the state's supply of gasoline, according to Turner. The McKee outage, along with upcoming maintenance at Suncor's refinery in Denver and work planned at Frontier Oil Corp.'s (FTO) Cheyenne, Wyoming, refinery could tighten supplies just when marketers need them grow. \u001d  Marketers are now trying to build commercial stocks ahead of spring maintenance unit shutdowns, Turner said, and the Valero shutdown \"could take inventories down and create a supply problem.\" The situation might result in refiners changing their maintenance plans, Turner added. \u001d  Investigations Under Way \u001d  Valero said it was cooperating fully with federal efforts to investigate the blast. Investigators from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board are both geared toward determining the root cause of the accident. Valero has also formed its own internal investigation into the incident. \u001d  The union representing Valero's hourly work-force has also delegated a representative to investigate the blast. Preliminary, the United Steelworker's John Alexander said the blast had likely originated with a release of propane, either due to mechanical failure or human error. When the propane was released, it was ignited by an undetermined source - possibly an open heater in the deasphalting unit - triggering the fire, he said. \u001d  In nearby Dumas, the influx of Valero's teams and outside investigators filled the city's motels, leaving several with no vacancy. Generally, motels in downtown Dumas are crowded on weekdays with travelers traveling between Texas and Colorado, but relatively empty on weekends. \u001d  Plant Was Evacuated On Risk \u001d  Valero's decision Friday to shut the refinery stemmed in part from the fire's proximity to propane tanks that created the risk of an explosion that a union official said could have potentially leveled the facility. \u001d  Four spherical propane tanks sit adjacent to the unit which caught fire, a propane deasphalter, said the Steelworkers' Alexander, a health and safety specialist with the United Steelworkers. The heat and flames from the fire could have resulted in one of the tanks exploding, said. Such a blast would likely have caused a chain reaction, in which the other tanks also combusted, he added. \u001d  \"There were propane spheres in the direction of the wind at the time the decision was made (not close, but within the wind's direction),\" said Valero's Brown. \"Fortunately, the wind shifted relatively quickly,\" she said. \u001d  \"The decision was made for the safety of our workforce,\" Brown said. Valero, the nation's largest refiner, completely shut the plant Friday afternoon after a giant flame prompted the company to evacuate some 400 employees and hundreds of contract workers. \u001d  \"Evacuating the plant was the right thing to do,\" said the Steelworkers' Alexander, who is based in Pittsburgh and arrived here Friday night to investigate the incident. \"If the wind hadn't been blowing, it might have leveled the whole place,\" Alexander said. \u001d  The fire resulted in no deaths, but there were three serious injuries. A contractor working at the refinery through Team Industrial Services Inc. (TISI) as a supervisor for that company was the most severely injured. He remained hospitalized in critical, but stable condition at a burn unit in Lubbock.

For the fourth quarter alone, operating income amounted to NOK4,573 million, compared with NOK10,360 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and NOK15,278 million in the third quarter of 2006. \u001d  The proposed merger of Hydro's oil and gas activities with Statoil is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2007, in line with the plan announced in December. \u001d  Hydro's Board of Directors proposed a dividend of NOK5.00 per share for 2006. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 01:51 ET (06:51 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1e97566e9737096094bba80523dd92cb","symR":["RUS.T","CA7819036046"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Russel Metals 4Q Net C$0.49/Share >RUS.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T18:43:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RUS.T","CA7819036046"],"IndustryCodes":["STL","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 13:43 ET (18:43 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1eb757b236d66face57a8551cefb0a59","symR":["CLR.UN.T","CA1853841049"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Clearwater Seafoods To Issue C$43.5M Of Conv Unsec Sub Debs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T20:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CLR.UN.T","CA1853841049"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 15:56 ET (20:56 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1ed921800300ad90dd574478536a79a8","symR":["UKDAY"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"London Late Gold And Silver At 1615 GMT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T16:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":["PCS"],"Story":"\b \bGold    $670.00-$671.50  ($664.30-$664.70) \bSilver $13.99-$14.03     ($13.86-$13.92) \b Contact: Peter Dowling, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-20-7842-9445; peter.dowling@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 11:16 ET (16:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1ee799d80bd8dc82e6ce9a4e92adcef5","symR":["FBRWY","FGL.AU","AU000000FGL6"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Foster's: Expects Accelerating EPS Growth FY07","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T21:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FBRWY","FGL.AU","AU000000FGL6"],"IndustryCodes":["BVG","DST","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 16:36 ET (21:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1f16d95719b0393103c320f54e14f8f0","symR":["SFLY"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Shutterfly Added to Russell 3000 Index, Russell 2000 Index and Russell Microcap Index","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T21:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SFLY"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bREDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2007-- \u001d  Shutterfly, Inc.

(Nasdaq:CTXS), the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, today announced the findings of its survey of state- and private-sector health executives on electronic medical record (EMR) adoption and regional health information organization (RHIO) participation. RHIOs enable the secure exchange and use of patient information held in EMRs across facilities in order to improve healthcare quality and efficiency. The full report is available via download at http://www.citrix.com/healthitsurvey. \b \b   EMR Use Growing, But Roadblocks Remain \b \u001d  While 57 percent of private-sector healthcare facilities are currently using EMRs, just 19 percent of state healthcare facilities have adopted them. EMRs contain patient condition and treatment information and are used by healthcare practitioners across multiple facilities to document and manage healthcare delivery, speeding patient care, reducing administrative costs, and improving medical outcomes. Significant challenges to EMR adoption include budget constraints, healthcare staff resistance, and technical complexity, according to the survey. \b \u001d  The Bush administration has set the goal of providing e-health records for all citizens by 2014. At the present time, many communities are establishing RHIOs to facilitate medical record-sharing across healthcare facilities at the local level. Survey participants cited immediate access to up-to-date patient information, increased collaboration amongst healthcare providers, and access to information about EMR solutions as the key benefits of RHIO participation. State health executives are leading the way in RHIO participation, with 43 percent currently involved in a RHIO, compared to 20 percent for the private sector. The top barriers to participation cited were lack of awareness/education regarding RHIO options, no EMR use, and budget constraints. \b \u001d  Public-Sector Healthcare Executives Advocate Increased State Leadership \b \u001d  Despite their higher level of RHIO participation, however, few states have set timeframes for achieving statewide EMR use. Just 16 percent of state health executives and 6 percent of private-sector health IT executives said their states had set a timeline. Yet state health executives said they see a strong role for the states in RHIO development. Seventy-nine percent said states should provide a framework for RHIO development, 73 percent said states should provide start-up funding, and 72 percent said states should provide access to EMR technology solutions via an ASP model. \b \u001d  \"States need to quickly adopt a proactive EMR/RHIO leadership role in order to realize the 2014 goal of e-health records for all Americans,\" said Bert Wakeley, director of State and Local Government for Citrix. \"States can help healthcare organizations overcome the cultural, budgetary, and technical challenges to EMR adoption by setting timelines, raising awareness, and providing access to funding and technology resources.\" \b \b   Methodology \b \u001d  The online survey of 347 private-sector health IT executives in January 2007 includes representatives from the full range of care facilities: hospitals, long-term care facilities, physician's offices, and rehabilitation facilities/clinics. The private-sector survey has a margin of error of +/- 4.4 percent with a 90 percent confidence level. The one-on-one phone survey of state healthcare executives in January 2007 includes representatives from public hospitals and clinics and state public health agencies. The state healthcare executive survey has a margin of error of +/- 8.3 percent with a 90 percent confidence level. Respondents from both groups indicate professional titles of CIOs, senior IT executives, IT managers, and healthcare administrators.

Uncle Sam will crack some heads at Merck and Pfizer, and Washington will save so much money that it might even close the much-loathed \"doughnut hole,\" a flaw in the law that currently denies coverage to Medicare recipients who have at least $2,400 in prescription costs, but less than $3,850 in total out-of-pocket expenses. \u001d  That's the plan. But not so fast. \u001d  Even assuming Congress can overcome the Bush administration's rigid opposition to using government heft to benefit consumers, it's not clear that most advocates of lower prices understand how the prescriptions racket really works. Drugmakers don't typically sell directly to insurance companies. And insurers don't decide by themselves which drugs they'll cover. Instead, corporations called pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate discounted purchases of drugs and manage the administration of benefits for health plans. And with Part D going back on the table, it's the role of PBMs within Medicare that requires corrective surgery first. \u001d  The history of PBMs in 100 words: As HMOs emerged in the early 1990s, they sought to clamp down on drug costs within their networks. So they started restricting their formularies, or lists of prescriptions they would cover. And they began hiring outside companies -- pharmacy benefit managers -- to play a two-step supply-chain game. First, the PBMs obtained volume discounts from companies that made the drugs the insurers still did cover. Second, they pressured doctors and pharmacists to herd patients onto those medications. Taking cash from both the drug companies and the insurers, PBMs grew into extremely powerful, profitable middlemen. \u001d  By January 2006, the three largest PBMs -- Medco Health Solutions, Caremark (which has announced a merger with CVS) and Express Scripts (which is also seeking to merge with Caremark) -- were processing prescription benefits for more than 150 million patients and generating combined revenues of $89 billion. And over the past year, PBMs have been able to extend their business model into the Medicare population. That's because the government doesn't run Part D directly, the way it operates Medicare's hospital, physician and home health care programs. Instead, beneficiaries join private drug plans, which buy pharmaceuticals, dispense them and get reimbursed by Medicare, and those plans are using PBMs to obtain drugs and set formularies. \u001d  Now, when a PBM saves a managed-care company or employer money by handling paperwork more efficiently, great. But PBMs make most of their money through practices that should scare the hell out of anyone signing up for a Medicare drug plan. \u001d  PBMs routinely manipulate formularies to favor the drug companies that offer them cash. Drug-makers typically give PBMs discounts on specific pharmaceuticals in the form of rebates. PBMs pass part -- but not all -- of those payments to insurers in exchange for giving those medications favored slots on the lists of prescription drugs the insurance plans cover. PBMs also bombard doctors with requests to prescribe the approved drugs and pharmacists with requests to switch patients to those medications. \u001d  So if you have high cholesterol and your doctor wants to treat you with Vytorin, there's no guarantee that's what you'll get. Vytorin is made by Merck and Schering-Plough; if your health plan is working with a PBM that has struck a deal with Pfizer on anticholesterol drugs instead, your insurance will probably cover Lipitor but not Vytorin. Not all drugs are interchangeable though, and if your doctor insists on Vytorin, he may be forced to fill out extra paperwork to authorize your prescription. Or you may have to fork over a higher copayment or full retail price for the drug you want -- and in Medicare, if you go off your insurer's formulary, your spending will not count toward the out-of-pocket limit that triggers government coverage beyond the \"doughnut hole.\" Creepiest of all, your insurer's PBM may call your pharmacist or doctor and get your prescription switched before you ever get to the drugstore. \u001d  Industry professionals call this process \"therapeutic substitution,\" or \"step therapy,\" an even more hideous euphemism. Anyone on a steady regimen of prescriptions knows the reality of those terms: You ride a carousel of medications and an escalator of bills while your health plan and its PBM fish around for payouts from drug companies. Medco, for example, generates more than $3 billion a year in rebates on brand-name pharmaceuticals and keeps 26 percent of that cash. Indeed, in its 2005 annual report, the company revealed that without discounts and payments from drugmakers, it would not have been profitable in any year since 2003. But is this really something we want to impose on Medicare beneficiaries? Seniors take more medications and are more likely to have multiple prescriptions than other age groups, so they are especially vulnerable to adverse drug effects. It's also a recipe for confusion: My dad takes nine different kinds of pills a week; the last thing I want is for his oval green gelcaps to be switched to triangular yellow tablets and then, 60 days later, to half-red capsules. \u001d  What's worse is that this whole process may not even be saving any money. Sure, PBMs obtain discounts for insurance companies. But it's impossible for health plans to know whether they're really getting a good deal on pharmaceuticals, because the contracts between PBMs and drugmakers are secret. Drug companies don't have to reveal the costs of their products, and PBMs don't have to disclose which firms they are dealing with or how much of their rebates they are keeping. \"It's like if you go to Best Buy and find a big-screen TV  you like and there's a slip on the shelf that says 'COUPON,' but bears no price,\" says Robert Garis, professor of pharmacy sciences at Creighton University in Omaha. \"So you go up to the register and the clerk says, 'That will be $2,300, and by the way, we gave you a great rebate on this.' And you ask, 'How much was the rebate?' And he says, 'That's proprietary.'\" \u001d  Recently, PBMs have garnered lawsuits from federal prosecutors, state attorneys general and health plan members. In October, Medco agreed to pay $155 million to settle a case in which the Justice Department charged the PBM had solicited kick-backs from drugmakers, paid kickbacks to health plans and submitted false mail-order prescription claims. And in September 2005, AdvancePCS, which is now a Caremark subsidiary, paid $137 million to close its own federal kickbacks case. But these settlements haven't changed the middlemen firms' essentially self-dealing nature. In the traffic of prescription drugs, PBMs are like toll takers who pay themselves salaries from the fees they collect. \u001d  Which brings us back to Medicare. Congressional Democrats are seriously considering a proposal by Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) to have Medicare establish its own drug plan, which would compete with private plans, theoretically driving prices down. But that would leave intact the anticompetitive arrangements that PBMs have with drugmakers and insurance companies. Congress should also resurrect a 2003 plan by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) to require PBMs that want to participate in federal programs to reveal all contracts they have with pharmaceutical companies and health plans. And it should make clear that drug substitutions for commercial reasons are illegal within federal programs. \u001d  Seniors are filling 3.5 million Part D prescriptions a day. A government spending $38 billion a year to pay for that medicine has an obligation to make sure that doctors, pharmacists and patients themselves, not drug-company marketers, HMO accountants and PBMs, have the final say over what they put into their bodies. \u001d  --- \u001d  Contributing editor PETER KEATING can be reached at newretirement@hearst.com. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:04 ET (11:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2080cbc6346d09375f18c0b7ddd44fe5","symR":["12150.FR","13190.FR","5730.FR","ABI.YY","FR0000121501","FR0000131906","NL0000235190"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"French Fin Min: Wealth Tax Is Necessary","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T19:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12150.FR","13190.FR","5730.FR","ABI.YY","FR0000121501","FR0000131906","NL0000235190"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","AUT","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XMDAX"],"Story":"\u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--French Finance Minister Thierry Breton said the wealth tax is necessary and that it won't be abolished if Nicolas Sarkozy, the candidate of the governing UMP party, wins the presidential elections in May. \u001d  \"It's necessary to have a tax on capital,\" Breton said in an interview on France Inter radio. \"The issue is for the tax not to be excessive.\" \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 14:21 ET (19:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2082fdb15af7f3722462a6372e73f1a3","symR":["AXA.T","ETIFF","CA28248G1072"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Eiger Files First Quarter Results On SEDAR>AXA.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T14:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AXA.T","ETIFF","CA28248G1072"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ"],"Story":"\bTORONTO, Feb. 19 /CNW/ - Eiger Technology, Inc.

XM and SIRIUS shareholders will each own approximately 50 percent of the combined company. \b \u001d  Mel Karmazin, currently Chief Executive Officer of SIRIUS, will become Chief Executive Officer of the combined company and Gary Parsons, currently Chairman of XM, will become Chairman of the combined company.  The new company's board of directors will consist of 12 directors, including Messrs.

Further management appointments will be announced prior to closing.  The companies will continue to operate independently until the transaction is completed and will work together to determine the combined company's corporate name and headquarters location prior to closing. \b \u001d  The combination creates a nationwide audio entertainment provider with combined 2006 revenues of approximately $1.5 billion based on analysts' consensus estimates.  Today the companies have approximately 14 million combined subscribers.  Together, SIRIUS and XM will create a stronger platform for future innovation within the audio entertainment industry and will provide significant benefits to all constituencies, including: \b \b \b    * Greater Programming and Content Choices -- The combined company is \b      committed to consumer choice, including offering consumers the ability \b      to pick and choose the channels and content they want on a more a la \b      carte basis. The combined company will also provide consumers with a \b      broader selection of content, including a wide range of commercial-free \b      music channels, exclusive and non-exclusive  sports coverage, news, \b      talk, and entertainment programming.  Together, XM and SIRIUS will be \b      able to improve on products such as real-time traffic and rear-seat \b      video and introduce new ones such as advanced data services including \b      enhanced traffic, weather and infotainment offerings. \b \b    * Accelerated Technological Innovation -- The merger will enable the \b      combined company to develop and introduce a wider range of lower cost, \b      easy-to-use, and multi-functional devices through efficiencies in chip \b      set and radio design and procurement.  Such innovation is essential to \b      remaining competitive in the consumer electronics-driven world of audio \b      entertainment. \b \b    * Benefits to OEM and Retail Partners -- The combined company will offer \b      automakers and retailers the opportunity to provide a broader content \b      offering to their customers.  Consumer electronics retailers, including \b      Best Buy, Circuit City, RadioShack, Wal-Mart and others, will benefit \b      from enhanced product offerings that should allow satellite radio to \b      compete more effectively. \b \b    * Enhanced Financial Performance -- This transaction will enhance the \b      long-term financial success of satellite radio by allowing the combined \b      company to better manage its costs through sales and marketing and \b      subscriber acquisition efficiencies, satellite fleet synergies, combined \b      R&D and other benefits from economies of scale.  Wall Street equity \b      analysts have published estimates of the present value of cost synergies \b      ranging from $3 billion to $7 billion. \b \b    * More Competitive Audio Entertainment Provider -- The combination of an \b      enhanced programming lineup with improved technology, distribution and \b      financials will better position satellite radio to compete for \b      consumers' attention and entertainment dollars against a host of \b      products and services in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving \b      audio entertainment marketplace.  In addition to existing competition \b      from free \"over-the-air\" AM and FM radio as well as iPods and mobile \b      phone streaming, satellite radio will face new challenges from the rapid \b      growth of HD Radio, Internet radio and next generation wireless \b      technologies. \b \b \u001d  \"We are excited for the many opportunities that an XM and SIRIUS combination will provide consumers,\" said Gary Parsons, Chairman of XM Satellite Radio and Hugh Panero, CEO of XM Satellite Radio, in a joint statement.  \"The combined company will be better positioned to compete effectively with the continually expanding array of entertainment alternatives that consumers have embraced since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) first granted our satellite radio licenses a decade ago.\" \b \u001d  \"This combination is the next logical step in the evolution of audio entertainment,\" said Mel Karmazin, CEO of SIRIUS Satellite Radio.  \"Together, our best-in-class management team and programming content will create unprecedented choice for consumers, while creating long-term value for shareholders of both companies.

Each of our companies has a strong commitment to providing listeners the broadest range of music, news, sports and entertainment and the best customer service possible.

PCL (SHIN.TH) is majority foreign-owned. \u001d  However, when questioned by reporters after the news conference, he appeared to downplay the possibility of revoking Shin Satellite's concession, because even if Shin Corp. is found to be a foreign firm, it owns only 41.3% of the satellite operator, so Shin Satellite might still be a majority Thai-owned firm, eligible to hold the operating concession. \u001d  Singapore's state-owned investment company Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd. (TEMAH.YY) acquired control of Shin Corp. early last year. A Ministry of Commerce investigation forwarded to police late last year an initial finding that Temasek may have used local holding firm Kularb Kaew Co. as a nominee to evade a 49% limit on foreign ownership of a telecommunications company, but no further progress has been reported in the case. Sittichai said it isn't clear whether his ministry has the authority to conduct an independent investigation into the nationality of Kularb Kaew. \u001d  Sittichai said the ministry believes it has the Thai public's consent and support in its bid to regain control of the country's assets, but that it wants to be fair to all sides. \u001d  \"If we were to buy back (Shin Satellite), the price must be fair to both buyer and seller. It's also up to whether the owner will sell it. If the seller doesn't want to sell then we can't buy it. We can't exercise our authority in an unfair way,\" Sittichai said. \u001d  Temasek may not resist selling back the satellite operator as Shin Satellite, which posted a third quarter loss of THB746.8 million, is one of Shin Corp.'s costlier and riskier businesses, weighing on the group's overall earnings performance. \u001d  There is also the question of whether it would be worth it for the government to buy the company, Sittichai said. \u001d  \"If the new owners operate it in the right way then it's okay. If they don't, then it could be a problem for national security,\" Sittichai said. \u001d  KGI Securities said the government's plan to buy back Shin Satellite has a negative effect on Shin Corp. as investors are concerned that Shin may not get a fair price. \u001d  Mayuree Chowvikran, a telecoms analyst at Siam City Securities, estimates the book value of the company at THB10 per share. With 1.09 billion shares outstanding, a price of around THB10 billion implies a slight discount to book value, and a slight premium to the current market value. \u001d  \"In the near term, the report (also) has a negative psychological effect on Shin Corp. since it would take a while to determine whether Shin Satellite is a foreign-owned company,\" said Adisak Kammool, analyst at KGI Securities. \u001d  The government also has to consider the effects on investor confidence and stock market capitalization if ownership of Shin Corp.'s biggest money spinner, Advanced Info Service PCL (ADVANC.TH), the country's largest mobile phone operator, is also questioned, analysts said. \u001d  Sittichai told reporters there is no plan to buy back Shin Corp., which would return Advanced Info to Thai control, due to a high cost of likely around THB100 billion. \u001d  Adisak said the share price of Shin Satellite is unlikely to be hurt by the buyback, because it would most likely impact the company's ownership rather than its operations. \u001d  However, Poramet Tongbua, head of research at Tisco Securities, said the possible change in Shin Satellite's ownership to a state-owned company could affect operations because some customers may delay decisions about using the company's services. \u001d  \"It is too soon to say how seriously the company would be affected. We need to see details of any deal and the future status of the company,\" Poramet said. \u001d  At 0830 GMT, shares of Shin Corp. were down 7.1% at THB26.25, while Advanced Info was up 1.3% at THB77.50 and Shin Satellite was down 0.7% at THB7.00. \u001d  Shin Satellite has four satellites in orbit, of which two are about to be retired, and the government already owns the satellites because the concession was granted on a build-transfer-operate basis,Sittichai said. \u001d  If the government does purchase Shin Satellite, it will probably allow TOT PCL (TOT.YY) and CAT Telecom PCL to operate it,he said, adding that the two former state agencies will probably be merged. The agencies have been turned into corporations, but the state still owns 100% of both companies. \u001d  Meanwhile, Shin Satellite won't be allowed to launch any other satellites, nor would its concession contract be renewed while the company's nationality remains in question, Sittichai said. \u001d  Sittichai said the ministry will also consider opening up the sector to competition by allowing other private-sector or government agencies to apply for satellite operating concessions. \u001d  Shin Satellite's concession expires in 10 years. It hasn't announced any specific plans for another launch in its Thaicom satellite series, through which it serves a regional footprint from China and Japan to India. \b \u001d  -By Phisanu Phromchanya, Dow Jones Newswires; 66 2266 0744; phisanu.phromchanya@dowjones.com \u001d  (Supunnabul Suwannakij and Tom Fox contributed to this article) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 04:57 ET (09:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2156e450a650b6e1d1eeeca35dd3717a","symR":["FGF.UN.T","CA30603Y1034"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Fairway Investment Grade Income Fund Announces Monthly Distribution>FGF.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T16:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FGF.UN.T","CA30603Y1034"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  TORONTO, Feb. 19 /CNW/ - Fairway Investment Grade Income Fund announces a distribution for the month ending February 28, 2007 of $0.05 per unit.

Revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2006 as a result of decreases in spot rates in both the Suezmax and product carrier fleets and lower revenue from vessels that began new time charter contracts in 2006 at rates that were lower than the spot rates earned in 2005. Revenue of $718,907,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $66,540,000 or 10% compared to revenue of $652,367,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. Revenue increased in 2006 over 2005 based on the average increase in rates in the 2006 year in both the Suezmax and product carrier fleets, in addition to, increased revenue for the product carrier fleet due to more operating days from vessels acquired. \b \u001d  Craig H.

There are still too few inspectors, and state officials allege that corruption among the inspectors has kept international standards from being enforced. \u001d  Although the tragedy sparked a national outcry, no concrete measures have been taken to improve miners' safety, and Mexico's powerful trade unions have proved to be feeble advocates for greater protections. \u001d  \"That mine has no remedy because they never took precautions, and I doubt they will start now,\" said Ricardo Ramirez, a 25-year-old miner who survived the disaster and still has nightmares about the explosion. He said he suspects nothing will change, despite promises from the federal Labor Department to improve conditions. \u001d  About 100 relatives and friends of victims staged the all-night vigil outside the Pasta de Conchos mine - owned by Grupo Mexico SAB (GMEXICO.MX) - and released the 65 balloons at 2:15 a.m. Crews have worked around the clock to recover the remains of the 63 miners still trapped deep in the mine but progress has been painstakingly slow. \u001d  Later Monday, relatives placed flower arrangements at a makeshift altar outside the mine and gathered for a Mass where they renewed their pleas for better working conditions and for the recovery of the miners' remains. \u001d  \"We're asking for more resources from mining companies and the federal government because safety conditions at the mines have not improved,\" said Bishop Alonso Garza, of the city of Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas. \u001d  An official cause hasn't been determined for the explosion on Feb. 19, 2006, that collapsed much of the mine. But investigators found problems with the mine's ventilation system and some miners say that gas detectors designed to automatically shut down the mines in dangerous situations were routinely tampered with by the miners themselves. \u001d  A special state prosecutor is recommending charges of negligent homicide against 11 mine officials and federal government inspectors. \u001d  On Sunday, Coahuila Gov. Humberto Moreira said he was pressured by former President Vicente Fox to cover up for federal inspectors and to accuse \"innocent people\" for the tragedy. \u001d  Fox \"asked me to do things that are immoral, to make up crimes and put innocent people in jail,\" Moreira told reporters. \u001d  Morerira made the comments in response to a federal congressional report leaked to the media that claimed state authorities failed to enforce safety measures. The purported author of the report, congressman Armando Lopez, said it was false and that his signature on the document was forged. \u001d  A Fox spokesman wasn't available to comment. \u001d  In January, a coal miner was crushed to death and four others were injured after the collapse of a mine shaft in Nueva Rosita, a town neighboring San Juan de Sabinas, renewing demands by state authorities to increase inspections. \u001d  Only five inspectors are responsible for more than 100 coal mines in Coahuila state, where the mine is located, despite requests by the state government to increase the number of inspectors. \u001d  The company that owns Pasta de Conchos, Grupo Mexico - a railroad and mining company with operations in Mexico, Peru and the U.S. - insists the mine met all safety standards and denies that safety precautions were ignored. As for the cause, the company says investigators have to reach the spot where the blast originated before drawing any conclusions. \u001d  The company made a one-time payment of $75,000 to miners' families and gives them weekly payments of about $350. It doesn't plan to reopen the mine. \u001d  Only two bodies have been recovered, and because a more rapid mechanized search could ignite explosive gases, experts say it could be years before all the bodies are removed. \u001d  Six months ago, Rolando Alcocer, whose 54-year-old brother was killed in the blast, moved to a tent outside the mine's gates. Nearby is a makeshift altar where a glass case holds photos of the 65 dead miners, surrounded by votive candles and plastic flowers. \u001d  \"I want them to see that we have not forgotten and that we will not leave until they give us our relatives,\" Alcocer said. \"They said that, at the most, we would get the bodies in six months and we are still waiting.\" \u001d  Supporters of ousted union leader, Napoleon Gomez Urrutia, said they will strike Monday to mark the anniversary of what Gomez has dubbed \"industrial homicide.\" \u001d  Gomez himself has been a divisive figure in the disaster: He is being investigated for allegations of fraud and corruption, and his slow response after the explosion enraged workers' families. \u001d  Supporters of Gomez, who fled to Canada, say he is being persecuted for alleging a government cover-up for Grupo Mexico's negligence. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 14:55 ET (19:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"24dfe9b54505af12191b438ea12d9fdb","symR":["MLX.T","CA5729041007"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Marsulex Was Rated Strong Buy By Fraser Mackenzie >MLX.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T17:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MLX.T","CA5729041007"],"IndustryCodes":["POL","SVC"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 12:05 ET (17:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2553afb099aadae99737ef1dd85b5574","symR":["SGI.T","CA82669C1032"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"SignalEnergy To Change Name To Fortress Energy","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T14:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SGI.T","CA82669C1032"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 09:02 ET (14:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2564af948381028f626c9b4968744dea","symR":["BKIR.DB","IRE","IE0030606259"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"BoI: Reorganisation Will Not Involve Any Asset Disposals","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T10:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BKIR.DB","IRE","IE0030606259"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 05:03 ET (10:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"25b984a4b76677d08da82a56d1ad3496","symR":["EBAY","US2786421030"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"SmartMoney(3/1) Street Smart: Reality Check","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T11:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EBAY","US2786421030"],"IndustryCodes":["CSV","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From SMARTMONEY) \b   By Renee DeFranco \u001d  \"We just hired a new country manager by the name of Martin Wu, who's up and running and off to a good start.

(NASDAQ: WSTG) an integrated technology company that resells world-class software solutions to VARS and IT professionals, has deployed GFI FAXmaker for Exchange/SMTP company-wide to expedite order processing, invoicing and workflow. GFI Software is an international developer of network security, content security and messaging software. \b \u001d  GFI FAXmaker offers secure, confidential and instant delivery of faxes by email in Adobe PDF format. This allows Wayside Technology Group to automatically route orders electronically to selected departments and recipients, which expedites workflow and saves paper. \b \u001d  Wayside Technology Group had been receiving five hundred to over one thousand faxed paper purchase orders every day from customers and invoices from suppliers before deploying GFI FAXmaker in October, 2006. \b \u001d  Simon Nynens, Chairman and CEO of Wayside Technology Group, said, \"Wayside Technology Group has been successfully selling GFI software solutions for the past three years, so we were well-aware of how versatile and easy to use they are. We chose GFI FAXmaker to help us enhance electronic document management company-wide. In the short time since it has been deployed, GFI FAXmaker has helped us achieve 90% electronic workflow, which enhances efficiency and saves thousands of dollars on paper. The product is perfect for today's email-based workflow environment.\" He adds, \"Now our employees don't have to leave their desks to go to the fax machine to search for and collect faxes all day long, which results in increased productivity.\" \b \u001d  GFI FAXmaker is scalable for any size organization. It scales from four lines (standard) to 32 lines (for large organizations) with the Cantata/Brooktrout(TM) fax board. In small businesses, it runs in the background on the company mail server machine and in larger organizations, such as Wayside Technology Group, it runs on a separate machine. \b \u001d  Wayside Technology Group is planning on adding GFI FAXmaker's OCR scanning module to reduce the two-step traffic process to one. The OCR module will scan incoming faxes to identify user/employee names. When a name is recognized, the fax will be routed to that person directly without first going through the company's central email box for manager review and dissemination. \b \u001d  Another benefit of GFI FAXmaker is that it integrates with Microsoft Sequel (SQL) Server, enabling users to archive electronic faxes. In many industries, including healthcare and education, where companies are required by HIPAA and other laws to archive data for several years, this is valuable because it helps with legal compliance and expedites audits. \b \u001d  As an ecologically sensitive company, Wayside Technology Group donates a percentage of their annual savings on paper to an environmental charity. \"We'll easily save over $10,000 on paper a year, Simon Nynens says, so we're pleased to be able to give back.\" \b \u001d  \"Wayside Technology Group resells best-of-breed software solutions from world-class software companies, so for Wayside to deploy a GFI solution company-wide and achieve notable success in such a short time is extremely rewarding,\" says Curtis H. Staker, CEO of GFI Software. \b \b   About Wayside Technology Group \b \u001d  Wayside Technology Group, Inc. is a unified and integrated technology company providing products and solutions for corporate resellers, VARS, developers, IT professionals as well as business, government and educational entities. \b \b   About GFI \b \u001d  GFI is a leading software developer that provides a single source for network administrators to address their network security, content security and messaging needs. With award-winning technology, an aggressive pricing strategy and a strong focus on small-to-medium sized businesses, GFI is able to satisfy the need for business continuity and productivity encountered by organizations worldwide.

But as some savvy American investors have discovered, Sherritt is also a backdoor into Cuba, which has been off-limits to direct trade with the U.S. since the Cold War began. The tiny island nation reported 12.5 percent GDP growth in 2006, more than double the regional average, in part due to rising  prices for nickel, coal and oil. Sherritt, Cuba's biggest private provider of power and the Cuban government's partner in a nickel mine and refinery, reported record earnings of C$167 million, or C$1.10 per share in the first three quarters of 2006 (one Canadian dollar is worth U.S. 85 cents). \u001d  \"It's a commodity company without competition,\" says Salman Partners analyst Raymond Goldie. The stock rose 23 percent in 2006 and boosted the returns of a handful of American mutual funds, including one of the top performers of 2006, Heartland Value. Heartland's managers declined to comment on the company. \u001d  Cuba is still a heated political issue in the United States: The U.S. government has designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terror and prohibits Americans from traveling or doing business there. Investing in Sherritt, however, is legal so long as an American investor doesn't own enough shares to control the firm. Sherritt trades solely on the Toronto exchange, but virtually all discount brokers enable investors to purchase shares there. \u001d  As long as Cuba's policies don't change, Sherritt remains an emerging-market midcap commodity company. With a P/E of 11, it's not particularly cheap, notes Peter Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital. But the forecasts for nickel, cobalt and coal prices suggest that Sherritt should do well in the short term, while a planned expansion at the Moa nickel plant boosts the long-term outlook considerably. \u001d  --- \bSherritt International  (C, on the Toronto exchange) \bPrice: C$18.75 \bMarket Value: C$2 billion \b2007 Revenue*: C$1.1 billion \b2007 EPS*: C$1.38 \b2007 P/E*: 8.6 \b*Projected. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:01 ET (11:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"28b22b487d86dd42aa680bc87abae29f","symR":["AMT.UN.T","CA03234R1029"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Amtelecom Tgt Up To C$13.50 From C$11 At Natl Bk >AMT.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T14:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMT.UN.T","CA03234R1029"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 09:46 ET (14:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"28cb2ac95280691ea721cf6f0c3ac00b","symR":["12052.FR","ASHM.LN","SZE","FR0000120529","GB00B132NW22"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Suez Energy Intl, A Suez Unit, Makes Acquisition In Panama","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T17:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12052.FR","ASHM.LN","SZE","FR0000120529","GB00B132NW22"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","MUT","XB20","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 12:00 ET (17:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"293b7f9515ad2669e8ec2e146e1a11ce","symR":["HTE","HTE.UN.T","CA41752X1015"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Harvest Upped To Outperform From Underperf By RBC >HTE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T15:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HTE","HTE.UN.T","CA41752X1015"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 10:02 ET (15:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2955307ef8bf95d36521f90b98098386","symR":["FCPO"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Factory Card & Party Outlet Corp.

But these so-called reinsurers, which underwrite the biggest risks of the primary insurers, are primed for some pretty interesting gains. The fortunes of many reinsurers depend a great deal on the weather-hurricanes, specifically -- so when faced with massive claims in the wake of Wilma, Rita and Katrina, several dramatically curtailed their policy writing. Those that didn't were able to raise premiums. So when 2006's hurricane season turned out to be one of the mildest in recent history, reinsurers booked big profits. Barring disaster -- literally -- \"they should have another solid year,\" says Legg Mason analyst Larry Katsafanas. \u001d  The 2007 hurricane forecast is favorable, for one thing. But even if the weathermen are wrong, several changes in the industry should keep prices high, smoothing the outlook over the next 12 months. Credit-rating agencies raised capital requirements, forcing reinsurers to beef up their balance sheets and effectively  limiting policy supply. The models companies use to determine policy prices have also changed to reflect increasing disaster risk, which requires higher premiums. The result? Year-over-year premiums increased as much as 40 percent in January. \u001d  Even so, the industry is inherently risky, and reinsurance stocks are notoriously volatile. A company's track record is important: In its 14 years, RenaissanceRe has survived several disaster cycles with share value intact and, in the past decade, averaged 16 percent return on equity. The stock is up 40 percent from its 2006 low, and Morningstar analyst Bill Bergman thinks it's worth another 20 percent. \u001d  A safer way to play the sector is with a well-diversified company that's able to spread its risk around. With a worldwide presence and a wide range of reinsurance products, XL Capital is poised to profit in a growing global market, while its healthy investment portfolio was responsible for a 17 percent return on equity. \"They'll be able to meet most of their earnings targets from interest income alone,\" says RNC Genter Capital President Dan Genter, who thinks the  stock is worth at least $100. \u001d  Another beneficiary of high reinsurance premiums is Willis Group, one of the biggest reinsurance brokers. Rising premiums mean bigger commissions for the brokerage -- without the risk of underwriting. The stock offers a 2.4 percent dividend yield. \u001d  The reinsurance industry also boosted thousand-pound gorilla Berkshire Hathaway, to $109,490 per share, $3,650 for B shares. Warren Buffett announced record growth for his company in December, in part because of high premiums netted by subsidiary General Re. It generates plenty of cash, and its subsidiary companies spread out the risk; it's also the only reinsurer in the market with Buffett overseeing its investment portfolio. Fans think the shares are worth at least 30 percent more. Alternatively, you could invest in the Fairholme Fund (FAIRX), which is run by Buffett disciple Bruce Berkowitz and has Berkshire Hathaway as its largest holding. \u001d  --- \bINSURING THE INSURERS \b                              Price       Market Value     2006 \bCompany (Ticker)               ($)          ($bil)         Price/Book \b \bBerkshire Hathaway (BRKB)   3,650.91        168.9         1.65 \bRenaissanceRe (RNR)            58.50          4.2          1.8 \bWillis Group (WSH)             38.85          6.1           NA \bXL Capital (XL)                68.72         12.4          1.4 \b \bPrices as of 1/10/07.

The five probes represent the largest number of scientific satellites NASA has ever launched aboard a single rocket. \b \u001d  Before Saturday's liftoff atop a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, THEMIS had a six-week stay at Astrotech's Titusville facilities where the probes underwent performance testing, fueling, and were each individually mated to the payload carrier and finally, to the upper stage booster. \b \u001d  \"We congratulate the NASA Explorer Program and all those contributing to this exciting 'first' in the satellite industry,\" said SPACEHAB Executive Vice President, Jim Royston. \"Along with our NASA customer, we anxiously await the discoveries THEMIS will reveal in the coming months.\" \b \u001d  Astrotech provides satellite processing facilities and services from its nine-building compound in Titusville, Florida as well as its Vandenberg Air Force Base location in California. The Company also provides facilities management and spacecraft processing services for the ocean-going Sea Launch program at the Home Port Facilities in Long Beach, California.

(8234.TO) and Matsuzakaya Holdings Co. (3051.TO) would create Japan's No. 1 department store operator and benefit both sides in a bid to gain market share amid continued falling demand, analysts said. \u001d  Daimaru, Japan's fourth-biggest department store chain by sales, and No. 8 Matsuzakaya both said Monday they are mulling an operations merger within the department store sector. \u001d  Although they didn't mention each other's names, weekend media reports said the two companies are in talks to create the top entity in the industry with combined sales of Y1.167 trillion, bigger than Takashimaya Co.'s Y1.031 trillion for the year ended February 2006. \u001d  Their store locations complement each other. Daimaru operates 16 stores in areas such as Osaka of western Japan, while Matsuzakaya has nine stores centered around the Tokai area of central Japan. \u001d  Analysts said both companies would benefit from such a move because it would strengthen their buying power for supplies and streamline their distribution and other operations. \u001d  \"Should a merger go through, we expect the deal will be positive for both,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Sho Kawano said in a report. He added that Matsuzakaya would likely benefit more as it could receive the business know-how of Daimaru, known in the industry for its high profit margins. \u001d  Analysts also said a merger between the two may prompt a realignment not only among other department stores, but also among supermarket and other retail operators. \u001d  A Daimaru-Matsuzakaya deal would be the first since in the sector since the creation in 2003 of Millennium Retailing Inc., which now operates under the umbrella of Japanese retail giant Seven & I Holdings Co. Millennium operates unlisted Seibu and Sogo department stores. \u001d  The nation's department stores are struggling to get a bigger slice of market share as Japan's shrinking population begins to chip away at their customer base, especially in local areas. \u001d  Weak consumption has taken a toll on the industry, which saw only a brief pickup in sales on the economic recovery in autumn of 2005. Nationwide department store sales fell 0.7% in 2006 to Y7.77 trillion, down for a 10th consecutive year, according to the Japan Department Stores Association. The association said Monday that department store sales in January were flat on year. \u001d  A Daimaru spokesman Monday said the company is considering various steps, including a merger, a tie-up and new store openings, to better position itself amid a tough environment in the department store industry.

The 9-site IP VPN provides centralized access to software applications and the Internet for the private junior college's seven campuses and two remote sites. \b \u001d  \"Time Warner Telecom is delivering its IP VPN services in a way that makes planning and implementing for our growing infrastructure much easier,\" said Mike Hamilton, senior network architect for San Joaquin Valley College.  \"We replaced our old point-to-point network that racked up expensive long haul fees with an IP VPN that provides local data-transport rates between campuses. We now have a network that's easier to maintain and is scalable so we can meet the demands of our explosive student growth.  This service also positions us to roll out VoIP services in the near future.\" \b \u001d  To better serve it's more than 4,000 students, San Joaquin Valley College contracted with Time Warner Telecom to install a nine-node IP VPN and build fiber into the college's Fresno and Bakersfield locations.  From Fresno, the college redeploys 40 Mbps of Ethernet Internet access to all other locations on their network.  The expanded capacity represents a nearly 600 percent increase over the college's old 6 Mbps connection.  This installation is central in providing high-speed access to the Visalia headquarters and data center for technical resources. \b \u001d  \"Previously, we didn't have the bandwidth to meet the growth requirements we had at our campuses,\" explained Hamilton.  \"But now, not only have users seen an improvement in our network, but I only have to make a call to Time Warner Telecom to quickly add additional bandwidth.  I like that flexibility, because some of our campuses are experiencing incredible growth in their student enrollments.  We didn't get that flexibility from our previous providers.\" \b \u001d  Time Warner Telecom's IP VPN provides several network administration advantages as well.  \"Because the old point-to-point solution relied on three separate vendors, it was complicated to troubleshoot problems,\" said Hamilton. \"With the IP VPN through Time Warner Telecom, we get one-stop-shop service.  I really like that their technical staff owns issues until they're resolved.  We talk to people on the phone and not automated phone menus as we have with other vendors.\" \b \u001d  \"Our IP VPN solution is highly attractive to companies that operate businesses with multiple locations,\" said Robert Thompson, general manager for Time Warner Telecom in Fresno.  \"Not only does it provide local access connectivity, it also allows for the consolidation of servers, applications and infrastructure.  What's more, its helps companies protect their existing investment in networking equipment because we deliver an Ethernet handoff directly to them.\" \b \b    About Time Warner Telecom \b \u001d  Time Warner Telecom Inc., headquartered in Littleton, Colo., provides managed network services, specializing in Ethernet and transport data networking, Internet access, local and long distance voice, VoIP and security, to enterprise organizations and communications services companies throughout the U.S.  As a leading provider of integrated and converged network solutions, Time Warner Telecom delivers customers overall economic value, quality, service, and improved business productivity.

The $7.9 million variance was due to higher revenues from byproducts, premiums and processing fee as well as better recoveries partially offset by a stronger Canadian dollar and lower volumes of zinc metal sales. \b \bThe Fund makes a portion of its sales based on the average price from the previous month (month prior pricing). This form of pricing is often used for those customers where cash-in-advance terms have been negotiated as a way to manage the Fund's liquidity position and credit exposure. In a market where zinc prices are rising, a portion of the Fund's revenues will lag behind the higher zinc prices; while in a market where zinc prices are falling, a portion of the Fund's revenues will benefit from higher zinc prices from the month prior. Month prior pricing sales are closely monitored to ensure sales volumes do not vary significantly from month to month. In 2006, month prior pricing had a negative impact of approximately $10 million on the Fund's Net Revenues as the zinc price rose from 83 cents per pound US in December 2005 to US$2.00 per pound in December 2006. \b \bSelling, general and administration (\"SG&A\") costs for 2006 were similar at $18.8 million, compared to $18.5 million in 2005. \b \bThe foreign exchange loss for 2006 was $5.6 million, compared to a loss of $3.1 million for 2005. The increase was the result of a foreign exchange loss in the fourth quarter. The Fund maintains cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable in US dollars. \b \bAmortization and reclamation was $28.6 million in 2006 compared to $29.4 million recorded in 2005. The decrease was due to changes in the expected timing of future reclamation spending. This has resulted in a reduction in the present value of future site restoration and reclamation liabilities. \b \bIn 2006, net interest expense was $17.8 million compared to $11.1 million in 2005 due to an increase in interest rates and debt outstanding as a result of higher working capital requirements, and higher interest expense related to delayed concentrate payments. \b \bMinority interest in earnings of subsidiaries in 2006 was $11.1 million up from $10.9 million in 2005 due to the higher earnings of the Fund. \b \b \b    << \b    -------------------------------- \b    (1) Cash Generated is not a measure defined by generally accepted \b    accounting principles. Cash Generated as calculated by the Fund may not \b    be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. See \b    Distribution Policy, Distributable Cash and Operating Reserve. \b    >> \b \b \bConsolidated Net Earnings (Fourth quarter 2006 compared \b \b to fourth quarter 2005) \b \bNet Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 totalled $67.3 million, compared to $68.8 million in the same period of 2005. The $1.5 million decrease was due to lower volumes of zinc metal sales and a stronger dollar offset by higher premiums, byproduct revenue and processing fee. \b \bAs we mentioned in the third quarter press release, stronger zinc prices were expected to negatively impact fourth quarter results due to the impact of month prior pricing. For the quarter, this pricing had a negative impact of approximately $5 million on the Fund's Net Revenues as the zinc price rose from US$1.54 per pound in September 2006 to US$2.00 per pound in December 2006. \b \bSG&A costs for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $4.9 million, compared to $4 million in the same quarter a year ago due to higher insurance costs. \b \bThe foreign exchange loss in the fourth quarter of 2006 of $6.1 million compared to a foreign exchange loss of $0.5 million for the same period in 2005. The $5.6 million increase was due to the impact of a weakening Canadian dollar on the Fund's net monetary liability. The foreign exchange loss was partially offset by an estimated $4.0 million increase in the value of in-process and finished inventory. This increase in value is realized in Net Revenues as the metal is sold to customers. \b \bAmortization and reclamation costs in the quarter were $6.9 million, a decrease of $0.5 million from the same period in 2005. \b \bMinority interest in earnings of subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $1.3 million, down from $3.4 million in 2005 due to the lower earnings of the Fund. \b \bPRODUCTION AND SALES \b \b=------------------- \b \bZinc metal production in 2006 was 266,427 tonnes, compared to 272,418 tonnes in 2005. Production in 2006 was negatively impacted by equipment failure in the first quarter, and by a lower concentrate grade and a new  process to recover copper in the second half of the year. In the fourth quarter of 2006, zinc metal production was 68,147 tonnes, compared to 69,002 tonnes in the same period of 2005. \b \bFor 2007, production is forecast to be 275,000 tonnes. \b \bWith high zinc prices in 2006, an alternate processing method was implemented to recover zinc from our jarosite pond water. In the first nine months of 2006, $8.8 million of additional revenue was generated from this process. During the fourth quarter of 2006, no additional water was processed. A further $1.8 million was generated from a project to increase zinc recoveries. Approximately $3-4 million of additional revenue is expected in the first half of 2007 from zinc recovered from the jarosite pond water. \b \bOffsetting this positive for zinc recoveries was higher internal zinc consumption. The new process to treat copper cake without arsenic negatively impacts zinc metal production by requiring higher zinc dust consumption. A program is currently in place to address this issue. \b \bThe softening in US demand for zinc negatively impacted the Fund's sales in 2006. The combination of a slowdown in the US automobile market as well as destocking at the steel mills negatively impacted zinc sales in December. For the year, sales of zinc metal totalled 259,446 tonnes, 5% lower than the 271,830 tonnes sold in 2005.

In summer 2006, when Philips announced the divestment of 80.1% of its semiconductor business to a consortium of private equity firms, Kleisterlee said that the transformation was almost done and that he now wants the company to grow \"like hell.\" But the company's fourth-quarter sales disappointed analysts somewhat. \u001d  Still analysts welcomed news of Kleisterlee's reappointment. \u001d  \"So far Mr. Kleisterlee has done a good job,\" said Frits de Vries of Rabo Securities, adding that he has to prove now that he can make the company grow as well. \u001d  \"This gives him the time to do so,\" said De Vries. \u001d  De Vries said the proposed reappointment is \"all-in-all good news\" and rates Philips shares at buy. \u001d  Wim de Kleuver, chairman of the Supervisory Board of Royal Philips Electronics, said in a statement: \"In the light of the importance of continuity in the successful implementation of the company's strategy, the Supervisory Board has deemed it desirable to ask Kleisterlee to stay on as President & CEO beyond that date.\" \u001d  Kleisterlee has been President & CEO of Philips since April 2001. \u001d  Philips' Supervisory Board will also propose to the meeting of shareholders, which will be held March 29, the reappointment of Gottfried Dutine, Executive Vice-President of Philips and a member of the Board of Management for four years. \u001d  The General Meeting of Shareholders will also be asked to appoint Steve Rusckowski, CEO of Philips Medical Systems, as a member of the Board of Management. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board will propose Heino von Prondzynski as a member of the Philips Supervisory Board. \u001d  Philips shares closed at EUR29.53 on Friday. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.philips.com \u001d  By Mathijs Schiffers and Stefan Simons; Dow Jones Newswires; +31-20-5890270; mathijs.schiffers@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 02:55 ET (07:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"335f8f32893c53372a554b112aa0c20d","symR":["MLX.T","CA5729041007"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Marsulex Cut To Buy By Fraser Mackenzie >MLX.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T17:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MLX.T","CA5729041007"],"IndustryCodes":["POL","SVC"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 12:05 ET (17:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"338cb98b399af04c7e4f697ec548fc2a","symR":["KKGB.KZ","KZ1C00400016"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Fitch Affirms Kazakhstan's Kazkommertsbank BB+","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T09:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KKGB.KZ","KZ1C00400016"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK"],"Story":"\b \b   The following is a press release from Fitch Ratings: \b \u001d  Fitch Ratings has today affirmed Kazakhstan-based Kazkommertsbank's (\"KKB\") ratings at foreign currency Issuer Default 'BB+', Short-term foreign currency 'B', local currency Issuer Default 'BBB-' (BBB minus), Short-term local currency 'F3',  Individual 'C/D' and Support '3'. The Outlook on the foreign currency Issuer Default rating (\"IDR\") remains Positive and that on the local currency IDR Stable. \u001d  The Issuer Default, Short-term and Support ratings reflect the moderate probability of support being forthcoming, in case of need, from the Kazakhstani authorities. This is based on the bank's substantial domestic franchise, and takes into account the authorities' ability to provide support, as reflected in the sovereign IDRs of foreign currency 'BBB' and local currency 'BBB+'. The Positive Outlook on KKB's foreign currency IDR reflects that on the sovereign foreign currency IDR. The Stable Outlook on the local currency IDR reflects the fact that, given Fitch's current view of the authorities' propensity to support the country's largest banks, the support floor for the bank's IDRs is not expected to go higher than 'BBB-' (BBB minus), even should the sovereign be upgraded. \u001d  The Individual rating reflects the risks inherent in the bank's rapid loan growth, which was particularly strong in Q406 following the receipt of new capital. It also reflects KKB's high construction sector and individual borrower concentrations and potential structural risks stemming from the high reliance on external funding. However, the rating also considers KKB's strong franchise, long track record of sound performance, reasonable asset quality to date and satisfactory liquidity and capitalisation. \u001d  A reduction in loan concentrations and a moderation of growth rates would be positive for KKB's stand-alone credit strength, while higher loan impairment or further margin pressure would be negatives. That said, Fitch views any changes in the Individual rating as unlikely in the near term. \u001d  KKB is one of the two largest commercial banks in Kazakhstan, with a core franchise in the large corporate segment. It is now trying to increase the proportion of SME and retail business. A large minority stake is held by a Kazakhstani businessman, together with associates. Participation of portfolio investors is also substantial. \u001d  Contact: James Watson, Alexei Kechko, Moscow, Tel: +7 (495) 956 9901. \u001d  Media Relations: Julian Dennison, London, Tel: +44 20 7862 4080; Alla Izmailova, Moscow, Tel: +7 495 956 9903. \u001d  Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.

A London-based spokesman said the company's board will meet shortly \"and come back with a response in due course.\" He declined to elaborate. \u001d  But the company's Chief Executive Henrique Granadeiro offered an initial view: \"Sonaecom didn't find diamonds in PT's headquarters, but rather a strong set of earnings,\" he said on state-owned RTP2 television late Thursday, referring to previous remarks by Sonaecom that unless diamonds were found under PT's head office, the company wouldn't raise its bid. \u001d  Last week, PT reported a 16% rise in fourth-quarter net profit to EUR339.8 million, bolstered by strength in its broadband business. \u001d  Three key shareholders representing about 12.15% of PT were quick to reject Sonaecom's new offer: Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo, or BES, an 8.08% shareholder; investor Jose Berardo with 2.07%; and Ongoing Strategy Investments, holding a 2% stake. \u001d  BES added that it would also vote against the removal of a voting-limitation poison pill at a PT extraordinary general meeting scheduled for March 2. \u001d  BES has been a persistent thorn in the side of Sonaecom and had been rumored to be trying to form a shareholder alliance to block the bid. \u001d  Sonaecom's offer, which must be approved by a minimum 50.01% of PT shareholders, expires March 9. The company has said it won't proceed with the offer unless the EGM votes by a minimum two-thirds majority to abolish the poison pill. \u001d  Other analysts agree with the hardline stance of BES, Berardo and Ongoing. \u001d  Nuno Vieira, analyst at Portuguese bank BCP in Lisbon, said: \"Given our fair value for PT (EUR11.5 per share), we recommend its shareholders not to accept the tender offer.\"   Nevertheless, investors appeared to welcome Sonaecom's improved bit, which comes a year after it first tabled an indicative EUR9.50 offer. \u001d  Around 1406 GMT Friday, PT shares were flat at EUR10.20, retreating from midday highs of EUR10.40. \u001d  A Lisbon-based trader attributed this to the fact that Sonaecom's bid cannot legally be raised further. \u001d  Sonaecom is prevented from further raising its offer according to Portuguese takeover law, which, while recently abolished in favor of European regulations, is still valid for this transaction. \u001d  Sonaecom shareholders were the big winners, with their stock jumping EUR1.36, or 21.4%, to EUR7.73. \u001d  BPI analyst Ricardo Seara said the additional EUR1.1 billion cash put up by Sonaecom could be offset by mobile communications synergies and the value of PT's stake in Vivo (VIVO4.BR), which would be likely to be sold to Telefonica (TEF.MC) after a takeover. \u001d  Vivo is Brazil's biggest mobile operator by customers, in which PT holds a 50% stake. \u001d  If its takeover is successful, Sonaecom will boast about 70% of Portugal's mobile subscribers - the highest concentration in any European market. \u001d  Sonaecom's financial advisers are Banco Santander de Negocios Portugal, JPMorgan PLC and Perella Weinberg Partners UK. \u001d  Portugal Telecom's advisers are BES, Citigroup Inc. (C), Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER), and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS).

Mago is one of UraMin's two South African black economic empowerment partners and JVCo is the local company in which UraMin's South African interests are housed. Prior to the transaction UraMin held a 65 per cent stake in the South African venture. \b \bUraMin's acquisition of Mago's stake in JVCo represents a final resolution to the disagreements which have persisted between UraMin and Mago since the venture's establishment. In terms of the agreement JVCo will also relinquish to Mago the entitlement to benefit from prospecting rights and applications for prospecting rights in the Mpumalanga and Limpopo Provinces of South Africa. JVCo, however, will retain all rights, titles and interests in and to those prospecting rights and applications for prospecting rights in the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape Provinces. These include the Ryst Kuil Channel, Riet Kuil and Tanqua projects. \b \bIan Stalker, UraMin's Chief Executive Officer, said 'The agreement with Mago will enable UraMin to increase its stake in the South African venture from 65% to 74%, while resolving all differences and disagreements in relation to our South African business. Of the 26.25% interest in JVCo purchased from Mago, shares representing 17.25% of the company will be placed with attorneys in trust pending their on-sale to another suitable black economic empowerment partner. UraMin will retain the balance of 9%, thereby increasing its stake in the exciting South African project to 74%.' \b \bSam Jonah, Chairman said 'The acquisition of this additional interest in our South African joint venture maximises the benefit to shareholders from the development of the Ryst Kuil uranium project while at the same providing the opportunity for new black empowered partners to take an active role in the development of what has the potential to become South Africa's first primary uranium mine. With the first phase of the Ryst Kuil RC drilling programme about to begin and with feasibility study engineers to be appointed shortly we can look forward to an exciting period of growth in South Africa.' \b \bGLOSSARY \b \b \b    << \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    Feasibility     a comprehensive study of a deposit in which all \b    study           geological, engineering, operating, economic and other \b                    relevant factors are considered in sufficient detail for \b                    it to reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision \b                    by a financial institution to finance the development of \b                    the deposit for mineral production \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    Lb              Pound \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    Uranium         heavy silvery-white metallic element found in several \b                    minerals, notably uraninite and carnotite \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    >> \b \b \bBackground Information: \b \bUraMin (www.uramin.com) was founded in February 2005 and its shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol 'UMN'. The Company was established to acquire and develop mineral properties, predominantly uranium. The Company currently has working capital of approximately US$95 million and a market capitalization of approximately US$1 billion on an undiluted basis. \b \bUraMin is currently focusing on the development of its advanced exploration projects at Trekkopje in Namibia, Bakouma in the Central African Republic and Ryst Kuil in South Africa. Through the South African joint venture, UraMin also enjoys additional prospecting license applications for important uranium deposits in the Karoo, South Africa. No assurance can be given that remaining applications for the prospecting rights in the Ryst Kuil Channel or elsewhere in South Africa will be successful. \b \bThe Ryst Kuil Channel is located in the Karoo Basin of South Africa. The Karoo formations which host the uranium and molybdenum mineralisation consist of alternating units of sandstone and mudstone with the mineralisation being largely restricted to the sandstone units. The uranium mineralisation appears to have been deposited as irregular shaped pods or lenses that range in size from a few metres to 200m in width and from about 10m to several hundred metres long. The average thickness of the mineralised pods is about 1m. The Ryst Kuil Channel has been extensively explored most notably by Esso Minerals Africa in the 1970s. \b \bForward-Looking Statements: \b \bThis press release contains statements that are \"forward-looking\".

(MRK) last year. \u001d  Garnier suggested in an interview Friday that the European review of Cervarix was taking longer than the nine-month review for Merck's Gardasil because GlaxoSmithKline's data file was incomplete when it was submitted to European regulators in March 2006. U.K.-based GlaxoSmithKline was about two to three years behind Merck in developing a cervical-cancer vaccine, Garnier said, but European regulators told GlaxoSmithKline to submit its incomplete data anyway, then file the rest later. Gardasil was submitted to European regulators around December 2005 and the European Commission approved it in September 2006; Gardasil is marketed there by a joint venture of Merck, Whitehouse Station, N.J., and Sanofi-Aventis (SNY) of France. \u001d  \"We need to file the last piece of data, and we can get it reviewed and hopefully everything will go smoothly then,\" Garnier told Dow Jones Newswires after speaking at a health-care conference here organized by students at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. A Merck spokesperson couldn't immediately be reached. \u001d  Garnier declined to estimate when European regulators might take action on the Cervarix application. In the U.S., Merck's Gardasil received Food and Drug Administration approval in June. GlaxoSmithKline expects to submit its Cervarix application to the FDA around April, Garnier reiterated. GlaxoSmithKline is hoping to receive \"priority review\" for the application, which would shorten the approval process to about six months from 10 months, but Garnier said \"this is entirely up to the FDA.\" \u001d  Merck has recorded at least $235 million in Gardasil revenue since the drug went on sale last year, and for the time being it has the market to itself. But Merck's head start hasn't discouraged Garnier. He said GlaxoSmithKline hopes to distinguish Cervarix from Gardasil in several ways, including promoting it as having broader protection against the virus strains that cause cervical cancer, and getting approval to market Cervarix to women through middle age. The FDA approved Gardasil for girls and women ages 9 to 26. \u001d  Merck has previously said it's studying Gardasil's effectiveness in women older than 26, and whether it offers broader protection against virus strains than what is currently in the product's label. \u001d  GlaxoSmithKline last month said it would conduct a head-to-head patient trial comparing Cervarix with Gardasil. The approximately 1,000-woman study is designed to measure immune responses for each vaccine. \u001d  - By Peter Loftus, Dow Jones Newswires; 215-656-8289; peter.loftus@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 01:45 ET (06:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"371421fd88717e810e11affa4db39445","symR":["SCC.T","CA81234D1096"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Sears Canada Advised By Breville Of A Potential Safety Hazard Relating To The Breville Moda Blender","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T15:56:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SCC.T","CA81234D1096"],"IndustryCodes":["RTB","RTS","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  TORONTO, Feb. 19 /CNW/ - Sears Canada has been advised by Breville(R) of a potential safety hazard relating to the Breville Moda Blender(TM).

With a drop in LME zinc stocks from 393,550 tonnes at the end of 2005 to 90,475 tonnes at year end 2006, stocks are at a critically low level - 3 days of consumption. LME prices responded to this tightness, rising from an average of US$0.63 per pound in 2005 to US$1.49 per pound in 2006. \b \bThe tightness in the zinc market was reflected in premiums. For 2006, they averaged 7.2 cents US per pound, compared to 6 cents per pound in 2005. For the fourth quarter of 2006, premiums rose to 7.5 cents US per pound compared to 6.7 cents US per pound for the same period in 2005. \b \bThe target for 2007 premiums has been increased to 10 cents US per pound, reflecting expected realizations from spot and contract sales. \b \bBYPRODUCTS \b \b=--------- \b \bCopper fundamentals began to weaken in May of 2006, reflecting the signs that the physical market was easing. By year end, total exchange stocks of copper had increased to 252,790 tonnes from 156,251 tonnes a year in 2005. The market ended 2006 with a small surplus (60,000 tonnes), and it is expected to have a further surplus of 240,000 tonnes in 2007. LME copper prices in 2006 averaged US$3.05 per pound compared to US$1.70 per pound in 2005. \b \bIn 2006, copper prices were 183%, respectively higher than in 2005. This increase explains the substantial increase in 2006 byproduct revenues to $35.7 million from $24.6 million in 2005. Sulphuric acid netbacks were weaker than in 2005 because of higher transportation costs. The average realized netback in 2006 was US$16.90 per tonne compared to $20.50 per tonne in 2005. For the fourth quarter, byproduct revenues were largely unchanged from a year earlier at $8.2 million. \b \bThe Fund's target for premiums is subject to various risks and uncertainties. The assumptions can be found in the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below. \b \bCAPITAL EXPENDITURES \b \b=------------------- \b \bIn 2006, the Fund initiated a number of capital projects to improve productivity and increase revenues over the next few years. The completion of the projects is now scheduled for March 2007, due to difficulties to purchase specific stainless steel products. \b \bFor 2006, capital expenditures rose to $22.2 million from $15.8 million in 2005 as a result of the revenue generating projects being developed. Roughly $15 million was sustaining capital and $7.2 million was invested in revenue generating projects. Capital expenditures exceeded the $21.5 million budget because of higher stainless steel costs for some of the components. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $7.4 million compared to $5.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. \b \bFor 2007, capital spending is forecasted at $22 million - $16 million will be spent on sustaining capital and $6 million will be for revenue generating projects. The focus of these expenditures is to increase zinc concentrate throughput towards the maximum available concentrate supply under the terms of the Supply and Processing Agreement with Falconbridge. The Fund currently processes approximately 535,000 tonnes, which are 15,000 tonnes below the Supply and Processing Agreement's maximum level. Closing the gap to 550,000 tonnes will increase processing fees, and revenue from zinc premiums and byproducts. The extra capital expenditures will be allocated toward de-bottlenecking the plant to increase capacity, with a potential to generate an additional $4 million in incremental cash flow starting in 2008. \b \bIn 2006, the Fund participated in Hydro-Quebec's \"Industrial Initiatives Program - Major Customers\" program. The Fund recognized $56,000 in the form of incentives during the fourth quarter and $1.8 million for the year. These incentives have been recorded as a reduction of property, plant and equipment as they relate to capital expenditures incurred to reduce electricity consumption. In 2007, the Fund is expecting a similar level of grants, providing all of our projects are approved. \b \bThe Fund's target for capital spending is subject to various risks and uncertainties. The assumptions can be found in the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below. \b \bCash Flows, Liquidity and Capital Resources \b \bCash realized from operations, before changes in non-cash working capital for 2006, was $73.2 million compared to $74.6 million at the end of 2005. For the fourth quarter of 2006, cash realized from operations, before changes in non-cash working capital was $12.6 million compared to $21.8 million for the same periods in 2005. \b \bDuring 2006, non-cash working capital increased by $52.9 million, due to higher zinc prices. Zinc prices impacted the value of in-process and finished product inventories. The average monthly LME zinc price rose to US$2.00 per pound in December 2006 from US$0.83 per pound in December 2005. \b \bFor 2006, capital expenditures rose to $22.2 million from $15.8 million in 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006, they were $7.4 million compared to $5.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. \b \bDistributions paid to unitholders in the fourth quarter were $12.8 million, unchanged from the same period in 2005. Distributions to unitholders for both 2006 and 2005 were $51 million. \b \bThe Fund has a Revolving Facility in place that is used for general corporate purposes, including financing working capital. On June 30, 2006, the Revolving Facility was extended to May 3, 2008 and was increased from $65 million to $100 million to finance the higher working capital levels. The Revolving Facility was extended at essentially the same terms that were in place with the prior Facility. As a result of the high zinc price, the Fund is now operating at the limit of its credit facilities and is currently receiving credit from Falconbridge by way of delayed payment terms. The Fund continues to review its options with respect to financing its working capital as well as monitor the impact of the changing zinc pricing environment on its working capital requirements. \b \bFluctuations in working capital balances as a result of operations are generally funded by or used to repay the Revolving Facility. During the quarter, $158.7 million of debt was drawn and $163.5 million was repaid related to the fluctuations in working capital. \b \bAt December 31, 2006, the Fund's total debt was $244.5 million, up from $180.4 million at the end of December 2005. \b \bDistribution Policy \b \bThe Fund makes monthly distributions to its Unitholders based on the monthly Distributable Cash (see \"Distributable Cash\" below) declarations. The Fund's goal is to provide stable monthly distributions and will seek to increase distributions through sustainable improvements, such as operating efficiencies and revenue enhancing opportunities. \b \bThe Fund announced today the monthly cash distribution for the month of February 2007 of $0.085 per unit. The distribution will be payable on March 26, 2007 to unitholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2007. \b \bThe schedule below sets out the history of the Fund's cash distributions for the past six months: \b \b \b    << \b \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    RECORD DATE              PAYMENT DATE              DISTRIBUTION PER UNIT \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    February 28, 2007        March 26, 2007                   8.5 cents \b    January 31, 2007         February 26, 2007                8.5 cents \b    December 31, 2006        January 25, 2007                 8.5 cents \b    November 30, 2006        December 27, 2006                8.5 cents \b    October 31, 2006         November 27, 2006                8.5 cents \b    September 30, 2006       October 25, 2006                 8.5 cents \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    >> \b \b \bIn order to meet the Fund's goal to provide a stable monthly distribution the Fund utilizes a notional operating reserve. In a period during which Cash Generated is greater than the distribution declared, the operating reserve will increase. In a period during which Cash Generated is less than the distribution declared, the operating reserve will decrease. The operating reserve provides flexibility so that the Fund can maintain a stable, monthly distribution, while adhering to the Fund's trust indentures and debt covenants. \b \bDistributable Cash \b \bDistributable Cash is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is dependant upon the definition as contained in the trust indentures establishing the Fund. Distributable Cash under the Fund's indenture is based on 100% of the net earnings adjusted to account for non-cash transactions such as amortization, reclamation and minority interest, reduced by additions to capital assets, site restoration expenditures, reasonable reserves and repayment of long-term debt. Fluctuations in working capital balances as a result of operations are generally funded by or used to repay the Revolving Facility. \b \bCash Generated is defined as Distributable Cash before changes in operating reserves. Distributable Cash as calculated by the Fund may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The Distributable Cash for the period is as follows: \b \b \b    << \b \b                                         Three     Three    Twelve    Twelve \b                                        months    months    months    months \b                                        ending    ending    ending    ending \b                                      Dec. 31,  Dec. 31,  Dec. 31,  Dec. 31, \b                                          2006      2005      2006      2005 \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b    Net earnings                        $4,015   $10,334   $33,190   $32,809 \b    Add: \b      Amortization, and reclamation      6,938     7,443    28,612    29,397 \b      Minority interest in earnings      1,338     3,444    11,063    10,936 \b      Loss from sale of assets             380       193       624       542 \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 13:26 ET (18:26 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"385e8224e6189ae290c72e669d6f1240","symR":["METH"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Methode Electronics, Inc. to Announce Third Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results on Friday, March 2, 2007","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T16:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["METH"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\bCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2007-- \u001d  Methode Electronics, Inc.

Tree growth into overhead utility lines, fallen tree limbs and uprooted trees are the most common causes for service interruptions and tend to involve more cleanup and repair, resulting in longer service interruptions to customers. \b \u001d  Nearly 3,000 miles of aerial electric lines will be trimmed this year as part of PECO's regularly scheduled tree-trimming cycle. In addition to tree trimming, PECO uses a variety of methods to control vegetation growth in and around its facilities and lines, including mowing, herbicides, and removal of hazardous or incompatible trees. Trained professionals from Asplundh Tree Experts, who consider the overall health of the trees as they trim using as few cuts as possible, perform PECO's trimming work. \b \u001d  PECO's tree maintenance helps the company prevent service interruptions, reduce the length of the interruptions when they do occur, and improve service in areas that experience more outages than the regional average.

Net income attributable to common shares for the quarter ended 31 December 2006 was C$128 million, a decrease of C$4 million, or 3 per cent, compared with C$132 million for the same period in 2005. The fourth quarter of 2005 included a recovery of C$14 million in our general allowance for credit losses and a one time reduction of C$14 million in deposit guarantee fees following a transfer pricing settlement with the Canada Revenue Agency. Excluding the impact of these items and the related income tax effects, net income attributable to common shares for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 19.6 per cent higher than the same quarter in 2005. \b\b \b\bCommenting on the results, Lindsay Gordon, President and Chief Executive Officer, said: \"Results for the fourth quarter and for the year were good, reflecting strong growth in our commercial banking business and good momentum in our wealth management businesses. Net interest income was higher from strong loan growth, despite a competitive pricing environment. Non-interest revenues were higher on increased investment administration fees, higher credit fees and higher investment gains. Total non-interest expenses for the year increased as we continued to invest in our businesses, while our efficiency ratio also improved. \b\b \b\b\"Our focus for 2007 will be to continue this momentum and build for sustained growth by continuing to reinvest in key businesses and leveraging the Group's global distribution network and systems platforms. Business transformation initiatives will be undertaken to further improve efficiency, while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers. We will also continue our marketing efforts to build on the significant progress made on the awareness of the HSBC brand within Canada.\" \b\b \b\bNet interest income \b\b \b\bNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was C$291 million, an increase of C$22 million, or 8.2 per cent, from the same quarter in 2005, driven primarily by growth in the balance sheet across all our customers groups. Average interest earning assets were C$50.1 billion, compared with C$45.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2005. Net interest margin, as a percentage of average interest earning assets decreased modestly to 2.30 per cent from 2.36 per cent. \b\b \b\bNet interest income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was C$9 million higher than the previous quarter, primarily due to growth in deposits and loans. Average interest earning assets were C$1.7 billion higher than the previous quarter. Average deposits were C$2.3 billion higher than the previous quarter and average loans were C$0.8 billion higher. \b\b \b\bNet interest income for the year ended 31 December 2006 was C$1,115 million, an increase of C$105 million, or 10.4 per cent, from C$1,010 million for 2005 driven by growth in the balance sheet, partially offset by lower net interest margins due to the competitive pricing environment. Average interest earning assets were C$47.9 billion for 2006 compared with C$42.6 billion for 2005. Although prime rates increased during the year, net interest margins as a percentage of average interest earning assets decreased from 2.37 per cent in 2005 to 2.33 per cent in 2006. This was primarily as a result of competitive pricing, particularly in personal products such as residential mortgages and deposits. \b\b \b\bNon-interest revenue \b\b \b\bNon-interest revenue for the fourth quarter of 2006 was C$168 million, C$27 million or 19.2 per cent higher, compared with the fourth quarter of 2005. Growth in non-interest revenue benefited from higher investment administration fees as a result of growth in our wealth management businesses as well as an appreciation in equity markets. Higher securitization income, increases in the value of our investments in private equity funds and higher capital markets fees in our Global Investment Banking business also benefited non-interest revenue. \b\b \b\bNon-interest revenue for the fourth quarter of 2006 was C$8 million higher than the previous quarter due to higher capital markets fees and increases in the value of our investments in private equity funds as well as higher securitization income. \b\b \b\bFor the year ended 31 December 2006, non-interest revenue was C$651 million, C$81 million or 14.2 per cent higher, compared with the same period in 2005. Non-interest revenue in 2006 benefited from higher investment administration fees, higher securitization income, higher credit fees as a result of higher volumes in Acceptances, higher Global Investment Banking revenues and increases in the value of our investments in private equity funds. These were partially offset by lower immigrant investor program fees, which are dependant on the number of approvals from government agencies. \b\b \b\bNon-interest expenses and operating efficiency \b\b \b\bNon-interest expenses for the fourth quarter of 2006 were C$236 million, an increase of C$31 million or 15.1 per cent compared with the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding the C$14 million reduction of deposit guarantee fees made in the fourth quarter of 2005, non-interest expenses increased by 7.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with the fourth quarter of 2005. Salaries and benefits in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased by C$13 million from the same period in 2005 due to an expanding workforce to meet growth initiatives, particularly in our wealth management businesses. Also, higher incentive compensation reflected higher revenues. \b\b \b\bNon-interest expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006 were C$23 million higher than the previous quarter primarily due to higher premises costs, arising from the change in estimate of the useful life of improvements made to leased properties, and higher marketing expenditure on the HSBC brand. \b\b \b\bFor the year ended 31 December 2006, non-interest expenses were C$906 million, an increase of C$82 million, or 10.0 per cent, compared with C$824 million for 2005. Salaries and benefits expenses were C$61 million higher due to a larger work force and higher stock based compensation resulting from a C$9 million charge in the second quarter 2006, arising from the waiver of the total shareholders return-related performance condition in respect of the 2003 awards under the HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan. Incentive compensation was also higher due to higher revenues. Other expenses were C$12 million higher due to increased marketing spend on further developing the HSBC brand and a higher business tax expense due to a recovery in 2005 on the successful resolution of certain commodity tax issues. These were partially offset by a lower deposit guarantee fee expense due to the discontinuation of the HSBC Group's guarantee on new deposits subsequent to June 2005. \b\b \b\bIncome taxes \b\b \b\bThe effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 33.2 per cent, compared with 30.0 per cent, for the fourth quarter in 2005. The tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2005 was lower due to a year-to-date tax expense reduction recorded on the resolution of the deductibility of the deposit guarantee fee expense for the years 2002 to 2005. \b\b \b\bThe effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased by 1.7 per cent from the previous quarter due to a decrease in certain non-deductible expenses. \b\b \b\bThe effective income tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2006 was 35.6 per cent, compared with 33.5 percent in 2005. The effective rate was lower in 2005 due to benefits from changes in the net realizable value of certain future income tax assets and the resolution of the amount of the deductibility of the deposit guarantee fee expense for certain years. Also, lower corporate income tax rates enacted by the federal government budget in 2006 resulted in a write down of our future income tax asset and the expense related to the 2003 option awards for stock based compensation recognized in 2006 is not deductible for tax, thereby increasing the 2006 effective income tax rate. \b\b \b\bCredit quality and provision for credit losses \b\b \b\u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 04:02 ET (09:02 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"3af86d4c27d160fc364b47f8112da82b","symR":["SGI.T","CA82669C1032"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": SignalEnergy Inc.

(\"Signal\" or the \"Corporation\") provides an update to its operations and announces, shareholder approval of the Plan of Arrangement, a $30 million distribution to shareholders as part of the Arrangement, and a change of name to Fortress Energy Inc. \b \bOperations Update \b \bSignal previously announced a $15 million capital budget under which all drilling operations are now complete. The Corporation drilled 11 development wells, 2 exploration wells and performed 7 recompletions all in the Ladyfern area. The capital expenditure program has resulted in 8 new wells which will be tied in by the end of the first quarter and will enable the Corporation to bring 420 boe/d of new gas production on stream. The Corporation is pursuing upgrading the processing capability at the Ladyfern facility to include refrigeration to allow the processing of greater volumes of liquids rich gas. \b \bThrough its exploration efforts the Corporation has identified two new gas accumulations at the Mearon South and Square Creek areas. In the Square Creek area the Corporation completed one well that was drilled in 2006 which tested 1.5 mmcf/d and has drilled an additional well to delineate the pool. The second delineation well has demonstrated controlled flow rate of 4.6 mmcf/d over a 72 hour period. The Corporation has elected to drill a third well in 2007 to further evaluate the accumulation. Signal owns a 50% working interest in the wells and has an interest in 26 gross (13 net) sections of land in the area. \b \bIn Mearon South the Corporation has an interest in 14 gross (4.5 net) sections of land and has recompleted two wells drilled in 2006 one of which tested gas rates 400 mcf/d establishing the existence of a new pool. Further drilling in the area is planned in 2008. \b \bThe Corporation owns an interest in 4 gross (2 net) sections of land in the Velma area where two Blue Sky wells in which it owns a 50% working interest were drilled and completed in 2006. The wells are capable of producing in excess of 200 boe/d net production. Production from these wells had been subject to a common carrier application, however the decision did not allow the Corporation access to competitors' processing facilities. As a consequence the Corporation is examining its alternatives in order to bring the production on stream. This may include constructing a pipeline to allow the gas to be processed at the Corporation's Ladyfern facility. \b \bProduction in January was approximately 780 boe/d. In addition approximately 70 boe/d was shut-in due to facility constraints in the Ladyfern area. \b \bPlan of Arrangement and $30 Million Cash Distribution \b \bAt the Special General Meeting of Shareholders held on February 15, 2007, Shareholders voted 99% in favour of the Arrangement and the reorganization of the Corporation. Accordingly, the Corporation is proceeding with court approval of the Arrangement on February 20, 2007 and the Arrangement is expected to be completed shortly thereafter. Under the election available under the Arrangement, Shareholders holding 60,481,275 shares elected to receive cash. \b \bTherefore such Shareholders will have their elections pro-rated to the maximum of $30,000,000 of available cash on the basis of $1.30 per share. The balance shall be satisfied, along with Shareholders who elected or were deemed to elect to receive the share consideration, by the issuance of one share of Fortress Energy Inc. for each five Signal shares currently held. \b \bNew Name - Fortress Energy Inc. \b \bAs part of the Arrangement and reorganization of the Corporation, the business and operations of the Corporation will be carried on under the name Fortress Energy Inc. As stated, it is expected that the Arrangement will be completed on or about February 20, 2007 and trading will begin under the name Fortress Energy Inc. thereafter subject to compliance with TSX policies. The new trading symbol will be \"FEI\". \b \bBOE Presentation \b \bNatural gas reserves and volumes recorded in thousand cubic feet are converted to barrels of oil equivalent (\"boe\") on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (\"mcf\") of gas to one barrel (\"bbl\") of oil. The term \"barrels of oil equivalent\" may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf to 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalent conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalent at the wellhead. \b \bCaution to Reader \b \bThis news release contains forward-looking statements and the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, as there can be no assurance that the plans, intentions or expectations upon which they are based will occur. This specifically includes estimated volumes and timing of future production, business plans for exploration, development and drilling, anticipated budget costs for items including drilling, plant and equipment and the timing of the completion of the Arrangement and reorganization of the Corporation.

(NYSE: FRK), a leading producer of construction aggregates, cement, concrete and concrete products in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states, today announced that they have signed a definitive agreement for Vulcan Materials to acquire Florida Rock in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $4.6 billion. \b \u001d  The acquisition, which has been unanimously approved by both companies' boards of directors, will significantly enhance Vulcan Materials' strategic position and long-term growth opportunities by greatly expanding its presence in attractive Florida markets and in other high-growth Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states. The combined company will have aggregates reserves totaling approximately 13.9 billion tons, an increase of more than 20% over Vulcan Materials' stand-alone aggregates reserves, and 2006 pro forma aggregates shipments of 300 million tons, an increase of approximately 18% compared to Vulcan Materials' stand-alone shipments. \b \u001d  Under the terms of the agreement, Vulcan Materials shareholders will receive one share of common stock in a new holding company (whose subsidiaries will be Vulcan Materials and Florida Rock) for each Vulcan Materials share. Florida Rock shareholders can elect to receive either 0.63 shares of the new holding company or $67.00 in cash for each Florida Rock share, subject to proration, to ensure that in the aggregate 70% of Florida Rock shares will be converted into cash and 30% of Florida Rock shares will be converted into stock. The transaction is intended to be non-taxable for Vulcan Materials shareholders and non-taxable for Florida Rock shareholders to the extent they receive stock. The total blended cash and stock consideration of $68.03 per share, based on the closing price of Vulcan Materials' stock on Friday, February 16, 2007, represents a premium of 45% for Florida Rock shareholders based on Friday's closing price of each company's stock. \b \u001d  Vulcan Materials Chairman and CEO, Don James said, \"This is a tremendous opportunity for Vulcan Materials and Florida Rock. We're taking two high performance companies and creating an even better company. Combining with Florida Rock further diversifies and broadens our reach and regional exposure, providing us with a significant presence in Florida - one of the fastest growing markets for aggregates in the U.S. - and bringing us approximately 2.5 billion tons of reserves in markets where reserves are increasingly scarce. The combined company will have enhanced earnings growth and a strong cash flow profile to reduce debt while maintaining Vulcan Materials' historical dividend practices and significantly increasing the dividend to Florida Rock shareholders.\" \b \u001d  \"We are extremely pleased to combine our organization with Vulcan Materials,\" said Florida Rock President and CEO, John Baker. \"We have great respect for Vulcan Materials' team and believe they offer an ideal business fit and a highly compatible culture to Florida Rock's. These are very complementary companies, and this is an excellent opportunity for our shareholders as well as our employees, many of whom could enjoy enhanced opportunities as part of an even stronger and more geographically diversified organization that has operations in key high-growth markets nationwide.\" \b \u001d  Following completion of the transaction, John Baker will join Vulcan Materials' Board of Directors and Tom Baker, Vice President, Cement and Aggregates, of Florida Rock, will become President of Vulcan Materials' new Florida Rock Division headquartered in Jacksonville, where he will oversee the company's consolidated operations in the state of Florida. Florida Rock's operations in Georgia, Virginia, Maryland and other states will be integrated into existing Vulcan Materials divisions. \b \u001d  Vulcan Materials expects to achieve annual pre-tax cost synergies of approximately $50 million. The transaction, which is anticipated to close in mid-year 2007, is expected to be neutral to Vulcan Materials' earnings in 2007 and accretive to earnings in 2008 and beyond. \b \u001d  Vulcan Materials has received a firm commitment from Goldman, Sachs & Co. to provide bridge financing for the transaction. Following the close of the transaction, Vulcan Materials will have approximately $3.7 billion in debt and a debt-to-capital ratio of approximately 50%. Vulcan Materials expects its significant operating cash flows will enable it to reduce its debt-to-capital ratio to 35-40% within three years of close, in line with its historic capital structure targets. The Company intends to maintain an investment grade rating. \b \u001d  The transaction is subject to the approval of a majority of Florida Rock shareholders, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The Baker family, which founded Florida Rock, has entered into a voting agreement to support the transaction. Following the close, Florida Rock shareholders will own approximately 12% of the combined company. \b \u001d  Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as financial advisor to Vulcan Materials and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as Vulcan Materials' legal counsel.

This year, small operators should be the solitary stars, although with less sparkle than a quarter ago, driven by takeover speculation and strong earnings expectations, while former national monopolies suffer from thinning profit margins. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  \"There's just so much money out there in private equity. Now they're looking at much bigger deals and these mid-sized European telecoms have come on their radar screens,\" said Philippe de Weck, a fund manager at Pictet & Cie in Geneva. \u001d  Private-equity group Blackstone, for one, said in November said it was looking at a stake in Telecom Italia (TI). Other possible targets in the sector include national incumbents whose governments are expected to sell shares this year. Lessening government involvement could make it easier to turn them into efficient private enterprises. Among analysts' picks: Greece's Hellenic Telecommunications Organization (OTE) and Sweden's TeliaSonera AB (TLSN.SK). \u001d  Shares of TeliaSonera has climbed 6.2% so far this year, while OTE has eased 2%. By comparison, the telecoms portion of the pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index has risen 4.6%, slightly better than the overall market. \u001d  Emerging-market operations are also attractive prey, with Western European firms keen to tap into rapid growth elsewhere to offset stagnant demand at home. \u001d  Vodafone Group PLC (VOD), which earlier this month said it agreed to buy 67% of Indian cell-phone operator Hutchison Essar, has said it is hoping to buy still more this year. Telekom Austria (TKA), Telenor (TELN) and France Telecom (FTE) are also shopping, according to Citigroup analysts, who say that operations in Vietnam and Serbia are attracting the European hunters. \u001d  Telenor last year took over formerly state-owned Mobi 63 of Serbia, one of the country's two mobile phone networks in the country along with Telekom Srbija. Telenor also has a \"representation office\" in Vietnam to explore the market, according to a company spokesman. A France Telecom spokesman declined to comment on the speculation, while Telekom Austria's spokespeople weren't immediately available for comment. \u001d  Investors likely will reward those firms that acquire real growth markets, rather than the ones simply looking to grab any available market share. \u001d  \"The market seems to be rewarding high-growth companies tapped into emerging markets,\" said James Enck, a European telecom analyst with Daiwa Securities SMBC Europe Ltd. \u001d  The sector's losers are likely to be bulky national incumbents, most of which are expected to remain high on analysts' sell lists this year. These companies face ever increasing competition and are the target of stringent European Commission antitrust regulations that are expected to slash profit margins. \u001d  \"The category with a lot of risk are the really big guys,\" warned Bruno Lippens, a fund manager at Robeco. \"I see more opportunities in niche players with a strong focus in one particular market.\" \u001d  Mr. Lippens said his favorite buys include Germany's Mobilcom AG (MOB.XE), which sells contracts for Germany's four mobile networks, and France's Bouygues SA (12050.FR), which operates one of France's mobile networks in addition to a number of non-telecom businesses. Both are expected to keep cutting away at national champions' Deutsche Telekom's and France Telekom's margins. \u001d  Mobilcom shares have risen 6.3% so far this year, while Bouygues has surged by more than 11%. \u001d  Deutsche Telekom is in the midst of a EUR3 billion upgrade of its broadband network in 50 German cities that will combine high-definition television, telephone and Internet service. But European regulators have ordered it to share this upgraded network with competitors, making the returns on this massive investment appear grimmer and grimmer. \u001d  The company in January issued its second profit warning in six months, blaming fierce competition in the German market and the weak dollar - Deutsche Telekom's (DT) T-Mobile USA is the fourth-largest mobile phone operator in the U.S. by subscribers. The stock has slipped 1.7% so far this year. \u001d  Instead, smaller competitors are expected to do well because they are considered better positions to cut costs, offer growing revenues and take advantage of new E.U. competition rules, which order dominant market players to share their networks with competitors. \u001d  Analysts and fund managers say their favorites in this category are Italian broadband company Fastweb SpA (FWB.MI), French multiservice provider Iliad SA (403591.FR) and Greek telecom and internet operator Forthnet SA (FORTH.AT). \u001d  These players in particular, and their peers in general, are giving entrenched incumbents serious competition with flexible structures that allow for fast cost-cutting and smarter marketing that that is winning over subscribers. \u001d  Fastweb has slipped 0.1%, Iliad has jumped 24% and Forthnet is down 1.3% so far this year. \u001d  One old monopolist that may also do well is Royal KPN NV (KPN).

Neeleman, the company's founder and chief executive, said he was \"humiliated and mortified\" by the breakdown in the airline's operations, The New York Times reported Monday. He promised that in the future the company would pay penalties to customers should they be stranded on a plane for too long, the report said. \u001d  Neeleman blamed the crisis on poor communications and a failed reservation system. He said the ice storm had left many of the airline's 11,000 pilots and flight attendants a great distance from where they could operate the planes, the report said. He added that JetBlue lacked trained staff to coordinate the flight crews. The reservation system had also been overwhelmed. \u001d  The airline had scheduled 600 flights for Presidents Day, more than the 550 to 575 flights on a typical Monday. Of those, 139 flights have been canceled, JetBlue announced late Saturday night. \u001d  JetBlue Airways Corp. spokesman Sebastian White said headway was being made Sunday, but that the cancellations Monday were needed to make sure all flight crews had gotten the legally mandated amount of rest before taking to the skies again. \u001d  \"Canceling one more day's operations will really help reset our airline,\" White said. \u001d  All flights on JetBlue were canceled in and out of 11 airports: Richmond, Virginia; Pittsburgh; Charlotte and Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin and Houston, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; Nashville; Portland, Maine; and Bermuda. \u001d  White said the airline had tried to warn passengers through phone and e-mail of flight cancellations over the past couple of days, and was in the process of doing so for Monday's flights. JetBlue has been trying to reduce the backlog of passengers through a number of methods including flying charter flights, adding flights in certain sectors, rebooking passengers who had some travel flexibility to later dates, and booking seats on other airlines, White said. \u001d  The cancellations followed hundreds of other canceled and delayed flights since Wednesday, when a snow and ice storm grounded jets at John F. Kennedy International Airport through the weekend. \u001d  Passengers scrambled to deal with the disruption of their plans. returned to the terminals because of the cancelations. Some passengers complained that they couldn't leave the airport, even after their flights were canceled, because no one could find their bags. \u001d  White said the airline had teams out in New York City and Long Island on Sunday delivering luggage to customers. \u001d  JetBlue's service hot lines became overwhelmed by people trying to rebook flights. \u001d  Affected customers may receive refunds or rebook their flights, the airline said. \u001d  The airline said it initially tried to get its system back to normal by selectively canceling flights Thursday and Friday, but long delays continued as a result of constraints that included a one-runway operation at JFK on Thursday, and flight crews burning through the number of hours they are legally allowed to work before taking a rest. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:02 ET (11:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3e6f1b09fe499edadc8c1e2c65f44dbb","symR":["PUM.XE","DE0006969603"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Puma AG 4Q, 2006 Tables Of Financial Results >PUM.XE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T10:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PUM.XE","DE0006969603"],"IndustryCodes":["FOT","TEX","XDJGI","XISL","XMDAX"],"Story":"\b \bPuma AG - Herzogenaurach, Germany \b       3 Mos Dec. 30: \b \b                        2006                2005 \bRevenue         EUR480.6 Mln        EUR349.2 Mln \bNet Profit          32.8 Mln            44.1 Mln \bPretax Profit       43.3 Mln            56.5 Mln \bEBIT -a             41.6 Mln            55.0 Mln \b \b a.

The increase in revenue was driven by improved market conditions and, in particular, enterprise service delivery into Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. \b \u001d  At the year end SES NEW SKIES operated five satellites: NSS-806 at 319.5(degree) East, NSS-7 at 338(degree)East, NSS-703 at 57(degree) East, NSS-6 at 95(degree) East and NSS-5 at 183(degree) East. Together these satellites provide global coverage. Transponder utilization on the fleet grew from 65% at the end of 2005 to 71% at the end of 2006, on a total of 215 available transponders. \b \u001d  At the end of 2006 SES NEW SKIES carried 508 television channels, a growth of 9% compared to 466 channels at the end of 2005. In total it is estimated that these channels are received by some 44 million cable and satellite households: 25 million in India, 3.5 million in Africa and 15 million in Latin America. \b \u001d  Major new deals and renewals in 2006 include the renewal of the contract with the Department of Space of the Indian Government and Antrix Corporation of India for the continued roll-out of DTH services in India. At the end of 2006 approximately 5 million households in India received DTH channels broadcast from the NSS-6 satellite. \b \u001d  SES NEW SKIES continued to serve the United States government by renewing or expanding the provision of satellite capacity, particularly in the Middle East. In 2006 there was strong growth in government services outside the United States, in particular with the Australian and Dutch governments for long-term support of their overseas operations. \b \b   SES NEW SKIES satellite fleet developments \b \u001d  In 2007 SES NEW SKIES intends to further expand its capacity through the transfer into the SES NEW SKIES fleet of AMC-12/ASTRA 4A at 322.5(degree) East, AAP-1 at 108.2(degree)East and the West Africa beam on ASTRA 2B at 28.2(degree) East. The transferred satellites will boost fleet capacity by 47%, from 215 to 315 transponders. \b \u001d  SES NEW SKIES will further enhance its orbital resources through the addition of NSS-9 in 2009. The NSS-9 satellite, which has been ordered in 2006, will be positioned at the orbital location of 183(degree) East, allowing NSS-5 to replace the NSS-703 satellite as it nears the end of its life. SES will choose a launch service provider for the NSS-9 satellite in the near future. \b \u001d  In January 2007, the launch of NSS-8 failed as a result of a launch malfunction. SES NEW SKIES is reviewing several options to capture the growth that the satellite was to have delivered through the additional capacity that would have been added to the fleet. \b \b   Services \b \u001d  Services activities across the Group developed satisfactorily and according to plan. Group services activities generated revenues of EUR 271.7 million in 2006. Strong focus on cost control and other management initiatives supported the improvement in returns from the managed services activities with a resulting improvement in services EBITDA margin to 10.5% (before project start-up costs) at the year end. \b \u001d  SES ASTRA executed a range of initiatives, in particular increasing its ownership in ND SatCom from 25.1% to 100%. The transaction significantly enhances SES ASTRA's government services offering and creates opportunities for the core infrastructure business. \b \u001d  SES ASTRA started implementing its low-cost satellite-based interactive broadband internet access ASTRA2Connect, which was announced during Q3 2006. SES ASTRA also launched its interactive, Bluetooth-based blucom service for international customers while closing further major contracts with customers in the German market (ProSiebenSat.1, N24, and the Mobile Unit of RTL). \b \u001d  ASTRA Platform Services delivered strong double-digit growth during the period as it expanded its product offering and increased the number of channels to which it provide services. It also took an important step for future growth with the commercial rollout of the blucom service and the signature of the first customer contracts for the service. \b \u001d  In December 2006 in Germany, the Federal Cartel Office closed its investigation of the planned introduction of the entavio platform in the German market, following ProSiebenSat.1's decision not to proceed with the encryption of its Free-To-Air programming lineup. Accordingly, the development of the open and neutral entavio platform will be refocused on Pay-TV offerings. \b \b   AMERICOM Government Services \b \u001d  AMERICOM Government Services (AGS) has appointed a new leader, General (Ret.) Robert Tipton (Tip) Osterthaler, to lead the group in continuing to build on its strong position in the provision of satellite-based network solutions to various agencies and departments of the US government which continue to rapidly expand their reliance on, and use of, commercially-based satellite bandwidth and services around the world. \b \u001d  Main developments in 2006 included a ground Command and Control on-the-Move (C2oTM) service that blends antenna and modem technology with AGS's satellite, teleport, and terrestrial infrastructure offering two-way broadband connectivity for vehicles. \b \b   Buy-back of GE's 19.5% stake in exchange for assets and cash \b \u001d  On 14 February 2007, SES announced that it had agreed with GE a EUR 1.2 billion split-off transaction in which SES will contribute certain assets and cash to a new company and exchange shares of that new company for GE's entire holding of 103,149,900 shares in SES, subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions. \b \u001d  GE will exchange its shareholding in SES for shares in a new company, SES International Holdings, Inc. comprising assets and EUR 588 million in cash, subject to certain closing adjustments. SES has agreed to pay an equivalent of EUR 12 for each exchanged share, resulting in a total transaction value of EUR 1,238 million. The cash amount and the transaction value will be increased by an additional amount of up to EUR 45 million provided that closing occurs prior to April 21st, 2007. \b \b   Outlook and Modelling guidance \b \u001d  Following the announcement of the transaction with GE last week, updated modelling guidance was published incorporating the impact of that transaction as well as of the major CANAL+ contract, entavio pre-commercial costs and the NSS-8 launch failure. This guidance remains unchanged. Based on an initial review of the impact of the NSS-8 launch failure completed last week we are certain that we will be taking a one-time depreciation charge of USD 21 million in Q1 to write off capitalized programme costs. Initial indications however suggest that no further value adjustments affecting earnings will arise in 2007 as a result of this event. \b \u001d  SES guidance is for a 2007 revenue range of EUR 1,568 - 1,608 million and EBITDA range of EUR 1,041 - 1,081 million. The guidance table can be found in the Appendix to this document. \b \u001d  In modelling the underlying growth of revenue and EBITDA between the years 2006 and 2007 it should be assumed that 95% of the respective impacts of the GE transaction reflected in the Appendix (being EUR 76 million for revenue and EUR 36 million for EBITDA) should be applied to the 2006 reported results. \b \u001d  The focus of 2007 will be to build on the acquisitions and other achievements of last year. The foreseen growth will come from the continued development of TV broadcasting in our core markets. Additional capacity will become available for European DTH following the launch of ASTRA 1L and the relocation of ASTRA 2C, as well as with the launch of SIRIUS 4. The AMC-18 satellite will provide further growth opportunities in the North American market. \b \b   ---------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b   PRESS / ANALYST TELECONFERENCES \b \u001d  A press call in French will be hosted at 10.00 CET today, 19 February 2007.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, Cash Generated (Distributable Cash before changes in operating reserves) was $5.2 million and Distributable Cash to unitholders was $12.8 million: $9.6 million paid to Priority Unitholders and $3.2 million paid to Ordinary Unitholders. \b \bNotional Operating Reserve \b \bDuring the fourth quarter of 2006, the notional operating reserve decreased by $7.5 million to $11.1 million. This compares to a reserve of $8.9 million at the end of 2005. \b \bThe Fund also utilizes a capital and site restoration reserve. As of December 31, 2006, the capital and site restoration reserve was $5.0 million (December 31, 2005 - $5.1 million). \b \bRevenue Recognition \b \bThe Fund recognizes revenue from the sale of refined metals and byproducts at the time of the sale, when the rights and obligations of ownership pass to the buyer. This generally occurs upon shipment. Prices for provisionally priced sales are based on market prices and exchange rates prevailing at the time of shipment and are adjusted based upon market prices and exchange rates until final settlement with customers, pursuant to the terms of sales contracts. Price changes for shipments waiting final pricing at quarter-end could have a material effect on future revenues. As of December 31, 2006, there was $15 million in revenues waiting final pricing. \b \bThe Fund makes a portion of its sales based on the average price from the previous month (month prior pricing). This form of pricing is often used for those customers where cash-in-advance terms have been negotiated as a way to manage the Fund's liquidity position and credit exposure. In a market where zinc prices are rising, a portion of the Fund's revenues will lag behind the higher zinc prices; while in a market where zinc prices are falling, a portion of the Fund's revenues will benefit from higher zinc prices from the month prior. With zinc prices coming off the December highs, month prior pricing is expected to have a positive impact on the first quarter results. \b \bOTHER DEVELOPMENTS \b \bToday the Board of Trustees appointed Gerard A. Limoges and John M. Whyte as Trustees of the Board. \b \bMr. Gerard Limoges was the former Deputy Chairman of Ernst & Young Canada until his retirement in 1999, after a 37-year career with the firm. He has a long experience in the areas of accounting, audit, mergers and acquisitions. He also has extensive experience with governmental projects. Mr. Limoges serves on the boards of numerous public and private companies as well as several not-for-profit organizations. He received the Order of Canada in 2002. Mr. Limoges graduated from HEC Montreal as a chartered accountant. He will be an independent trustee serving as Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee and a member of the Audit Committee. \b \bMr. John Whyte joined Noranda in 1991 after being in private practice for several years with a Toronto law firm - Beard, Winter and has since held a variety of senior positions within the legal department and the recycling business. Most recently, Mr. Whyte held the position of Vice-President and Assistant General Counsel of Falconbridge Limited, and currently holds the position of Vice-President, Legal of Xstrata Zinc Canada. Mr. Whyte is a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada, the Canadian Bar Association of Ontario and is a member of several business associations. He holds a B.A. (Hons.) from the University of Toronto (Victoria College), and an L.L.B. from Queen's University. \b \bThe Processing Facility was originally served with a class action motion presentable before the Qu&#233;bec Superior Court in August 2004, subsequent to an accidental discharge of sulphur trioxide. In February 2007, it was served with a re-amended motion whereby the amount of damages claimed was increased to $100 million from $25 million. The case is expected to resume before the courts in 2007. The Fund continues to believe that this action is unfounded and is contesting it vigorously. \b \bRISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES \b \bThe Fund is monitoring the strike at CN Rail and taking action as required to limit delays to production and deliveries. At this point, there has been no negative impact. \b \bOn November 1, 2006, the Federal Government released the Tax Fairness Plan. The proposed new tax structure has the intended impact of eliminating any tax advantage enjoyed by the trust structure over the corporate structure from the perspective of Canadian tax-exempt investors and foreign investors. These changes would be effective for existing trusts in 2011, unless they exceed allowable growth thresholds, and for corporations considering a trust structure from November 1, 2006 onwards. \b \bAs a trust currently under the terms of the Income Tax Act (Canada), the Fund is not subject to income taxes to the extent that its taxable income in a year is paid or payable to a unitholder. If enacted in its current form, the proposed legislation will result in a change in which the earnings of the Fund will be subject to income tax, either in 2011 or earlier if the Fund exceeds the allowable growth threshold, regardless of whether amounts are distributed to the Unitholders or not. \b \bCash distributions on Ordinary Units are subordinate to distributions on Priority Units until 2017, except on the occurrence of certain events. With respect to the Proposed Tax Fairness Plan, the Fund expects that the subordination will remain unchanged. \b \bOUTLOOK \b \bThe Fund's primary goal is to continue to provide stable monthly distributions. \b \b \b    << \b    The 2007 targets for the key drivers of the Fund are: \b    Zinc metal production:            275,000 tonnes \b    Zinc metal sales:                 282,000 tonnes \b    Processing fee:                   37 cents per pound \b    Zinc metal premiums:              10 cents US/pound \b    Capital expenditures:             $22 million \b    >> \b \b \bThe Manager's ability to provide for stable monthly distributions and meet the targets identified above is subject to the various risks and the assumptions that can be found in the \"forward-looking statements\" below. \b \bForward-Looking Statements \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 13:26 ET (18:26 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"400489a8a574d1b51a31b9b0c6d47e77","symR":["APD","US0091581068"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Air Products Appoints Montgomery Alger Vice President and Chief Technology Officer","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T19:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["APD","US0091581068"],"IndustryCodes":["CHC","CHM","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa., Feb. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Air Products (NYSE: APD) has named Montgomery (Monty) Alger vice president and chief technology officer, effective today.

Management believes that in addition to net earnings, this measure provides useful supplemental information to investors including an indication of cash available for distribution prior to debt service, capital expenditures and income taxes. Investors should be cautioned, however, that this measure should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of the Company's performance. The Company's method of calculating this measure may differ from other companies, and, accordingly, the results may not be comparable. \b \bManagement's Discussion and Analysis \b \b(presented in US dollars) \b \bForward-looking statements: Certain statements made in the following Management's Discussion and Analysis contain forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of the Company. Forward-looking statements represent the Company's intentions, plans, expectations and beliefs, and are not guarantees of future performance. Such forward-looking statements represent our current views based on information as at the date of this report. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions and the Company's actual results could differ, which in some cases may be material, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.  Unless otherwise required by applicable securities law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise this information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The Company cautions investors not to place undue reliance upon forward-looking statements. \b \bSummary Results of Operations \b \bOperating results in the final quarters of 2006 and 2005 were similar with net earnings amounting to 10 cents per share. Fourth quarter 2006 sales advanced 3.1 per cent. The margin of earnings from operations improved by 0.7 percentage points despite the decrease in gross profit margins of 0.8 percentage points.  The benefits of lower expenses and foreign exchange gains offset lower gross profits, which occurred due to a decline in the margin percentage.  The foreign exchange gains arise from the impact on cost of sales of the weakened average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar in the quarter compared to the same period in 2005. \b \bFull year net earnings improved 40.9 percent, reaching 50 cents per share in 2006 compared to the 36 cents reported in the prior year. The 14 cents per share improvement included one-time gains of 6.5 cents on the sale of premises at Laird Drive, Toronto, Ontario and 2.5 cents to recognize the enactment in 2006 of lower future Canadian income tax rates. The Laird Drive facility and two product line rationalizations further discussed below contributed 3.5 cents per share, while organic growth provided 2.0 cents and lower operating expenses delivered 5.5 cents. These were partially offset by 1.5 cents per share due to the 2006 strengthening, on average, of the Canadian dollar, 3 cents associated with higher raw material and manufacturing costs, and 1.5 cents caused by increased minority interest and effective income tax rates. \b \bIn 2006, the rationalizations contributed net earnings of 3.5 cents per share. This includes the ongoing benefits of the closure of the Laird Drive converting facility in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the rationalization of two product lines in 2006. Consequent to these actions, gross profit margins improved in 2006 contributing 4.5 cents per share and expense savings realized 1 cent. These benefits were partly offset by the organic contraction of 2 cents per share associated with sales that were no longer made by the Company subsequent to the facility closure. \b \bSales volume and pricing \b \bFourth quarter sales, when excluding the paper bag business from the equivalent quarter of 2005, increased by 4.5 percent. This comprised price increases and mix changes totaling 4.5 percent and foreign exchange gains of 0.9 percent, partially offset by 0.9 percent lower volume. Pricing adjustments for most product groups, with the notable exception of biaxially oriented nylon (BOPA) film, passed through some of the raw material cost escalations incurred by the Company. Early in 2006, the Company had decided to rationalize its offering of product lines by ending the supply of certain low-margin paper converting and drink cup products. The impact of this decision in the final quarter of the year was to drive what was otherwise a slight volume gain to the slight reduction of 0.9 percent. Most products contributed to the volume gains, particularly packaging machines, however these were largely offset by lower shipments of specialty films. \b \bSales in 2006 were 2.4 percent greater than in 2005, or 5.8 percent higher when adjusted to exclude the paper bag business. Pricing provided growth of 4.8 percent and foreign exchange, 1.5 percent. These were offset to a minor extent by lower volumes of 0.5 percent. Product related comments made for the fourth quarter regarding volume and pricing are also relevant to the full year.  The full-year volume improvement netted to 1.6 percent, when adjusting for the aforementioned product rationalization that reduced volumes by 2.1 percent compared to 2005. Organic growth of core plastic extrusion and foil-based technology products, driven by volume and pricing as discussed above, increased net earnings by 2 cents per share, while the organic contraction associated with the facility and product line rationalizations reduced net earnings by 2 cents. \b \bTwo of Winpak's product lines, biaxially oriented nylon (\"BOPA\") film and food trays, have lagged earnings expectations.  For two years, BOPA film has attracted margins at historic lows due to worldwide oversupply. Establishing a foothold in one of the potential markets for food trays has taken longer than expected. Each product line carries potential for earnings improvement in the future. \b \bGross profit margins \b \bDisappointing manufacturing performance in the final quarter of 2006 drove higher manufacturing costs and consequently a gross profit margin decline compared to the same period in 2005.  Although manufacturing efficiency significantly improved at one plant during 2006, the Company is addressing efficiency with an emphasis on programs to continuously improve manufacturing productivity at all plants. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 07:19 ET (12:19 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"40e0ea848d1c418e6699a92c9db10e1a","symR":["4704.TO","TMIC","JP3637300009","4704.TO","TMIC","JP3637300009","4704.TO","TMIC","JP3637300009"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Restatement of Consolidated / -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T12:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["4704.TO","TMIC","JP3637300009"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","X225","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  In Asia and Pacific regions, although inflationary pressure has concerned as the issue, the economic recovery tone in the background of brisk export stands out.

A poly-metallic concentrate will be produced for smelting off-site. All technology anticipated for use in this project is industry proven and in common use. The open pit will be mined at a rate of 18,000 tonnes per day of ore, or 6.3 million tonnes per year. The overall strip ratio is estimated to be 3.5:1. \b \bCapital Costs \b \bCapital costs associated with infrastructure, construction of the process plant and mining equipment are estimated to be C$261 million, including a 10% contingency of C$23.7 million and based on current exchange rates between the Canadian and US dollars. This estimate is considered accurate to within a range of more or less 30%, which is consistent with studies at this level of confidence. \b \bConclusions and Recommendations \b \bP&E makes several recommendations in the PEA that may improve the economics of the project. These include additional metallurgical test work that may improve recoveries, examining the recoveries of nickel, silver and rhodium in the deposit and expanding the resource. A 35,000 meter drilling program is underway that is anticipated to add higher grade material to the resource. \b \bThe company is pleased with the report and intends to carry out the recommendations at the appropriate time. P&E feels that this project has a good probability of becoming a viable producer due to a projected future high metal price environment, excellent location (only a few km from the Trans Canada Hwy and the town of Marathon complete with services and available workforce), grid electricity and rail transport. \b \bThis press release was prepared by Mr. Phillip C.

(AP)--Ever since casino gambling began here in 1978, revenue at the gambling halls has been on a one-way trip - straight up. \u001d  But for the first time, annual revenue from Atlantic City's casinos could decline in 2007. The industry faces increased competition from slot machines in neighboring states, new restrictions on smoking and the closing of one casino. \u001d  The first monthly revenue figures of the new year were down, raising concern that it could be the start of a yearlong trend. \u001d  If revenue does go down, it could have negative consequences for the industry, its customers and the state of New Jersey, which relies on casino taxes. \u001d  \"There will be an impact, no doubt,\" said Carlos Tolosa, eastern division president for Harrah's Entertainment Inc. (HET). \"The Pennsylvania slots parlors will certainly cause competition. In the past, people just came to Atlantic City. That's the part that always scares you. Atlantic City relies on high-frequency customers.\" \u001d  Already, Pennsylvania slots parlors are cutting into Atlantic City's pie. Figures for January, when Atlantic City went head-to-head with two new Philadelphia-area slots parlors, had New Jersey casino executives reaching for the antacid tablets. Overall revenue at Atlantic City casinos declined 2.9% compared with a year ago, but the decline in slots revenue was even sharper at 7.2%. \u001d  Philadelphia Park, in Bensalem Township, about 20 miles north of Philadelphia, opened Dec. 19. Harrah's Chester Casino and Racetrack opened on Jan. 22. Executives of those gambling halls said they targeted gamblers who otherwise would have gone to Atlantic City. \u001d  On the Atlantic City Expressway, among the billboards featuring local entertainers and buffet deals, one billboard for Delaware Park Racetrack in Wilmington beckons departing drivers to \"come play with us\" next time. \u001d  But what's bad for the casinos may be good for their customers, at least in the short term. Many observers say they expect casinos to be even more aggressive about offering financial incentives such as free rooms or show tickets to keep players coming. \u001d  Also, a revenue dip may only accelerate a movement already well under way here: Making sure there's a lot more to do in Atlantic City than just gamble. \u001d  \"Clearly, Atlantic City recognizes that for its overall revenue to grow, it has to become less gaming-centric,\" said Joseph Weinert, vice president of Spectrum Gaming Group, a casino consulting firm. \"A majority of Atlantic City's customers will be able to play slots somewhere closer to home. Atlantic City has to give them a compelling reason to drive farther, stay longer and spend more.\" \u001d  Weinert said he expects overall 2007 revenues to be about flat, with a possible fluctuation of 1% above or below the break-even point. But Frank Fantini, publisher of The Gaming Morning Report, says a decline of as much as 5% is possible this year. \u001d  In 2006, Atlantic City's revenues came in at $5.2 billion, up 4% from the year before. \u001d  The closing in November of The Sands Casino and Hotel is also expected to hurt the bottom line. \u001d  \"Some of that money will flow to other casinos, but some of it won't be recovered until another property takes its place,\" said Fantini. There are now 11 Atlantic City casinos, down from 12 last year. \u001d  Smoking restrictions are another wild card. As of April 15, casinos must designate at least 75% of their gambling floors as smoke-free. The industry is worried about losing its smoking patrons, as well as the millions of dollars it will cost each property to wall off smoking areas and install expensive ventilation systems. \u001d  The state has an interest in keeping casino revenues flowing as well. The casinos pay 8% tax on their gross revenues, and pay another 1.25% toward projects approved by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority. Last year, that worked out to $417.5 million in revenue taxes, and $65.2 million in reinvestment obligations. \u001d  But even if revenues decline this year, almost no one thinks it would be an irreversible trend. Tolosa, the Harrah's president, noted that casinos shut down last July during a state budget crisis, a revenue loss he doesn't expect to recur this year. \u001d  Three casinos are adding 2,500 hotel rooms over the next several years, and still other companies are considering building new gaming halls here. \u001d  \"I don't think anybody doubts that long-term, Atlantic City is going to remain a powerhouse,\" Fantini said. \u001d  On the Net: http://www.atlanticcitynj.com/ \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 00:12 ET (05:12 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4477c01a8a6ee77d42636ead9ca36418","symR":["AMC.AU","AMCR","AU000000AMC4"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Australia's Amcor 1H Net A$117.7M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T21:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMC.AU","AMCR","AU000000AMC4"],"IndustryCodes":["CTR","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 16:57 ET (21:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"45b24149469bb7c987899fcf72e28a8f","symR":["SIRI","XMSR"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"XM Satellite, Sirius Seen Announcing Merger Monday - NY Post","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T14:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SIRI","XMSR"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XNQ1","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc.

DBRS has also confirmed the Stability Rating of Bell Aliant Regional Communications Income Fund (Bell Aliant or the Fund) at STA-2 (high). \u001d  These confirmations come after today's announcement that Bell Aliant would sell its directory business to YPG Holdings Inc. for $330 million, with the Company indicating that proceeds will be used for share repurchases. Although the use of proceeds is not positive for debtholders, DBRS expects Bell Aliant to maintain its adjusted debt (including securitizations)-to-EBITDA levels at approximately 2.1 times through its recent acquisitions (the minority interest of Bell Nordiq Income Fund (Bell Nordiq) and the recently announced intention to purchase the Amtelecom Income Fund (Amtelecom)). This level is acceptable for Bell Aliant's current ratings given its size, stable cash flow generation, in-franchise growth opportunities and the implicit support it receives from its 44.7% ownership by BCE Inc. and Bell Canada. In addition, DBRS believes that Bell Aliant has ample flexibility to keep its adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio in line if unexpected further pressure were to occur in its operations from increased cable telephony competition. However, if this ratio were to rise closer to 2.5 times, negative rating action could potentially occur that could be compounded by further competitive pressures and potential integration risks of the former Bell Canada rural operations, which may also be hindered by the lack of a direct wireless offering in most of its territory to offset fixed-line substitution. \u001d  DBRS notes that although the loss of high-margin, stable directory cash flow is negative for either debt or income unitholders, this segment only represented approximately 2% of Bell Aliant's overall EBITDA. In addition, this loss of cash flow is being somewhat made up for through the recently closed acquisition of the Bell Nordiq minority interest (a substantial equity-financed transaction), which gives Bell Aliant full access to Bell Nordiq's cash flow after capital expenditures and interest payments to both T&#233;l&#233;bec L.P. and NorthernTel L.P. bondholders. Cash flow would be further augmented by the closing of the Amtelecom purchase, although this transaction is being financed by existing cash and debt. \u001d  DBRS notes Bell Aliant could consider further acquisitions over the next couple of years on an opportunistic basis. DBRS would expect that such transactions would be financed in a manner that would preserve its current credit protection measures and would involve operations contiguous to its existing footprint. \u001d  DBRS acknowledges that the Fund's Stability Rating is supported by (1) its dominant fixed-line positions in eastern and central Canada, where it generates approximately 44% EBITDA margins; (2) the support of BCE Inc. and Bell Canada; (3) growth opportunities related to DSL services; and (4) above-average financial flexibility at its related operating entities with continued access to the capital markets as a group. \b \u001d  Note: \u001d  All figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. \b \bIssuer Debt Rated Rating Action Rating Trend Notes Latest Event \bBell Aliant Regional Communications Income Fund Stability Rating Confirmed STA-2 (high) --  Feb 19, 2007 \bBell Aliant Regional Communications, Limited Partnership Commercial Paper Confirmed R-1 (low) Stb  Feb 19, 2007 \bBell Aliant Regional Communications, Limited Partnership Senior Unsecured Debt Confirmed BBB (high) Stb  Feb 19, 2007 \b \u001d  Rory Buchalter \u001d  Senior Vice President \u001d  +1 416 597 7568 \u001d  rbuchalter@dbrs.com \b \u001d  Jamie Wetmore \u001d  Financial Analyst \u001d  +1 416 597 7354 \u001d  jwetmore@dbrs.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 11:03 ET (16:03 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"48b4823ae05a0b244dfeae691cc7dae5","symR":["MEC.A.T","MECA","US5592111075"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Magna Entertain To Record $59.7M Writedown In 4Q >MECA","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T19:59:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MEC.A.T","MECA","US5592111075"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 14:59 ET (19:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"48ecf76c0882a8e087f3c0b3acf351c1","symR":["5232.TO","JP3400900001"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Daiwa Institute Cuts Japan's Sumitomo Osaka Cement To 4","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T08:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5232.TO","JP3400900001"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","X225","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 03:17 ET (08:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"49c2678a16f9c9c5bd4eedea2507a76c","symR":["CADAY"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"TIMED WIRE: Canada Programming Schedule: Mon Feb. 19","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T13:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CADAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\b \bTime (EST)         Feature                     *DJNS Code \b \b11 AM          =Canada Hot Stocks                  N/NYH \b \b11:50 AM       =Toronto Midday Stock Comment       N/TOR \b \b12:30 PM       =Canada News Highlights             N/HOH \b \b2 PM           =Canada Hot Stocks                  N/NYH \b \b4:20 PM        =Toronto Closing Stock Comment      N/TOR \b \b4:30 PM        =Canada News Highlights             N/HOH \b \u001d  *To learn the codes you need to use for your particular vending system, please contact our customer service department at 800-223-2274 or by e-mail at Newswires@dowjones.com. \b-0- \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4a0d53b50761e42d3eb8f7ff33f29bfc","symR":["BSAN.EB","RBK.YY","VONN.EB","CH0002267737","CH0012335540"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MARKET TALK: KBW Downgrades Sarasin To Marketperform","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T09:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BSAN.EB","RBK.YY","VONN.EB","CH0002267737","CH0012335540"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","SCR","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  0947 GMT [Dow Jones]--Keefe, Bruyette & Woods downgrades Bank Sarasin (BSAN.EB) to marketperform from outperform.

(TSX:VAA) is pleased to announce that a temporary Operating Licence for its 100% owned Duas Barras Mine has been issued by FEAM, the State of Minas Gerais environmental authority, which enables Vaaldiam to commence mining operations. The Licence was granted for the Duas Barras Mine following an environmental review of the operation. The final Operating Licence is expected to be issued by FEAM in March. \b \bKen Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vaaldiam, commented that \"the issuance of the temporary Operating Licence for our Duas Barras Mine will allow us to immediately commence mining operations on the property. Plant construction is expected to be completed within the next month, and processing of diamond-bearing gravels, which are being stockpiled adjacent to the plant, is expected to begin before the end of March.\" \b \bThe Duas Barras Mine is forecast to produce approximately 38,000 carats during its first full year of production, increasing to 50,000 carats per annum for the remainder of the mine's projected 9-year life. The deposit contains an indicated resource of approximately 1.7 million bank cubic metres at an estimated grade of 0.16 carats/m3 and 0.18 grams Au/m3, representing an in-situ diamond resource of 270,000 carats and 306 kilograms (9,838 ounces) of gold. In addition, the deposit contains an inferred resource of approximately 1 million bank cubic metres at an estimated grade of 0.16 carats/m3 and 0.18 grams Au/m3, representing an in-situ diamond resource of 160,000 carats and 180 kilograms (5,787 ounces) of gold (see press release dated August 21, 2006). A recent independent valuation of 169.15 carats of diamonds recovered during Vaaldiam's bulk sampling program indicated an average value of US $197 per carat (see press release dated September 19, 2006). \b \bVaaldiam is committed to expanding its alluvial diamond production to at least 100,000 carats per year within the next two years and is currently evaluating opportunities to achieve this objective. Vaaldiam intends to utilize the cash flow from its alluvial operations to finance its kimberlite exploration and development program in Brazil. Vaaldiam has 81.4 million common shares outstanding and approximately C$9.0 million in cash available for the exploration and development of its diamond properties. \b \bThis release has been reviewed by Paul Daigle, P.

The net decrease in Operating Income during the three months ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to the gain on disposal of vessels of $55,091,000 in 2005 from the sale of 2 vessels the PECOS and the SABINE. Other decreases in operating income were from a 19% decrease in the average daily TCE rates for vessels on spot in 2006 (see Market Overview), in addition to higher charter hire expense for 2 vessels that were chartered-in during April and August 2006. Decreases in TCE revenue were offset partially by a 22% increase in average daily TCE rates for time chartered vessels for new time charters that began in 2006 and profit sharing earned in 2006. The net decrease in Operating Income during the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to (1) the sale of 4 Suezmax vessels, 2 were chartered-back (and renamed HS ALCINA and CAPE BANTRY) which increased Non-Gemini charter hire expense and the other 2 entered the Gemini pool by the new owner, which increased Gemini pool charter hire expense subsequent to their sale dates in the second quarter (note: all 4 vessels sold continue to earn revenue in the Gemini Pool) and (2) lower TCE revenue for Suezmax vessels which had been operating on spot in 2005 that have been fixed by time charters and synthetic time charter contracts (equivalent to an average of 3.75 Suezmax vessels in the second half of 2006). The average daily TCE rate for the contracted synthetic time charters was higher than the average daily fixed charter hire expense rate for the 3 vessels on spot that are chartered -in. Decreases in operating income were partially offset by $23,126,000 higher gain on disposal of 3 vessels in 2006 compared to the gain on disposal of 2 vessels in 2005, 2 vessels earning profit sharing, new time charters, and higher rates for synthetic time charters compared to previous 2005 average time charter rates. \b \u001d  The following table illustrates the crude fleet Operating Income by vessel type, Average Daily TCE, Number of TCE Revenue Days, Average Daily Vessel Expense and Average Number of Vessels Operated by the crude oil fleet for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005 (Note: Amounts for some vessels sold include the settlement of certain revenues and expenses, including insurance claims from prior years): \b \bBREAKDOWN BY FLEET \b------------------------------- \b(In Thousands, Except Daily Rates & Expenses, \bNumber of Vessels and Number of Days) \b \b                                  For the Three       For the Twelve \b                                      Months              Months \b                                Ended December 31,  Ended December 31, \bCRUDE FLEET:                     2006      2005      2006      2005 \b---------------------------------------- --------- ------------------- \bSuezmaxes - On Spot and Time \b Charter: \bTCE Revenue(1) \b Suezmaxes - On Spot            $38,727  $ 89,080  $247,703  $291,892 \b Suezmaxes - On Time Charter \b  (2),(3)                        33,506     5,798    80,290    13,660 \b                               --------- --------- --------- --------- \bTotal TCE Revenue                72,233    94,878   327,993   305,552 \bVessel Expense                    4,234     7,610    19,453    32,544 \bCharter Hire Expense: \b Gemini Pool Charter Hire \b  Expense                        24,828    21,034   101,854    47,986 \b Non-Gemini Charter Hire \b  Expense                        15,357     9,314    49,653    24,795 \bDepreciation and Amortization     4,564     7,075    20,128    30,842 \bG&A Allocated to Vessels          1,953     2,375     9,054     9,289 \bGain on Disposal of Vessels        (179)  (55,091)  (78,217)  (55,091) \b                               --------- --------- --------- --------- \bOperating Income                $21,476  $102,561  $206,068  $215,187 \b                               ========= ========= ========= ========= \b \b-------------------------------------------------- ------------------- \bSuezmaxes - On Spot: \bAverage Daily TCE               $45,580  $ 56,555  $ 50,977  $ 48,060 \bNumber of OMI TCE Revenue Days      272     1,221     2,724     5,095 \bNumber of Pool Member TCE \b Revenue Days(1)                    577       354     2,135       978 \b-------------------------------------------------- ------------------- \bSuezmaxes - On Time Charter: \bAverage Daily TCE               $36,420  $ 29,795  $ 37,073  $ 29,721 \bNumber of TCE Revenue Days(3)       920       195     2,166       460 \b-------------------------------------------------- ------------------- \bSuezmaxes - On Spot and Time \b Charter: \bAverage Daily Vessel Expense    $ 6,575  $  7,027  $  6,368  $  7,026 \bAverage Daily Non-Gemini \b Charter Hire Expense           $27,821    25,310  $ 26,710  $ 24,120 \bAverage Number of Wholly Owned \b Vessels                            7.0      11.7       8.4      12.7 \bAverage Number of Time \b Chartered-In Vessels               6.0       4.0       5.1       2.8 \bAverage Number of Pool Member \b Vessels                            7.0       3.8       6.0       2.7 \b-------------------------------------------------- ------------------- \bCrude Carriers Sold in Prior \b Years:(4) \bTCE Revenue                     $    51  $    (25) $     53  $    904 \bVessel Expense                      (13)       99       (72)       31 \bDepreciation and Amortization         -         -         -         - \bGain on Disposal of Vessels           -         -         -    (2,874) \b                               --------- --------- --------- --------- \bOperating Income (Loss)         $    64  $   (124) $    125  $  3,747 \b                               ========= ========= ========= ========= \b \bAverage Daily TCE                   n/a       n/a       n/a  $ 15,801 \bNumber of TCE Revenue Days          n/a       n/a       n/a        57 \b \b-------------------------------------------------- ------------------- \bTotal Operating Income          $21,540  $102,437  $206,193  $218,934 \b                               ========= ========= ========= ========= \b \u001d  Note: Number of operating or TCE revenue days used to compute Average Daily TCE includes waiting days and is reduced only for the days the vessels are out of service due to drydock.

Under time-charter contracts the charterer pays the \bvoyage expenses (except brokerage commissions), whereas under voyage \bcharter contracts the shipowner pays the voyage expenses. TCE Revenue \band Expenses includes revenue and expense generated by the Gemini \bSuezmax Pool. As of December 31, 2006, the Suezmax pool included 9 \bSuezmaxes from OMI and 7 Suezmaxes owned by the other pool members.

During May 2005, 2 vessels began operating on seven year \btime charters with profit sharing. During November 2005 and April \b2006, 2 Suezmaxes that were on TC were sold, and they were replaced by \b2 Suezmaxes that previously operated in the spot market. During 2006, \bOMI recognized profit sharing revenue of approximately $4,471,000. \b \b   (4) In January 2005, 2 handysize crude oil carriers were sold. \b \u001d  Clean Fleet - Operating Income increased $26,610,000 for the three months and $44,801,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The increases in Operating Income in the 2006 periods were primarily attributable to (1) the gain on disposal of 2 vessels in October and December 2006, (2) the increased number of operating days resulting from 5 vessels acquired in 2005 and 5 vessels in 2006 increasing operating days in 2006 in both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006, which was reduced by the vessel sold in October 2006 (the other 2 vessels sold in the fourth quarter of 2006 are operating in the Libra pool, and one of which was chartered back by OMI), (3) increased profit sharing ($1,654,000 higher in the three months and $4,504,000 higher in the twelve months ended December 31, 2006) and (4) time charters at higher daily rates in 2006 compared to 2005 periods. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 15:16 ET (20:16 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"4af96fa2e197a0154e1442d3c7c40b1f","symR":["SZR.UN.T","CA86770Q1090"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Sunrise REIT Announces That HCP Clarifies Its Proposal To Acquire Sunrise REIT;

Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu Oyu (OUT1V.HE) this month posted a fourth-quarter net profit of EUR603 million from a loss of EUR180 million the year before, easily beating expectations. \u001d  \"Arcelor Mittal faces the challenge of looking good against the background of those results,\" said HSBC Securities analyst Alan Coats referring to Thyssen and Outokumpu as well as other competitors on the U.S. market such as Nucor and U.S. Steel, which also beat expectations.    Analysts are keen for insight into Arcelor Mittal's pricing plans, after the company last week announced an average price increase of 5% on its flat carbon products in Europe, made possible thanks to \"a favorable overall market environment\". \u001d  \"They announced something which others consider to be quite aggressive and they will get questions as to how realistic they think the [price increases] are,\" said Commerzsbank steel analyst Jutta Rosenbaum. \u001d  The company last year began its scheme of bolstering demand through small production cuts in Europe. This tactic is meant to eliminate volatility from steel prices by giving producers some control over demand. Other industry giants such as ThyssenKrupp expected to follow suit this year. \u001d  Analysts now say they want more details about this strategy, though they predict that European demand won't need any help and that any of Arcelor Mittal's upcoming production cuts will be targeted in North America, where demand could still pose a risk to sales. \u001d  \"In Europe it's possible to run capacities at full usage because of very high demand here,\" said Hermann Reith, an analyst at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt.\"For the U.S., it's not possible to step up production to the normal volumes - demand is not high enough.\" \u001d  Updates on cost-savings and the integration Arcelor and Mittal will also be top on analysts' list of questions for the company. The company has previously promised $1.6 billion in synergies from combining Arcelor and Mittal Steel. Analysts say they expect the company to report Wednesday that it's on track, if not ahead of schedule, to meet its targets. \u001d  How far China's cuts to exporters' subsidies will go in taming demand for cheap Chinese steel will also be of key interest on Wednesday. \u001d  -By Anne Jolis Dow Jones Newswires; +32 2 741 1488; anne.jolis@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 13:22 ET (18:22 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4c4bf60cc9fd71768c2bf814023060f7","symR":["ETR.LN","GB0005031231"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Enterprise: Potential Offer At 605P Per Share","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T11:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ETR.LN","GB0005031231"],"IndustryCodes":["ICS","SVC","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:55 ET (11:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4c6b6505f832f2211c1d6ebff453d057","symR":["FRK","VMC"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Vulcan Materials to Acquire -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T21:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FRK","VMC"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"described above will be consummated.

(AP)--Stocking up on food is as simple as a trip to the grocery store, a veritable land of plenty for Americans. \u001d  But will fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, bread, milk and other household staples still be available if the U.S. is hit with an anticipated bird flu pandemic? If state and federal officials urge people to stay away from public places, like restaurants and fast-food establishments, will they be able to get the groceries they need to prepare food in their homes? \u001d  Unlike other critical infrastructure sectors like water, energy and health care, the food industry isn't getting much help from state and federal governments when it comes to disaster planning. That puts the burden on individual supermarket chains and wholesalers to deal with a potentially large number of sick workers that could affect store operations and disrupt the food supply. \u001d  \"The industry is actively thinking through contingency plans, so if it should happen, our members would be well prepared to deal with it,\" said Tim Hammonds, president of the Food Marketing Institute, an advocate for grocery wholesalers and retail supermarkets nationwide. \u001d  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates a third of the population could fall ill if the H5N1 strain of the bird flu mutates into a form that spreads easily from person to person. It's not clear if that will ever happen and no human cases of bird flu have ever been traced to eating properly cooked poultry or eggs. \u001d  But if a pandemic emerges, the Department of Homeland Security projects worker absenteeism to reach 40% or more over a prolonged period. Hammonds said retail food stores would have to contend with worker shortages and disruptions in the supply chain. \u001d  The food and agriculture industry is listed among 13 critical-infrastructure sectors that the Department of Homeland Security says must remain functional during a pandemic. \u001d  \"Having those critical facilities open - like power, water, food - becomes very important\" during a national disaster such as a pandemic, said Keith Hanson, an outreach coordinator for Nebraska's Center for Biopreparedness Education. \u001d  Hanson works with local businesses, helping test their preparedness plans. He will speak about the importance of that testing at the Public Health Preparedness Summit in Washington, an annual conference designed to help public health workers prepare for emergencies. This year's meeting started Friday and ends Feb. 23. \u001d  Hanson said continued operations of power and water utilities are of the utmost importance, but grocery stores rank highly too. That's because people today keep less food on hand, opting instead to make weekly trips to the grocery store. \u001d  Americans are also dining out more than they have in the past. Money spent on food prepared outside the home rose from 34% of total food costs in 1974 to about 50% in 2004, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \u001d  The Food Marketing Institute's Hammonds said a widespread pandemic will likely cause food consumption to shift away from restaurants and fast-food establishments and toward in-home eating, causing a greater demand for groceries. \u001d  \"That means stores would need to be prepared for an increase in volume,\" he said. \u001d  Hy-Vee, a West Des Moines, Iowa-based supermarket chain that operates more than 200 stores in the Midwest, does not have a disaster plan developed in the event of avian flu. But company spokeswoman Chris Friesleben said the company keeps abreast of the illness through the Food Marketing Institute. \u001d  \"The food supply is essential to the well-being of the community,\" said Hammonds. \"We've been through a lot about what we need to do as a supermarket.\" \u001d  That includes urging wholesalers and retailers to talk with their suppliers about alternative sources for their products and to anticipate what products will be in high demand in a pandemic situation, such as medicines and food staples. \u001d  Stephanie Childs, a spokeswoman for Omaha-based ConAgra Foods Inc.

(AP)--More than three years since 52-year-old Patricia Schwaller died of a heart attack, her widower and a pharmaceutical giant are poised to square off in court over whether the former blockbuster painkiller Vioxx caused her demise. \u001d  Jury selection is to begin here Tuesday in the first Midwest trial over the arthritis medication, which Merck & Co. (MRK) withdrew in 2004 after research showed it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. \u001d  Both sides and observers expect the Schwaller case to be closely watched to see for the first time how the legal wrangling over Vioxx plays out in America's heartland - and notably in Madison County, which in recent years has tried to shed its reputation as a plaintiffs' paradise in big-money lawsuits. \u001d  Attorneys suing Merck for at least $50,000 in damages on each of the lawsuit's eight counts say Schwaller had been taking Vioxx for more than 20 months before the Granite City woman died suddenly Aug. 8, 2003, after returning home with groceries. John Driscoll, the family's attorney, said the mother of two had no previous heart attacks, strokes or symptoms of congestive heart disease. \u001d  But Merck expects to prove what it has argued in previous trials involving Vioxx - that heart problems by certain plaintiffs, including Schwaller, were caused by pre-existing health issues, not Vioxx. The company also contends it properly warned doctors of possible complications from using the painkiller. \u001d  Jim Fitzpatrick, an attorney for Merck, said in a statement that the company acted responsibly every step of the way, from researching Vioxx to monitoring it on the market and voluntarily withdrawing the drug. \u001d  \"We believe we have a strong case, and we look forward to presenting that evidence to the jury,\" he said, noting that \"each case has individual facts and each plaintiff has their own unique medical history.\" \u001d  Based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., Merck has been deluged with more than 27,000 personal injury lawsuits and another 265 potential class-action lawsuits alleging harm from Vioxx, amounting to billions of dollars in litigation. Merck, which has reserved $1.64 billion in its Vioxx legal defense fund, has won most of the roughly dozen trials involving Vioxx so far. \u001d  Madison County in southwest Illinois, just east of St. Louis, has become known as a place where lawyers from across the country file cases hoping for big payouts involving everything from asbestos exposure to medical malpractice. Some plaintiffs have been awarded millions - even billions - of dollars. \u001d  In March 2003, a Madison County judge issued a $10.1 billion verdict favoring smokers who sued Philip Morris USA in a class-action lawsuit involving \"light\" cigarettes. The Illinois Supreme Court later threw out that ruling, and the nation's high court last November let that decision stand. \u001d  Detractors, including the American Tort Reform Association, have pointed to this county as a \"judicial hellhole.\" President George W. Bush visited here in January 2005 as a backdrop for pressuring Congress to pass legislation limiting jury awards for medical malpractice. And in August 2005, Gov. Rod Blagojevich came to Madison County to sign a law seeking to hold down steep medical malpractice costs for doctors by limiting the amount of money people can collect in lawsuits against hospitals and physicians. \u001d  With the Schwaller case, \"the eyes of not just Illinois but the eyes of the country are on Madison County,\" said Ed Murnane, president of the Illinois Civil Justice League, a lawsuit reform group. \"I think this will be a test for the court to make sure it's a fair trial and that both sides are given ample opportunity to state their case.\" \u001d  Would-be jurors were to spend much of Tuesday filling out questionnaires, with jury selection then to be recessed until next Monday because the judge will be on vacation. The trial should take at least three weeks, both sides say. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 16:00 ET (21:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4fff4049203a8df8c6682c2ee089cf2c","symR":["OMM"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": OMI Corporation Reports 2006 -3-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T20:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OMM"],"IndustryCodes":["MAR","XDJGI","XNYA","XSCI"],"Story":"\bOther(3)                         823        58        2,927     1,401 \b                           ---------- ---------  ----------- --------- \bNet income                 $  61,453  $112,641   $  306,558  $275,169 \b                           ========== =========  =========== ========= \b \bBasic earnings per common \b share                     $    0.97  $   1.53   $     4.54  $   3.39 \bDiluted earnings per \b common share              $    0.96  $   1.53   $     4.54  $   3.39 \b \bWeighted average shares \b outstanding-basic            63,652    73,531       67,540    81,112 \bWeighted average shares \b outstanding-diluted          63,684    73,588       67,592    81,177 \b \b(1)  The Gain on disposal of vessels of $30,283,000 for the three \b months ended December 31, 2006 resulted from the sale of 2 product \b carriers in October and December.

TCE revenue comprises revenue from vessels operating on time charters and voyage revenue less voyage expenses from vessels operating in the spot market. TCE revenue is used to measure and analyze fluctuations between financial periods and as a method of equating TCE revenue generated from a voyage charter to time charter revenue. Time charter revenue is earned by vessels under contract for a specific period of time with duration usually greater than one year. \b \u001d  At December 31, 2006 (excluding the 2 product carriers sold in February and scheduled to be sold in March 2007): \b \b   --  65% of our fleet tonnage (or 35 vessels, 6 Suezmax vessels and \b        29 product carriers) operated on time charters (see Contracted \b        Time Charter Revenue section) and \b \b   --  35% of our fleet tonnage (or 9 vessels, 7 Suezmax vessels and \b        2 product carriers) operated in the spot market. \b \u001d  We currently have the equivalent of 3.75 Suezmax synthetic time charters (including a recent contract for one year beginning January 2007 for 1/4 of a Suezmax vessel) which reduces our exposure to the spot market for Suezmaxes from 7 to 3.25 vessels. Synthetic time charters are similar to time charters, as they mitigate the risk associated with the spot market. \b \u001d  Revenue generated by time charters gives the Company the ability to cover certain fixed charges (vessel expenses and charter hire expenses for vessels on time charter, consolidated general and administrative expenses and interest expense). Of the vessels on time charter: \b \b   --  62% of our tonnage on TC (or 20 vessels, 4 Suezmax vessels and \b        16 product carriers) operated on fixed rate time charters and \b \b   --  38% of our tonnage on TC (or 15 vessels, 2 Suezmax vessels and \b        13 product carriers) operated on time charters with profit \b        sharing arrangements, giving us the ability to benefit from \b        strong spot markets. Our time charters with profit sharing \b        arrangements have a floor rate. If earnings exceed that rate, \b        we share in the profit above that rate equally. This enables \b        us to benefit from strong tanker markets while protecting our \b        downside. \b \u001d  Three Months Ended December 31, 2006 vs. Three Months Ended December 31, 2005 \b \u001d  The Company earned TCE revenue of $129,672,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2006 and $148,274,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2005, which is a reduction of $18,602,000 or 13%. During the three months ended December 31, 2006, 36% or $47,215,000 of our TCE revenue was earned by vessels operating in the spot market, and 64% or $82,457,000 of our TCE revenue was earned by vessels operating on TC. During the three months ended December 31, 2005, 74% or $110,399,000 of our TCE revenue was earned by vessels operating in the spot market, and 26% or $37,875,000 of our TCE revenue was earned by vessels operating on TC. \b \u001d  The following table illustrates the TCE revenue fluctuation for the three months ended December 31, 2006 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2005: \b \b                   TCE Revenue                  % Increase  Increase \b              For the Three Months              (Decrease) (Decrease) \b                Ended December 31,   Increase   Daily TCE   Operating \b                 2006       2005     (Decrease)    Rate        Days \b              ----------- --------- ---------------------------------- \bTCE Revenue \b for Vessels           (In thousands) \b on Spot \b Charters: \b-------------- \bCrude Fleet     $ 38,778  $ 89,055    $(50,277)       -19%       (726) \bClean Fleet        8,437    21,344     (12,907)       -22%       (359) \b              ----------- --------- -----------            ----------- \bTotal           $ 47,215  $110,399    $(63,184)                (1,085) \b              =========== ========= ===========            =========== \b \bTCE Revenue \b for Vessels \b on Time \b Charters: \b-------------- \bCrude Fleet     $ 33,506  $  5,798    $ 27,708         22%        725 \bClean Fleet       48,951    32,077      16,874         14%        682 \b              ----------- --------- -----------            ----------- \bTotal           $ 82,457  $ 37,875    $ 44,582                  1,407 \b              =========== ========= ===========            =========== \b \bTotal           $129,672  $148,274    $(18,602)                   322 \b              ---------------------------------            =========== \b \u001d  During the three months ended December 31, 2006, the $18,602,000 decrease in TCE revenue was attributed to vessels operating on spot charters which decreased revenue by $63,184,000 offset by increases of $44,582,000 for vessels operating on time charters. \b \u001d  The decrease of $63,184,000 in TCE revenue for vessels operating on spot charters was due to a decrease of $50,277,000 in the crude fleet and $12,907,000 in the clean fleet. \b \b   The decreases from the crude fleet were primarily from: \b \b   --  a 19% decrease in spot charter daily TCE rates in 2006 (see \b        Market Overview section for explanations of rate \b        fluctuations), \b \b   --  479 fewer days in 2006 due to vessels that began operating on \b        6 time charter contracts; 2 of the contracts with profit \b        sharing arrangements began in 2005 and were replaced by 2 more \b        vessels that were operating in the spot market when the \b        original vessels contracted were sold in November 2005 and \b        April 2006, \b \b   --  368 fewer days relating to the equivalent of 4 Suezmax vessels \b        in the spot market that were hedged by synthetic time charter \b        contracts, which are included with vessels on time charter, \b        and \b \b   --  102 fewer days primarily from 3 vessels sold; 2 of which \b        entered the Gemini pool, the third was chartered back to OMI \b        and returned to the Gemini pool. \b \b   --  The decrease in the number of days OMI's Suezmax vessels \b        operated on spot charters were offset by increases in the \b        number of days (223 more) from 4 more pool member vessels \b        (non-OMI vessels) operating in the Gemini pool during the 2006 \b        period. \b \b   The decreases from the clean fleet were primarily from: \b \b   --  A 22% decrease in the spot charter daily TCE rates in 2006 \b        period (see Market Overview section for explanations of rate \b        fluctuations). \b \b   --  384 fewer operating days primarily for vessels that left the \b        spot market and began operating on time charter contracts. \b \b   --  Decreases were offset by 25 days of revenue from a new vessel \b        in the Libra pool. \b \u001d  The increase of $44,582,000 in TCE revenue for vessels operating on time charters was due to increases of $27,708,000 in the crude fleet and $16,874,000 in the clean fleet. \b \b   The increases in the crude fleet were primarily from: \b \b   --  22% higher average TCE rate for vessels operating on time \b        charter because of new time charters at higher rates, an \b        average of approximately $36,085 per day in 2006, in addition \b        to, the average synthetic time charter rate of $40,600 a day \b        in 2006 compared to the average TC rate in 2005 of $29,795 per \b        day, \b \b   --  357 days primarily from new time charters (net of the decrease \b        from 2 vessels sold in 2005 and 2006) and \b \b   --  368 more days relating to synthetic time charter contracts. \b \b   The increases in the clean fleet were primarily from: \b \b   --  14% higher average TCE rate for vessels operating on time \b        charters because of new or extended time charters at higher \b        rates, at an average of approximately $20,336 per day in 2006 \b        compared to the average TC rate in 2005 of $15,999 per day, \b \b   --  448 more days from 5 vessels acquired in 2006 and \b \b   --  234 days primarily from new time charters for vessels \b        previously operating on spot charters in the 2005 period. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 15:16 ET (20:16 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5078b2545ece6f57be6c0edfae6cac79","symR":["GE","US3696041033"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"GE Money, Mohawk Extend Consumer Finance Program>GE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T21:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GE","US3696041033"],"IndustryCodes":["IDD","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 16:36 ET (21:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5100913a03ca47efa87d0822ba212dbc","symR":["VAA.T","CA9184742067"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Vaaldiam Resources Satarts Mining Opers At Duas Barras","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T14:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VAA.T","CA9184742067"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 09:24 ET (14:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"51560d100fc0edd65a64f4f7f52dcbe6","symR":["CADAY"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Toronto Stocks Close Mixed: U.S. Investors Absent -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T21:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CADAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\u001d  Overall, six of the TSX's 10 stock groups rose, but there was nothing much noteworthy about the day, said Fred Ketchen, managing director of stock trading at Scotia Capital. \u001d  Indeed, none of the advancing or declining sectors posted gains or declines of 1% or more. \u001d  Among advancing groups, the industrials led the way, adding 0.69%.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the competitive energy businesses earned $285 million, or $1.85 per share, compared with a loss of $54.1 million, or $0.39 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2005.  The improvement in 2006 was largely due to the generation sale and the absences of mark-to-market and other charges recorded in 2005.  Shivery said the success of the competitive generation sale helped allow the competitive businesses to make a $25 million pre-tax contribution in the fourth quarter of 2006 to the NU Foundation, which supports charitable organizations in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.  Fourth quarter 2006 competitive business results reflect the effect of that contribution. \b \b    Parent and Other \b \u001d  NU Parent and other affiliates earned $2.0 million in 2006, compared with a loss of $18.7 million in 2005.  The improved results were due primarily to interest earned by NU Parent on cash raised through the sale of 23 million additional shares in December 2005 and the sale of the competitive generation, as well as the absence in 2006 of certain write-offs recorded in 2005. \b \b \b \b \b \b    The following table reconciles 2006 and 2005 fourth-quarter and full year \bresults: \b \b

Imperial and CAT-Gold intend to vote the bcMetals' common shares held by them in favour of any subsequent acquisition transaction.

That level was now likely to be between 1 and 2 times, the person said. \u001d  \"(Investors) know they have effective security in the music publishing arm. But following two profits warnings confidence in recorded music has declined. Bankers will be far more hesitant about loading debt onto recorded music. It might be a situation where you can't guarantee the free cash flow.\" \u001d  Analysts Monday agreed that a financial restructuring was likely for EMI. \u001d  The company last year was involved in merger talks with its U.S. peer, Warner Music Group. A tit-for-tat bidding war was eventually abandoned after a ruling from European Union antitrust regulators on another music industry merger. But analysts believe regulators will eventually clear the merger under scrutiny - of Sony Corp's (SNE) and Bertelsmann A.G.'s music units, effectively giving EMI and Warner the green light to begin merger talks. \u001d  For this reason, many analysts believe a disposal of any EMI assets is unlikely until after such a ruling. \u001d   Company Web site: http://www.emigroup.com \u001d  -By Jessica Hodgson, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 92 93; jessica.hodgson@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"57698f8f7898175fcdc97cbb254a2426","symR":["CHR","CHRN.EB","SCO","SCR.FR","CH0012997711","FR0010411983"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Scor \"Irrevocably\" Secures 32.9% Of Converium Share Cap -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T08:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CHR","CHRN.EB","SCO","SCR.FR","CH0012997711","FR0010411983"],"IndustryCodes":["INS","INU","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  Scor said in a statement that it \"strongly believes that the combination of Converium and Scor is a unique strategic opportunity to create a top five global multi-line reinsurer in this time of market consolidation.\" \u001d  It said the idea of tying the two companies is based on \"very strong industrial, economic and financial rationales.\" \u001d  Scor said it paid 20% cash and 80% in new shares for the Converium stake for a value of CHF21.1 a share. \u001d  The French reinsurer said it had approached the Converium board to discuss making a full offer but this had been rejected. \u001d  -By Digby Larner, Dow Jones Newswires; +33 1 4017 1748; digby.larner@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 03:38 ET (08:38 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"57a47ef8c77dc57cca72e2d86cecd8ee","symR":["CHR","CHRN.EB","SCO","SCR.FR","CH0012997711","FR0010411983"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Scor: Regrets Converium Board's Rejection Of Bid","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T08:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CHR","CHRN.EB","SCO","SCR.FR","CH0012997711","FR0010411983"],"IndustryCodes":["INS","INU","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 03:05 ET (08:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"57c35c14ef7c325257f2e6c47ea19f23","symR":["MBL.UN.T","CA6152501079"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Montrusco Bolton Income & Growth Fund Announces Distribution>MBL.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T13:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MBL.UN.T","CA6152501079"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\b   TORONTO, ONTARIO--(CCNMatthews - Feb. 19, 2007) - Montrusco Bolton Income & Growth Fund (TSX:MBL.UN) announces a distribution for the month ending February 28, 2007 of $0.05833 per unit.

(TSX: AMM)(AMEX: AAU) (\"Almaden\" or \"the company\") is issuing the following news release to clarify our disclosure made in past news releases with respect to the resource for the company's ELK project, British Columbia. \u001d  In the company's January 11th, 2006 and January 24th, 2007 news releases concerning the Elk Gold deposit an historic resource was quoted which is not NI 43-101 compliant. The company did not purport to have and does not have any NI 43-101 compliant reserves. The company did not intend to represent the old resource as NI 43-101 compliant and does not have NI 43-101 compliant reserves but mineral resources. The historic resource is no longer current and was quoted only as a means of demonstrating how the resource has changed over time through the drilling programs conducted by the company since 2001. \u001d  Further, the same paragraph of the company's disclosure of contained metal did not comply with NI 43-101 because it added inferred resources to other categories and did not provide the details of tonnes and grade for each category. The reader is reminded that correct disclosure was done by the company in tabular form in the news releases in question as well as the news releases of May 6, 2006 which announced the current resource at the Elk project. The table from the May 6, 2006 news release is shown below. \u001d  The Elk gold project is a mesothermal quartz vein gold deposit hosted by the Okanagan Complex Batholith. The resource estimate reported in the May 6, 2006 news release is from a report by Giroux Consultants dated April 6th, 2006, and was calculated using the industry standard geostatistical estimation methodology, kriging. It includes assays from 434 surface and 301 underground diamond drill holes, totaling 71,000 meters of core. Drill sections are 10m to 50m apart, with holes spaced on average between 15m and 25m. More than 8,000 individual gold assays and analyses, with an average interval length of 0.5m, were used to develop the mineral resource estimate. Gold assays were examined using graphical and statistical techniques and as a result capped at 302 g/t gold (8.8 oz/t gold). A total of 12 assays were capped. The resource for the Siwash North B vein and WD veins was first calculated using a two dimensional method which involves estimating thickness and gold accumulation (thickness x gold grade) for a number of blocks located in the plane of the vein. For each drill hole that intersected a vein, a true thickness was calculated. For each vein the intersections were rotated in the horizontal and vertical planes as required to produce a long section that approximated the true vein surface. \u001d  A grid of blocks 10 x 10m for the B Vein and 20 x 20m for the WD veins were superimposed on the long section and estimated by ordinary kriging. The B vein was subdivided into three domains for estimation based on vein structure. Due to the change in dip a Flat near surface segment that included the open pit was estimated east to the RBF Fault trace and where the vein steepened below the 1600 level a Steep segment was estimated. The third B vein domain was east of the RBF fault. During the 2004-05 drilling no new holes tested the B vein Flat segment so the resource reported for that part of the vein is identical to the resource reported in May 2004. The Siwash North B vein when it crosses from granodiorite to quartz monzonite tends to split up with less continuous parallel splays produced. The tonnages and resource presented above in the two dimensional approach ignored the parallel splays. The WD vein has a similar situation with several parallel smaller splays, but only the WD vein, was estimated. To allow for the possibility of open pit mining the Siwash North B vein east of the existing pit, the splays were combined with the main B vein and internal waste between them assigned a grade of 0.001 g/t gold. A three dimensional solid was produced to encompass all the mineralization and a three dimensional block model was estimated by ordinary kriging. Specific gravities were assumed to be 2.75 in sulphides parts of the vein, 2.50 in oxide portions or were calculated from Fe, Pb, Cu and Zn contents in samples where these elements were available. Each intersection in the 2D approach and each one metre composite in the 3D approach had an assigned specific gravity. Inverse distanced squared interpolation was used to assign a specific gravity to each resource block in both models. Semivariograms ranges and the distances from blocks estimated to data used were used to classify the resource. \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b   Measured                    Indicated \b                     --------------------------  -------------------------- \b                 Au            Grade  Contained            Grade  Contained \b             Cutoff             Gold     Ounces             Gold     Ounces \bAREA           (g/t)  Tonnes    (g/t)      Gold   Tonnes    (g/t)      Gold \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bB Flat Vein     7.0   12,000   34.57     13,300    7,000   13.77      3,100 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bB Steep Vein    7.0   17,000   37.34     20,400   34,000   47.51     51,900 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bB East Vein     7.0    1,000   12.46        400    8,000   18.13      4,700 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bWD Vein         7.0        0       0          0  137,000   21.77     95,900 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bBulk Open \b Pit Target     1.0  195,000   5.730     35,900  435,000   4.250     59,400 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bTOTAL                225,000    9.68     70,000  621,000   10.77    215,000 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                                            Inferred \b                                               ---------------------------- \b                                                           Grade  Contained \b                                                            Gold     Ounces \bAREA                                              Tonnes    (g/t)      Gold \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bB Flat Vein                                          500    7.74        100 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bB Steep Vein                                     114,000   16.21     59,400 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bB East Vein                                       26,000   13.88     11,600 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bWD Vein                                           46,000   11.05     16,300 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bBulk Open \b Pit Target                                      908,000    3.46    101,000 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bTotal                                          1,094,500    5.35    188,400 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \u001d  This resource does not incorporate the results of the 2006 drilling conducted on the property.

However, we believe it is more appropriate to use the more likely range of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding special items provided above. \b \u001d  The diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding special items range we have provided specifically excludes any one-time transition or one-time financing and closing costs associated with the acquisition of Alderwoods.  The diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding special items range we have provided also eliminates the revenues and operating income associated with planned divestitures and includes the benefit from the reinvestment of estimated proceeds; however, no adjustments have been made to reflect any anticipated gain or loss from the divestitures. \b \u001d  The guidance range for diluted earnings from continuing operations excluding special items in 2007 assumes an effective tax rate of 35% and assumes the fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be approximately 290 to 295 million, excluding any potential SCI share repurchases. \b \u001d  Diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is not currently accessible on a forward-looking basis.

These statements may be accompanied by words such as \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate\" or \"predict,\" that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. These statements are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable; however, many important factors could cause our actual results in the future to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein and in any other documents or oral presentations made by us, or on our behalf.

Gazprombank also anticipates growth of between 20% and 30% in its corporate and retail deposits over the course of 2007. \u001d  It said its assets rose 66% in 2006 to RUB724 billion and sees its corporate loan book growing 40% this year, while retail lending is expected to surge 70%. \u001d  Gazprombank owns controlling stakes in media and petrochemicals enterprises and has drummed up a host of corporate clients through Gazprom, its affiliates and other oil and gas firms. \u001d  The bank has actively sought to cross-sell its retail products to employees of those companies and this remains key to its business model. \u001d  It already owns a bank in Belarus and is considering other moves into abroad, possibly into neighboring Ukraine, but is focusing on Russia for the time being. \u001d  \"The main accent will be on domestic expansion this year,\" Sobol said. \u001d  Bank Web site: http://www.gazprombank.ru \u001d  -By Andrew Langley and Geoffrey T.

The ProStuff(R) straight eight starting gate has been selected as the official start gate for Olympic BMX contests. The 2008 Olympics will be the first ever held in China and mark the debut of BMX bicycle racing as an Olympic event. Parker distributor, Barker Rockford, Inc., integrated Parker automation components to develop the patented system. \b \b    (Photo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20070219/CLM089-a ) \b \b    (Photo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20070219/CLM089-b ) \b \b    (Logo:   http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/19990816/PHLOGO ) \b \u001d  \"Using Parker automation technology, we set out to find a new application in an untapped market niche,\" said Pierce Barker, III, principal of the Rockford, Illinois distributorship and president of ProStuff LLC. \"Today, we're confident that the design features and performance of our starting gate are unique and allow them to outperform any other in the world. This equipment is in use at racing facilities in 24 countries on every continent except Antarctica - and that includes many Olympic training facilities.\" With Parker's support and cooperation, Barker has been instrumental in establishing a worldwide standard based on ProStuff designs. \b \u001d  The ProStuff starting gate systems are built using Parker components including a pneumatic ram, FRLs, exhaust valves, a custom accumulator constructed using Parker's rigid aluminum IPS profiled shapes, hoses and connectors and industrial grade shock absorbers. Barker also developed proprietary electronic controls and safety hinge devices for use with the gates. Gate doors and ramps on single gate systems for individual training are framed by Parker's Industrial Profile Systems - extruded aluminum sections designed to support automated equipment in factories. Several world champions attribute their success, in part, to training with the ProStuff ProGate. \b \u001d  \"Our design addresses the concerns of riders and race operators for consistent performance, safety, durability and low noise operation,\" said Barker. Consistent performance and safety go hand-in-hand in a race where riders anticipate the start signal and actually begin moving milliseconds before the gate falls. In many BMX races, early anticipation results in riders going \"over the top\" -- stuck on the upraised edge of the start gate -- or worse, falling under the gate as it drops to start the race. At the 2005 BMX World Championship in Paris, 40 percent of the race starts had riders going over the top using a competitive system. In the 2006 event, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, using ProStuff starting gates, only two riders in 3,970 starts got ahead of the gate drop. The automated start cycle of ProStuff gates, from \"ready\" to \"drop\" positions varies by 10 milliseconds or less. Other systems typically vary 60 to 120 milliseconds - enough time to throw off top world class competitors. \b \u001d  \"Besides the improved safety, we had no breakdowns or malfunctions in all 3,970 drops of the gate at the Sao Paulo Worlds,\" Barker noted.  \"In many contests where heavier steel gates are used, the repair welder is on the starting line nearly as often as the riders to fix gates and ramps that literally beat themselves to pieces.\" Several elements, from basic design geometry to light weight materials and an adjustable \"cushion\" stop for the cylinder rod combine to make this high performance reliability possible. \b \u001d  The last 5/8 inches of rod travel on the Parker air cylinder, or ram, can be cushioned by exhaust air compressed in the cylinder rod end by Parker cushion valves. The rod extends rapidly, using pressurized air from its attached accumulator, to push the gate forward on each race start. Unlike self-destructing \"bang-into-the-ground\" systems, ProStuff gates can be modulated with software and a single adjustment screw on the side of the air ram to provide a pneumatic cushion that stops the free-fall of the gate. The cushion kicks in as the industrial grade Parker shock absorbers contact the gate at the end of its travel. \b \u001d  \"How much cushioning is required will vary with the terrain of the start line,\" said Barker, \"so our software ensures sufficient air volume and pressure are applied to suit the conditions.\" Before ProStuff, start gates hit the ground hard enough to be felt in the stands. The noise, over 100 decibels, was comparable to a shotgun blast. BMX racing organizations find the quiet operation of the system is actually helping recruit young riders to the sport. \b \u001d  \"Parker offers more motion and control systems worldwide than anybody else,\" said Roger Sherrard, President of Automation at Parker. \"More than 12,000 Parker distributor locations provide an unequaled global market channel, and like Barker Rockford, partner with customers to identify needs and create productive, profitable motion and control applications. We look forward to watching, along with the rest of the world, the result of this collaborative approach in action at the athletic competitions in Beijing.\" \b \u001d  With annual sales exceeding $9 billion, Parker Hannifin (NYSE: PH) is the world's leading diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision-engineered solutions for a wide variety of commercial, mobile, industrial and aerospace markets.

Stewart \u001d  Does July 14, 2006, mean anything to you? Probably not. Other than being Bastille Day in France, it was a seemingly ordinary midsummer day in investment history. But it was on that day that a barrel of oil fetched a record $77.03. By Labor Day it was $70 a barrel, by October it was $60, and by mid-January 2007 it had plunged to $52. \u001d  With the benefit of hindsight, we can now say with certainty that the prolonged bull market in oil ended that July 14. With a decline of more than 32 percent per barrel, oil is officially in a bear market. Natural gas prices have fallen even further, and metals and other commodities have also dropped sharply from their 2006 highs. This marks a profound psychological shift from a world in which natural resources were perceived as scarce and ever more expensive, to one in which OPEC is scrambling to cut production to prop up prices. \u001d  What happened? If I knew, I'd be running an energy hedge fund, more than a few of which, incidentally, have either closed or are losing investors in droves. I've heard various explanations: warm winter weather, a calm hurricane season, a slowing U.S. economy. But what happened to all those reasons that were so often cited for higher oil prices? Iran has become even more brazen in its pursuit of nuclear weapons, which threatens Mideast stability and the oil supply. Nigerian rebels are still crippling production in that West African nation. Insurgents in Iraq continue to blow up pipelines. And Belarus cut off crude-oil supplies to Western Europe. Meanwhile, on the demand side, the Chinese and Indian economies are still growing at or near double-digit rates, and the U.S. and Western European economies were showing renewed growth by year-end. In other words, all the pressures that seemed to justify high oil prices are still there. If anything, they seem stronger. \u001d  Part of the answer may be little more than market psychology. Prices went up because everyone expected them to rise, and hedge funds and other speculators poured money into oil futures. Now it's the reverse. Falling prices beget short sellers and bearish bets, further driving down prices. But I don't pretend to know, nor can I predict future oil prices. All I can do is look at where they've been and what it means now for energy-sensitive stocks. \u001d  After all, there's always a way to profit from movement in oil prices. The only thing professional traders really dread is price stability. They live for volatility. Following the Common Sense mantra to buy lower and sell higher, I buy oil stocks and related securities when oil prices are falling (buying lower). I sell when they're rising, as I did during the long bull market in oil. I do the reverse with oil-price-sensitive stocks that typically move in the opposite direction of oil prices. These traditionally include chemical companies (which rely on oil as a raw material); airlines and other transports; and mass-market retailers, whose customers are disproportionately hurt by high gas prices. Over a year ago, with oil prices approaching their peak, I recommended these counter-oil stocks in anticipation of lower oil prices. \u001d  How have they fared? It's interesting to compare stock prices of these companies from last July, when oil prices peaked, with prices in January of this year, when oil dropped to $52 a barrel. Take Wal-Mart Stores. With gas at $3 a gallon last summer, analyst after analyst cited the world's largest retailer as a poster child for companies being hurt by the price at the pump. Wal-Mart customers couldn't afford to visit the stores as often and didn't have as much discretionary spending when they got there, they explained. Wal-Mart did indeed hit its low for the year, $43, on July 17, the Monday after $77-a-barrel oil. By Oct. 26, with oil around $60, it had rallied to $51.75. But then, as oil prices continued to drop, Wal-Mart, which is suffering from other woes, slipped back to $48, roughly 10 percent above its low. \u001d  Du Pont is a good proxy for the chemical makers, and its stock has moved in textbook fashion. On July 14 it was at $39, where it remained until early August. By the second week in January, it had risen in a near straight line to more than $48. That's a 25 percent gain in six months, not bad for a stodgy chemical stock. \u001d  For airlines, let's look at American Airlines' parent, AMR. On July 14, it was just over $23. It hit its low for the year, just under $19, on Aug. 11. By mid-January it had doubled to $38. The transports as a whole, however, wound  up in January about where they were in July, though they have rallied off their August lows. (This exercise has convinced me that oil-sensitive stocks have indeed reaped the benefits of lower oil prices, which means it's time to reduce these positions. In other words, sell higher, locking in these gains.) \u001d  Curiously, the converse doesn't seem to have held true. Oil-stock prices nearly always move in tandem with oil prices, in my experience. Last September, with oil prices off their peak, I first suggested in my online column that investors should consider this a buying opportunity. On Sept. 19, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) was trading at around $51, near its low for the year. But then, as oil prices continued to fall, XLE rallied sharply, hitting $61.75 in mid-December, for a more than 20 percent gain. My advice proved profitable -- for the wrong reasons! \u001d  Back then, I noted the huge Gulf of Mexico oil reserves recently discovered by Chevron and its partners, Devon Energy and Statoil of Norway. I was surprised that the market had failed to bestow any premium on these oil producers as a result of this huge find. (Costs and feasibility of extracting the oil remain an issue, but in my book, oil is oil, and it's better to find it than to be depleting reserves.) For whatever reason, all three stocks rallied sharply into the end of 2006. \u001d  As I've noted in this column before, I'm always intrigued by economic conundrums. Something is wrong here. Either energy investors are rightly convinced that oil prices are destined to rise in 2007, justifying these higher oil-stock prices, or energy stocks are overpriced. I favor the latter theory, since who can know what future oil prices will be? \u001d  Before doing this research, I fully expected to be reiterating my advice to continue increasing exposure to the oil sector. Instead, I'm planning to prune some holdings, perhaps by selling some calls. If I were a big risk taker, I might even short some of these positions (but I never recommend short sales and have never sold a stock short myself). If oil continues to plunge, these stocks will surely follow suit. Then -- and only then -- will it be time to return to the energy sector. \u001d  --- \u001d  SmartMoney.com: Need more Common Sense?

The proposals aim to remove the tax-advantaged status of most income trusts by taxing distributions paid to unitholders in the same manner as dividends paid to shareholders of corporations. In the absence of mitigating factors, the tax would be applied at a rate of 31.5%, beginning in 2011. \b \bA preliminary analysis of the draft legislation indicates that the effect of the tax on Arctic Glacier should be mitigated in three main ways: \b \b1. The tax should not apply to income derived directly from U.S. operations, which is projected to be approximately 70% of the Fund's annual taxable income. The U.S.-sourced income is currently being received indirectly by the Fund, but will be restructured before 2011 to have it flow directly into the Fund. \b \b2. Tax in the Fund's operating subsidiaries can be further reduced by loss carry-forwards and tax depreciation remaining in Canadian and U.S. operations, which are projected to provide a tax shield until approximately 2016. \b \b3. The tax should not apply to the return of capital portion of distributions, which currently comprises approximately 50% of the total cash distributions paid to Arctic Glacier unitholders. The proposed return of capital should continue for the foreseeable future. \b \b\"Based upon these assumptions and current projections, approximately 15% of our cash distributions would be subject to the new distribution tax in 2011,\" said Mr. McMahon. \"This means that the tax cost to the Fund will be approximately $0.05 per unit starting in 2011.\" \b \bWhen combined with the current payout ratio, the Fund does not anticipate any reductions in future cash distributions as a result of the proposed distribution tax. \b \bIn addition, the new tax guidelines provide trusts with the ability to pursue growth initiatives via equity financings through to 2011, within certain limits. As presently understood, these \"safe harbor\" limits will allow Arctic Glacier to continue its growth strategy through acquisitions without accelerating application of the new tax rules. \b \bAbout Arctic Glacier \b \bArctic Glacier Income Fund, through its operating company, Arctic Glacier Inc., is a leading producer, marketer and distributor of high-quality packaged ice in North America under the brand name of Arctic Glacier(R) Premium Ice. Arctic Glacier operates 34 production plants and 50 distribution facilities across Canada and the northeast, central and western United States servicing more than 68,000 retail accounts. \b \bArctic Glacier Income Fund trust units are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the trading symbol AG.UN.

(\"Corporation\") (TSX:MOG) today announced that it intends to consolidate its operations into new facilities in the Greater Chicago area and to manufacture its MonoPrep Processor. This new operational plan requires that the Corporation buy back the manufacturing rights for the MonoPrep Processor and the lease obligation for its current manufacturing facility (the \"Transactions\"). Those manufacturing rights and lease obligation have been held by corporations controlled by Mr. Siegfried Weiler, MonoGen largest shareholder. The compensation agreed to between the parties for the cancellation of these rights is the issuance by the Corporation of 5-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 600,000 common shares of the Corporation. The warrants are exercisable at a price of US$1.19 per common share and have an expiration date of five years from the closing date. The Transactions are expected to close on or before March 5, 2007. The Transactions are subject to TSX approval. \b \bMonoGen CEO, President and Chief Scientific Officer, Norman J. Pressman, Ph.D., stated: \"Following the hiring of Mr. Ted Geiselman as Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in the fall of 2006, the Corporation undertook a complete review of its operations.

The Company's pre-clinical studies show that CF102 is also active against Hepatitis B virus, in addition to liver cancer, which is the first indication being developed. The new discovery opens up for Can-Fite a potentially significant target market of approximately 3 billion dollars, and may lead to the accelerated development of CF102, which Can-Fite is developing alongside its first drug, CF101, which is already in various phases of clinical trials in the United States, Europe and Israel. \b \u001d  The new findings were obtained in collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Kamel Khalili, Professor and Chair, Department of Neuroscience, Director, Center for Neurovirology, Temple University School of Medicine. Prof. Khalili, a leading scientist in this field, serves also as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Neurovirology. \b \u001d  The research institute headed by Dr. Khalili employs about 100 leading scientists in the field and has the newest equipment that enables monitoring of the virus in infected cells, testing of the drug's inhibitory effect on virus reproduction and elucidation of the drug's mechanism of action. Within the confines of this collaboration agreement, the effect of CF102 on the Hepatitis C virus will also be tested. \b \u001d  Liver cancer affects about 450,000 new patients each year and is highly prevalent in people infected with Hepatitis B and C virus and in alcohol abusers. This type of cancer is particularly common in Eastern countries, and currently has no effective treatment. \b \u001d  CF102 belongs to a chemical class of substances called nucleosides, which includes the currently marketed antiviral drugs. The Company has therefore decided to study the activity of CF102 against hepatitis virus. \b \u001d  The number of people infected with Hepatitis B and C around the world is 350 million and 170 million, respectively, with the number rapidly increasing in recent years. The current market size is estimated at about 3 billion dollars annually due to a lack of appropriate treatments. Can-Fite thus becomes a biotechnology company involved in the development of drugs for a wide array of diseases, including autoimmune diseases, cancer and viral diseases, with a market potential in billions of dollars. \b \u001d  Prof. Pnina Fishman, CEO of Can-Fite, said today that \"this is a genuine scientific and commercial breakthrough. The new discovery essentially indicates that, in addition to its activity in suppressing liver cancer, the drug CF102 is also effective in suppressing the Hepatitis B virus, one of the main pathogens of liver cancer. These findings significantly contribute to the accelerated development of CF102 and substantially increase the scope of the drug's target markets.\" \b \u001d  Can-Fite has recently reported that it commenced patient enrollment in a phase II clinical trial of CF101 in the treatment of Dry Eye Syndrome. This phase II trial in patients with Dry Eye Syndrome is added to the Company's ongoing clinical trial in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. Last month, Can-Fite announced that it completed the enrollment of 250 patients for the phase IIb rheumatoid arthritis trial. Completion of the enrolment was a milestone in the marketing agreement recently signed with the Japanese Seikagaku Corporation, and Can-Fite has already received about 4 million dollars within the confines of this agreement, whose total sum may reach 19.5 million dollars. \b \u001d  Can-Fite develops targeted drugs that specifically attack affected cells without compromising normal body systems, and therefore have a favorable safety profile. The Company's drugs are based on a scientific concept, which was proven in trials, suggesting that the target of the drug is only expressed on the surface of affected cells. The Company has recently developed a procedure that uses pre-treatment blood tests to determine the receptor level, which may be indicative of treatment response. \b \u001d  Can-Fite is developing its first drug, CF101, for 4 clinical indications in the field of inflammatory diseases, including: rheumatoid arthritis (ongoing phase IIb clinical trials in the US), Dry Eye Syndrome (ongoing phase II trials in Israel), psoriasis (initial development phase) and uveitis. The Company has also begun the development of CF102 for the treatment of liver cancer. \b \u001d  Can-Fite Biopharma Ltd is a public company traded on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange. The Company, which commenced business activity in 2000, was founded by researcher Prof. Pnina Fishman and patent attorney Dr. Ilan Cohn. The Company focuses on the development of molecule-based drugs that inhibit the development of cancer or inflammatory cells. The market for the company's drugs is estimated at billions of dollars. \b \b    CONTACT: Can-Fite BioPharma \b             Chief Executive Officer \b             Pnina Fishman, Ph.D., +972-3-9241114 \b             Fax: +972-3-9249378 \b             pnina@canfite.co.il \b             http://www.canfite.com/ \b \b    SOURCE: Can-Fite BioPharma \bCopyright Business Wire 2007 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 09:00 ET (14:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5df989ac91673ac49f5a7ee4a72d09b3","symR":["SRZ","VTR"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Ventas Responds To Conditional HCP Proposal And Sunrise Senior Living REIT Announcement>VTR","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T12:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SRZ","VTR"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","REA","REI","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Ventas, Inc.

(TSX: RUS) today announced earnings of $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter of 2006 and $2.65 for the year ended December 31, 2006, the second strongest annual earnings in the Company's history. Fourth quarter 2005 earnings per share were $0.82. Fiscal 2005 earnings per share were $2.47. \u001d  Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $159 million, an increase of 27% over fiscal 2005 net earnings of $125 million. Net earnings for the 2006 fourth quarter were $31 million, down 27% from $42 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. \u001d  The energy tubular products segment produced the strongest fourth quarter operating income ever but this was down from the third quarter, which is traditionally the weaker quarter. This reflects the inconsistency in the oil and gas industry where drilling activity levels had reached all time highs but may have plateaued in the fourth quarter. It is unclear how the recent decline in oil and gas prices will impact our energy tubular products segment after the record operating profits of $77 million in 2006. \u001d  The fourth quarter decline in operating income in the metals service center segment reflects the impact of lower steel prices and lower demand levels in the quarter. North American service centers addressed an industry-wide inventory overhang going into the fourth quarter and cut back their steel purchases to levels below end user demand. This adversely impacted the steel mills and consequently steel prices from the mills dropped in the quarter. The service center industry purchases from the mills are expected to improve during the first quarter, but we expect service centers to continue reducing inventory levels during the first half of 2007. The Company reduced its metals service centers inventory by $36 million in the fourth quarter while at the same time experiencing lower end user demand. The strong demand in our Canadian metals service centers experienced in the first half of 2006 weakened in the fourth quarter and resulted in lower fourth quarter revenues compared to the same period last year. \u001d  Revenue for the steel distributors segment in the fourth quarter was adversely impacted as service center customers reduced their purchases to correct inventory levels and delayed delivery of our inventory. These goods will be shipped within the first quarter of 2007. \u001d  Bud Siegel, President and CEO, stated, \"Overall we don't want to lose sight of the fact that our 2006 annual earnings were our second strongest ever. Fourth quarter earnings reflected lower revenue levels but I was pleased to see our margins remain strong and our EBIT to sales ratio remained at a historical high level in a challenging quarter. \u001d  Our inventory levels are higher than required to support the current market conditions. As previously mentioned, the metals service center segment successfully decreased inventory by $36 million in the fourth quarter, however the inventory in our other operating segments increased in the quarter. We are actively working to improve our inventory turns in all segments in the first half of 2007. \u001d  The free cash flow generated in 2006 was $159 million, or $2.65 per share. Our already strong dividend was increased 60% to $1.60 per share in 2006, the fourth straight year of increased dividend returns to our shareholders. The balance sheet is currently under leveraged and we continue to evaluate internal and external growth opportunities. We believe that an opportunity to significantly add value for our shareholders through an acquisition, or acquisitions, will occur in due course. We have the financial strength in our balance sheet to execute any transaction that may occur in the sector.\" \u001d  Bud Siegel continued, \"We remain focused on rewarding our shareholders. Our common shares are one of the top yielding securities in the S&P/TSX Composite Index, yielding approximately 6%. The strong 2006 earnings coupled with the financial strength of our balance sheet will enable the Company to selectively participate in the industry consolidation currently underway. Overall, I am pleased with the Company's 2006 achievements.\" \u001d  The Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share payable March 15, 2007 to shareholders of record as of March 2, 2007. \u001d  The Company will be holding an Investor Conference Call on Tuesday, February 20, 2007 at 9:00 a.m. ET to review its fourth quarter results for 2006. The dial in telephone number for the call is 1-800-346-5998. \u001d  For those unable to participate in the conference call, it will be recorded and available for listening at 1-800-558-5253 until midnight, Tuesday, February 27, 2007.

(7259.TO), an autoparts manufacturer affiliated with Toyota Motor Corp. (7203.TO), plans to increase its supply of core motor systems for hybrid vehicles to Ford Motor Co. (F), The Nikkei reported in its Tuesday morning edition. \u001d  This could signal a growing relationship between the Toyota group and Ford. Last December, Toyota Chairman Fujio Cho and Ford President and Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally held talks, at Ford's request, in a move apparently aimed at exploring potential partnerships. \u001d  Aisin subsidiary Aisin AW Co. has supplied dual-motor systems to Ford since 2004 for use in the automaker's hybrid Escape sport utility vehicle. Aisin AW's shipments currently reach around 20,000 systems a year. \u001d  Looking to expand its lineup of hybrid vehicles, Ford has asked Aisin to increase output. The automaker also has asked Aisin to develop a new dual-motor system for its next-generation small and midsize hybrid sedans. \u001d  Against a backdrop of volatile gasoline prices, demand for fuel-efficient vehicles has grown sharply in the U.S. To address this, Ford, which offers a wide array of large vehicles, has been working to develop its own hybrid motor system, but sagging earnings have hampered this effort. By teaming up with the Toyota group, the U.S. carmaker intends to kick-start sales and stage an earnings comeback. \u001d  While the U.S. Big Three automakers struggle with sluggish sales, the Toyota group continues to hold a strong position in the North American market. It now boasts the third-largest share in terms of sales after General Motors Corp. (GM) and Ford. Toyota is believed to be trying to tighten ties with U.S. automakers in order to prevent a backlash against its growing dominance. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 13:09

Results \b \b \u001d  NAPERVILLE, Ill., Feb. 19 /PRNewswire/ -- OfficeMax today introduced its paper procurement policy, enhancing the company's current environmental policy by setting direct product expectations and business relationship expectations for paper product suppliers.  The OfficeMax paper procurement policy defines performance criteria for its product suppliers in the selection of raw materials and production of paper products and will guide the company's actions in support of its commitment to environmental sustainability. OfficeMax developed the policy through a consultative process that included viewpoints from OfficeMax associates, customers, suppliers and environmental organizations who share our interests in the environmental impacts of paper production. \b \u001d  \"We are proud of the progress we made in creating this paper procurement policy,\" said Ryan Vero, executive vice president and chief merchandising officer for OfficeMax.  \"The inclusion of outside parties brought diverse viewpoints and perspectives that ultimately delivered a balanced and realistic policy that achieved our common goals.\" \b \u001d  Among the policy's stated expectations for product suppliers are the tracking of raw materials used in the making of paper products, elimination of products from endangered areas and discontinuation of converting natural forests to industrial tree plantations. \b \u001d  Through its paper procurement policy, OfficeMax commits to creating systems to ensure our suppliers are meeting stated expectations.  \"This paper procurement policy provides meaningful incentive for our suppliers of paper products to carefully consider environmental sensitivities.  We will continue to work with these stakeholders to implement our commitments and achieve our important goals,\" said Vero. \b \u001d  OfficeMax has notified its suppliers about areas of concern to two environmental groups; the Cumberland Plateau, specifically identified by Dogwood Alliance, and First Nations' concerns about the impact of fiber originating from Canadian forests, an issue specifically identified by ForestEthics.  OfficeMax will continue to urge its suppliers to resolve these matters through their supply chains. \b \u001d  Ongoing progress achieved through the active implementation of the OfficeMax environmental policy and paper procurement policy will be presented in the company's annual Environmental Report. \b \u001d  OfficeMax promotes environmentally responsible behavior to its customers and associates through various programs and activities.  OfficeMax was the first office product retailer to provide an ink cartridge refill service, allowing retail customers to reuse printer ink cartridges instead of discarding them and, thus, reducing landfill content. \b \u001d  Through a long-term ink cartridge recycling incentive program, OfficeMax provided more than 500,000 reams of recycled content paper to customers. Today, OfficeMax offers a $3 gift card for each printer ink cartridge turned in for recycling, allowing customers greater purchase flexibility. \b \u001d  OfficeMax has committed to identifying and supporting recycled-content paper and paper products with a target of 30% average post-consumer fiber content.  Among its current selection of environmentally preferable products, OfficeMax offers recycled content paper at all retail outlets, including the first nationally distributed 100% post-consumer paper, and also promotes use of recycled content paper within the company's own operations.  OfficeMax ImPress, providing print and document production services to all OfficeMax customers, also uses recycled content paper. \b \u001d  The complete OfficeMax paper procurement policy, in addition to the company's environmental policy, can be found online at http://about.officemax.com/html/officemax_environmental_policy.shtml . \b \b    About OfficeMax(R) Incorporated \b \u001d  OfficeMax is a leader in both business-to-business and retail office products distribution.

It may take time to reinvigorate the brand, but Pottery Barn has a strong customer base. \b \u001d  YES: The five-year-old West Elm brand, which makes up a very small portion of Williams-Sonoma's revenue, will be a big growth engine. Williams-Sonoma has a history of using catalogs and online channels to develop strong brand awareness before launching retail stores. \b \u001d  YES: We expect 9.6 percent sales growth in 2007 and 2008. Williams-Sonoma needs to understand and appeal to its customer better than its competitors can. While that's not going to happen next month, it will over the next year or so. \b \u001d  YES: The home-furnishings environment is weak, but our recent survey shows that the Pottery Barn shopper spends about $2,800 a year on home furnishings and accessories, versus the average consumer's $1,045 a year. \u001d  --- \u001d  NO: \"Pottery Barn makes up 50 percent of Williams-Sonoma's revenue, and it's struggling right now. PB should be one step ahead of the competition, but it isn't keeping up.\" \u001d  -- Kristine Koerber, analyst, JMP Securities \b \u001d  NO: Pottery Barn has become stagnant, with merchandise that hasn't changed much in years. Slowing sales and bloated inventory are leading to markdowns and increased promotions. In addition, Williams-Sonoma's same-store sales were basically flat all last year. \b \u001d  NO: West Elm has been around for several years, but only 20 or so stores have opened. How is that going to support growth of the company? Meanwhile, other new rollouts, like Williams-Sonoma Home and Pottery Barn Kids, are targeting too narrow an audience at too high a price. You won't get strong growth from such a narrow base. \b \u001d  NO: We're looking at roughly 5 percent sales growth. It's not reassuring that just two quarters ago management denied there was any sort of merchandising problem, instead blaming an economic slowdown for poor sales. \b \u001d  NO: There's overall weakness in the home-furnishings market. Plus, there's competition from retailers like Target that are knocking off Pottery Barn's seasonal d&#233;cor and selling it at cheaper prices. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:01 ET (11:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6560e32930fdb304c742467bb7b9f1ca","symR":["PUM.XE","DE0006969603"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Puma 4Q Sales EUR480.6M Vs EUR349.2M >PUM.XE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T10:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PUM.XE","DE0006969603"],"IndustryCodes":["FOT","TEX","XDJGI","XISL","XMDAX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"65b9cde330b2a047d69dcd849f9c287b","symR":["FLS.UN.T","CA35902U1084"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Front Street Long/Short Income Fund Announces Distribution>FLS.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T22:18:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FLS.UN.T","CA35902U1084"],"IndustryCodes":["ZFU"],"Story":"\u001d  TORONTO, ONTARIO--(CCNMatthews - Feb. 19, 2007) - \bFront Street Long/Short Income Fund (TSX:FLS.UN) announced today a distribution of $0.05 per unit to unitholders of record on February 28, 2007, which will be paid in full on or about March 15, 2007.

(BBD.B.T) is moving ahead with plans to build a 100-seat airplane, announcing Monday a larger version of its popular CRJ900 regional jet. \u001d  Bombardier, the world's fourth-largest airplane manufacturer, already has 38 firm orders worth US$1.2 billion for the plane, although some are conversions from the CRJ900. Deliveries will begin at the end of 2009. \u001d  \"This is good news\" for Bombardier and its employees, said Bombardier Aerospace President Pierre Beaudoin, as it  expands the company's product line, could create jobs, and generates a strong return on investment. \u001d  He estimated the market for the aircraft at 400 units over the next 20 years. \u001d  The CRJ1000, as the aircraft has been dubbed, will use the same engine as the CRJ900 from which it was derived, but will have a slightly larger wingspan. It will also have the same fuselage, albeit stretched by another three meters. However, Beaudoin said the plane will also have larger windows and overhead bins, with an eye to increasing customer comfort. \u001d  The CRJ1000, which has been under study for the past two years, cost about US$300 million to develop. \u001d  Montreal-based Bombardier has also been studying the possibility of launching a 100-seat mainline airliner, dubbed the C-Series. That study, which is expected to cost US$2.1 billion, is ongoing. The company is to provide an update on the program at the end of March. \u001d  Beaudoin also confirmed the company continues to study a stretch version of its increasingly popular Q400 turboprop, which seats 75. \u001d  The widely expected launch of the CRJ1000 is slightly positive news, BMO Capital Markets said in a note. \"It will allow Bombardier to expand its product range and therefore garner more business while the development cost will be relatively small as it is a derivative of an existing family of aircraft,\" analyst Claude Proulx said. \u001d  However, he estimated any benefits to the bottom line won't be felt until fiscal 2011. \u001d  Additionally, Proulx said the launch \"does not address the issue of the long-term future of Bombardier Aerospace as the CRJ series is getting fairly old.\" \u001d  Bombardier has slowly been losing ground in the regional jet market to Brazilian manufacturer Embraer S.A. (ERJ), whose family of 50-90 seat aircraft has gained in popularity in the North American market. \u001d  Beaudoin said the CRJ1000 would have 15% lower operating costs than the Embraer ERJ195 aircraft, in part because it's lighter and thus has a smaller engine. \u001d  He said the derivative aircraft was launched due to customer request for a larger regional aircraft than the CRJ900, which seats a maximum of 90 passengers. \u001d  The CRJ1000 has three launch customers. \u001d  Brit Air of Morlaix, France, a unit of Air France-KLM (AKH), placed a firm order for eight CRJ1000 aircraft, and has taken options on eight additional CRJ1000 aircraft.

By this, they mean it is important that their actions should be seen by financial market participants and other economic agents as belonging within a decision-making framework that is readily intelligible. The received wisdom is that when central banks achieve this degree of transparency, confidence in their ability to achieve their objectives is enhanced.  They may then reach their objectives at less cost, in terms of lost economic output, than might otherwise be the case.  Judged from this viewpoint, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is probably the least efficient of the major central banks. \u001d  To be sure, the BoJ described how it would conduct monetary policy in a statement released on 9 March last year.  The BoJ views economic activity and inflation from two perspectives.  First, it examines whether the outlook for activity and for prices one to two years in the future 'deemed most likely by the Bank of Japan' follows a path of sustainable growth under price stability.  Secondly, it looks at the risk factors that are most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy, even if the probability of these risks materialising is low.  As regards price stability, the BoJ went on in its statement to give a conventional definition: price stability is a state where various economic agents including households and firms may make decisions regarding such economic activities as consumption and investments without being concerned about the fluctuations in the general price level'. When it came to specifying a rate of increase in the consumer price index that was consistent with price stability, the statement declared that the members of the BoJ policy board held differing views, though 'a range between zero and two percent was generally consistent with the distribution of each Board member's understanding of medium- to long-term price stability'.  It should be noted that 'price stability', in this formulation of the BoJ's stance, does not require current consumer price indicators to be giving positive readings.  During the era of 'quantitative easing' (up to March 2006), the BoJ stipulated that evidence of a positive trend in consumer prices would be a necessary pre-condition for ending that regime. Since March 2006, however, the BoJ's definition of 'price stability' has been forward-looking.  On the BoJ's latest forecast, published in October 2006, the central bank's favoured measure of consumer prices was set to average 0.5% in fiscal year 2007.  As long as the BoJ is able to argue credibly that the risks around this forecast do not render it implausible, the way will be clear for the BoJ policy board to press on with the task of normalising interest rates. \u001d  One problem with the BoJ's approach is that Mr Fukui and his colleagues have not yet done enough to satisfy the markets of the forward-looking focus of their policies.  For them to convince the markets that their actions were closely related to their economic projections, they would need to talk more about those projections in public.  The BoJ publishes its forecasts on a semi-annual basis, which may not be frequently enough given the primary role they are supposed to play in policymaking.  After all, the Bank of England and the ECB update forecasts on a quarterly basis.  Admittedly, the US Federal Reserve publishes semi-annual economic reports but FOMC policy decisions are not presented in relation to the specific projections for growth and inflation contained in those documents.  The BoJ does issue a brief monthly report on the economy.  In the most recent of these, released on 18 January, consumer prices were reckoned to have so far deviated slightly downward from last October's projection 'but they are expected to develop broadly in line with the projection'.  No grounds were given for this expectation.  In short, the BoJ has not done enough to explain how its thinking on policy is evolving.  An even more serious difficulty is that the markets doubt whether BoJ policymakers are the sole arbiters of monetary policy.  The political input into interest rate actions is potentially larger in Japan than elsewhere.  Japan is the only major industrial country where politicians retain the formal right to delay implementation of central bank decisions on rates.  The very fact that this power exists may well influence the votes of BoJ policymakers.  There appeared to be an instance of this prior to last month's policy meeting.  Then, the BoJ publicity machine initially prepared the markets for a rate hike but then went into reverse after strong political opposition to such a move surfaced. \u001d  Government spokesmen have been more restrained in their comments during the run-up to this week's BoJ policy meeting.  What is not clear is whether this reflects acceptance that the central bank will be raising rates this time, or concern to avoid a repetition of last month's presentational debacle. Perhaps calls at last week's G7 meeting for measures to underpin the yen exchange rate have persuaded the Abe Government to give a little ground on interest rates.  BoJ-watchers are split on what Mr Fukui and his colleagues will decide to do but money markets are signalling their expectation that rates will rise.  Indeed, the BoJ today had recourse to the largest ever one-day injection of funds into the market.  The aim was to keep short-term rates from rising by pumping liquidity into the banking system.  Even so, the overnight call rate settled only a shade under the 0.40% discount rate. One reason why BoJ policymakers have wanted to normalise official interest rates is to remove distortions in the money markets. The case for such action grows stronger. \b \u001d  -By Stephen Lewis: (+44) 20 7190 7193; sjlewis@insinger.com \u001d  (Stephen Lewis is chief economist at Insinger de Beaufort Ltd., London, independent brokers specializing in institutional business.) \u001d  Opinions expressed are those of the author, and not of Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  This column is published for information only, and it neither constitutes, nor is to be construed as, an offer to buy or sell investments.

(AIS.LN), the oldest of more than two dozen London-listed companies investing in pools of hedge funds, said its most recent share placing has boosted its assets by nearly one-third, to about GBP324 million. The company's portfolio of 30 hedge funds is managed by International Asset Management, part of ABN Amro Holding NV (ABN). \u001d  \"Interest in hedge-fund investments continues to be increasingly popular, and we are very excited to see that this issue has attracted demand from a wide range of both existing and new investors,\" Alan Djanogly, IAM's head of investments, said in a statement. \u001d  AIS became the first company of its kind when it listed on the London Stock Exchange in December 1996. Since then, it has made an annualized return of 10.13%, with no negative years, compared with a 7.77% sterling-hedged return on the MSCI World Index. \u001d  On its heels with a proposed secondary offering is New Star RBC Hedge 250 Hedge ETS PCC Ltd. (HXS.LN), or Hedge ETS. The company first came to market in November, raising $150 million. Its returns are based on the performance of the RBC Hedge 250 Index, an index of hedge funds tracked by Royal Bank of Canada (RY). Since the index's inception in July 2005, it has made an 11.1% annualized return. Returns on the index in the months since Hedge ETS' launch were 1.8% for January and 1.4% for December. \u001d  The shares are available in two classes: one with no leverage and the other using three times leverage to amplify returns. \u001d  Hedge ETS has put in a good performance in trading, with the unleveraged shares trading Monday at 104 pence, or about a 5% premium to the most-recent calculation of its portfolio's net asset value at the end of January. \u001d  Shares in closed-investment companies can trade at a premium or discount to NAV, depending on supply and demand of shares and investor sentiment for the underlying investments. \u001d  Ravi Anand, New Star's head of structured products, said Hedge ETS was set up to grow in size over time, and that further share placements will be made to meet investor demand to tap into hedge funds. \u001d  Meanwhile, BH Macro Ltd. is poised to become one of the largest listed hedge-fund vehicles if it meets its EUR1 billion fund-raising target next month. The company will be one of the few to invest in a single hedge fund rather than a pool of funds. Its closest rival, MW Tops Ltd. (TOPSE.AE), raised EUR1.5 billion in December on Euronext Amsterdam to invest in equities strategies run by hedge-fund group Marshall Wace LLP. \u001d  Listed hedge-fund vehicles have proved popular with investors as a way to get easy access to hedge funds. In contrast to offshore, open-ended funds that typically have minimum investment requirements of at least $100,000 and lock up investor's capital for a year or more, shares in exchange-traded hedge-fund companies can be traded daily in any amount. \u001d  According to ABN Amro, 20 fund-raisings last year raised nearly GBP3 billion for these kinds of companies in Europe. \u001d  For the investment managers, the vehicles are a way to raise capital that is more or less permanent. Open-ended hedge funds are subject to investor redemptions, usually on a quarterly basis. But the money managed on behalf of a closed-ended listed vehicle can only be returned if the company structure includes a mechanism allowing shareholders to vote to wind it up if the shares consistently trade below the value of the underlying portfolio. \u001d  Shares in listed hedge-fund management groups, such as London's Man Group (EMG.LN) and New York's Fortress Investment Group (FIG), have also been in demand. \u001d  Man Group is up 14% since the beginning of the year, including a 1.3% rise Monday to 596 pence. \u001d  Shares in Fortress Group priced at $19 when the hedge-fund and private-equity group went public Feb. 9, and hit a high of $37 in their first day of trading. Friday, the shares closed down 2% at $27.95. \u001d  -By Margot Patrick, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 20 7842 9451; margot.patrick@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 11:25 ET (16:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"67d6d77142501c2fb86e5705d3c91a09","symR":["NGEN"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Nanogen To Host Fourth Quarter Conference Call And Webcast On February 20, 2007>NGEN","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T13:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NGEN"],"IndustryCodes":["MDV","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2007-- \u001d  Nanogen, Inc.

Analysts had expected the figure to come in at EUR34 million. \u001d  The decline was widely expected by the market and reflects costs related to the company's so-called Phase IV growth initiatives. \u001d  Puma said it expects the 2007 margin for earnings before interest and taxes to stand at 16%, helped by lower administrative expenses. The company expects net income to grow by at least 10%, and an unchanged tax rate of 29%, in 2007. \u001d  Sales for the last three months of 2006 rose 37.6% to EUR480.6 million from EUR349.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, boosted by a strong performance of the Asia and Pacific regions. \u001d  Earnings before interest and taxation fell 24.3% to EUR41.6 million from EUR55 million in the last quarter of 2005, while the fourth-quarter EBIT margin stood at 8.7% versus 15.7% a year earlier. \u001d  Fourth-quarter gross profit margin, which rises with a company's financial health, stood at 47.7% in the fourth quarter of 2006, versus 50% in the last three months of 2005. \u001d  At 1015 GMT, Puma shares traded 0.2% lower or down EUR0.47 at EUR289.52, in a higher German market. \u001d  The company's 2006 net profit came in at EUR263.2 million, down 7.9% from EUR285.8 million in 2005, while 2006 sales came in at EUR2.37 billion, a 33.3% increase over 2005's EUR1.78 billion. \u001d  Order backlog - a carefully watched indicator for the company's future sales performance - stood at EUR1.12 billion at the end of 2006, 4.7% higher than the EUR1.07 billion a year ago. \u001d  Puma generated EUR366.2 million EBIT in 2006, after EUR397.7 million a year earlier, thus reaching an EBIT margin of 15.5%. \u001d  Puma, based in Herzogenaurach, is the world's third largest sportswear maker by sales after U.S-based Nike Inc.(NKE), and German Adidas AG (ADS.XE). \b   Company Web site: http://about.puma.com \b \u001d  -By Julia Mengewein, Dow Jones Newswires; +49 69 29725 507; julia.mengewein@dowjones.com \b \u001d  Order free Annual Report for Adidas AG\u001d  Visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0005003404 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028\u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 05:41 ET (10:41 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"68b8f6006f9f645636c4bb8771f6cfd1","symR":["00953.AE","PHG","NL0000009538"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Philips To Re-Appoint Dutine As Bd Member For 4 Yrs","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T06:37:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["00953.AE","PHG","NL0000009538"],"IndustryCodes":["CSE","ENT","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 01:37 ET (06:37 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"68d945e099e8812060604c4eb9b924eb","symR":["GMP.UN.T","CA3620171056"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": GMP Capital Trust Declares February Distribution>GMP.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T20:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GMP.UN.T","CA3620171056"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  TORONTO, Feb. 19 /CNW/ - GMP Capital Trust (the \"Fund\") announced today a monthly cash distribution of $0.125 per unit for the month of February 2007 to be paid on March 20, 2007, to unitholders of record as of February 28, 2007.

NU also reported fourth quarter 2006 earnings of $347.0 million, or $2.25 per share, compared with a loss of $13.6 million, or $0.10 per share, in the same quarter of 2005. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20060728/NORTHEASTUTILOGO ) \b \u001d  Charles W. Shivery, NU chairman, president, and chief executive officer, attributed the significant improvement to the company's strong execution of its strategic plan to exit its competitive energy businesses and focus exclusively on its regulated businesses.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, NU realized a gain of $314.1 million, or $2.03 per share, from the November 1, 2006 sale of its competitive generating facilities.  In 2005, NU's competitive businesses recorded losses of $398.2 million, or $3.03 per share, primarily as a result of marking to market various out-of-the-money wholesale energy contracts. \b \u001d  \"We are rapidly implementing the strategic plan we announced in November of 2005.  We are making significant investments in the energy delivery infrastructure New England needs,\" Shivery said.  \"These investments are critical to the region's reliability and to help it deal with some of the highest energy prices in the nation.  We are encouraged by the support we continue to receive from our policymakers to make these investments and we are pleased that we have been able to accomplish them on time and on or below budget.\" \b \u001d  Shivery said NU's regulated capital expenditures totaled $925 million in 2006, compared with $793 million in 2005.  In 2007, NU's regulated capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $1.2 billion as NU continues to build the infrastructure needed to meet the increasing demands for energy in New England.  In terms of capital projects, Shivery said NU achieved a number of milestones in 2006: \b \b \b     - The Connecticut Light and Power Company's (CL&P) 21-mile Bethel- \b       Norwalk, 345-kV transmission line was placed in service on October 12, \b       2006, approximately two months ahead of schedule and $10 million below \b       its $350 million budget. \b     - Public Service Company of New Hampshire's (PSNH) Northern Wood Power \b       Project, the conversion of a 50-mW coal-fired boiler at Schiller \b       Station in Portsmouth, New Hampshire to a renewable energy unit that \b       burns wood chips, began commercial operation on December 1, 2006 and \b       was completed below its $75 million budget. \b     - Construction of CL&P's share of the 69-mile Middletown-Norwalk 345-kV \b       transmission line began in mid-2006, about six months ahead of its \b       planned start date.  It is expected to be completed in 2009 at a cost \b       to CL&P of approximately $1.05 billion.  The project is currently about \b       16 percent complete. \b     - Construction began in October 2006 of CL&P's 9-mile, 115-kV Glenbrook \b       underground transmission project between Norwalk and Stamford, \b       Connecticut.  Completion is expected in 2008 at a cost of approximately \b       $183 million.  The project is currently about 20 percent complete. \b     - Yankee Gas Service Company's 1.2 bcf, $108 million liquefied natural \b       gas storage facility in Waterbury, Connecticut, which is expected to \b       improve reliability and lower overall customer costs, is approximately \b       90 percent complete and expected to be available for the 2007-2008 \b       heating season. \b \b    Also: \b \b     - Western Massachusetts Electric Company's (WMECO) two-year distribution \b       rate settlement was approved by Massachusetts regulators in December \b       2006 and implemented January 1, 2007. \b \b    2007 Earnings Guidance \b \u001d  NU today affirmed its 2007 consolidated earnings guidance of between $1.30 per share and $1.55 per share.  NU projects earnings from its electric and natural gas distribution and regulated electric generation of between $0.80 per share and $0.90 per share in 2007.  NU projects transmission earnings of between $0.50 per share and $0.60 per share in 2007 and parent company earnings of between $0.00 and $0.05 per share.  NU also projects approximately breakeven results at its remaining competitive businesses in 2007, excluding the impact of marking to market its decreasing level of wholesale electricity commitments. \b \b    2006 Results \b \u001d  Shivery said NU's improved results in 2006 were due primarily to the impact of executing the company's strategic plan, including the sale of its competitive generation and achieving higher transmission earnings on a larger transmission investment base.  Additionally, as previously announced, CL&P recorded income of $74 million, or $0.48 per share, in the third quarter of 2006 as a result of a reduction of income tax expense related to a private letter ruling (PLR) CL&P received earlier this year from the Internal Revenue Service.  Comparisons with previous year's results also benefited from the absence of charges NU recorded in 2005 as a result of the company's decision to divest its wholesale marketing and energy services businesses. \b \u001d  Excluding the impact of the generation sale and the PLR, NU's regulated businesses and parent company and affiliates earned $54.9 million, or $0.36 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $40.5 million, or $0.29 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2005.  For the full year, excluding such items, those businesses earned $178.2 million, or $1.16 per share, in 2006, compared with $144.7 million, or $1.10 per share, in 2005.  NU had earlier projected 2006 earnings for those business segments, excluding the PLR, of between $1.09 per share and $1.22 per share. \b \b    Regulated Business Results \b \u001d  The transmission segments of NU's three electric companies earned $16.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $59.8 million in full-year 2006, compared with $10.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $41.1 million in full-year 2005.  Increased full-year earnings were primarily a result of a higher level of investment, particularly in Connecticut. \b \u001d  NU's regulated electric and natural gas distribution and electric generation earnings were $47.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $197.5 million for the full year of 2006, compared with $38.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $122.3 million in the full year of 2005. \b \u001d  CL&P's distribution business earned $33.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $147.6 million for the full year of 2006, compared with $19.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $60.0 million in the full year of 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 results include recognition of an after-tax $7.7 million deferred gain related to the sale of NU's competitive generation assets.  That gain is eliminated in consolidated NU results.  Fourth quarter CL&P 2005 results included $8.5 million in after-tax termination and employee benefit curtailment charges.  Absent the impact of the aforementioned reduction in income tax expense from the PLR and the deferred gain, CL&P's distribution business would have earned $65.9 million in 2006.  Higher distribution rates in 2006 and a lower effective tax rate were partially offset by lower sales, higher storm-related expenses, and higher interest costs, compared with 2005. \b \u001d  PSNH's distribution and generation business earned $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $27.0 million for full-year 2006, compared with $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $33.9 million for full-year 2005.  The lower results were due primarily to a higher effective tax rate. PSNH's unitary state corporate income tax is impacted by the profitability of the NU system in its entirety.  Therefore, PSNH's state income taxes were higher in 2006 due to the competitive business divestiture gains recorded in 2006 by NU, and PSNH's state income taxes were lower in 2005 due to the significant losses recorded that year by NU's competitive businesses. \b \u001d  WMECO's distribution business earned $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and $11.0 million in full-year 2006, compared with $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $11.1 million in full-year 2005. \b \u001d  Yankee Gas earned $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and earned $11.9 million for the full-year 2006, compared with earnings of $7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $17.3 million for full-year 2005.  Yankee Gas earnings were lower due primarily to an 11.2 percent decline in firm sales in 2006, compared with 2005, largely the result of milder weather in 2006. \b \u001d  Shivery said 2006 regulated electric sales declined as a result of lower use per customer.  He said the lower use was due to a combination of milder summer and winter weather in 2006, compared with 2005, and customer reaction to higher energy prices. \b \u001d  Overall, retail electric sales were down 4.0 percent in 2006, compared with 2005, with residential sales off 5.6 percent, commercial sales off 2.3 percent, and industrial sales down 4.5 percent.  On a weather-adjusted basis, retail electric sales were down 1.6 percent in 2006, compared with 2005.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, retail electric sales were down 5.5 percent from the same period of 2005 and 3.1 percent on a weather-adjusted basis. \b \b    Competitive Business Results \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 16:35 ET (21:35 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"6ccdbcefefc0fb43f27864e1e93aa069","symR":["MOG.T","CA60975V1067"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MonoGen To Buy Back Mfg Rights For MonoPrep Processor, Lease Obligations","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T13:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MOG.T","CA60975V1067"],"IndustryCodes":["MDS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 08:22 ET (13:22 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6cecb4350f42365a4f06d7c32fef4612","symR":["PMZ.UN.T","CA74157U1093"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Primaris Retail REIT Announces February Distribution>PMZ.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T19:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PMZ.UN.T","CA74157U1093"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\b   TORONTO, ONTARIO--(CCNMatthews - Feb. 19, 2007) - Primaris Retail REIT (TSX:PMZ.UN) announces today its February 2007 monthly distribution in the amount of $0.0983.

\u001d  (This updates an article published at 0618 GMT, adding further detail and analyst comment.) \b \u001d  By Goran Mijuk \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  ZURICH (Dow Jones)--Reinsurer Converium Holding AG (CHR) Monday said its board has rejected an unsolicited bid by French competitor Scor SA (SCO) that values the Swiss firm at about CHF3 billion, or $2.4 billion, saying independence would create more value for shareholders. \u001d  The takeover fight comes amid growing mergers and acquisition activity in the insurance sector, as companies  increasingly seek to tap external sources to spur their expansion due to slowing organic growth in markets such as Europe and the U.S. \u001d  \"The directors are unanimous in their rejection of this proposal\", Converium said in a statement, adding, \"The proposal fundamentally fails to recognize the value of Converium's franchise and growth prospects, and is, therefore, not in the interest of Converium, its shareholders, and its customers\". \u001d  Under Scor's proposal, the French company, which is roughly double the size of Converium, would be prepared to pay CHF21 per Converium share, constituting a 12.3% premium to Converium's closing price of CHF18.7 last Friday. \u001d  \"A takeover of Converium by Scor would make sense as it would give Scor's underwriting ability another boost and strengthen its non-life business\", said Stefan Schuermann, analyst at Cheuvreux, who rates the stock at outperform. \u001d  A takeover of Converium by Scor would create a company with annual premiums of about EUR5.3 billion, catapulting both companies into the top ten of the world's largest reinsurers, which are led by Swiss Reinsurance Co (RUKN.VX), Munich Re (MUV2.XE) and Berkshire Hathaway Re, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKB). \u001d  However analysts question the financing of the deal and doubt that a hostile takeover bid will convince Swiss shareholders to sell their holdings. \u001d  Scor, which recently took over Revios Group, has in the past repeatedly tapped shareholder money to either revamp its own structure, buy out minorities or finance takeover transactions, raising analysts doubts that shareholders may not be prepared to finance another deal. \u001d  Scor wasn't available to comment on the bid. \u001d  However, analysts said that the timing of the bid was accurate as Converium shares are still relatively cheap due to the company's restructuring. \u001d  Converium is still smarting from heavy restructuring in the wake of a massive reserve shortfall in the U.S. in 2004, which required the company to issue new shares, reduce its staff and exit the U.S. reinsurance market. \u001d  Although the company has turned profitable since then, and today boasts a strong capital base, Converium is still rated triple-B by most rating agencies, a level that is deemed too low for a reinsurer to do bulk business. \u001d  However, Converium expects an upgrade to the crucial A-level later this year once an industry-wide probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to be finalized. \u001d  \"A hostile bid will be very difficult to push through and will depend on Converium's key shareholders\", Cheuvreux's Schuermann said. \u001d  Converium has a broad shareholder base: Most, around 51%, are located in Switzerland, followed by 24% in the U.K. and 21% in the U.S. \u001d  Among the larger shareholders are Zuercher Kantonalbank with a roughly 7% stake. Analysts say that Swiss shareholders, mostly pension funds, may be reluctant to divest the stock at the proposed price. \b \u001d  Company Web Site:http://www.converium.com \b \u001d  -By Goran Mijuk, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 80 47; goran.mijuk@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 02:58 ET (07:58 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6ecaf6228600028f4a43e3fbead6c2ba","symR":["BWTR"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Basin Water, Inc. to Present at the Roth Capital Partners 19th Annual Orange County Conference","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T19:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BWTR"],"IndustryCodes":["WAT","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\bRANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2007-- \u001d  Basin Water, Inc.

PCL (SHIN.TH) early last year. \u001d  However, Sittichai clouded the issue of what the ministry plans to do by saying that it wouldn't be necessary to buy back Shin Satellite if it is determined to be a foreign-owned company, as its operating concession could be revoked. \u001d  The ministry plans to investigate the nationality of Kularb Kaew Co., a holding company allegedly used by Temasek as a nominee shareholder of Shin Corp. to evade a 49% limit on foreign company ownership. \u001d  However, Shin Corp. owns only 41.3% of Shin Satellite, so the latter may not be deemed a foreign company even if Kularb Kaew and Shin Corp. are ruled to be foreign-owned. \b \u001d  -By Phisanu Phromchanya, Dow Jones Newswires; 66 2266 0744; phisanu.phromchanya@dowjones.com \u001d  -Edited by Craig Lewis \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 00:02 ET (05:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6f721a325009f74139527c6d2ee379c1","symR":["UKDAY","UKDAY"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EUROPEAN MORNING BRIEFING:Momentum Pushes Markets Higher","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T06:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UKDAY"],"IndustryCodes":[""],"Story":"\bDJIA         12767.57   +2.56  +0.02% \bNasdaq        2496.31   -0.79  -0.03% \bS&P 500       1455.54   -1.27  -0.09% \bFTSE 100      6419.50  -13.80  -0.21% \bXetra DAX     6957.07   -1.55  -0.02% \bCAC40         5713.59   -7.29  -0.13% \bAbove are closing prices \b \bNikkei 225   17951.68   +76.03  +0.42% \bHang Seng      Closed \bS&P/ASX 200   5990.10   +36.40  +0.61% \bTaiwan Index   Closed \bS.Korea Kospi  Closed \bDow Future     Closed \bNASDAQ Future  Closed \bS&P Future     Closed \bAbove are as of 0550 GMT \b \bUSD/JPY      119.44-47         +0.04% \bRange        119.60 - 119.23 \bEUR/USD      1.3151-54         -0.03% \bRange        1.3163 - 1.3146 \bAUD/USD      0.7877-80         -0.03% \bRange        0.7881 - 0.7869 \bGBP/USD      1.9541-45          0.00% \bRange        1.9566 - 1.9523 \bUSD/CHF      1.2341-44          +0.1% \bRange        1.2345 - 1.2316 \bAbove are as of 0550 GMT vs NY close \b \bUSD/JPY Vol Option Contract 7.45%/7.75% \bEUR/USD Vol Option Contract 5.62%/5.88% \bAUD/USD Vol Option Contract 6.31%/6.56% \bGBP/USD Vol Option Contract 6.23%/6.48% \bUSD/CHF Vol Option Contract 6.35%/6.60% \bAbove are 1-Mo prices as of 0500 GMT \b \b2Y Tsy   100  2/32   flat  4.83% +0.4 \b5Y Tsy   100 10/32  +1/32  4.68% -1.1 \b10Y Tsy   99 16/32  +4/32  4.69% -1.7 \b10Y JGB 1.7100% +0.0100 \bClosing Treasury prices vs prior NY close; JGB as of 0550 GMT \b \bAsian Spot Gold $671.20  +$2.70 +0.4% \bComex Gold      $676.10  +$3.30 +0.5% \bBrent Crude Oil  $58.87  -$0.08 -0.1% \bAbove are as of 0550 GMT vs NY close \b \u001d  EUROPEAN OUTLOOK & US/ASIAN SUMMARIES: \u001d  European shares are likely to push higher to start as major equity markets maintain their positive run. The euro is seen firmer along with gold, while government debt is likely to open little changed with oil lower. \u001d  STOCKS: \u001d  European shares are likely to start the week higher, maintaining their recent technical momentum, but with very few corporate or economic events scheduled Monday, prices may drift as the session progresses. \u001d  Spreadbettor IG Index is calling the FTSE up 12 points at 6431, the DAX up 13 at 6970 and the CAC up 10 at 5723. \u001d  Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank, said, \"We've probably got another three months of upside barring any serious accidents. I rather think that the current upward leg of the bull run, which has been in place since last summer, will probably find it difficult to continue going at its present pace,\" pointing to a recent spate of disappointing earnings. \u001d  DaimlerChrysler is moving forward with preparations to sell or spin off the Chrysler Group, raising the prospect that it could auction off the embattled U.S. unit in the coming months, two people close to the matter told The Wall Street Journal. \u001d  On Friday, a larger-than-expected drop in housing starts gave Wall Street a narrowly mixed performance, but the Dow Jones industrials had their third straight record close after spending much of the session in a decline that lacked conviction. \u001d  The U.S. market, after Monday's national holiday, will look to Wednesday's inflation figures for the impetus to extending its advance. \u001d  Remarks last week from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that economic growth and inflation are moderating sent stocks soaring last week, pushing the Dow Jones industrials to another series of record highs. \u001d  Analysts expect the CPI to show an increase of 0.1 percent in January, slower than December's 0.4 percent. But they expect the core CPI - which strips out volatile food and energy prices - to register a rise of 0.2 percent, higher than December's 0.1 percent. \u001d  For more clues about where rates are headed, investors will pore over the Federal Open Market Committee's minutes from the Jan. 31 meeting, which also will be released Wednesday. \u001d  The coming week will bring some of the last large earnings reports for the fourth quarter of 2006. Perhaps most interesting will be retailers Wal-Mart Stores, Home Depot and Lowe's, whose results and outlook statements could provide clues to how strong consumer spending is and the extent to which the housing slump is crimping sales of home improvement-related goods. \u001d  Japanese stocks rose Monday to their highest in nearly seven years on reports of a possible department store merger between Daimaru and Matsuzakaya Holdings. The sector's gains outpaced the selling of power and telecommunications stocks. Traders said the 18,000 mark in the Nikkei seemed within reach. \u001d  Broad-based support pushed the Australian market up. \"We're only one big takeover away from a 200-300 points rally,\" said David Halliday, associate director at Macquarie Equities. Some dealers expect the market to make new highs in the near future, although they are awaiting more results from the corporate earnings period. \u001d  Many other markets in Asia were closed for the Lunar New Year. \u001d  Citigroup is considering listing its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a move that would make it easier to buy Japanese companies and accelerate its planned expansion in the world's second biggest economy. \u001d  FOREX: \u001d  The euro starts the European session on solid footing against the dollar and yen. It has open technical area until $1.3282, as the view of a less aggressive Fed lends support. \u001d  The euro has resistance against the yen at around Y157.50, some way from its latest quote at around Y157.20. The BOJ's meeting Wednesday, with the risk of a rate hike, will keep activity light. \u001d  \"Even if a Japanese rate hike takes place this week, unless the BOJ suggests plans for additional rate hikes, the yen is likely to fall\", says Osamu Takashima, chief analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. \u001d  BONDS: \u001d  European government bond prices may open little changed Monday, after falling Friday as investors took some profit from sharp gains earlier. \u001d  Technical resistance could prove too strong for the market. \u001d  Otherwise Monday is likely to be a quiet session with U.S. markets closed for a holiday. \u001d  U.K. house prices rose in the early weeks of February, but U.K. property estate agency Rightmove Monday reported that the 0.9% monthly increase was the lowest February rise in the five-year history of the survey, suggesting would-be house buyers are cautious following the Bank of England's surprise January rate increase. \u001d  Wednesday brings minutes from the February Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee while Friday's highlight is the German February Ifo business climate survey. \u001d  Treasury prices closed higher Friday after news that builders started the fewest homes in nearly a decade in January, suggesting that the housing market slowdown has yet to reached a bottom. \u001d  This week, with a slim data calendar and several Asian markets closed for the Lunar Year holiday, the Treasury market's gains could well more modest when trading resumes Tuesday. \u001d  Japan's government bonds fell slightly in price Monday  as investors took a cautious stance ahead of the BOJ meeting this week. \u001d  ENERGY: \u001d  Oil prices fell 30 cents to $59.09 Monday amid news of the release of an American oil worker kidnapped in Nigeria. Worries of escalating unrest in Africa's largest crude producer had pushed oil futures up more than $1 a barrel on Friday. \u001d  Meanwhile, Iran's oil minister said Saturday the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would not institute any further cut in its output ceiling at its March meeting in Vienna if the price of crude oil maintains its current upward trend. \u001d  METALS: \u001d  Spot gold was up $2.70 at $671.20, but the market's target of $700 seemed out of reach for now because the market is slightly overbought, dealers said. Traders will avoid adding to positions at current levels because of the Lunar New Year holidays and Monday's holiday in the U.S. \u001d  Copper futures were slightly lower. \u001d  CALENDAR: Monday, February 19, 2007 \bGMT                                                        Expected  Previous \bN/A   US           Presidents Day holiday; all banks, \b                   businesses, govt offices, markets \b                   closed \b \u001d  -By Dennis Baker; Dow Jones Newswires; dennis.baker@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 01:00 ET (06:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6f89b7bdc8f87e56006f376e55580a05","symR":["RAL.T","CA7509131057"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Rally Energy To Issue 10M Common Shrs At C$5 Each >RAL.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T20:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RAL.T","CA7509131057"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 15:16 ET (20:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"705ffc6bb742b9c2d1e5399cb3182fda","symR":["6758.TO","BRT.YY","EMI.LN","SNE","WMG","GB0000444736","JP3435000009"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EMI Hldr Eclectica Writes To Chmn Outlining \"Concerns\" -2","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T15:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6758.TO","BRT.YY","EMI.LN","SNE","WMG","GB0000444736","JP3435000009"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","CSE","ENT","MED","MOV","PUB","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  In the letter, a copy of which was seen by Dow Jones Newswires, Eclectica outlined its key \"concerns\" as two profit warnings since the start of the year, the dismissal or removal of Alain Levy, the former chief executive of EMI's recorded music unit, his deputy David Munns and head of music publishing Martin Bandier, the discovery of an accounting irregularity at the Brazilian subsidiary, and the rejection of two takeover proposals. \u001d  The letter points to Chrysalis Group PLC (CHS.LN), the U.K. radio and music publishing company, as having \"set a precedent\" by publishing the revenue it gets after paying artists. \"We believe such disclosure would be constructive to EMI's valuation...As a shareholder we strongly urge the Board to revisit the depth and granularity of disclosure,\" the letter said. \u001d  Eclectica said it believes in \"working in cooperation with the Board\" and \"would welcome an invitation to meet.\" \u001d  Eclectica partner and Chief Investment Officer, Hugh Hendry, told Dow Jones Newswires last week he believed most of EMI's value resided in its music publishing business.

(NYSE:MDT) announced today the first U.S. patient implant in a feasibility study to evaluate the use of the Medtronic Melody(TM) Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve and Ensemble(TM) Transcatheter Delivery System to treat patients requiring congenital pulmonary heart valve replacement. \b \u001d  The prospective, non-randomized, feasibility clinical trial will enroll 30 patients at three U.S. medical centers including: \b \b   --  Children's Hospital Boston (Boston, MA) with investigators \b        James Lock, MD Cardiologist-in-Chief and Emile Bacha, MD \b        Senior Associate in Cardiac Surgery \b \b   --  Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York - Presbyterian \b        (New York, NY) with investigators Dr. William Hellenbrand, MD \b        Director of Catheterization Laboratory for Congenital Heart \b        Disease and Ralph Mosca, MD Director of Pediatric Cardiac \b        Surgery \b \b   --  Miami Children's Hospital (Miami, FL) with investigators Evan \b        Zahn, MD Chief, Cardiology and Redmond Burke, MD Chief \b        Cardiovascular Surgery \b \u001d  \"We are excited about the promise of bringing this new, non-surgical procedure to the thousands of U.S. patients suffering from congenital heart disease with defects that disrupt the blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery,\" said Dr. James Lock, Cardiologist-in-Chief at Children's Hospital Boston. \"Our first implant has been conducted with positive results - both clinically and from a quality of life perspective - for the patient by delaying the need for an invasive open heart procedure to restore valve function.\" \b \u001d  \"Effective management of congenital heart defects over a patient's lifetime requires dedicated collaboration between cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists,\" added Dr. John Mayer, Senior Associate in Cardiac Surgery at Children's Hospital Boston. \"Together, members of these two disciplines draw on a variety of treatment options and clinical pathways. We hope that the Melody valve will be an important addition to the choices available for our patients.\" \b \u001d  Oftentimes, this type of defect requires open heart surgery early in life to implant a prosthetic or bioprosthetic valved-conduit to establish adequate blood flow from the heart to the lungs. However, the functional life span of these conduits is relatively limited, and as a result, most patients with this type of defect may require multiple open heart surgeries to place new valved conduits as they grow over their lifetime. To meet this clinical need, Medtronic will use this trial to evaluate the Melody valve and Ensemble delivery system as a catheter-based alternative treatment in order to restore effective pulmonary valve function and potentially prolong the functional life of the right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduits. This alternative treatment will thereby reduce the number of open heart surgeries these patients must undergo. \b \u001d  \"The initiation of the feasibility trial and first successful implant continues to demonstrate Medtronic's commitment to providing new heart valve technologies for use in treating unmet patient needs,\" said Dr. John Liddicoat, vice president of Structural Heart Disease for the Cardiac Surgery business at Medtronic. \"We hope that the Melody valve and Ensemble system will prove to be two more examples of Medtronic's commitment to improving clinical outcomes, and our focus on patient-centered lifetime management of structural heart disease.\" \b \u001d  Medtronic has partnered with Professor Philipp Bonhoeffer, professor and chief of cardiology and director of the Catheterization Laboratory, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (GOSH) in London, and NuMed Canada, a pediatric catheter company in the development of the Melody valve and Ensemble system. A pioneer in transcatheter valve technology, Professor Bonhoeffer implanted the world's first transcatheter valve in September 2000. To date, more than 200 patients have been treated with the therapy. \b \u001d  While the Melody valve and Ensemble system are not currently available in the United States, Medtronic has received Canadian approval and CE Mark approval in Europe for commercial sale of the Medtronic Melody Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve and Ensemble Transcatheter Delivery System. \b \b   About Medtronic \b \u001d  Medtronic, Inc.

We have once more delivered outstanding shareholder value through the combination of good results, continued investment in our business, increased dividends and our share buyback programme. The acquisition of New Skies has already delivered significant synergies, and the acquisition of ND SatCom was closely followed by the successful bid for the German government contract.\" \b \u001d  \"More recently, we have announced a transaction with GE to buy back their 19.5% stake in SES for assets and cash. This deal delivers value to shareholders which will be boosted by the cancellation of the bulk of the acquired shares. The resulting restructuring of our asset portfolio streamlines and improves our geographic positioning without changing our overall group strategy of growing and delivering shareholder value.\" \b \u001d  \"The outlook for 2007 is positive. SES forecasts continued revenue growth which, with the planned share buyback and increased dividend, delivers industry-leading total returns to shareholders.\" \b \b   Operations Review \b \u001d  In 2006 the SES group (\"the Group\") continued to develop and strengthen its position in the industry. \b \u001d  The acquisition and integration of SES NEW SKIES into the Group was achieved in line with plan. This acquisition delivered high quality capacity and coverage of parts of the world where the SES footprint was incomplete or delivered via minority participations. Significant progress was made in delivering synergies from the acquisition, with spacecraft control operations transferred to SES ASTRA's facility at Betzdorf, Luxembourg and payload operations control being transferred to SES AMERICOM's facility at Woodbine, Maryland. The acquisition of ND SatCom, and the subsequent award of a major German government contract, boosted SES ASTRA's presence in this market segment, complementing the activities of AMERICOM Government Services. \b \u001d  Demand for satellite capacity in the European media market remains strong, supported by the continuing growth of existing satellite Direct-to-Home (DTH) markets and the establishment of new markets in Central and Eastern Europe. In North America, growth in the enterprise and consumer broadband sector and DTH broadcasting has created substantial demand for Ku-band satellite capacity, much of which is supplied by SES and its affiliates. The growth of High-Definition TV in Europe and North America, as well as the demand for global solutions from the US government, gathers pace and will be a feature of demand growth in the coming years. \b \u001d  Of total Group revenues, infrastructure activities contributed 83.4% (2005: 85.2%), and services activities 16.6% (2005: 14.8%). The growth in service revenues results from the successful implementation of the Group's strategy of developing its business in this area. \b \b   Infrastructure \b \u001d  Group infrastructure activities delivered revenues of EUR 1,416.7 million in 2006, with an EBITDA margin of 78.8%. \b \u001d  At the end of 2006, the number of commercially utilised transponders across the group was 760, a utilisation rate of 75%. Excluding the new capacity acquired with New Skies, the utilisation rate rose to 76%, or 608 of 804 commercially available transponders. \b \bSES Group              Utilised       %        Available \b \bASTRA segment            251         82%         305 \bAMERICOM segment         357         71%         499 \bNEW SKIES segment        152         71%         215 \b \bFull scope               760         75%        1,019 \bSame scope               608         76%         804 \b \b   EMEA \b \u001d  SES ASTRA continued to deliver the highest growth in the sector, having benefited from the continued increase in demand for its prime transponder capacity in its major markets at 19.2(degree) East and 28.2(degree) East; maintained growth in DTH broadcasting; concluded further HDTV deals in the French and German markets; and developed and promoted the new orbital position at 23.5(degree) East. \b \u001d  Of the 305 transponders commercially available in the SES ASTRA satellite fleet, 251, or 82%, were contracted at December 31, 2006, a net increase of 30 over the previous year. \b \u001d  Additional capacity was contracted with a range of broadcasters across all markets, including UPC Direct for development of their Central and Eastern European programming packages and TV Polska for their digital bouquet in Poland. New contracts were signed by Canal+, Anixe and National Geographic for their High-Definition broadcasting packages. Important renewals were also secured, with ProSiebenSat.1 at 19.2(degree) East and the BBC at 28.2(degree) East. \b \u001d  In January 2007, SES ASTRA significantly enhanced its position in the important French market with the signing of a new long-term contract with the French Pay-TV operator CANAL+ Group for the transmission of its programme bouquet from SES ASTRA's prime orbital position 19.2(degree) East. SES ASTRA will transmit the full programming line-up of CANAL+ Group from a single orbital position, providing the framework for the future growth requirements of this key long-term customer. \b \b   EMEA satellite fleet developments \b \u001d  ASTRA 1KR was launched in April and entered commercial service in July 2006. ASTRA 1KR has 32 active transponders and provides distribution of DTH broadcast services for customers across Europe, with an extended reach into Eastern Europe. The new satellite allowed SES ASTRA to replace its satellites ASTRA 1B and ASTRA 1C at the same orbital position. \b \u001d  In order to further optimise the ASTRA fleet, SES ASTRA ordered the procurement of the ASTRA 3B spacecraft from Astrium in November 2006. This will be a state-of-the-art Ku- and Ka-band spacecraft designed for the distribution of both DTH broadcast services and two-way broadband services across Europe and the Middle East. The satellite will have 52 transponders of which 20 are to replace existing in-orbit capacity while 32 represent new capacity. ASTRA 3B, scheduled for launch in Q4 2009, will be positioned at 23.5(degree) East thereby strengthening this third orbital position for European DTH services. The ASTRA 1D satellite is now stationed at 23.5(degree) East, with 16 commercially available frequencies on top of the 20 available on ASTRA 3A, allowing the immediate further development of this position prior to the launch of ASTRA 3B. \b \u001d  Due to tight launch manifests and launch timing issues at our launch providers, the 2007 launches of ASTRA 1L and SIRIUS 4 have been slightly rescheduled. The launch of ASTRA 1L on Ariane V is now scheduled for beginning of May 2007 instead of in Q1 2007. SIRIUS 4 is now scheduled for launch on Proton in July 2007 instead of in Q2 2007. The launches of ASTRA 1M in Q2 2008, and ASTRA 3B in Q4, 2009, are still on schedule. There is no material financial impact arising from the launch reschedules. \b \b   Americas \b \u001d  During 2006, SES AMERICOM continued to build on its leading position for providing satellite capacity in North America. Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) renewed and expanded its agreement with SES AMERICOM, becoming the anchor customer on AMC-21 in advance of its launch in 2008. Other significant 2006 signings included Turner Broadcasting Service (TBS) and Hughes Network Systems (HNS). 2006 also saw Scripps Networks launch two new HD channels, Home & Garden Television HD (HGTV HD) and Food Network HD, on SES AMERICOM's HD-PRIME neighbourhood. \b \u001d  The SES AMERICOM satellite fleet and the supporting terrestrial networks continued to operate with a high degree of reliability. Of the 499 transponders commercially available in the SES AMERICOM satellite fleet, 357, or 71.4%, were contracted at December 31, 2006, a net increase of 29 over the previous year. \b \b   Americas satellite fleet developments \b \u001d  AMC-18, carrying 24 C-band transponders for the extended HD-PRIME neighbourhood at 105(degree) West, was launched in December 2006 and entered commercial service at the beginning of February 2007. AMC-18 represents the third satellite in SES AMERICOM's HD-PRIME neighbourhood, and will be used to distribute both standard- and High-Definition programming to cable head-ends throughout the United States. \b \u001d  The AMC-21 satellite was procured to deliver 24 Ku-band transponders with 50-State coverage and is scheduled for launch in Q2 2008. SES AMERICOM's Canadian affiliate company Ciel began the procurement of its Ciel-2 satellite, scheduled for launch in Q4 2008. AMC-14, remains on schedule for launch in Q4 2007 onboard a Proton rocket. \b \b   SES NEW SKIES \b \b   2006 marked the arrival of New Skies Satellites ('New Skies') into \bthe SES Group of companies.

The ex-distribution date is February 26. \b \bFollowing a 21-month period of consistent monthly distributions to Unitholders of $0.10 per Trust unit, the Board of Directors has determined that a decrease in distributions to Unitholders at this time is prudent in light of the significant drop in commodity prices. The Board of Directors reviews the Trust's distribution policy monthly and sets the rate based on commodity prices, financial market conditions, internal capital investment opportunities and target payout ratios. The decision to lower monthly distributions to Unitholders at this time was made to ensure SOUND is well positioned to focus on further development of its asset base that includes approximately 460,000 acres of net undeveloped land and a multi-year inventory of identified drilling opportunities. This strategy will return the Trust to a low payout ratio of 51% and provide financial stability for the coming years, resulting in a sustainable entity over the longer term. \b \bGuidance \b \b=------- \b \bThe Trust is pleased to provide guidance for 2007 as set out in the table below. The following information is based on commodity price assumptions of US$55.00/bbl West Texas Intermediate crude and $7.00/Mcf AECO natural gas. The guidance incorporates the revised distribution level and lower commodity price assumptions than originally budgeted. The Trust expects that the decrease in distributions, combined with an updated hedging program, will result in a more sustainable distribution level and added protection of SOUND's 2007 capital program. \b \b \b    << \b    2007 Forecast \b    ------------- \b \b    Capital program                   $31.3 million \b    Average annual production         10,206 boe/d \b    Cash flow                         $78.1 million \b    Distributions to Unitholders      $40.2 million \b    Payout ratio                      51% \b \b \b    Capital Program \b    --------------- \b \b    The capital program for 2007 of $31.3 million will be allocated as follows \bover the Trust's four principal producing areas: \b \b        -  Northern Alberta:          $9.5 million \b        -  Peace River Arch:          $6.7 million \b        -  Central Alberta:           $8.3 million \b        -  Saskatchewan:              $6.8 million \b    >> \b \b \bFunding for the capital program will be provided entirely by funds flow from operations. The reduction in distributions will allow SOUND to maintain debt levels for 2007 and no increase in leverage is anticipated for the year. The Trust will maintain a lower payout ratio in the future and focus on asset development to provide Unitholder value through growth achieved from exploitation and exploration activities. \b \bSOUND's capital expenditure plans for 2007 will consist of a balanced mix of development and exploration projects for both natural gas and crude oil. \b \bReserve Information \b \b=------------------ \b \bThe reserves information for SOUND set out below is derived from the recently completed year-end 2006 reserves evaluation prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd. (\"GLJ\"), a Calgary-based independent reserves engineering firm, and the disclosure refers to working-interest reserves before the deduction of royalty burdens payable. \b \bThe year-end reserves report (the \"GLJ Report\") was prepared using definitions as set out under National Instrument 51-101 (\"NI 51-101\"), GLJ's forecast prices and costs as at January 1, 2007 in the case of the report effective December 31, 2006, and January 1, 2006 in the case of the report effective December 31, 2005. \b \bTotal proved plus probable (\"P+P\") reserves increased from 23.6 million boe (\"MMboe\") at December 31, 2005 to 33.0 MMboe at December 31, 2006, which represents an increase of 40%. \b \bTotal proved reserves increased from 16.2 million boe at December 31, 2005 to 20.5 MMboe at December 31, 2006, which represents an increase of 27%. \b \bProved developed producing reserves increased from 11.8 MMboe at December 31, 2005 to 14.0 MMboe at December 31, 2006, which represents an increase of 19%. \b \bBased on current production of approximately 10,500 boe/d and P+P reserves of 33.0 MMboe as estimated by GLJ, SOUND's reserve life index (\"RLI\") is 8.6 years, 16% longer than a year ago when it was 7.4 years. \b \bThe following tables summarize certain information contained in the GLJ Report. More detailed information on SOUND's year-end reserves will be included in the Annual Information Form, which will be filed on SEDAR on or before March 31, 2007. \b \bIt should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented in the tables below represent the fair market value of the reserves. There is no assurance that the forecast prices and costs assumptions will be attained, and variances could be material. The recovery and reserve estimates of SOUND's crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves provided herein are estimates only, and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein. \b \b \b    << \b               SUMMARY OF WORKING INTEREST OIL AND GAS RESERVES \b                 AND NET PRESENT VALUES OF FUTURE NET REVENUE \b                       USING FORECAST PRICES AND COSTS \b \b                             ------------------------ ----------------------- \b                                 DECEMBER 31, 2005       DECEMBER 31, 2006 \b                                     RESERVES                RESERVES \b                             ------------------------ ----------------------- \b                             OIL AND  NATURAL         OIL AND  NATURAL \b    RESERVES CATEGORY         NGLs      GAS     BOE    NGLs      GAS    BOE \b    -----------------------  ------- -------- ------- ------- -------- ------ \b                             (Mbbls)   (Bcf)  (Mbbls) (Mbbls)   (Bcf)  (Mboe) \b \b    PROVED \b      Developed Producing      6,531    31.6  11,803   5,774    49.7  14,050 \b      Non-Producing            1,733    16.1   4,416   3,260    19.4   6,499 \b                              ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- \b    TOTAL PROVED               8,264    47.7  16,219   9,034    69.1  20,549 \b    PROBABLE                   3,816    21.7   7,422   5,637    40.7  12,420 \b                              ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- \b    TOTAL PROVED PLUS \b     PROBABLE                 12,080    69.4  23,641  14,671   109.8  32,969 \b                              ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- \b                              ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- \b \b \b \b                                    NET PRESENT VALUES OF FUTURE NET REVENUE \b                                       BEFORE INCOME TAXES DISCOUNTED AT \b                                   ------------------------------------------ \b    RESERVES CATEGORY                       5%            8%           10% \b    -----------------------------  -------------- ------------- ------------- \b    ($000s) \b \b    PROVED: \b      Developed Producing                295,592       269,001       254,453 \b      Non-Producing                       95,504        80,519        72,652 \b                                   -------------- ------------- ------------- \b    TOTAL PROVED                         391,097       349,520       327,105 \b    PROBABLE                             191,809       158,031       140,689 \b                                   -------------- ------------- ------------- \b    TOTAL PROVED PLUS PROBABLE           582,906       507,551       467,794 \b                                   -------------- ------------- ------------- \b \b    The following sets forth certain selected benchmark reference prices, as \bat January 1, 2007, reflected in the reserves data above.

Both initiatives are designed to provide insights into the demographics, clinical descriptors, contemporary treatment, and outcomes of patients with hypertensive emergency. The data, once collected, will be used to improve patient care and to provide focus for future clinical research priorities. \b \u001d  Acute severe hypertension, a life-threatening condition affecting nearly three million patients in the US annually, is found in conjunction with conditions such as stroke, acute myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, heart failure, end stage renal disease (hypertensive emergencies) and following many surgeries, especially cardiac, neurological, and vascular surgeries (perioperative hypertension). \b \u001d  \"The data generated by these two pioneering initiatives will be the first comprehensive look into the condition, patient outcomes and patterns of treatment for acute severe hypertension,\" said Clive Meanwell, Chief Executive Officer of The Medicines Company. \"The Medicines Company's support of the registry and survey demonstrates our commitment to further understanding acute severe hypertension and our determination to continuously strive to improve the outcomes of patients who face this life-threatening condition.\" \b \u001d  The registry project will be conducted by the Center for Outcomes Research, University of Massachusetts Medical School, supported by a planned research grant from The Medicines Company. The registry will gather information on the frequency of hypertensive emergencies, patient characteristics, management practices and patient outcomes from physicians who treat emergency room and critical care patients. The first phase of the registry will involve 10 hospital sites and 200 patients. Eventually, the registry will include up to 50 sites and 2,500 patients. \b \u001d  \"Currently, there is surprisingly little information regarding severe acute hypertension, even though this is a common condition,\" said Christopher Granger, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, Duke University Clinical Research Institute and Chair of the Registry Steering Committee. \"Our goal is to gather information on patient characteristics and track how their acute hypertension is managed.  Ultimately, we would like to provide insight into how to better manage these patients in order to optimize patient outcomes.\" \b \u001d  The Ohio State University College of Pharmacy is conducting a large-scale survey of more than 7,000 practitioners who treat acute severe hypertension in the hospital setting, supported by a research grant from The Medicines Company.  The survey will target critical care clinical pharmacists, critical care specialists, emergency medicine doctors and cardiologists, in order to gather significant data on patterns and perspectives on acute severe hypertensive treatment across disciplines. \b \u001d  \"The survey is an exciting undertaking that should vastly improve our understanding of the current treatment practices surrounding acute severe hypertension. We expect findings of the survey to prove invaluable to health care professionals and the patients they serve,\" said Joseph Dasta, MS, FCCM, FCCP, Professor of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University. \b \u001d  The Medicines Company also announced the launch of its Mission Control BP STAT educational website, www.MissionControlBPSTAT.com, for the medical community. The website will serve as a portal for the latest information on acute severe hypertension and the common diseases in which acute severe hypertension manifests itself. \b \u001d  \"The purpose of Mission Control BP STAT is to empower the medical community with the means to affect positive patient outcomes by providing educational materials, and the latest research on acute severe hypertension,\" said Malcolm Lloyd, Senior Medical Director, The Medicines Company. \"The Mission Control BP STAT website will serve as an interactive community to foster communications between physicians, clinical pharmacists and nurses who treat acute severe hypertension.\" \b \u001d  For more information on the registry and survey, please visit www.MissionControlBPSTAT.com. \b \b    About Severe Hypertension \b \u001d  Acute severe hypertension is a rapid increase in blood pressure that can lead to damaged blood vessels, inflaming and causing a leak of fluid or blood and effects nearly three million people annually. As a result, the heart may not be able to maintain adequate circulation of blood and irreversible organ damage may occur within the central nervous system, heart, vasculature and kidneys. It occurs in the intensive care unit, emergency department, or perioperative arena and is often found in conjunction with stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, advanced renal disease or during serious cardiac, neurological, or vascular procedures. It is critical to safely reduce blood pressure as soon as possible to avoid catastrophic outcomes such as organ damage or failure and limit morbidity and mortality. \b \b    MDCO-G \b \b    About The Medicines Company \b \u001d  The Medicines Company is committed to delivering innovative, cost- effective acute care hospital products in the worldwide hospital marketplace. The Company markets Angiomax(R) (bivalirudin) in the U.S. and other countries for use in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, a procedure to clear restricted blood flow in arteries around the heart.

For Tim Taylor, this lesson began with a $10,000 hospital bill, rung up when he was rushed to the hospital with what he thought was a heart attack. When the incident turned out to be simply a bout of hot-wing-induced acid reflux, the doctor blamed Taylor's 267-pound frame. Taylor, who runs an ad-sales and marketing business in Jacksonville, Fla., finally agreed: The weight had to go. A little over a year later, he's dropped 83 pounds -- and that's not all. Taylor's new healthy eating habits have also cut his food bills by more than half, and he's no longer shelling out for monthly doctor visits, plus asthma, acid-reflux and high-cholesterol meds. To date, Taylor says his new svelte shape has already saved him more than $17,000. \u001d  Taylor's experience illustrates the growing body of research that suggests your health has a stronger connection to your bottom line than you might think. Research on individuals across all income levels has shown some impressive results. In a 10-year study by RAND Corporation, for example, 25- to 54-year-olds who reported being in \"excellent\" health at the beginning of the decade saw their median net worth nearly double by the end of the study, to $128,000, while for those with poor health, wealth actually shrunk. Go up the income ladder and the financial gains may be even higher. A recent study by the Center for Creative Leadership found that executives who exercise regularly scored better on a test of leadership skills than those whose butts never leave their fancy leather chairs. Though the study didn't examine earnings, it's not hard to see how these marks could result in bigger year-end bonus checks and faster promotions. \u001d  What's behind the health-wealth correlation? Obviously, people struggling with health problems rack up bigger medical bills and may have a harder time earning a living; conversely, the less income they earn, the greater the obstacles they may face in getting good care. Beyond that, the science gets blurry, but researchers have some interesting leads. According to Jeanne Hurlbert, a professor of sociology at Louisiana State University, good health tends to go hand in hand with strong social networks, the circles of friends, family, coworkers and acquaintances that make up our support systems. These networks have been linked to job-hunting and career success. \"Healthier people are less likely to be isolated,\" says Hurlbert, giving them the inside track to higher incomes and savings. \u001d  The networking effect may help explain why obese folks and smokers, both of which groups face social stigma as well as health complications, probably take the biggest financial hit of all. It may not seem fair, but the research backs it up. According to one study, white women who weigh 65 pounds more than average earn about 9 percent less than the average wage. Research by Ohio State economist Jay Zagorsky suggests that dieters can turn this trend around. He found that white men who decrease their body mass index by 10 points -- a weight loss comparable to Tim Taylor's -- will find themselves an average of $12,720 richer by the time they finish losing the weight. Zagorsky also discovered that the median net worth of people who have never smoked is double that of people who puff through more than a pack a day, while former smokers also have a wealth edge over heavy smokers. A separate study by a University of Calgary economist found that smokers as a group earn 24 percent less than nicotine-free workers. \u001d  In short, doubling your income may mean you have to ditch the ciggies or hit the gym more often than the cookie jar. But there's one vice you won't have to give up. According to a recent study in the Journal of Labor Research, social drinkers earn up to 14 percent more than teetotalers. Cheers! \u001d  -- K.B. \u001d  --- \u001d  OKAY, FINE, TRIPLE YOUR MONEY Double your money? That's for folks who just aren't trying. What if Jonas Salk tried only to double the number of polio survivors? What if Henry Ford tried merely to double auto production? Here, a brief guide to the options for tripling your cash or better. The odds are long, but there's no reason to settle for reliable returns when you could be drowning in your own money. \u001d  -- A.K. \b \u001d  FILM \b \u001d  The payoff can be sweet for investors in a hit independent film. The oddball comedy Napoleon Dynamite, made with $200,000 in investor funding, was sold to Fox Searchlight for $3 million. But consider this: In 2006, of the 3,100 films submitted to Sundance, the best-known independent film festival, only 120 were accepted for screening, and just a handful got theatrical distribution. If you want in, Beverly Hills entertainment lawyer Mark Litwak advises steering clear of first-time filmmakers, controversial themes, cerebral comedies and anything shot in black and white. Which, yes, pretty much eliminates the entire universe of indie film. \b \u001d  WALL STREET \b \u001d  Forget diversification. Pick one stock and ride it to the top. According to Morningstar, roughly 17 percent of all stocks tripled in value over the past five years. Meanwhile, just 1 percent of all mutual funds matched that performance, and surprisingly, hedge funds didn't do much better. Get out the dartboard! \b \u001d  SOCIAL INVESTING \b \u001d  New Web sites like Prosper.com let you invest directly in individuals. Of course, to triple your money you'd have to make a series of loans at rates of 25 percent and up over the course of five years. Currently, the only applicants offering to pay such rates are high-credit-risk borrowers like the Gary, Ind., casino worker who needs $4,500 to pay the auto mechanic so she can stop hitching to work. Prosper.com says 6 percent of such borrowers are at least three months behind in their payments. \b \u001d  POKER \b \u001d  Suppose you're good enough to enter the World Poker Tour. The odds of tripling your $15,000 stake aren't as low as you might think: In one recent tournament, 30 of the 580 players, or 5 percent, walked away with at least $45,000. On the other hand, your odds of losing the entire $15,000 are roughly two out of three. \b \u001d  HORSES \b \u001d  Shares of a Thoroughbred racehorse can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $100,000. You'll also pay your share of boarding and training fees. The upside? Every so often you get a horse like Funny Cide, the $75,000 chestnut gelding who won the 2003 Kentucky Derby and Preakness -- and nearly $2 million. But of the 37,000 Thoroughbreds registered every year, only 1 percent  win races at the elite level. South Carolina's celebrated Dogwood Stable estimates that roughly a third of its investors lose their entire stake; another third break even. Still, swinging by the paddock before a race beats hanging out at the OTB. \u001d  --- \u001d  THE FANTASTIC FIVE \b \u001d  We asked five top money managers to identify a stock they thought would double in the next five years. Their picks range across all kinds of businesses -- making a nice little growth portfolio in their own right. \u001d  -- R.P. \b \u001d  JOHN BUCKINGHAM, Al Frank Fund \u001d  PICK: Cypress Semiconductor (CY, $18) \u001d  The company has $5 a share in cash and a $2 billion ownership stake in solar-cell maker SunPower. Given the company's $2.3 billion market valuation, Buckingham says, investors essentially get Cypress's solid microchip business for free. \b \u001d  VINCE GALLAGHER, Needham Funds \u001d  PICK: The Advisory Board (ABCO, $54) \u001d  A consulting firm that makes hospitals and doctor groups more efficient. \"It's the sweet spot of health care and business services -- two home runs,\" Gallagher says. \b \u001d  BILL MCVAIL, Turner Small Cap Growth \u001d  PICK: WMS Industries (WMS, $39) \u001d  The former designer of pinball machines and arcade videogames like Defender is now the second-biggest slot-machine manufacturer. McVail says WMS has innovative games and benefits from an explosion in casino gambling worldwide. \b \u001d  JOSEPH MILANO, T. Rowe Price Funds \u001d  PICK: Harman International Industries (HAR, $103) \u001d  Best known for speakers, but two-thirds of profit comes from global positioning systems installed in cars. It sells $3 billion worth of products to autos now, Milano says, but has $13 billion in backlogged orders. \b \u001d  STEVEN SUTERMEISTER, Summit Investment Partners \u001d  PICK: Monsanto (MON, $51) \u001d  The ethanol fuel craze should last for years, resulting in more corn being planted for ethanol production. Sutermeister says that should benefit Monsanto, whose newest seeds are particularly resistant to bugs, pesticides and other crop threats. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:03 ET (11:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"78f787530eb206632f9dddbecec52815","symR":["NOK","NOK1V.HE","STM","STM.MI","FI0009000681","NL0000226223"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"STMicroelectronics To Supply Microprocessors To Nokia -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T18:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NOK","NOK1V.HE","STM","STM.MI","FI0009000681","NL0000226223"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","SEM","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XGTI","XHEX","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XST5","XSTX","XSXA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--STMicroelectronics NV (STM) will supply Nokia Corp.

The Sanahujas, who control Barcelona-based real-estate company Sacresa, currently own about 39% of Metrovacesa. \u001d  The second entity, to be called Gecina, will include the company's French real-estate assets and some of its Spanish office rental business. A group formed by Metrovacesa Chairman Joaquin Rivero and director Bautista Soler will control the new company. They currently own about 36% of Metrovacesa. \u001d  The separation plan details a split of assets in Spain and France and proposes the distribution of an additional dividend of EUR2.5 per Metrovacesa share. The value assigned to Metrovacesa's shares to conduct the separation stood at EUR75.67 a piece, and EUR129.36 for each Gecina share. \u001d  Metrovacesa's shares closed at EUR117.85 Friday. Trading on Metrovacesa and Gecina shares was suspended before markets opened Monday. \u001d  The proposal, unveiled late Monday by the Spanish regulator, allows minority shareholders to remain in both or each of the new, separated companies.

Sale of property, business, related assets and associated costs: \b \bIn June 2006, Winpak sold the premises formerly occupied by the converting operating unit on Laird Drive, Toronto, Ontario.  The printed, paper bag converting business had been sold in June 2005 and normal operations at the premises ceased by the end of October 2005. Cash proceeds for the premises of $8,638 generated a pre-tax gain of $5,553 and net earnings of $4,329. The low income tax expense applied to the sale was due to the effective rate of tax applicable to the capital gains element of the transaction. \b \bIn June 2005, the Company sold certain assets of the printed, paper bag business operated from the aforementioned Toronto, Ontario premises for cash proceeds of $8,852, representing a pre-tax gain of $3,830.  Consequent to the asset sale and plant closure, the Company incurred termination and other related costs and realization of cumulative currency translation adjustments totaling $5,561, netting a pre-tax loss on sale of the business of $1,731.  The nature of these transactions for income tax purposes resulted in an income tax recovery of $1,878 and a $147 increase to net earnings. \b \bA majority of the remaining employee termination costs will be paid out by the end of the second quarter of 2007.

Provision for income taxes: \b \bThe Canadian Federal government substantively enacted legislation that progressively reduces the future federal corporate income tax rate over a period of several years. As a result, the Company was required to re-measure its future income tax assets and liabilities using the newly enacted corporate income tax rates, taking into account the tax rates anticipated to be in effect when the related future income tax assets are realized or liabilities are settled. This resulted in a non-cash reduction in future income taxes and an income tax recovery of $1,483 in the third quarter of 2006. \b \b5.

The revamped site offers CIGNA HealthCare members quicker and easier access to their personal health information, plan benefits and transactions detail, and quality and/or cost information for hospitals, outpatient facilities, specialists and prescription medications tailored according to the individual member's health and plan. \b \u001d  Initially launched in the summer of 2002, myCIGNA.com has undergone numerous upgrades including being the first Website to: compare hospitals for treatment outcomes; compare prescription medications; provide radiology and outpatient surgery costs and real-time medication pricing according to the member's health plan; automatically input clinical test results into a member's Personal Health Record (PHR); and integrate CIGNA HealthCare member PHR data into an online health risk assessment. \b \u001d  \"Given the wealth of resources we make available to members through myCIGNA.com, it is an ongoing challenge to ensure that information and tools are laid out intuitively so that members can quickly and easily find what they need,\" said Jeffrey Wyne, vice president of marketing, CIGNA HealthCare.  \"Our redesign is the result of months of research, including surveys and user testing of our members and employers.\" \b \u001d  According to Wyne, myCIGNA.com's new enhancements focus on facilitating access to the site's most popular features and improving the overall site navigation: \b \b \b    -- Provider Directory - used for an average of 13 million searches a year, \b       the online directory will now feature more information on CIGNA \b       HealthCare-contracted health care professionals in an easy-to-read \b       horizontal format.  Effective in 2007, members can now find and compare \b       in-network specialists based on their performance on select quality and \b       cost efficiency measures using a star-based scoring system. \b \b    -- Enhanced medical and dental claims status pages - including improved \b       and expanded search capabilities, claim status information and an \b       improved claim detail results page layout.  In addition, claim \b       information will now include dollars paid out of a member's Flexible \b       Spending Account, Health Savings Account or Health Reimbursement \b       Account, giving members a complete view of how their claim was paid. \b \b    -- Improved navigation including a new Member Center - enabling members \b       to quickly and easily perform key tasks including downloading forms, \b       printing and requesting ID cards and locating contact information from \b       an easily accessed central location. \b \b \u001d  Looking ahead, additional new myCIGNA.com resources are scheduled to be launched in 2007, including: \b \b \b    -- A third-generation CIGNA Pharmacy drug price quote tool will provide \b       side-by-side pricing according to the member's plan for both the target \b       drug and therapeutically equivalent medications (including generic \b       alternatives) dispensed at CIGNA Tel-Drug Home Delivery Pharmacy and \b       57,000 retail pharmacies nationwide. \b \b    -- The Dental Treatment Cost Estimator launched in 2006, which provides \b       cost estimates for dental treatments based on average cost by state, \b       will be enhanced to provide estimates customized to the CIGNA Dental \b       member's specific plan. \b \b    -- Enhanced displays of medical plan deductibles and maximums and a \b       downloadable format for medical and dental claim search results. \b \b \u001d  Approximately half of CIGNA HealthCare's medical plan subscribers have registered to use myCIGNA.com, and the award-winning, personalized member Web site averages some 60,000 visitors each business day.  The redesign of myCIGNA.com follows the relaunch of CIGNA's flagship public Website, http://www.CIGNA.com in January 2007. \b \b    About CIGNA HealthCare \b \u001d  CIGNA HealthCare, based in Bloomfield, CT, provides medical benefits plans, dental coverage, behavioral health coverage, pharmacy benefits and products and services that integrate and analyze information to support consumerism and health advocacy.  \"CIGNA HealthCare\" refers to certain operations of Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, which is an operating subsidiary of CIGNA Corporation (NYSE: CI).

The provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2006 was C$17 million compared with C$6 million for the same period in 2005, which benefited from a reversal of C$14 million of our general allowance for credit losses due to favourable economic conditions. \b\b \b\bThe provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased by C$12 million from the previous quarter, largely due to provisions in two specific commercial exposures. \b\b \b\bFor the year ended 31 December 2006, the provision for credit losses was C$34 million, compared with C$27 million for 2005. Gross impaired loans increased to C$164 million at 31 December 2006 compared with C$130 million at 31 December 2005. Total impaired loans, net of specific allowances for credit losses, were C$106 million at 31 December 2006 compared with C$73 million at 31 December 2005. The total allowance for credit losses, as a percentage of loans outstanding was 0.92 per cent at 31 December 2006 compared with 1.01 per cent at 31 December 2005. \b\b \b\bBalance sheet \b\b \b\bTotal assets at 31 December 2006 were C$56.8 billion, an increase of C$7.6 billion from C$49.2 billion at 31 December 2005. Strong economic conditions helped drive growth in commercial loans and deposits. Commercial loans and bankers' acceptances increased C$3.3 billion in total to C$22.9 billion at 31 December 2006 compared with C$19.6 billion at 31 December 2005. \b\b \b\bContinued strength in the housing market across Canada and the strong economy helped residential mortgages and consumer loans to increase C$1.1 billion to C$17.7 billion in total at 31 December 2006 compared with C$16.6 billion at 31 December 2005.  Increased trading and balance sheet management activity increased assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements by C$3.0 billion at 31 December 2006 compared with 31 December 2005 while cash resources decreased by C$1.2 billion. \b\b \b\bTotal deposits at 31 December 2006 were C$44.2 billion, an increase of C$5.6 billion from C$38.6 billion at 31 December 2005. Launch of our High Rate Savings Account and growth of our wealth management businesses helped increase deposits from individuals to C$17.0 billion at 31 December 2006 from C$15.3 billion at the same time last year. Investments in our payments and cash management services contributed to a C$4.4 billion increase in commercial deposits to C$25.7 billion at 31 December 2006. As a result of the growth in core customer deposits, less reliance was placed on deposits from other banks, which decreased to C$1.5 billion at 31 December 2006 from C$2.0 billion at 31 December 2005. \b\b \b\bTotal assets under administration \b\b \b\bFunds under management were C$23.3 billion at 31 December 2006 compared with C$20.5 billion at 31 December 2005. Including custody and administration balances, total assets under administration were C$31.9 billion at 31 December 2006 compared with C$28.0 billion at 31 December 2005. \b\b \b\bGrowth in funds under management during 2006 resulted from continued investment in our brokerage operations during the year and from success in our Private Client products. Additionally, Canadian equity markets, which were aided by higher natural resource prices, performed strongly in 2006. \b\b \b\bCapital management and Dividends \b\b \b\bThe tier 1 capital ratio was 9.0 per cent and the total capital ratio was 11.1 per cent at 31 December 2006. This is little changed from 9.0 per cent and 11.2 per cent, respectively, at 31 December 2005. \b\b \b\bIn addition to net income, regulatory capital increased in 2006 as subordinated debentures increased C$140 million as a redemption of a C$60 million issue was offset by a new C$200 million issue. \b\b \b\bDuring the fourth quarter of 2006, we declared and paid C$60 million in dividends on our common shares. Dividends declared on our common shares totalled C$240 million in 2006. \b\b \b\bRegular dividends of 31.875 cents per share have been declared on our Class 1 Preferred Shares - Series C and 31.25 cents per share on our Class 1 Preferred Shares - Series D. The dividends will be payable in cash on 31 March 2007, for shareholders of record on 15 March 2007.

These ratings upgrades followed S&P's revision of our group status to a 'core\" holding within the HSBC Group based on our growing integration with and increasing contribution to the HSBC Group. \b\b \b\bOn 6 October 2006, Dominion Bond Rating Service (\"DBRS\") upgraded its ratings of our deposits, debt instruments and preferred shares, as a result of implementation of a new support assessment methodology for banks. \b\b \b\b \b\b    << \b\b    Our current ratings are as follows: \b\b \b\b                                                      S&P            DBRS \b\b                                                      ---            ---- \b\b    Short-term instruments                            A-1+         R-1 (high) \b\b    Deposits and senior debt                          AA           AA \b\b    Subordinated debt                                 AA-          AA (low) \b\b    Preferred shares                                  P-1          Pfd-1 \b\b    HSBC Canada Asset Trust Securities                P-1          A (high) \b\b    >> \b\b \b\b \b\bAbout HSBC Bank Canada \b\b \b\bHSBC Bank Canada, a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc, has more than 170 offices.

These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause such differences include legislative or regulatory developments, technological change, global capital market activity, changes in government monetary and economic policies, changes in prevailing interest rates, inflation level and general economic conditions in geographic areas where HSBC Bank Canada operates. Canada is an extremely competitive banking environment and pressures on interest rates and our net interest margin may arise from actions taken by individual banks acting alone.

He said the company plans international borrowing of up to $3 billion this year, including a ruble-denominated Eurobond of up to RUB10 billion ($381 million). \u001d  In addition to that, he said, the bank would offer another RUB10 billion bond on the domestic market. \u001d  Rubles became internationally clearable only this year, allowing the issuance of ruble debt and settlement in the secondary market outside of the country for the first time. \u001d  Gazprombank had initially planned to hold an IPO last year and had entered into an agreement with investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort - 'parking' the shares with the latter in the meantime. \u001d  However, the issue fell victim, in part, to delays in liberalizing the laws governing share issues by banks. New legal amendments have now eased that process, but the first banks to take advantage of the new situation will be state-controlled OAO Sberbank (SBER.RS) and OAO Vneshtorgbank. \u001d  Bank Web site: http://www.gazprombank.ru \u001d  -By Geoffrey T.

(NYSE:GE) today announced the installation of the CommerceGuard(TM) System at the Port of Portland to further secure a vital link in the world's global supply chain. \b \u001d  The CommerceGuard installation at the Port of Portland is the first comprehensive installation of the system on the U.S. West Coast. It advances the Port's ongoing initiative to offer enhanced security options to its customers. CommerceGuard is the first global supply chain system that deters and detects theft, smuggling and international terrorism by integrating container security devices (CSDs) within a global information network. The CommerceGuard network of secure corridors is enhanced with the Portland installation particularly creating secure trade lanes with several ports in Asia that have recently adopted the CommerceGuard System. \b \u001d  \"I'm pleased to see additional safeguards for cargo security at the Port. Ensuring the security of our ports is vital, both for public safety and for our region's economic well-being,\" U.S. Senator Ron Wyden said. \"Requiring a state of the art container security device, rather than a simple padlock to secure expedited shipping containers, means we get safer ports and the added benefit of helping businesses move their cargo more quickly. That's the classic definition of a win-win situation.\" \b \u001d  CommerceGuard is a commercially available system that meets the new requirements for container security devices specified in the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden's amendment to the act ensured much more rigorous security for containers by specifying that a container security device must positively identify a container, detect and record the unauthorized intrusion of a container, and secure the container against tampering throughout the supply chain. Before Senator Wyden's amendment, a common padlock would have met the existing criteria. The act is further designed to offer quicker customs inspections for companies that take extra security precautions. \b \u001d  \"West Coast maritime trade volume is on the rise, so I am proud that the Port of Portland is a part of a new comprehensive approach to cargo security,\" said Congressman Earl Blumenauer. \"With over ten million containers entering U.S. ports every year, this innovative approach is the kind of long term investment that will make businesses and Americans safer.\" \b \u001d  \"The Port of Portland is pleased to participate in a private sector initiative that will complement the extensive governmental efforts to secure marine cargo,\" said Bill Wyatt, Executive Director of the Port of Portland. \"In addition to making its facilities as secure as possible, the Port is committed to helping its customers implement their own cargo security measures.\" \b \u001d  \"This installation of the CommerceGuard System will improve cargo container security and enable port customers to enjoy commercial advantages ranging from security to asset visibility,\" said Randy Koch, president & CEO, CommerceGuard AB & GM, cargo security, GE Security. \"Both importers and exporters can now use CommerceGuard to secure their shipments.\" \b \u001d  More than a dozen key international ports have adopted the CommerceGuard container security device and reader system. It has also undergone successful international trials with shippers including Yang Ming Lines and is in use by top importers. \b \u001d  The CommerceGuard system features the first market-ready container security device (CSD) that has been tested and proven to be secure and reliable. The CommerceGuard CSD is positioned inside an international cargo container and registers any opening of the container door. Any unauthorized door opening is recorded as a tamper event, and alerts are routed to appropriate officials. Fixed and handheld readers at critical points along the supply chain, such as overseas and U.S. ports, collect container status from the device and report it using the CommerceGuard Information Network. This information provides cargo owners greater security while tracking the location and status of shipments as their containers move through the supply chain. Tracking data is available at no additional charge as part of the CommerceGuard Service. Cargo owners, authorized logistics providers, and appropriate government authorities can securely access the information from any Internet browser. \b \u001d  CommerceGuard products are available through a global business collaboration consisting of GE Security, Mitsubishi Corporation (TSE:8058), Samsung Corporation (SEO:000830), and Siemens building Technologies (NYSE:SI). GE Security holds the sales and distribution rights for the CommerceGuard system in North America and certain other regions. \b \b   About Port of Portland \b \u001d  Established in 1891 by the Oregon legislature, the Port of Portland today owns four marine terminals, four airports (Portland International, Hillsboro, Troutdale and Mulino) and seven business parks. The mission of the Port of Portland is to enhance the region's economy and quality of life by providing efficient cargo and air passenger access to national and global markets. \b \b   About CommerceGuard Container Security System \b \u001d  The CommerceGuard security system, supported by a global business collaboration between GE Security, Mitsubishi Corporation, Samsung Corporation, and Siemens Building Technology features the first market-ready container security device (CSD) that magnetically adheres to the inside of an international cargo container and registers any opening of the container door. Fixed and handheld readers record its status in a database that can be accessed by authorized importers, shippers and government officials anywhere in the world. \b \b   More information can be found at www.commerceguard.com. \b \b   About GE Security \b \u001d  GE Security, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), is a leading supplier of security and life safety technologies, with operations in more than 35 countries and $2 billion in annual sales. GE Security offers one of the industry's broadest product portfolios, covering explosives and narcotics detection, intrusion and access control, video surveillance, key management, and fire detection.

Based on the current national average -- which is abnormally low -- your annual take would be 6 percent of the property's value, or $51,000. Rents should rise slightly faster than inflation, according to real estate data provider Reis Inc., so you'd be taking in $57,400 a year by 2012. Total profit on your $170,000 down payment after five years: $55,116. Sell the building for $965,000 and you've doubled your money. And that's assuming the property's value rises 14 percent in five years -- very conservative, considering the housing market's average annual return of 6.1 percent since 1975. \u001d  You can do better if you pick the right property. The basics: Choose something with four units or fewer. It's easier to manage, and you'll avoid the higher interest charged on commercial loans, says E-Loan President Mark Lefanowicz. Second, buy close to home so you can care for the building yourself. If you have to hire a property manager, you can kiss your profits goodbye. And steer clear of areas with overheated condo markets. Developers may convert slow-selling condos to rental properties, creating a surplus. Warning signs include widespread price reductions and \"owner must sell\" ads. \u001d  Now, here's the fun part: choosing the right neighborhood. In the 'burbs, look for evidence that residents are investing in their own homes with remodeling and additions. And even in metro areas with dim prospects, there are always bright spots, says Richard DeKaser, chief economist with the bank National City Corp. Hot prospects include areas with improving school districts (check test scores at SchoolMatters.com) and new infrastructure like parks and roads.

But we're not suggesting risky options with high startup costs like, say, opening a restaurant. We're focusing on lucrative work you can do part-time from home -- an option that gets more realistic every year, thanks to the Web. \u001d  The Web's omnipresence means just about any personal interest of yours can  lure enough Internet traffic to support a profitable business. Thanks to falling prices for everything from site hosting to credit card processing, the cost of launching a full-fledged e-commerce site has fallen from several thousand dollars to the price of dinner for two, says Scott Fox, author of Internet Riches. Of course, with the barriers to entry so low, there's lots of competition. The trick is to identify the knowledge and skills that give you an edge. Take auction sales. EBay's increased fees and falling sell-through rates have made it hard to eke out a profit, says Ina Steiner, editor of AuctionBytes.com; you'll never make much money selling commodities like iPods or DVDs. But if you spent the past 20 years collecting antique oil lamps, you're probably an expert on sourcing and pricing them; your product descriptions will have an authority that attracts buyers, and you'll win repeat customers. \u001d  You can also try to monetize your brilliant thoughts -- sharing them via a Web site or blog. Some Web scribblers practice payola, dropping fawning references to other companies' products and services in return for cash. But almost anyone making real money is taking a more honorable path. And the timing is right: Advertisers have finally embraced blogs and their brethren as a way to target niche markets. Programs like Google AdSense can automatically place relevant ads on your site in return for a cut of the proceeds. You can also register with online retailers like Amazon.com that run similar programs. Of the many online guides explaining the nuts and bolts, one of the best is ProBlogger.net. \u001d  Which of your interests to exploit? Hobbies, industry knowledge, informed reviews -- just about anything works if you write with authority. But some topics pay more than others. Steve Pavlina, whose eponymous self-help blog brought in about $150,000 in revenue last year, says he didn't break the $1,000-a-month mark until he was attracting roughly 400,000 visitors each month. In contrast, CoffeeReview.com, which constitutes a 15-hour-a-week job for Berkeley, Calif., beverage consultant Kenneth Davids, steadily brings in $6,000 a month off just 50,000 visitors. That's because its comprehensive reviews have made the site one of the top-ranked results for folks doing a Google search for \"coffee,\" and specialty coffee companies happily pay to advertise on the site. \u001d  You can get a rough idea of the relative value of your expertise using the \"View Bids\" tool at Searchmarketing.Yahoo.com. We learned that marketers will pay as much as $2.50 per click for ads placed next to \"dog grooming\" content, but \"cat grooming\" fetches less than a dollar. Dogs win. Still, the most important predictor of your site's success is your interest level. Really. While there are 60 million blogs, just over half have been updated in the past three months, according to tracking site Technorati.com. But the top 4,000 blogs -- those linked to by at least 500 other blogs -- have been active for nearly two years on average and are typically updated twice a day. \u001d  Beyond the Web, of course, there is always teaching and consulting, particularly popular these days with the surging demand for continuing education. The growing number of retirees and young singles (i.e., folks with free time) is creating more jobs for people who can teach hands-on skills that are hard to learn on one's own. Will it double your money? Not likely. But instructors working solo can earn anywhere from $15 to $95 an hour teaching anything from academic subjects to sailing to jazz guitar. Firms that hire contractors with specialized skills are another option for working after hours from home, says Jonas Prising, North American president of staffing firm Manpower. Based on the hourly rates they can command, copy editors working 10 hours a week can pick up an extra $22,500 a year before taxes, interior decorators about the same. And if you like computers but not blogs, take note: Part-time programmers can earn as much as $47,500. \u001d  -- A.K. \b \u001d  SAVINGS & SPENDING \b \u001d  To update an old saying, it takes more money to make more money. You may need extra dough to pursue some of the strategies we've described, since rental-property down payments don't grow on trees, after all. You could try to save the money through ascetic nickel-and-diming: giving up your daily latte, sacrificing HBO. But you'll save more, faster, if you take aim at your life's biggest expenditures -- your mortgage and your wheels. \u001d  Start in your driveway, where choosing used over new can have a big impact on your cash flow. Chalk it up to depreciation: Because a new car loses so much of its resale value in the first years of ownership, your out-of-pocket costs are that much higher. Consider the Acura TL, a luxury sedan that sells new at around $42,000. Buy it new, and your five-year ownership costs -- everything from fuel and maintenance to that old devil depreciation -- will amount to a little under $58,000, according to the car-advice site Edmunds.com. Buy a three-year-old used model and your costs will be about $12,000 less. Duplicate that strategy in a two-car family and you've saved $24,000. Used hybrids from Toyota, Honda and Ford offer another way to save cash: They hold their resale value better than similar nonhybrid cars do, making them a more cost-effective purchase. Your savings at the pump will add up too. Based on what a typical upper-income family spends on fuel, upgrading from a car that averaged 20 miles to the gallon to one that got 30 would save you about $960 a year. And if you're really addicted to new-car smell, you needn't go without; replacement floor mats -- $42 each for that Acura -- can restore that special scent and boost your car's resale value. \u001d  Next, take a trimmer to the monthly mortgage payment. Unlike in recent years, the spreads in interest rates between fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages are fairly narrow right now. But rates have recently been sliding, and anyone who locked in a mortgage over the past year or two has a good chance of finding a better deal -- even more likely if they have an adjustable loan that has just flipped up to a higher rate, says Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com. On a $400,000 mortgage, the difference between a loan at 7.5 percent interest and one at today's prevailing rates of 6.25 percent would add up to more than $20,000 in payments over five years -- money that could be working for you in a double-your-money investment portfolio. \u001d  If you're seeking more savings, think about ditching your landline phone; that could save you $3,700 over five years. And if you don't want to rely exclusively on your cell phone, Internet telephone service -- a technology that has become much more reliable over the past couple of years -- offers another way to save. Monthly plans from established providers like Vonage or Net2Phone cost $30 to $40 a month for unlimited local and long-distance service, letting you spend as much as $1,900 less than you would on old-school telephony. \u001d  -- M.H. \b \u001d  HEALTH \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:02 ET (11:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7e6abe5a05a05613aafcc771697670c5","symR":["ADDYY","ADS.XE","NKE","PUM.XE","DE0005003404","DE0006969603"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Puma 4Q Net Pft -26%; Optimistic 2007 Outlook","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T11:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ADDYY","ADS.XE","NKE","PUM.XE","DE0005003404","DE0006969603"],"IndustryCodes":["CLO","FOT","RTS","SAP","TEX","XDAX","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XMDAX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   (Updates an item published at 1041 GMT with Chief Executive, analysts' comments, share price activity) \b \u001d  By Julia Mengewein and Archibald Preuschat \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Germany's athletic wear maker Puma AG (PUM.XE) Monday unveiled a 26% fall in fourth-quarter net profit, due to higher spending on advertising and brand promotion, and said sales in 2007 should expand by \"a medium-to-higher single-digit range.\" \u001d  The company's fourth-quarter net profit attributable to shareholders fell to EUR32.8 million from EUR44.1 million a year earlier, Puma said in a statement. Analysts had expected the figure to come in at EUR34 million. \u001d  The decline was widely expected by the market and reflects costs related to the company's so-called Phase IV growth initiatives. \u001d  Puma analyst Marina Noss at NordLB said \"The figures for 2006 were bang in line with my estimates, only sales was a tad lower.\" She attributed the negative share price reaction to the market's hopes for a higher outlook. \u001d  \"The market's used to Puma exceeding expectations and upgrading its outlook, which however didn't happen today,\" she said, adding the company's 2007 outlook is realistic-to-conservative. \u001d  Noss expects the bulk of costs for the Phase IV program to have been booked in 2006 and \"2007 should see record results again.\" She added the figures don't give any reason to change her buy rating and EUR315 price target on the stock. \u001d  Another analyst who requested anonymity also said the company's outlook disappointed the market, while 2006 earnings met expectations. \"Order backlog was lower-than-expected due to a weaker performance of the North-America operations,\" he added. \u001d  A technicals-based trader said he expects Puma's share price to find a solid support at EUR270. \u001d  At 1140 GMT, Puma shares traded 0.9% lower or down EUR2.69 at EUR287.30, in a higher German market. \u001d  Puma said it expects the 2007 margin for earnings before interest and taxes to stand at 16%, helped by lower administrative expenses. The company expects net income to grow by at least 10%, and an unchanged tax rate of 29%, in 2007. \u001d  Puma Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz Monday said the company will continue its share buyback program in 2007, in similar fashion to that conducted in 2006. \u001d  Puma in its latest financial statement said that in 2006 it bought back 230,000 of its own shares for an investment of EUR66 million. At the end of 2006, the company held 1.12 million of its own shares, or 6.5% of subscribed capital, the statement said. \u001d  Zeitz said that he doesn't see any acquisition targets in 2007 and that the company doesn't plan to buy back further licenses in the current year. \u001d  Puma's sales rose 34% in 2006, 13% of which is attributable to organic growth. The remaining growth stemmed from repurchased licenses. \u001d  Sales for the last three months of 2006 rose 37.6% to EUR480.6 million from EUR349.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, boosted by a strong performance of the Asia and Pacific regions. \u001d  Earnings before interest and taxation fell 24.3% to EUR41.6 million from EUR55 million in the last quarter of 2005, while the fourth-quarter EBIT margin stood at 8.7% versus 15.7% a year earlier. \u001d  Fourth-quarter gross profit margin, which rises with a company's financial health, stood at 47.7% in the fourth quarter of 2006, versus 50% in the last three months of 2005. \u001d  The company's 2006 net profit came in at EUR263.2 million, down 7.9% from EUR285.8 million in 2005, while 2006 sales came in at EUR2.37 billion, a 33.3% increase over 2005's EUR1.78 billion. \u001d  Order backlog - a carefully watched indicator for the company's future sales performance - stood at EUR1.12 billion at the end of 2006, 4.7% higher than the EUR1.07 billion a year ago. \u001d  Puma generated EUR366.2 million EBIT in 2006, after EUR397.7 million a year earlier, thus reaching an EBIT margin of 15.5%. \u001d  Puma, based in Herzogenaurach, is the world's third largest sportswear maker by sales after U.S-based Nike Inc.(NKE), and German Adidas AG (ADS.XE). \b   Company Web site: http://about.puma.com \b \u001d  -By Julia Mengewein, Dow Jones Newswires; +49 69 29725 507; julia.mengewein@dowjones.com \b \u001d  Order free Annual Report for Adidas AG\u001d  Visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0005003404 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028\u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:55 ET (11:55 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7ea86903502b0ad98c0112c37a313b51","symR":["FCPO"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Factory Card & Party Outlet: Misch Resigns As Acctg Chief","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T22:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FCPO"],"IndustryCodes":["OTS","RTS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 17:27 ET (22:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7edf120812458ba04524af2e287f4c00","symR":["DOCC"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": ISS Reaffirms Recommendation in Favor of Docucorp/Skywire Merger","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T20:42:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DOCC"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b           Stockholder Vote Scheduled for February 22, 2007 \bDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2007-- \u001d  Docucorp International(R) (Nasdaq:DOCC), a leading provider of Customer Communication Management (CCM) solutions, announced today that Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc.

Wolfden agreed to grant such exclusivity period upon having received an expression of interest (\"Letter of Interest\") from Zinifex in the form of a non-binding and conditional proposal for the acquisition of all of the outstanding common shares of Wolfden, for a cash price of $3.90 per share (including shares issued or issuable upon the exercise of Wolfden warrants and stock options). \b \bWolfden has agreed not to solicit proposals relating to any acquisition of its common shares or similar transactions from other persons or entities until after March 7, 2007.

Wolfden has agreed to reimburse Zinifex's expenses, up to $1 million, if Wolfden enters into a definitive agreement providing for an alternative transaction in certain circumstances. \b \bThe Letter of Interest contemplates a potential transaction in the form of a take-over bid, unless an alternative form of transaction is deemed advisable.

Together these new Group operations generated over half of the additional revenues in the year. \b \u001d  Beyond this impact the Group experienced further high single-digit growth in its existing businesses reflecting continuing strong developments in SES ASTRA's UK, German and Eastern Europe markets as well as geographical expansion into the African market. \b \u001d  Finally one-off revenue items, mainly termination fees resulting from the cessation of activities of Connexion by Boeing and transponder sales by SES AMERICOM to Star One, made an additional contribution to the positive development. \b \u001d  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (\"EBITDA\") \b \b                                 2006      2005     Variance         % \bOperating expenses              534.8     376.9      +157.9     +41.9% \bEBITDA                        1,080.4     881.1      +199.3     +22.6% \bEBITDA margin                    66.9%     70.0%  -3.1 % pts       -- \b \u001d  EBITDA rose strongly in 2006 reflecting the three factors set out above in the revenue section. The reported EBITDA is after taking a charge of EUR 28.5 million for restructuring costs of teleports in the US and the remaining charge for the integration of SES NEW SKIES. \b \u001d  Excluding the non-recurring restructuring charge, the Group's EBITDA margin was 68.7%, reflecting the increased proportion of services in the revenue mix this year. Services revenues increased 45.4% to EUR 271.7 million, being 16.6% (2005: 14.8%) of the total, with organic growth representing about half of this gain and the balance mainly attributable to the acquisition of ND SatCom. \b \u001d  The margin in the Group's infrastructure business remained robust at 78.8% (2005: 80.2%) when the restructuring charge is excluded. On the same basis, the reported services margin rose from 4.0% in 2005 to 5.6% in 2006. Normalised for start-up costs, services delivered an EBITDA margin of 10.5%. \b \b   Operating profit \b \b                                 2006      2005     Variance         % \bDepreciation                    438.6     363.0       +75.6     +20.8% \bAmortisation                     36.5      42.3        -5.8     -13.7% \bOperating profit                605.3     475.8      +129.5     +27.2% \b \u001d  Depreciation in 2006 was EUR 75.6 million higher than in 2005 reflecting the first-time consolidation of the five satellite fleet of SES NEW SKIES for the nine months beginning in April. This added EUR 55.2 million to the Group's depreciation expense. Also the satellites ASTRA 1KR, launched in April 2006, and AMC-23 (launched in December 2005) contributed to the increase in depreciation over the prior year. \b \b   Net financing charges \b \b   The charges can be analysed as follows: \b \b                                 2006      2005     Variance         % \bNet interest expense           (129.9)    (74.3)      +55.6     +74.8% \bCapitalised interest             22.7      17.2        +5.5     +32.0% \bNet foreign exchange gains       14.7      48.4       -33.7     -69.6% \bDividend income                   1.5        --        +1.5        -- \bGain on disposal of \b subsidiary                      15.0        --       +15.0        -- \bValue adjustments                (4.8)      4.0          --        -- \b                            ------------------------------------------ \bNet finance (charges) / \b income                         (80.8)     (4.7)      +76.1        -- \b                            ------------------------------------------ \b \u001d  The net interest expense rose sharply with the higher debt levels implemented in 2006 and the contribution of the two high yield bonds taken over with the purchase of New Skies. These were refinanced in August at terms better reflecting the Group's normal terms. \b \u001d  Net foreign exchange gains were realized on financial derivatives and on the holding of US dollar denominated liabilities during the year as the dollar weakened against the Euro from Euro 1 : USD 1.1875 at the start of the year to Euro 1 : USD 1.3170 at the close. \b \u001d  Finally a book gain of EUR 15.0 million was made in February 2006 on the disposal of the Group's 100% interest in SES Re S.A., a captive insurance company in Luxembourg. \b \b   Income tax expense \b \b                                 2006      2005     Variance         % \bIncome tax expense               99.4      99.3        +0.1        -- \bReported tax rate                19.0%     21.1%  -2.1 % pts       -- \b \u001d  The tax charge for the year remained flat despite an increase in 11.3% of profit before taxes, reducing the Group's reported tax rate from 21.1% in 2005 to 19.0% in 2006. \b \b   Net profit and earnings per share \b \b                                 2006      2005     Variance         % \bNet profit of the Group         435.8     381.9       +53.9     +14.1% \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 02:02 ET (07:02 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"8134343f7d92a3d37732bc7f495d5d75","symR":["CARULLA.BO","CENCOSUD.SN","EXITO.BO","JPM","CL0000000100","COP2162U1068","COP3782F1073","US46625H1005"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Colombian Retailer Exito Takes Over Rival Carulla","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T18:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CARULLA.BO","CENCOSUD.SN","EXITO.BO","JPM","CL0000000100","COP2162U1068","COP3782F1073","US46625H1005"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FDR","RTB","RTS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Adds more details and comments from the president of the local stock exchange and Exito's chief executive) \u001d  BOGOTA (Dow Jones)--Colombia's largest retailer Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO.BO) bought a total of 72.2% in its main rival Carulla Vivero SA (CARULLA.BO) for $470 million. \u001d  The Medellin-based company said Monday it acquired a 52.4% stake of Carulla Vivero in a tender offer that ended Friday. In addition, the company had bought a 19.8% stake in Carulla from Newbridge Andean Partner, a U.S.-based private equity firm, Exito's chief executive Gonzalo Restrepo said Monday in a press release. \u001d  The company bought 18.54 million shares of Carulla in the tender offer for $293 million, or $15.792 for each share. \u001d  \"We are creating the biggest retailer in Colombia with sales worth almost $3 billion a year,\" Restrepo said in a press conference. \u001d  On Feb. 5, Exito had launched a public tender offer to buy a minimum 22% stake and a maximum 58% of the company. \u001d  \"This is one of the biggest businesses at the Colombian stock exchange,\" Juan Pablo Cordoba, president of the local stock exchange said at the same press conference. \u001d  Exito financed the purchase with the sale of $116 million worth of new shares to existing shareholders and a $300 million syndicated loan led by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). \u001d  \"The money arrived in Colombia two weeks ago,\" Restrepo said, without naming all the international banks that lent the money. \u001d  Restrepo said it will launch another tender offer for the remaining 27.8% in Carulla. Carulla's management will seek approval from shareholders to delist its share on March 9. To delist the share, Exito will be forced to carry out a second tender offer, according to local stock market rules. \u001d  Exito will hire a new investment bank that will determine the price for Carulla shares. \u001d  \"The price suggested by the investment bank will be approved by Carulla's shareholders,\" Restrepo told reporters on the sidelines of the press conference. \"I believe this obligatory public tender offer could take place in April,\"he added. \u001d  Separately, Restrepo said Exito isn't interested in expanding overseas. \u001d  He added that Exito is considering entering in the travel agency business as well as opening stores with new formats. \u001d  Colombia's anti-trust agency approved the transactions in December but said that, if successful, the merged units must sell 11 of their combined 256 stores.

(JPM). \u001d  \"The money arrived in Colombia two weeks ago,\" Restrepo said, without naming all the international banks that loaned the money. \u001d  Restrepo said it will launch another tender offer for the remaining 27.8% in Carulla. \u001d  Carulla's management will seek approval from shareholders to delist its shares March 9. To delist the shares, Exito will be forced to carry out a second tender offer, according to local stock market rules. \u001d  Exito will hire a new investment bank that will determine the price for Carulla shares. \u001d  \"The price suggested by the investment bank will be approved by Carulla's shareholders,\" Restrepo told reporters on the sidelines of the press conference. \u001d  \"I believe this obligatory public tender offer could take place in April,\" he added. \u001d  Two market participants estimated Exito could offer the same price or less for each of Carulla's share. \u001d  \"Exito already controls the majority so it's almost impossible that it will offer more for each share of Carulla,\" said Edgar Jimenez, who manages a fund of stocks with local brokerage Promotora Bursatil. \u001d  Restrepo said Exito isn't interested in expanding overseas. \u001d  Exito is considering entering into the travel agency business as well as opening stores with new formats, he added. \u001d  Colombia's anti-trust agency approved the transactions in December but said that, if successful, the merged units must sell 11 of their combined 256 stores. The regulator also limited the extended bargaining power the new entity would have over its suppliers. \u001d  Exito controls about 30% of the Colombian retail market, followed by Carulla with a 15% market share, according to a study by UBS. \u001d  The company will appoint a new chief executive for Carulla on Feb. 27, Restrepo said. \u001d  Separately, Restrepo said he isn't worried about Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's announcement to nationalize supermarkets because his company respects all price controls imposed in Venezuela. \u001d  Exito owns a 28% stake in the Venezuelan supermarket chain Cadenas de Tiendas Venezolanas, or Cativen. \u001d  Last week, Chavez threatened to nationalize any privately owned supermarkets and food storage facilities caught hoarding inventories or violating price controls imposed on basic goods. \u001d  While Exito bought Carulla, French supermarket chain Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (12558.FR) is vying with Chilean retailer Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD.SN) to acquire the 24.5% stake in Exito being sold by Colombia's Toro family. \u001d  Casino currently owns 39% in Exito. \u001d  \"Conversations between Exito's shareholder and private companies are secret and I don't know anything about it as shareholders don't share that information with me,\" Restrepo said. \u001d  The share price of Exito rose 0.4% to close at 14,200 Colombian pesos ($6.39) on Monday, while Carulla rose 3.1% to COP35,044, the price paid by Exito. \b \u001d  -By Diana Delgado and Inti Landauro, Dow Jones Newswires; 571-6001980; colombia@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 16:47 ET (21:47 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"819fbee4ebf0925b46d1096733aa23ec","symR":["ESP"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Espey Boosts Qtr Dividend To 15c/Shr From 13c >ESP","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T18:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ESP"],"IndustryCodes":["ELQ","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Espey Mfg. & Electronics Corp.

In addition, the demand for the security products continues to increase to the SMB market since the full enforcement of the personal information protection law from April 2005.  Moreover, our flagship personal product \"Virus Buster\", called \"PC-Cillin\" outside of Japan, has still seen healthy growth with the demand of personal users based on their strong awareness to protect against the theft of individual property helping to boost Japan revenue.

Also, the security demands for especially the small companies in SMB business market increased.  The sales for this period in the area came to 8,836 million yen (28% increase from the previous period). \b \u001d  In the European region, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been reviewed its ultra-low interest policy that had kept with the stagnant economy in the background with raising its interest rate in March 2006 as the second times since the end of 2005 for the first time in recent 5 years and fixed. European's business economy is on a gradual recovery based on enterprise- driven with the improved employment picture and brisk exports.  According to Institute for Economic Research, Munich (IFO), German business sentiment rose in June to its highest level in over 15 years.  It is considered that great opportunities such as the 2006 World Cup and incentives to spend before value- added tax's expires at the beginning of 2007 are increasing.  Under these circumstances, sales for the large enterprise market in France and Italy has increased.  The sales for this period in the area came to 10,021 million yen (14% increase from the previous period). \b \u001d  In Asia and Pacific regions, although inflationary pressure has concerned as the issue, the economic recovery tone in the background of brisk export stands out.  In East Asia, especially mainland China has showed a better-than- expected GDP in this first half of the year.  According to such a situation, we have a growth of sales for large enterprise and SMB business market, and also Australia and mainland China have been showing steady performance of sales.  The net sales for this period in the regions came to 4,436 million yen (18% increase from the previous period). \b \u001d  At Latin America region, large enterprise business market boosted net sales and its growth rate is the highest in all region for this period.  In this region net sales came to 1,308 million yen (71% increase from the previous period). \b \u001d  As a result, the consolidated net sales for this period came to 40,673 million yen (18% increase from the previous period).  Meanwhile, operating expenses came to 26,956 million yen (24% increase from the previous period) due to the increases in the expense to deal with stock option expense since 2006 and expanding employee hiring.  In spite of 1,766 million of a one time payment (receipt) related to intellectual property usage, the consolidated operating income for this period was 13,717 million yen (7% increase from the same period in previous year) and the consolidated net income for this period was 7,997 million yen (6% decrease from the same period in previous year). \b \b \b    < As Amended > \b \b    (1).

According to Institute for Economic Research, Munich (IFO), German business sentiment rose in June to its highest level in over 15 years.  It is considered that great opportunities such as the 2006 World Cup and incentives to spend before value- added tax's expires at the beginning of 2007 are increasing.  Under these circumstances, sales for the large enterprise market in France and Italy has increased.  The sales for this period in the area came to 10,258 million yen (16% increase from the previous period). \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 07:07 ET (12:07 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"82a7d09877118335562204bb8847c800","symR":["BA.UN.T","CA07786J1030"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Bell Aliant Ratings Confirmed By DBRS >BA.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T16:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BA.UN.T","CA07786J1030"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 11:01 ET (16:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"82dc284b7af776fec5077f116f62b3bf","symR":["RUS.T","CA7819036046"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Russel Metals 4Q Net Down 27% On Lower Rev >RUS.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T18:52:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RUS.T","CA7819036046"],"IndustryCodes":["STL","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Russel Metals Inc.

But surprise -- developing countries are moving rather quickly to build beyond the big cities, spending billions on power lines, sewer pipes, roads and other basic infrastructure projects. \u001d  According to a recent Merrill Lynch report, the world's emerging nations could spend as much as $1 trillion over the next three years on basic infrastructure projects alone. And there are several well-run multinational companies that will reap billions of dollars in revenue and profits from the trend. \u001d  They'll have a lot of work to do. China alone could spend $400 billion as it spruces up for the 2008 Olympics. Other countries have equally big projects. Barely half the rural population of Latin American nations lives within a mile of an all-season road, according to World Bank estimates. And less than half of the 1.3 billion people in South Asia have access to reliable electricity. Developing countries would need to spend, on average, more than 5 percent of their gross domestic product just to maintain the inadequate status quo. \u001d  There are dozens of companies pouring asphalt and laying sewer lines, but choosing the best investments isn't easy -- many of these stocks have run up. The stock of Switzerland's ABB, one of the world's leading construction and engineering firms, has nearly tripled in two years; Egyptian construction firm Orascom has nearly quadrupled in the same time. \u001d  But while bargain stocks are hard to find, these companies have near-limitless potential for growth. \"You'll see a lot of opportunities in this sector,\" says Chris Lively, portfolio manager of the Old Mutual Clay Finlay Emerging Markets fund. \"Urbanization is driving the spending.\" Still, investors need to be careful not to overpay, which is why we narrowed the sector to three good picks. These companies are not only the best positioned to benefit from global economic growth, but they also provide the best value right now. \u001d  While Caterpillar is the world's largest construction-equipment firm, Japan's Komatsu is the leader when it comes to selling bulldozers and other earth-moving equipment in the emerging markets. \u001d  Komatsu's stock is up 175 percent in two years and, at 14 times expected earnings for the fiscal year ending in March 2008, trades at a higher valuation than Cat's P/E of 11. However, it's the better company for investors seeking to capitalize on emerging-market infrastructure spending, Lively says. Komatsu's sales in China have gone from $45 million in 2003 to an estimated $100 million for the fiscal year ending in March. The company expects to see strong sales growth in China, India and Indonesia. \u001d  India-based construction and engineering firm Larsen & Toubro has seen its sales nearly double in three years, to almost $4 billion in 2006. The company builds everything from power stations to water pipelines. In October the firm had almost $7 billion in sales on back order, and in December the company won a $1.2 billion contract to expand Delhi International Airport. Analysts expect the company's profits to grow at a 26 percent annual clip over the next five years, making the firm's forward P/E of 24 look reasonable. \u001d  Mexico-based Cemex grew fat off the seven-year U.S. housing boom; even though that boost tapered off in 2006, the firm has seen growth in other areas, namely, increasing sales in Mexico, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Analysts expect net income to rise 6 percent in 2007, to $2.6 billion, giving the stock a forward P/E of 9, far below that of the  S&P 500. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:00 ET (11:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8455b2732db0e05edc5a9fff2bf6780c","symR":["OMM"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"OMI Corp. 4Q EPS 96c Vs $1.53 >OMM","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T20:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OMM"],"IndustryCodes":["MAR","XDJGI","XNYA","XSCI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 15:16 ET (20:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"845f4542f89d0360a6f60d93718a8db7","symR":["SES.T","CA8055661067"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Saxon Energy Tgt Cut To C$6 From C$7 At R.

(OTCBB:MIVT) (FWB:MIV), a leading developer of next-generation biocompatible coatings and advanced drug delivery systems for cardiovascular stents and other implantable medical devices, announced that the Company has completed the acquisition of Biosync Scientific, an India-based designer and developer of innovative interventional cardiology products, including cardiovascular stents. \b \u001d  Biosync Scientific now provides MIVT with a highly competitive bare metal stent platform that compares favorably with the best bare metal stents available today. Both Biosync's stainless steel and thin-strut cobalt chromium stent platforms are CE Mark-certified for use in Europe and other countries around the world where the CE Mark is recognized, such as India. MIVT will use the Biosync stent platform as the underlying bare-metal stent platform for its proprietary biocompatible polymer-free next generation drug-eluting stents. \b \u001d  The Biosync Scientific acquisition is the latest step in MIVT's strategic plan to become a world leader in the $8 billion plus interventional cardiology market. MIVT also recently signed an agreement to acquire Vascore Medical, a China-based manufacturer and distributor of advanced interventional cardiology devices. \b \u001d  Biosync Scientific was founded by Rajesh Vaishnav, a well known and highly respected authority in the Indian Interventional Cardiology Industry. Over the past decade Mr. Vaishnav has been responsible for developing many of the leading bare-metal and drug-eluting stents currently being sold in India and other emerging markets around the world. Mr. Vaishnav will join MIVT as Chief Executive Officer of Biosync Scientific. \b \u001d  \"Biosync Scientific not only contributes a highly competitive CE Mark stent platform that complements our revolutionary polymer-free drug-eluting coatings, but also the leadership, expertise and experience of Mr. Vaishnav, one of India's most respected and well known stent authorities,\" said Dr. Mark Landy, President of MIV Therapeutics. \"We welcome Mr. Vaishnav and his team to the MIVT family, and we look forward to continuing to build our brand in one of the world's fastest-growing markets.\" \b \u001d  Together this partnership will accelerate the commercialization of MIVT technologies that could successfully address the well publicized issues facing the current drug eluting stent manufacturers. \b \u001d  Biosync Scientific's stated mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the productivity of health care delivery through the development and advocacy of less-invasive medical devices and procedures. This is accomplished through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and development of new technologies which can reduce risk, trauma, cost, procedure time and the need for aftercare. \b \b   About MIV Therapeutics Inc. \b \u001d  MIV Therapeutics is developing a next-generation line of advanced biocompatible coatings for passive and drug-eluting applications on cardiovascular stents and a broad range of other implantable medical devices. The Company's ultra-thin coating formulation is designed to protect surrounding tissue from potentially harmful interactions with bare metallic stents. The Company's unique ultra-thin coating platform is derived from an organic material called hydroxyapatite (HAp) which has demonstrated excellent safety and biocompatibility in vivo animal studies. Hydroxyapatite is a bioactive porous material that makes up the bone mineral and matrix of teeth and is widely used today as a bone substitute material and for coatings on implantable fixation devices in orthopedic, dental and other applications. The Company's novel polymer-free drug eluting technologies based on Hydroxyapatite could also provide an attractive alternative to current polymer-based drug eluting coatings on the stent market, which have been associated with undesirable medical effects. The Company's drug eluting coatings are additionally designed to suit a broad range of implantable medical devices that could benefit from highly customizable drug release profiles. MIVT has a Collaborative Research Agreement (CRA) with the University of British Columbia and has received Government grant for its research program on the \"Development of Novel Drug Eluting Composite Coatings for Cardiovascular Stents,\" under the National Research Council-Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP). Under this sponsorship, the Company is expected to complete its drug-eluting research and development program and to reach product commercialization stage. \b \u001d  For more information, please visit http://www.trilogy-capital.com/tcp/mivt/website.html.

(the \"Manager\") announces that it is proposing mergers of Mortgage-Backed Securities Trust (TSX:MF.UN) and MBS Adjustable Rate Income Fund (TSX:MTF.UN) (the \"Terminating Funds\") with Sentry Select MBS Adjustable Rate Income Fund II (TSX:MGS.UN) (collectively the \"Mergers\"). \b \bIf approved, the Terminating Funds will transfer all of their assets to Sentry Select MBS Adjustable Rate Income Fund II (the \"ARIF II\") in exchange for units of ARIF II and the assumption by ARIF II of all the liabilities of the Terminating Funds. Each unitholder of a Terminating Fund will receive units of ARIF II having the same aggregate net asset value as their units of the Terminating Fund as of the close of business on the effective date of the Mergers, expected to be April 4, 2007. \b \bThe Mergers \b \bThe Manager believes that the Mergers will result in significant benefits to unitholders. The larger combined ARIF II will have the advantage of increased economies of scale and lower fund operating expenses. The Mergers will eliminate the administrative and regulatory costs of operating separate investment funds, provide greater liquidity on the Toronto Stock Exchange and a higher profile in the marketplace resulting from greater net asset value and market capitalization. Unitholders of Mortgage Backed Securities Trust will also benefit from minimized currency exchange risk and more advantageous tax treatment of distributions, as ARIF II provides currency hedging and its distributions are generally treated as capital gains or return of capital. \b \bFee reduction \b \bIf either or both Mergers are completed, the Manager has agreed to reduce its management fee for ARIF II by 20%, effective July 1, 2007, from 0.125% to 0.100% of the net asset value of the Trust multiplied by the Partnership Leverage Factor (assuming a debt-to-equity ratio of 9:1, this percentage would be 1.00%), plus the amount equal to the Servicing Fee. \bIf either or both Mergers are completed, the General Partner has agreed to reduce its fee by 20% from 0.125% to 0.100% of the net asset value of the Partnership immediately (assuming a debt-to-equity ratio of 9:1 this percentage would be 1.00%). \b \bCosts of the Mergers \b \bAll costs and expenses associated with the Mergers will be borne by the Manager. \b \bUnitholder approval \b \bEach Merger will require approval of two-thirds of the votes cast by unitholders of a Terminating Fund at a special meeting of the unitholders to be held on April 4, 2007. The Mergers are not contingent on each other and one may proceed even if the other is not approved. The record date for the purpose of determining the unitholders entitled to receive notice and vote at the meetings is the close of business on February 28, 2007. \b \bThe proposed Mergers are subject to the acceptance and approval by the Toronto Stock Exchange. \b \bSentry Select Capital Corp. \b \bSentry Select Capital Corp. is a wealth management company providing investment, administrative and marketing services to 35 exchange-listed closed-end funds and corporations (including preferred securities and debentures), 22 principal-protected notes, 16 mutual funds and four flow-through limited partnerships. As of December 31, 2006, the firm had approximately $8 billion in gross assets under management. \b \b \bThe Exchange Tower \b130 King Street West \bSuite 2850, P.O.

Under the terms of the Agreement, VantageMed stockholders would receive cash consideration of US $0.75 per share, valuing the transaction at approximately US $13 million. Company directors, officers and a subset of its stockholders, representing in aggregate approximately 39% of VantageMed's outstanding shares, have already agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. \b \u001d  Upon completion of the transaction, Nightingale's U.S. operations will be run by VantageMed's CEO, Steve Curd, and the existing VantageMed management team will remain in place. \"The market for our core practice management products and services is maturing and we require a robust suite of Electronic Medical Record products to maintain our customer base and facilitate our future growth. To obtain EMR technology on our own would have required extensive stockholder dilution,\" said Curd. \"We believe that joining with Nightingale will enable us to better serve our customers, and the transaction provides liquidity to the VantageMed stockholders.\" \b \u001d  The combined company will be significantly larger than VantageMed is today which will allow it to improve support to its clients. \"Our additional scale will enable us to eliminate expenses associated with our being a public Company in the U.S., and intensify our focus on providing comprehensive, high quality solutions and support services to our customer base,\" Mr. Curd added. \b \u001d  The acquisition, expected to close prior to April 15, 2007, is conditioned upon a majority vote of the common stockholders and other customary conditions. VantageMed's Board of Directors has received a fairness opinion from Healthcare Growth Partners, Inc. stating that the consideration to be received pursuant to the offer is fair from a financial point of view to the stockholders of VantageMed. The Board of Directors has unanimously approved the Agreement. The Company expects to distribute its proxy materials in the coming weeks and convene a special meeting of stockholders in April 2007. \b \u001d  Concurrent with the announcement of the transaction, Nightingale has arranged a committed subordinated credit facility of CDN$15.5 million led by Wellington Financial LP and including Export Development Canada, a Limited Partner in Wellington Financial Fund III. \b \b    Important Information \b \u001d  In connection with the transaction, VantageMed intends to file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including a proxy statement. BECAUSE THOSE DOCUMENTS WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION, HOLDERS OF VANTAGEMED'S COMMON STOCK ARE URGED TO READ THEM CAREFULLY, IF AND WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. When filed with the SEC, they will be available for free (along with any other documents and reports filed by VantageMed with the SEC) at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov , and VantageMed's stockholders will receive information at an appropriate time on how to obtain transaction-related documents for free from VantageMed. Such documents are not currently available. \b \u001d  VantageMed and its executive officers and directors may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of VantageMed in favor of the proposed merger. A description of the interests of the executive officers and directors in VantageMed is set forth in the proxy statement for VantageMed's 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2006, and its Annual Report on Form 10-KSB filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2006. These documents are available free of charge at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov and from VantageMed by directing a request to VantageMed Investor Relations, 415-397-2686, ext. 213, investor@vantagemed.com.

In a statement published Sunday, Grupo Mexico said it's about to begin the fifth stage of the recovery effort, which involves removing gas to reach the area where the miners were working. \u001d  A Grupo Mexico source said Monday that work continued as normal at most of the company's facilities, including the La Caridad and Cananea copper mines, although there was high absenteeism at the San Martin zinc mine in Zacatecas state. \u001d  Luis Rey Delgado, a spokesman for Industrias Penoles (PE&OLES.MX), the world's biggest silver producer, said the strike was affecting the company's mines and its metals complex in Torreon. Delgado said Penoles workers agreed to make up the lost day next month. \u001d  Also reported on strike were steelworkers at Lazaro Cardenas, on the Pacific coast, where the Arcelor Mittal (MT) plants are located. \u001d  Monday's work stoppage comes amid a year-old dispute over the leadership of the 250,000-member miners union. Saturday marked a year since the Labor Ministry recognized dissident Elias Morales as head of the union, prompting a nationwide strike last March in support of union boss Napoleon Gomez Urrutia. \u001d  Gomez Urrutia, who is backed by a majority of local union leaders and has received expressions of support from international labor groups, has been accused of embezzling funds from the $55 million that Grupo Mexico paid the union related to the 1990 privatization of Cananea and La Caridad. He is currently in Canada. \u001d  Labor Minister Javier Lozano, who took office Dec. 1 with the incoming administration of President Felipe Calderon, recently proposed a union vote to settle the leadership dispute. \u001d  Zuniga said the union would accept the possibility if it has guarantees that the outcome will be respected, noting that the ministry under the previous government rejected the results of a convention last year in which Gomez Urrutia was ratified. \u001d  The union is also demanding government action in investigating the document, which the Labor Ministry accepted in recognizing Morales as a replacement for Gomez Urrutia. Zuniga said his signature was forged on that document. \u001d  -By Anthony Harrup, Dow Jones Newswires; (5255) 5080 3450, anthony.harrup@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 14:23 ET (19:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8724becbd1e0ed71a6634fb9b48fa78b","symR":["GEA.T","CA3805911078"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Gold Eagle Mines Tgt Upped To C$11 By Westwind >GEA.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T14:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GEA.T","CA3805911078"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 09:54 ET (14:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"873a63f9285b36133061aec42f183148","symR":["NCR"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Teradata Named Best Global Data Warehouse-Business Intelligence Appliance Vendor","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T16:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NCR"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\bDAYTON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2007-- \u001d  Teradata, a division of NCR Corporation (NYSE:NCR), announced that Teradata was named the best global data warehouse-business intelligence appliance vendor by readers of Intelligent Enterprise Magazine, a CMP Media publication. \b \u001d  \"Readers are the best judge of what works for them, and our Readers' Choice Awards are an indication of products that have delivered good value to the broadest spectrum of users,\" said Doug Henschen, Intelligent Enterprise, editor-in-chief. \"Teradata has earned the respect of our readers.\" \b \u001d  Each year, Intelligent Enterprise Magazine invites its readers to select their preferred vendors in a range of 37 different technology categories.

We normally reconcile \b        this financial measure to diluted earnings per share from continuing \b        operations; however, diluted earnings per share from continuing \b        operations calculated in accordance with GAAP is not currently \b        accessible on a forward-looking basis.  For a summary of information \b        that is unavailable, see the discussion under \"Assumptions\" below. \b    (B) The forecasted range for cash flow from operations in 2007 above \b        excludes expected cash taxes, one-time transition costs associated \b        with the Alderwoods acquisition, and expected payments to terminate \b        our cash balance and certain other pension plans.  Cash flow from \b        operations before these items is a non-GAAP financial measure.  For a \b        reconciliation to cash flow from operations calculated in accordance \b        with GAAP, see \"Operating and cash flow highlights\" below. \b \b \u001d  A summary of the key financial drivers and assumptions for our 2007 financial outlook are discussed below: \b \b \b    Effect of Alderwoods Acquisition \b \b     *  Based on current estimates and assumptions, we expect to achieve \b        annual pretax improvement synergies of $90 to $100 million as a result \b        of the acquisition of Alderwoods, which occurred on November 28, 2006. \b        This compares to our original estimate of $60 to $70 million of \b        overhead synergies.  We expect to achieve the additional synergies \b        primarily through improved purchasing leverage, pricing initiatives, \b        and further staffing synergies as a result of implementing \b        standardized operating metrics.  Of the $90 to $100 million of total \b        anticipated annual synergies, we expect to realize approximately $65 \b        to $75 million in 2007 and realize a full run-rate of the \b        $90 to $100 million of synergies in 2008. \b \b     *  In order to achieve these synergies described above, we expect to \b        incur approximately $66 million of one-time cash transition costs, \b        primarily for severance expenses.  This compares to our original \b        estimate of $60 million.  Approximately $27 million of these \b        transition costs were incurred in 2006.  We expect to recognize \b        approximately $39 million in 2007, of which we estimate that \b        $15 million will be capitalized and $24 million will be expensed. \b \b     *  We expect that the one-time financing and closing costs in connection \b        with the acquisition will be approximately $80 million. This compares \b        to our original estimate of $75 million.  During 2006, we incurred \b        $77 million of these costs, of which $60 million was capitalized.  We \b        expect to incur an additional $3 to $4 million of closing costs in \b        2007 which will be capitalized. \b \b    Operating and cash flow highlights \b \b     *  We expect to increase funeral revenues through continued strong growth \b        in the average revenue per funeral service primarily as a result of \b        our initiative to realign funeral pricing towards service offerings \b        from traditional product offerings. This expected increase in average \b        revenue will offset expectations for lower funeral volume primarily as \b        a result of our exit from low priced immediate cremation activities in \b        certain markets. \b \b     *  We expect to increase preneed funeral and cemetery sales production as \b        a result of focusing more administrative and lead procurement \b        resources in this area. \b \b     *  We expect to realize cost savings associated with implementing \b        standardized staffing and selling metrics in our funeral and cemetery \b        operations.  These anticipated savings are expected to help mitigate \b        inflationary increases in fixed costs.  We also plan to invest in our \b        funeral operations to further our customer segmentation initiative, \b        which we believe will drive incremental volume growth over time. \b \b     *  In 2007, we expect cash flows from operating activities calculated in \b        accordance with GAAP to range from $306 to $346 million.  This range \b        includes $30 to $40 million for total expected U.S. federal cash taxes \b        in 2007 commencing mid-year, one-time Alderwoods transition costs of \b        approximately $24 million described above, and expected payments of \b        approximately $40 million to terminate our cash balance and certain \b        other pension plans.  We expect cash flow from operations excluding \b        these items described above to range from $400 to $450 million. \b \b     *  We expect total capital expenditures in 2007 to range from $150 to \b        $180 million. The following table provides a detail of our capital \b        spending outlook for 2007: \b \b \b         In millions \b         Capital improvements at \b          existing facilities                             $60 to $70 \b         Capital expenditures to develop \b          cemetery property                               $45 to $55 \b         Acquisition or construction of new \b          funeral or cemetery facilities                  $45 to $55 \b                                                        -------------- \b         Total capital expenditures                      $150 to $180 \b \b \b    Divestitures \b \b     *  During 2007, we intend to sell all of the properties named in the \b        consent decree executed with the Federal Trade Commission, as well as \b        other SCI assets previously identified as non-strategic. SCI has \b        reached definitive agreements for disposition of most of these assets \b        and is finalizing agreements with respect to the others.  We expect \b        that we will generate $150 to $170 million of proceeds in 2007 from \b        these divestitures. \b \b     *  We have entered into a definitive agreement to sell Mayflower National \b        Life Insurance Company, Alderwoods' former insurance subsidiary, for \b        $65 million and expect to close the transaction in the first half of \b        2007. \b \b     *  We will continue to review and evaluate our portfolio of integrated \b        businesses and anticipate that there could be more divestitures in \b        2007 due to opportunities to consolidate businesses or to rationalize \b        additional non-strategic assets. \b \b    Other Items \b \b     *  We expect general and administrative expenses before expected one-time \b        Alderwoods transition costs of approximately $24 million to range from \b        $85 to $95 million in 2007.  Total general and administrative expenses \b        calculated in accordance with GAAP are expected to range from $109 to \b        $119 million. \b \b     *  We expect interest expense to range from $145 to $155 million in 2007. \b        We intend to pay down the remaining balance of our $150 million term \b        loan in the first quarter of 2007 and do not anticipate any further \b        material debt payments in 2007. \b \b     *  We expect depreciation and amortization expense to range from $145 to \b        $175 million in 2007.  Beginning in 2007, we will reclassify within \b        cash flows from operations our non-cash cemetery property cost of \b        sales from working capital to amortization of cemetery property.  This \b        change will not have any impact on net earnings or cash flow from \b        operations.  The anticipated breakdown of depreciation and \b        amortization expense in 2007 is as follows: \b \b \b \b         In millions \b         Depreciation expense                           $100 to $110 \b         Amortization expense                            $10 to $20 \b         Amortization of cemetery property               $35 to $45 \b                                                      --------------- \b         Total depreciation and amortization expense    $145 to $175 \b \b \b    ASSUMPTIONS \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 17:25 ET (22:25 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"8876f7cb67c99a7704b96ae230de3788","symR":["BA.UN.T","CA07786J1030"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Bell Aliant Ups Monthly Distrib To C$0.2350/Unit >BA.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T16:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BA.UN.T","CA07786J1030"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Bell Aliant Regional Communications Income Fund (BA.UN.T) has increased its monthly distribution to 23.5 Canadian cents a unit from 22.83 Canadian cents. \u001d  The distribution increase takes effect with February's monthly distribution which will be paid on March 15 to unitholders of record at the close of business on Feb. 28, the fund said. \u001d  Bell Aliant, Halifax, N.S., is a regional communications provider. \u001d  -Wendy Tsau;

It is slated to open sometime in 2008. \b \bCanam obtained two contracts in the scope of this project. The first, from steel fabricator Walters Inc. of Hamilton, Ontario, is for the fabrication of approximately 400 tons of joists and joist girders. A second contract, this one from steel fabricator Norak Steel Construction of Concord, Ontario, is for the fabrication of some 1,590 tons of steel trusses. These components will be fabricated at the Canam plant in Mississauga, Ontario, and deliveries will begin next April. \b \bMurox obtained a contract from general contractor Vanbots Construction Corporation of Markham, Ontario, for the manufacture and installation of close to 120,000 square feet of non load-bearing wall panels. Already familiar with the Murox system, having used it both for the construction and expansion of its industrial complex in Alliston, management at Honda Canada once again opted for the Murox system because of its quick and efficient installation. \b \bCanam is the largest steel joist fabricator in Canada and the second largest in North America. Steel joists are joist girders that support the ceilings and floors of commercial and industrial buildings. Canam also fabricates and distributes steel deck. \b \bMurox designs, manufactures and markets high-performance building systems for the commercial, industrial and institutional construction markets. Thanks to its unique technology of shop-assembled, load-bearing wall panels, Murox offers owners, developers and general contractors superior, customized buildings for their construction projects. \b \bCanam Group Inc. is an industrial company operating 11 plants specialized in the design and fabrication of construction products and solutions.

Each share will be issued with two free attaching options at an exercise price of A$0.23 and a term of four years. Placements to U.S. investors were made pursuant to Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act and placements to non-U.S. investors were made pursuant to Regulation S under that Act. HPC Capital Management Corp., a New York based investment bank, acted as the sole placement agent. \b \u001d  The capital raising was undertaken in replacement of the previously-announced Nordic Biotech Fund interim financing described in the Notice of the Extraordinary General Meeting. \b \u001d  \"This capital raising allows the Company to focus on the recently announced exclusive licensing negotiations with a global pharmaceutical company and continue its primary focus on near and medium term opportunities, particularly in the area of controlled slow release drug delivery technologies,\" said Dr. Paul Ashton, Managing Director of pSivida Limited. \b \u001d  At the Company's General Meeting of Shareholders on February 20th, 2007, the shareholders will consider a non-specific resolution that, if approved, would allow the Company to issue the shares and options in this placement. \b \u001d  The securities offered will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy any securities. \b \u001d  This release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including with respect to the closing of the placement on the terms described, our ongoing negotiations with a global pharmaceutical company and our near and medium term opportunities in the area of controlled slow release drug delivery technologies.

Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to many important factors including failure of the company to successfully close the transaction due to the company's shareholders not approving the transaction, the company's failure to meet the closing conditions specified in the transaction documentation (including, the occurrence of a material adverse change to the company's assets, liabilities, results of operations, condition (financial or otherwise), business, or prospects, the Company's failure to maintain its current listings on the NASDAQ Stock Market and ASX, the investors' failure to comply with any regulatory requirements, failure of the results of the Retisert(TM) for DME trial to be a good indicator of the results of pSivida's ongoing Phase III Medidur(TM) for DME trial; failure of the Medidur(TM) trials in DME to show a very similar improvement in visual acuity and diabetic retinopathy severity score as Retisert(TM) for DME; failure of Medidur(TM) to release fluocinolone acetonide at the same rate as Retisert(TM); our inability to recruit patients for the Phase III Medidur(TM) for DME trial; our inability to develop proposed products, including without limitation, in the controlled slow release drug delivery field; failure of our negotiations with the global pharmaceutical company to result in an agreement on favorable terms or at all; and regulatory, scientific or other issues.

There is a good balance between what sellers and buyers want respectively,\" he says. \u001d  Companies mentioned as potential IPO candidates include 7TM Pharma, Natimmune, Egalet, Gastrotech Pharma, Symphogen, Santaris, M2 Medical and Millimed. \u001d  Florian Schoenharting, co-founder and partner of venture capital firm Nordic Biotech, says that of these, 7TM Pharma stands out as the flagship company. \u001d  \"It has first-class investors involved, they are in phase II with their drug for obesity, which is a big indication, and they have done some international deals,\" he said. \u001d  Schoenharting added that Gastrotech and Egalet are also interesting as both companies have good, late-stage products and Egalet also has the advantage of being supported by top venture capital firm Index Ventures. \u001d  Egalet has two products in late-stage research for the treatment of high blood pressure and pain management and Gastrotech has two drugs in phase II research for catabolic disorders and irritable bowel syndrome. \u001d  The positive sentiment for biotechnology investments in Denmark has been triggered by a number of companies entering lucrative contracts with international pharmaceutical firms. \u001d  In December, Genmab A/S (GEN.KO) signed a potential $2.1 billion partnership deal with GlaxoSmithKline PLC (GSK) for its blood cancer drug HuMax-CD20, and shortly after, peer ALK-Abello A/S (ALK-B.KO) entered a contract with Schering-Plough Corp.

The two-year/10-year spread widened by one basis point to 11.0 basis points, and the 10-year/30-year spread widened by two basis points to 13.0 basis points. \u001d  At 1530 GMT, the March bund future on Eurex was down 0.11 at 115.28, the benchmark 10-year bund was down 0.15 at 97.47 to yield 4.065%. \u001d  U.K. gilts traded lower after comments from the Bank of England seemed to indicate the possibility of the need for higher interest rates. \u001d  In a written report to parliament's Treasury Committee, the BOE said the inflation environment is unlikely to be as benign in the future as it has been since inflation targeting began in 1997. \u001d  Short sterling dropped immediately, with the June contract down 0.02 at 94.27, as the market took the comment as a signal that inflation could rise above 3%, the upper limit of the BOE's comfort zone. \u001d  Gilts also fell, with the long-end slightly outperforming the short-end. The yield on the two-year gilt rose by two basis points to 5.35%, and on the 10-year by 2.5 basis points to 4.895%. The yield on the 30-year rose by 1.5 basis points to 4.34%, ahead of Tuesday's GBP1.0 billion 2037 index-linked gilt auction. \u001d  Insinger's Ostwald noted some positioning ahead of the supply, with flows indicating \"solid real-money demand.\" \u001d  At 1530 GMT, the March Gilt future contract was down 0.15 at 106.89, while the 4% gilt due 2016 was down 0.17 at 93.25 to yield 4.895%. \b \u001d  -By Keith Jenkins, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-20-7842-9495; keith.jenkins@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 10:45 ET (15:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8b950f4aff4e662f783a1069eeca4b25","symR":["CHR","CHRN.EB","SCO","SCR.FR","CH0012997711","FR0010411983"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Scor \"Irrevocably\" Secures 32.9% Of Converium Shr Cap>SCO CHR","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T08:20:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CHR","CHRN.EB","SCO","SCR.FR","CH0012997711","FR0010411983"],"IndustryCodes":["INS","INU","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--French reinsurance company Scor SA (SCO) Monday said it has acquired 32.9% of the share capital of Converium Holding AG (CHR). \u001d  In a statement, Scor said it \"has irrevocably secured\" 32.9% of the share capital of Converium - 8.3% through direct market purchases and 24.6% through share purchase agreements, the consummation of which is subject to regulatory approvals. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 03:20 ET (08:20 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8b9e2509370056fd1765b19280b55393","symR":["AMC.AU","AMCR","AU000000AMC4"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Australia's Amcor 1H Net A$527M","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T21:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMC.AU","AMCR","AU000000AMC4"],"IndustryCodes":["CTR","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 16:32 ET (21:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8c25a227167d0e6516314afa6713c372","symR":["UFPI"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": OPEN JOIST(R) Promotes Speed and Strength, Teams Up with Kasey Kahne Racing, Dodge Motorsports","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T21:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UFPI"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","REA","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\bGRAND RAPIDS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2007-- \u001d  Universal Forest Products (Nasdaq:UFPI) today announces they will team up with NASCAR superstar Kasey Kahne and Dodge Motorsports to promote Open Joist as the company's first major motorsports initiative.

(NYSE: BLC) announced today the passing of one of the great leaders in the Company's history, James M. \"Jimmy\" Moroney, Jr., at the age of 85.  For more than 60 years, Moroney helped drive the evolution of The Dallas Morning News, Belo's television business, and the parent company, Belo Corp.  His legacy is that of a caring father, generous leader and loyal friend. \b \u001d  \"Jimmy will be remembered always for his personal humility and unwavering belief in Belo's institutional purposes,\" said Robert W. Decherd, Belo's chairman, president and chief executive officer.  \"He exerted a steady and powerful influence on the Company's transitions and expansions over half a century, and in many instances, he was the pivotal influence.\" \b \u001d  Moroney joined The Dallas Morning News in 1946 after serving in the U.S. Navy. He held numerous positions with the Company throughout his career, starting as a reporter at The Morning News and retiring as chief executive officer and chairman of the Board of Directors in December 1986 at age 65. From 1987 to 2000, he remained on the Board of Directors, serving as chairman of the executive committee, and upon retirement from the board, he was named chairman emeritus. \b \u001d  His forward-thinking insight led Belo's expansion into new products including broadcast television and new markets outside of Dallas.  In the 1970s, Moroney played a critical role in converting Belo from a privately-held company founded by his grandfather, George Bannerman Dealey, into one of the nation's largest publicly-traded media companies. \b \u001d  In 1980, Moroney became president and chief executive officer of The Dallas Morning News and president and chief operating officer of Belo. Moroney became chief executive officer of Belo in 1983 and the following year was elected chairman of the board.  During his tenure as CEO, he was instrumental in the purchase of Corinthian Broadcasting Group from The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation.  At the time, the $606 million transaction was the largest ever in U.S. broadcast history. \b \u001d  \"One remarkable thing about Jimmy was his consistency,\" said Decherd. \"That's very rare in this world, as we think about the length of time he was part of Belo, both as an employee and as a director.  It's even more remarkable in a world where time is measured in nanoseconds, and where the lifespans of companies and institutions and product ideas have been reduced to very short cycles. \b \u001d  \"I'm not sure we'll see many more Jimmy Moroneys, but the spirit and example that he created will be enduring for us at Belo, and will be an example for many others to follow,\" added Decherd. \b \u001d  An obituary published in today's Dallas Morning News details Moroney's extensive professional and civic accomplishments, and together with a news story broadcast on February 18 on WFAA-TV, can be accessed online at http://dallasnews.com or http://wfaa.com . \b \b    About Belo \b \u001d  Belo Corp. is one of the nation's largest media companies with a diversified group of market-leading television, newspaper, cable and interactive media assets.  A Fortune 1000 company with 7,100 employees and $1.6 billion in annual revenues, Belo operates in some of America's most dynamic markets in Texas, the Northwest, the Southwest, the Mid-Atlantic and Rhode Island.  Belo owns 19 television stations, six of which are in the 15 largest U.S. broadcast markets.

In addition, it has just begun sales of Japanese shares to local investors at the Singaporean operation. \u001d  At a time when barriers separating banking and securities operations are gradually crumbling in such areas as financing of corporate acquisitions, megabanks are scrambling to boost their competitiveness to meet this challenge.

Reiten said the process \"is on track.\" \u001d  Analyst Morten Normann of Kaupthing said Hydro's overall aluminum division clean operating profit was slightly higher than Kaupthing's estimate. \u001d  He added that the aluminum metals subdivision's performance was more disappointing, with a loss on a London Metals Exchange contract. Even taking that loss into account, there was a negative deviation from forecasts \"that was not explained by specific one-off items,\" Normann said. \u001d  Credit Suisse said in a research note that lower-than-forecast clean EBIT for the period was based on higher energy and raw-materials costs and a slight decline in primary production in the aluminum division. \u001d  Ongoing restructuring within Hydro's aluminum business resulted in a shift to operating profit for Hydro's total aluminum activities of NOK413 million in the fourth quarter versus a loss of NOK1.099 billion in the same period of 2005. Despite this, Hydro said operating income was \"heavily influenced by write-downs, costs and charges relating to the restructuring of its downstream aluminum operations.\" \u001d  In its outlook on aluminum markets, the company said that key economic indicators signal \"somewhat slower growth\" in European, U.S. and Asian aluminum markets in 2007. \u001d  It forecast a 7% increase in global primary aluminum consumption in 2007, driven largely by Chinese demand, with European consumption growth expected only 2.5% higher on the year, and U.S. consumption seen 1% lower. \u001d  Hydro's first-quarter 2007 aluminum products operations are expected to be positively influenced by progress in its plant rationalization programs, the company said. \u001d  Meanwhile, Hydro's oil and energy division saw realized oil prices increase 4% in the fourth quarter versus the same period in 2005, while gas prices rose 6%. In the year as a whole, realized oil prices rose 18% compared with 2005 and realized gas prices lifted 27%. \u001d  In the fourth quarter, Hydro produced an average of 595,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 6,000 boe/d more than a year ago. For the full year, average oil and gas production increased to 573,000 boe/d from 563,000 boe/d in 2005, exceeding its revised target of 570,000 boe/d. \u001d  Despite the year-on-year rise, Hydro said output was hurt by production interruptions on partner-operated fields on the Norwegian continental shelf together with lower-than-expected output from its international portfolio. \u001d  It turned in a reserve-replacement ratio of just 38%. The figure demonstrates that management still has some way to go to improve underlying performance,\" Credit Suisse said. \u001d  Despite this, Hydro Chief Financial Officer John Ottestad said at the results presentation that he expects to see a swift reversal of fortunes, as key assets like giant gas field Ormen Lange come online, enabling a reserve upgrade under U.S. Exchange and Securities Commission regulations. The company said it also expects a number of core projects to receive sanctioning during 2007. \u001d  Credit Suisse noted that Hydro's aggressive exploration campaign will help address future reserves replacement. It rates Hydro neutral. \u001d  Hydro retained its 2007 production target of 605,000 boe/d, which represents a 6% increase on realized production in 2006. \u001d  Hydro shares closed down NOK0.75, or 0.4%, at NOK195. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.hydro.com \b \u001d  -By Elizabeth Cowley, Dow Jones Newswires; +47 22 20 10 58; elizabeth.cowley@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 13:11 ET (18:11 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8edacd659e3e2ad89040f46d73c8c63b","symR":["UMN.LN","UMN.T","VGG9298V1067"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": UraMin Inc. - SRK's Interim Report On The Trekkopje Feasibility Study>UMN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T14:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UMN.LN","UMN.T","VGG9298V1067"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF"],"Story":"\bTORONTO, Feb. 19 /CNW/ - UraMin is pleased to announce the results of SRK's Interim Progress Update Report on the feasibility study for the Trekkopje Uranium Project in Namibia: \b \b \b    << \b    -  Proposed production profile rising to over 8 million lbs per annum \b       U(3)0(8) using heap leach technology \b \b    -  Estimated operating costs are US$18.07 per lb U(3)0(8) after V(2)0(5) \b       credit (US$20.08 per lb without V(2)0(5) credit) and estimated capital \b       expenditure of US$461 million \b \b    -  Estimated pre-tax Internal Rate of Return of 67 per cent and a Net \b       Asset Value of US$1.2 billion (using an 8 per cent discount rate) \b \b    -  Resources in the Measured and Indicated category increase over 200 per \b       cent to 46.5 million lbs at an average grade of 146ppm U(3)0(8) (using \b       a cut-off of 100ppm) \b    >> \b \b \bIan Stalker, Chief Executive, said: \"SRK's project scope contemplates an open pit mine utilising a sodium carbonate/bicarbonate heap leach process at a large scale mining rate of 100,000 tpd. As a result production would rise to more than 8 million lbs per annum of U(3)0(8), much higher than previously envisaged, and Trekkopje would become one of the largest uranium producing mines in the world. SRK's interim results have exceeded expectations and we look forward to completing the Feasibility Study and beginning the development stage later this year.\" \b \bHeap leach is the preferred processing technology following successful column leach test work indicating recoveries of approximately 75 per cent and as a result SRK has evaluated a production profile for Trekkopje rising to 8 million lbs U(3)0(8) per annum. This compares favourably with the 3.3 million lbs U(3)0(8) per annum of production previously considered using tank leach processing. Most importantly water consumption using heap leaching is substantially lower than would be the case with tank leaching. \b \bSRK's model envisages a 2 year pre-production period, followed by a production period of 8 years producing 61 million lbs U(3)0(8) and 20 million lbs V(2)0(5). A trial mine is planned for the fourth quarter of 2007 and Trekkopje should commence commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2008 at initial production rates of 4 million lbs per annum scaling up to in excess of 8 million lbs within 2 years thereafter. Potential exists to achieve incremental production for the project from the following areas: \b \b \b    << \b    -  An additional 75 million tonnes of sulphate rich ore grading \b       approximately 148 ppm is excluded from the proposed mine plan but is \b       the subject of further testing and could be amenable to acid leaching. \b \b    -  Test work is being undertaken to determine whether lower grade \b       material using a cut off grade of 60 ppm could be treated on a \"dump \b       leach\" basis. \b \b    -  Excellent exploration potential exists on the additional exploration \b       license area granted to UraMin in November 2006. Significant \b       radiometric anomalies on the property are interpreted to delineate \b       extensive sedimentary channels, similar to those already drilled on \b       the Trekkopje project. \b    >> \b \b \bThis potential upside could extend the life of mine and sustainability of production rates of 8 million lbs per annum of U(3)0(8) beyond the initial mine plan of 8 years with resultant enhanced project economics. \b \bThe selection of a carbonate/bi-carbonate heap leach and ion exchange at a mine production rate of 100,000 tpd would require a water supply from a desalination plant of 12 million m(3) per year. It is anticipated that the cost of construction of a desalination plant may be partially offset by contributions from other parties reducing the estimated capital expenditure on the basis of a shared plant. \b \bUpdated Resource Statement \b \bUraMin is also pleased to announce SRK's NI 43-101 compliant updated interim resource statement on the Trekkopje Uranium Project in Namibia where both deposits have seen a substantial conversion of Inferred to Indicated Resources. Current in-fill drilling is expected to convert most of the total remaining Inferred resource to Measured and Indicated. \b \b \b    << \b    -  Project Measured and Indicated resources are estimated at 144.6 \b       million tonnes grading 146 ppm eU(3)O(8) (at a 100 ppm cut off grade), \b       containing an estimated 46.5 million pounds of U(3)O(8). \b \b    -  Project Inferred resources are estimated at 195.3 million tonnes \b       grading 138 ppm eU(3)O(8), containing an estimated 59.3 million pounds \b       U(3)O(8). \b \b    -  The Measured and Indicated resource increased 236% from the September \b       2006 initial resource estimate, as a result of the conversion of \b       Inferred resources, due to increased drill density. \b \b    -  A program of in-fill drilling central to the 200 by 200m grid (5-spot \b       drilling) is being completed and is expected to convert much of the \b       existing Inferred resource to Measured and/or Indicated resource.

(TSX:EIA)(\"Ecopia\" or the \"Corporation\") and privately-held Caprion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (\"Caprion\") announced today that they have received from investors subscription commitments of gross proceeds for a proposed new amalgamation of the two companies (\"Amalco\") of $45 million, which represents the maximum amount intended to be raised in the previously announced range of $30 million to $45 million.  The companies also announced today that the proposed name for Amalco will be Thallion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (\"Thallion\"). \b \bPicchio Pharma Inc., a joint venture healthcare investment firm owned by FMRC Family Trust (a trust of which Dr. Francesco Bellini is a beneficiary) and Power Technology Investment Corporation (a subsidiary of Power Corporation of Canada), has placed a lead order of $4 million in the proposed financing.  The private placement by a syndicate of agents is being co-led by Desjardins Securities Inc. and Dundee Securities Corporation and includes Loewen, Ondaatje, McCutcheon Limited and Versant Partners Inc. \b \b\"We believe that this milestone in our financing validates the vision and strategy behind our merger and the early support and advice we received from our investors at Picchio to form a leading oncology and infectious disease company with scale and critical mass,\" said Lloyd M. Segal, currently president and chief executive officer of Caprion and who will be chief executive officer of Thallion. \b \b\"The proceeds from this offering will allow Thallion to drive the development of all three of its clinical products,\" said Pierre Falardeau, currently president and chief executive officer of Ecopia and who will be chief operating officer of Thallion. \b \bThis announcement follows the previously announced proposed amalgamation, as part of a plan of arrangement (\"Arrangement\"), to form a new Amalco.  The contemplated $45 million that they have received from investors in the form of subscription commitments shall be for an aggregate of 180,000,000 units of Amalco (\"Amalco Units\"), which will be issued at a price of $0.25 per Amalco Unit and each Amalco Unit will be comprised of one common share of Amalco (\"Amalco Share\") and one-half share purchase warrant of Amalco (\"Amalco Warrant\"). Each whole Amalco Warrant will entitle its holder to purchase one Amalco Share at a price of $0.375 for a period of 36 months following the date of its issuance. Closing of the private placement is conditional upon the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions, which conditions include the completion of the Arrangement and approval by disinterested shareholders of Ecopia. As part of the Arrangement, after the issuance of Amalco Units pursuant to the private placement, it is proposed that the common shares of Amalco be consolidated on the basis of one post-consolidation common share for every ten pre-consolidation common shares. \b \bEcopia and Caprion have also announced today that their joint management information circular and related documents relating to the meetings of their respective shareholders to be held on March 12, 2007 to consider and vote on, among other things, the proposed amalgamation of Ecopia and Caprion as part of the Arrangement, have been mailed to the security holders of Ecopia and Caprion. \b \bThe joint management information circular and certain related documents are also available on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com. under Ecopia's profile. \b \bTHE SECURITIES OFFERED HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES ABSENT REGISTRATION OR AN APPLICABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS.

Our current focus is to move our flagship compound ECO-4601 through Phase I clinical trials. ECO-4601 is a novel small molecule that, based on advanced animal models, crosses the blood brain barrier and is effective in significantly inhibiting primary brain tumor growth and other types of cancers. Just like well-known chemotherapies such as doxorubicin and mitomycin C, ECO-4601 comes from microorganisms that live in common soil. However, unlike these drugs that were discovered many decades ago, ECO-4601 represents a new chemical class that is derived from Ecopia's proprietary drug discovery platform Decipher(R). The common shares of Ecopia are listed on the TSX (TSX:EIA). \b \bAdditional information about Ecopia can be obtained from Ecopia's website at www.ecopiabio.com. \b \bAbout Caprion \b \bCaprion Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing pharmaceutical products in the areas of infectious disease and oncology. Caprion's clinical-stage programs include Shigamabs(R), a product for the treatment of Shigatoxin-producing E. coli bacterial infections, and CAP-232, a targeted therapy with potential efficacy in multiple oncology indications. CellCarta(R), Caprion's proprietary proteomics technology, provides Caprion with an effective means to identify novel drug targets, predict which therapeutics may be safer and more efficacious, and identify which patients may benefit most from a particular therapy. \b \bAdditional information about Caprion can be obtained from Caprion's website at www.caprion.com. \b \bForward-Looking Statements \b \bCertain statements in this press release that do not relate exclusively to historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or the Corporation's future performance. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as \"may\", \"will\", \"should\", \"expect\", \"plan\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"estimate\", \"predict\", \"potential\", \"targeting\", \"intend\", \"could\", \"might\", \"continue\", or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. In addition, this press release may contain forward-looking statements attributed to third party industry sources. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, as there can be no assurance that the plans, intentions or expectations upon which they are based will occur. By its nature, forward-looking information involves numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, that contribute to the possibility that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not occur and may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to (i) the potential combination of Ecopia and Caprion, (ii) the potential private placement of securities of the amalgamated company, (iii) the ability to raise future capital to fund the Corporation's research and development activities; (iv) success and timely completion of clinical studies; (v) the pursuit of clinical trials in the United States; (vi) the potential of ECO-4601 as a chemotherapy against primary brain cancer; (vii) the potential of ECO-4601 in the treatment of breast, prostate, colon, lung and ovarian cancers; (viii) the identification of a second generation ECO-4601 compound; (ix) the identification of a non-ECO-4601 related compound as a candidate for another regulatory filing; (x) the grant by the United States Patent and Trademark Office of a patent directed to ECO-4601 based on the Corporation's notice of allowance; and (xi) the earning of revenues from the exercise of exclusivity options on out-licensed patent properties may rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are therefore subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside Ecopia's control. \bActual results may therefore vary materially from the expectations expressed by the Corporation and depend on a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the possibility of not satisfying all closing conditions to complete the combination of Ecopia and Caprion, (ii) the ability of Ecopia of raising sufficient capital for purposes of the proposed private placement, (iii) risks related to the integration of acquisitions, (iv) the possibility of delays in approval of patients in Phase I trial; (v) scientific uncertainties relating to the correlation between preclinical animal data and human clinical data; (vi) the safety and efficacy of ECO-4601 as a cancer treatment; (vii) timely progress and completion of Phase I study; (viii) withdrawal of a notice of allowance by the United States Patent and Trademark Office; (ix) uncertainties related to the regulatory process for drug development; (x) the ability for the Corporation to fund its future operations in light of the lack of operating revenues for the years to come;(xi) and the impact of general economic conditions.

While CN continues to operate during the strike, the propane industry is experiencing increasing delays to propane shipments and problems in obtaining freight cars and containers to load. \b \bMany Canadians rely on propane as a sole energy source in the same way they rely on electricity, natural gas or oil. Railways are an integral part of the distribution of propane across the country and the interruption of rail service is creating an inability to make deliveries to propane-dependent Canadians during the coldest weeks of the year. \b \b\"The industry is doing everything within its power to minimize disruptions of propane delivery to its customers,\" says Ann Marie Hann, PGAC Managing Director, \"but there is growing concern within the industry about the impact of the strike on the many customers that rely on propane for heating, cooking, transportation, warehousing, building and construction heat, and various fundamental processes.\" \b \bPropane industry members have been vocal about the need for decision makers to do everything in their power to ensure that the labour dispute is resolved quickly, and to recognize that the reliable transportation of propane by rail is an essential service requiring appropriate priority. Through letters and telephone calls, the Propane Gas Association of Canada and its members have been expressing concerns to all parties able to influence a positive outcome for this situation. \"The industry is looking for firm and decisive action by CN, the UTU and Government to bring the current situation to quick conclusion.\" says Hann. \b \bThe Propane Gas Association of Canada is the national voice of the Canadian propane industry. Our mission is to promote the growth and development of a safe, environmentally responsible Canadian propane industry. Our 270+ members include propane producers, wholesalers, retailers and transporters, as well as manufacturers of appliances, cylinders and equipment. \b \bPropane is a widely available, cost-competitive, clean and portable fuel. The propane industry has an $8.4 billion economic impact in Canada, supporting the livelihoods of 20,000 Canadians in various sectors of the economy. Compared to conventional energy supplies, propane produces lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air toxins in virtually every application for which it is used. \b \b     /CONTACT: Media Contact: Tracy Walden, PGAC Manager Communications, (613) 321-2276, Fax: (403) 543-6508, twalden@propanegas.ca; www.propanegas.ca \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:28 ET (11:28 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"94a01a1bf517faeca34d330119818c2f","symR":["1004086.FR","MVC.MC","ES0154220414","FR0010040865"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Metrovacesa Top Holders Agree To Divide Company","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T09:17:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1004086.FR","MVC.MC","ES0154220414","FR0010040865"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","RED","REI","XDJGI","XIBEX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Santiago Perez \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  MADRID (Dow Jones)--Real estate company Metrovacesa SA (MVC.MC) Monday said its top shareholders - Chairman Joaquin Rivero, the Soler and the Sanahuja families - have reached an agreement to divide the company in two, to end the board dispute for control of the company. \u001d  Metrovacesa, the euro-zone's largest real-estate company by assets, will be divided into two separate entities after a high-profile bidding war for company stakes launched by two rival shareholder groups last year. \u001d  \"The bidding process for Metrovacesa shares, conducted during 2006, resulted in discrepancies at the board, stemming from different views over the development model,\" Metrovacesa said in a filing with regulators. \u001d  One of the entities, to be called Metrovacesa, will comprise the company's Spanish real-estate assets as well as its French rental assets, and will be have the Sanahuja family as its main shareholder. The Sanahujas, who control Barcelona-based real-estate company Sacresa, currently own about 39% of Metrovacesa. \u001d  The second entity, to be called Gecina, will include the company's French real-estate assets and some of its Spanish office rental business. The rival group, led by Rivero and the Solers, will be its main shareholder. \u001d  Metrovacesa directors Bautista Soler Crespo and Maria Victoria Soler Lujan are also the leading shareholders of Valencia CF, one of Spain's top soccer clubs. The Rivero-led group currently owns about one-third of Metrovacesa. \u001d  Metrovacesa, which acquired control of France's Gecina (1004086.FR) in 2005 in a deal valued at more than EUR5 billion, has a market capitalization of EUR12.6 billion and 107 million shares outstanding. \u001d  Spain's stock market supervisors Monday suspended trading in Metrovacesa shares ahead of the announcement. The trade halt \"won't be lifted until the company submits sufficient information,\" the regulator said in a statement Monday. Metrovacesa said more information on the proposed separation will be disclosed later Monday. \u001d  The company's shares closed Friday at EUR117.85. \u001d  With a thin free-float of about 14%, Metrovacesa share prices had staged a volatile ride in the past 12 months, doubling their value in just one year. \u001d  The free-float of Metrovacesa was squeezed by competing tender offers for company stakes in attempts to control the company's board as the dispute for control of Metrovacesa escalated last year. With the support of some smaller shareholders, the Rivero-led group maintained control of the company in its clash with the Sanahujas. \u001d  \"We believe that the legal requirements for the operation will be long and complicated,\" said local brokerage Banesto, which has a sell rating on Metrovacesa shares and a price target of EUR65.14. \u001d  \"From a stock price perspective, we believe that once the war between the top two shareholders concludes, Metrovacesa share prices should correct and adjust to the real value of their assets,\" wrote analyst Marta Gomez, who estimates the company's net asset value to be of about EUR51.2 per share. \u001d  Metrovacesa net profit for the first nine months of 2006  almost tripled to EUR861 million, on strong rental income and higher home sales in Spain's red-hot real estate market. \u001d  After Metrovacesa took control of Gecina, the company raised profit targets several times. Metrovacesa's management expects the company's profits to inch closer to EUR1.1 billion for the whole 2006. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.metrovacesa.es \b \u001d  -By Santiago Perez, Dow Jones Newswires; 34-91-395 8119; santiago.perez@dowjones.com \u001d  (Jonathan House and Christopher Bjork contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 04:17 ET (09:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"94cb5cbb2f4eca8672501d61d4a0b31c","symR":["F.MI","FIA","IT0001976403"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Italy Govt Says Fiat Entitled To Unemployment Benefit Plan","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T18:27:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["F.MI","FIA","IT0001976403"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDJGI","XMIB","XNYA"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 13:27 ET (18:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"94e79effa30da615a3173ba54c8571f9","symR":["NU"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Northeast Utilities Backs 2007 EPS View $1.30-$1.55","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T21:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NU"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 16:36 ET (21:36 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"95d6a89971e7047aa85a2cf89c577911","symR":["6758.TO","BRT.YY","EMI.LN","SNE","WMG","GB0000444736","JP3435000009"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EMI Mulling Refinancing, Possible Disposals - Source-2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T09:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6758.TO","BRT.YY","EMI.LN","SNE","WMG","GB0000444736","JP3435000009"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","CSE","ENT","MED","MOV","PUB","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  \"There are various options being considered for restructuring the balance sheet,\" the person said. \"There have been lots of ideas thrown around and I'm sure they are looking at everything.\" \u001d  EMI announced last week that profits were likely to be significantly below analysts' consensus forecasts for the year ending March 2007 as revenues were likely to be 15% lower for this year than the March 2006 year-end. \u001d  In January, EMI dismissed the Chief Executive of its recorded music unit, Alain Levy and Vice Chairman David Munns after its first profits warning. \u001d  Restructuring the balance sheet, to add more debt to the music publishing business unit, which has more stable cashflow, could make EMI's group debt less expensive, analysts say. It could also enable the company to give cash back to shareholders and provide a deterrent against interest from private equity groups, they say. Private equity-backed buyouts typically involve high debt levels and bidders are likely to be deterred by a company with high existing debt. \u001d  One debt analyst, who declined to be identified, said EMI had been discussing a range of options to put additional leverage onto its music publishing unit for several weeks. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 04:49 ET (09:49 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"95dcf94c337f0825d2cfe38712a00530","symR":["4704.TO","TMIC","JP3637300009"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Restatement of Consolidated / -12-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T12:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["4704.TO","TMIC","JP3637300009"],"IndustryCodes":["SOF","X225","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\b         revenue          1,450,930         1,441,820        1,542,109 \b     2.

2 from \b        2006 began operating as pool participant vessels in the Gemini \b        pool, and the other 2 from 2006 were chartered back to OMI and \b        also operate in the Gemini pool, \b \b   --  752 days in 2006 due to vessels that began operating on 6 time \b        charter contracts; 2 of the contracts with profit sharing \b        arrangements began in 2005 and had profit sharing of \b        $4,471,000 in 2006 and \b \b   --  644 fewer days relating to the equivalent of 3.75 Suezmax \b        vessels in the spot market that were hedged by synthetic time \b        charter contracts, and therefore are included with vessels on \b        time charter. \b \u001d  Decreases were partially offset by an increase of 1,157 days from 4 more pool participant member vessels (not owned by OMI) operating in the Gemini pool during the 2006 period and a 6% increase in daily spot charter TCE in 2006 (see Market Overview section for explanations of rate fluctuations). \b \b   The decreases from the clean fleet were primarily from: \b \b   --  1,433 days for vessels that left the spot market and began \b        operating on time charter contracts. \b \u001d  Decreases were offset by revenue from 25 days of revenue from a new vessel in the Libra pool. \b \u001d  Note: For detailed information of fluctuations by vessel type, see Breakdown by Fleet sections. \b \b   Operating Expenses \b \u001d  Vessel expenses increased $2,169,000 for the three months and $4,271,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005. Increases in vessel expenses during the fourth quarter of 2006 were primarily attributable to the vessels acquired in the clean fleet (5 vessels during 2006 and 5 vessels during 2005) offset by decreases in vessel expense for 6 Suezmax vessels sold (4 in 2006 and 2 in 2005) and 3 product carriers sold in 2006. The Suezmax average daily vessel expense was lower in the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease during the 2006 periods were primarily related to storing requirements in each year (spare parts and supplies) in addition to the higher lube oil expenses in 2005. The clean fleet's average daily vessel expense was approximately 7% higher in the three months and 3% higher in the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The clean fleet's increase in 2006 was primarily for additional stores and supplies, repairs on 3 vessels that were drydocked this year and miscellaneous expenses. The clean fleet vessel expenses also includes additional legal fees related to the loss of an arbitration in the fourth quarter of 2006 aggregating approximately $2,700,000 and $3,800,000 for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2006, respectively, see Clean Fleet section. (The additional charge was excluded from the average daily vessel expense for the clean fleet to better compare the fluctuations in the other routine expenses.) \b \u001d  Charter hire expense increased $12,498,000 for the three months and $85,338,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 30, 2005. Increases in charter hire expense of $7,577,000 for the three months and $28,528,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 were primarily the result of chartering in 7 additional vessels, 2 in 2005 (the CAPE BASTIA and the CAPE BONNY) and 5 in 2006 (the OTTAWA, TAMAR, CAPE BANTRY, HS ALCINA and KING EDWARD). Additional increases in charter hire expense of $4,921,000 for the three months and $56,810,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 were attributable primarily to increases in pool charter hire expense in the Gemini Pool resulting from 4 vessels that were added to the pool, 2 in 2005 and 2 in 2006 and an increase of $485,000 for the Libra product carrier pool which started in November 2006 (see Note below for discussion of Gemini and Libra). \b \u001d  Note: Gemini Tankers LLC (\"Gemini\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of OMI, began operating in December 2003. Gemini is a pool for double hull Suezmax vessels. As of December 31, 2006, there were 16 Suezmax vessels (9 from OMI and 7 from other pool members) operating in the Gemini pool. Libra Shipping LLC (\"Libra\") is also a wholly owned subsidiary of OMI that began operating in November 2006. Libra is a pool for double hull product carrier vessels. As of December 31, 2006, there were 2 product carriers (1 from OMI and 1 from another pool member) operating in the Libra pool. The earnings of the pools are allocated to the pool members using an agreed upon formula. The gross revenues of Gemini and Libra are reflected in OMI's consolidated revenues, and the charter hire expense for the other participants' vessels are included in OMI's consolidated charter hire expense. \b \u001d  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2,585,000 for the three months and $6,813,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in depreciation expense was primarily due to the disposal of 6 Suezmax vessels (4 in 2006 and 2 in 2005) and 3 product carriers in 2006. Decreases in depreciation expense were partially offset by additional expense for 10 product carriers acquired (5 in 2006 and 5 in 2005). \b \u001d  General and administrative expense decreased $902,000 for the three months and increased $2,613,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005. The increase for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 primarily resulted from higher compensation and employee benefits expense including increases in non-cash expense from amortization of restricted stock awards from 2005 and 2006 grants. \b \b   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 15:16 ET (20:16 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"977c0716bf70f94376a93f355e10890a","symR":["BPI.MI","BPVN.MI","PMI.MI","UNI.MI","IT0000064300","IT0000064482","IT0001074571","IT0003262513"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Banca Popolare Milano Denies Considering Three-way Merger","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T10:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BPI.MI","BPVN.MI","PMI.MI","UNI.MI","IT0000064300","IT0000064482","IT0001074571","IT0003262513"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","INF","INS","XDJGI","XMIB"],"Story":"\u001d  MILAN (Dow Jones)--Mutual bank Banca Popolare di Milano SCARL (PMI.MI) Monday denied it has even considered to merge with an Italian lender and a local insurance company. \u001d  Popolare Milano's response was triggered by press reports published Saturday and Sunday that said the lender is studying a \"three-way\" merger. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 05:23 ET (10:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"978a0ee55bbeafd6688228c416f1b50c","symR":["SCSC"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"NASDAQ Panel Grants ScanSource Filing Extension>SCSC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T14:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SCSC"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 09:08 ET (14:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"978bfa49db248f554bd5b4787e164358","symR":["PLPC"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Preformed Line Products Announces Improved Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2006","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T12:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PLPC"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MAYFIELD VILLAGE, Ohio, Feb. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Preformed Line Products Company (Nasdaq: PLPC) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2006. \b \u001d  Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 increased to $2,032,000, or $.38 per diluted share, compared to $883,000, or $.15 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2005.

This trend is continuing into 2007 as we anticipated.  I am particularly pleased with our fourth quarter net income more than doubling that of 2005.

Scor gave no other financial details but a Dow Jones Newswires estimate put the value of its Converium stake at around CHF880 million, or EUR542 million. \u001d  The fight comes amid growing mergers and acquisition activity in the insurance sector, as companies  increasingly seek to tap external sources to spur their expansion due to slowing organic growth in markets such as Europe and the U.S. \u001d  Scor said a tie-up with Converium was \"a unique strategic opportunity to create a Top 5 global multiline reinsurer in this time of market consolidation.\" \u001d  A takeover of Converium by Scor would create a company with annual premiums of about EUR5.3 billion, likely catapulting the emerged company into the top ten of the world's largest reinsurers - a group led by Swiss Reinsurance Co (RUKN.VX), Munich Re (MUV2.XE) and Berkshire Hathaway Re, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKB) - depending on the exact measurement used. \u001d  Analysts said that the timing of the bid was sensible as Converium shares are still relatively cheap due to the company's restructuring. \u001d  Scor's share plunged 8% in early trade Monday while Converium shares were up over 12%. Oddo Securities analyst Nicolas Jacob said investors are concerned that Scor would have to make another call on capital markets to finance a merger with Converium and that it shows a troubling strategic shift. \u001d  Scor came close to financial collapse in 2002 after losses from contracts written in the 1990s plunged it deep into the red. It was saved by a series of capital hikes worth over EUR1 billion and a massive restructuring plan. \u001d  Its focus shifted towards life reinurance which has a steadier claims record that more volatile property and casualty reinsurance. \u001d  In July 2006, Scor agreed to acquire German life reinsurer Revios Ruckversicherung AG from Globale Ruckversicherungs AG for EUR605 million. Converium, on the other hand, is more concentrated on non-life reinsurance.      At 0900 GMT, Scor shares were down EUR1.68, or 8% at EUR19.43. Converium was up CHF2.05 or 11.2% at EUR20.80. \u001d  \"The directors are unanimous in their rejection of this proposal\", Converium said in a statement, adding, \"The proposal fundamentally fails to recognize the value of Converium's franchise and growth prospects, and is, therefore, not in the interest of Converium, its shareholders, and its customers\". \u001d  Under Scor's proposal, the French company, which is roughly double the size of Converium, would be prepared to pay CHF21 per Converium share, constituting a 12.3% premium to Converium's closing price of CHF18.7 last Friday. \u001d  \"A takeover of Converium by Scor would make sense as it would give Scor's underwriting ability another boost and strengthen its non-life business\", said Stefan Schuermann, analyst at Cheuvreux, who rates the stock at outperform. \u001d  Converium is still smarting from heavy restructuring in the wake of a massive reserve shortfall in the U.S. in 2004, which required the company to issue new shares, reduce its staff and exit the U.S. reinsurance market. \u001d  Although the company has turned profitable since then, and today boasts a strong capital base, Converium is still rated triple-B by most rating agencies, a level that is deemed too low for a reinsurer to do bulk business. \u001d  However, Converium expects an upgrade to the crucial A-level later this year once an industrywide probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to be finalized. \u001d  \"A hostile bid will be very difficult to push through and will depend on Converium's key shareholders\", Cheuvreux's Schuermann said. \u001d  Converium has a broad shareholder base: Most, around 51%, are located in Switzerland, followed by 24% in the U.K. and 21% in the U.S. \u001d  Among the larger shareholders are Zuercher Kantonalbank with a roughly 7% stake. Analysts say that Swiss shareholders, mostly pension funds, may be reluctant to divest the stock at the proposed price. \u001d  Swiss investment company Patinex AG said Monday it sold its near-20% stake in Converium to Scor. \u001d  \"We have sold our stake that consists in part of shares and options,\" Patinex spokesman Ralph Stadler told Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  Patinex, which is led by Swiss investment maverick Martin Ebner, was Converium's largest single shareholder, followed by Swiss regional bank Zuercher Kantonalbank with a near 7% stake and San Francisco-based investment company Dodge & Cox with a 5% stake. \u001d  \"We have sold out stake since it is a logical step in the consolidation of Converium\", Stadler said. \"Such a deal will also strengthen the Swiss financial sector too\", he said. \u001d  Company Web Site:http://www.converium.com \b \u001d  -By Goran Mijuk and Digby Larner, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 80 47; goran.mijuk@dowjones.com \b \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 04:41 ET (09:41 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9a749ded4ccf3b2858b46eb40d529ee7","symR":["IVW.T","CA46582W1086"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Ivernia Inc.

It said it had increased its damages request. \u001d  Vodafone Italia alleged in the new documents filed to the Milan court that Telecom Italia has been acting illegally by supplying details of its fixed-line subscribers to mobile arm TIM to enable the mobile operator to target those customers with better deals. \u001d  Vodafone said its competitor has been targeting Vodafone customers specifically, offering them special discounts in an effort to poach them. \u001d  According to a court document filed by Vodafone, Telecom's \"anticompetitive behavior is backed up by specially prepared lists of target customers.\" \u001d  Vodafone accuses Telecom Italia of selecting these  customers \"on the basis of specially devised information matrices using confidential, commercial and traffic data only available to Telecom operating in combination with TIM.\" \u001d  In its statement, Vodafone asked Italy's telecom regulator AGCOM and the antitrust authority to act immediately to end Telecom Italia's \"dominant position abuse\" on the Italian market. \u001d  \"Vodafone Italia remains firmly convinced that the two independent authorities represent the best means of resolving the competitive issues raised as a result of Telecom Italia's behavior,\" the company said. \u001d  Telecom Italia declined to comment on the issue. \u001d  This isn't the first time the two telecom giants have come to blows. \u001d  An Italian court recently blocked a proposed new service by Vodafone Italia, which had wanted to allow its customers to have certain fixed-line calls diverted to their mobiles. \u001d  The decision stemmed from a complaint filed by Telecom Italia, which accused Vodafone of \"unfair competition.\" \u001d  Telecom Italia, Italy's dominant telecom operator, is pursuing a strategy of convergence - adding media content to its existing range of mobile, fixed-line, broadband and IPTV services. \u001d  Analysts say Telecom Italia's nationwide fixed-line infrastructure gives it a massive advantage over Vodafone, which has recently begun expanding into the broadband and fixed-line sectors. \b \u001d  -By Giada Zampano, Dow Jones Newswires; +39-02-5821 9907; giada.zampano@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 14:50 ET (19:50 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9bb346665653bf78561da9dac8acb064","symR":["GMI.T","CA37958J1021"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": GlobeStar's Copper Exploration And Development Update: Cerro De Maimon Pre-Production Drill Program Intersects 21.8 Metres Of 5.4% Copper>GMI.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T13:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GMI.T","CA37958J1021"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS"],"Story":"\b   TORONTO, ONTARIO--(CCNMatthews - Feb. 19, 2007) - GlobeStar Mining Corp.

The helicopter borne system has proven to be suitable for identifying massive sulphides. Test lines over the Company's Cerro de Maimon massive sulphide has shown a clear signature (see http://www.globestarmining.com/media/images/nwcerromaimonem.jpg), and the Company is optimistic that the system may recognize other targets similar to Cerro de Maimon in GlobeStar's land position. The airborne survey is part of the Company's US$2 million copper/gold exploration program, which consists of this survey and a 7,500 metre drilling program to follow up any anomalies generated. \b \bA second part of the program is designed to upgrade the Company's existing resources to be incorporate into the mine plan. The first target for drilling and development is the Company's 100% owned Loma Pesada deposit, some 14 kilometres Northwest from the Cerro de Maimon mill site, which contains 1.088 M tonnes of inferred resources grading 2.22% copper and 0.77% zinc. For more information, see the Company's NI 43-101 compliant technical report entitled \"Technical Report on the Dona Amanda, Cerro Kiosko, Dona Lorreta, Loma Pesada, Loma Barbuito, Cerro Verde and Anomaly B Properties\" available under the Company's profile on www.sedar.com. \b \bThis press release was prepared by William Fisher P.Geo, CEO of GlobeStar Mining Corp. who is the Company's Qualified Person for purposes of National Instrument 43-101. A Quality Control sampling program of blanks and duplicates is being instituted to monitor the integrity of all assay results. All core samples are split at the Cerro de Maimon minesite and shipped by to SGS Lakefield in Canada where SGS Lakefield completes the sample preparation and assays. Chemical analyses were carried out by SGS Lakefield. Gold was analyzed by fire assay, copper by XRF for samples greater than 0.1% Cu and by AA for samples below 0.1% Cu, whereas silver and zinc were analyzed through ICP. Intercepts were calculated allowing 5 m of internal dilution and using a 1% Cu cut off grade. \b \bAbout GlobeStar \b \bGlobeStar Mining Corp. is a TSX listed minerals exploration company, developing its first mine which is the 100% owned Cerro de Maimon copper and gold project in the Dominican Republic.

It is already talking to General Motors Corp. about joining forces to develop a large sports-utility vehicle. \u001d  At least some top executives at DaimlerChrysler's Stuttgart, Germany, headquarters are determined to try to sell Chrysler or spin it off to existing shareholders rather than restructure it again, one of those close to the matter said. \u001d  Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche, who headed Chrysler in his previous job, hasn't yet indicated his preference, a third person close to DaimlerChrysler's top management said. \u001d  A DaimlerChrysler spokesman reiterated that the company is looking at \"all options\" and declined to comment further. \u001d  Any sale or spinoff is likely to be a complicated transaction that would unfold over several months. It is also unclear how much Chrysler is worth and how much DaimlerChrysler would hope to get for the division. Financial analysts have speculated that Chrysler has a value of about $5 billion. It had a value of about $35 billion in the 1998 merger that formed DaimlerChrysler. \u001d  Last week DaimlerChrysler reported a 40% drop in fourth-quarter earnings because of a $1.5 billion operating loss at Chrysler, and unveiled a plan to slash 13,000 jobs and close at least one plant to stabilize the division. It also declared its interest in exploring the sale of Chrysler. \u001d  The announcement was intended in part to gauge interest among other car makers and private-equity investment firms to purchase Chrysler, one of those familiar with the matter said. \u001d  In the past few days, large car companies from Asia, Europe and the U.S. have approached DaimlerChrysler, which also makes Jeep and Dodge brand cars and light trucks, about a possible purchase or alliance with Chrysler. Private-equity firms, which have been buying ever larger industrial companies in recent years, are also interested in the group. \u001d  DaimlerChrysler hasn't begun an auction and is keeping open the option of shedding Chrysler through a spinoff to its existing shareholders, this person said. DaimlerChrysler is unlikely to sell just a part of the company to an outside investor, though no firm decisions have been made, the person added. \u001d  Bidding for Chrysler by interested buyers could still be months away since strategic and financial information needs to be prepared and studied before any potential buyer can put an approximate value on the business. \u001d  Hyundai Motor Corp. has held talks about building an engine plant in China with DaimlerChrysler and shares an engine plant in Michigan with DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. But the South Korean auto maker isn't considering buying Chrysler, a Hyundai spokesman said. \u001d  \"Our hands are full,\" he said. Hyundai is in the midst of aggressive overseas expansion, with plant investments in the Czech Republic, the U.S. and elsewhere. \u001d  DaimlerChrysler was formed in 1998 from the merger of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, which makes Mercedes Benz luxury cars and heavy commercial vehicles, and Chrysler Corp., a maker of passenger cars and pickup trucks geared toward lower and middle-class buyers. \u001d  At the time, Chrysler was profitable, but since 2000 it has struggled and dragged down the performance of the parent company. \u001d  --- \u001d  Stephen Power and Gina Chon contributed to this article. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 00:30 ET (05:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9ca333bbd57f75a08236da222bf430ba","symR":["FBRWY","FGL.AU","AU000000FGL6"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Foster's: Plans A$400M Share Buyback","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T21:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FBRWY","FGL.AU","AU000000FGL6"],"IndustryCodes":["BVG","DST","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 16:46 ET (21:46 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"9d07245e311573d76ae0d45a781e4ecb","symR":["NATI"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": NI CEO and President Elected to National Academy of Engineering","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T15:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NATI"],"IndustryCodes":["ITC","XDJGI","XISL","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b  Prestigious Award Among Highest Professional Distinctions Accorded \u001d                            to Engineers \bAUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 19, 2007-- \u001d  Dr. James Truchard, CEO, president and cofounder of National Instruments (Nasdaq:NATI) was elected to membership in the National Academy of Engineering, widely considered the highest honor given in the engineering profession. Truchard was recognized for \"creating 'virtual instrumentation,' which enabled the rapid development of customized measurement systems in industry, academia and classrooms.\" He is one of only 156 Texans to be elected in the history of the Academy. There are 2,217 total members. \b \u001d  \"I am excited to congratulate my friend and colleague Jim Truchard for achieving this great honor,\" said Dr. Ben Streetman, dean of the College of Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, Truchard's alma mater. \"His pioneering of virtual instrumentation has revolutionized the test and measurement industry. Furthermore, his contributions to engineering education worldwide have been substantial. In recent years, the work NI has done in K-12 classrooms with LEGO(R) robots has given young people a taste of engineering design and graphical programming.\" \b \u001d  Since its founding in 1976, National Instruments has pioneered virtual instrumentation, a unique approach to embedded design, industrial control and test and measurement that combines commercial off-the-shelf technologies with innovative software and hardware. In 1986, National Instruments introduced the revolutionary software product LabVIEW, which challenged traditional approaches to programming with graphical development similar to flowcharting. LabVIEW helps engineers and scientists in diverse industries to quickly produce a wide range of applications. \b \u001d  Over the past 20 years, LabVIEW has evolved from a desktop instrument control and data acquisition tool into an integrated design, control and test platform for desktop, industrial, embedded and handheld applications. Because the software employs an intuitive graphical programming environment, it is used by professional engineers and students alike, at both K-12 and university levels. In 2006, NI and LEGO collaborated to create the LabVIEW Toolkit for LEGO MINDSTORMS(R) NXT, in which children as well as expert programmers can use a unique drag-and-drop programming environment to program their LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT robots. \b \u001d  This honor reinforces Truchard's role as an industry leader. He was recently named a Distinguished Graduate of The University of Texas College of Engineering and in 2003 was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences. In 2002, a leading electronics publication, Electronic Design, inducted Truchard into its Engineering Hall of Fame and in 2001, a global market consulting firm, Frost & Sullivan, honored him as the CEO of the Year for the test and measurement industry. In addition, Worth magazine named him one of the best CEOs for three consecutive years, emphasizing his focus on long-term growth and innovation. \b \u001d  Founded in 1964, the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) is the portal for all engineering activities at the National Academies, which along with the NAE include the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council. Academy membership honors those who have made outstanding contributions to \"engineering research, practice or education, including, where appropriate, significant contributions to the engineering literature,\" and to the \"pioneering of new and developing fields of technology, making major advancements in traditional fields of engineering, or developing/implementing innovative approaches to engineering education.\" \b \b   About National Instruments \b \u001d  National Instruments (www.ni.com) is transforming the way engineers and scientists design, prototype and deploy systems for measurement, automation and embedded applications.

On Monday (Feb. 19) Verizon announced plans to deploy the advanced fiber-optic technology all the way to customers' homes and businesses in those four counties. \b \u001d  The company said it will extend its fiber-to-the premises (FTTP) network this year to the communities of Forest Grove, McMinnville and Wilsonville. It also will continue its network expansion in the Beaverton, Sherwood and Tualatin areas of Washington County, and the east Multnomah communities of Gresham, Troutdale, Fairview and Wood Village. \b \u001d  A total of 59,000 additional homes will be connected to the FTTP network, which offers the fastest data speeds available to homeowners and small businesses and is capable of offering TV services in the future.  Below are the number of households in each community that will be added to the network: \b \b \b    Community               Households \b    Forest Grove               9,600 \b    Gresham Area              15,700 \b    McMinnville                5,000 \b    Wilsonville                4,300 \b    Beaverton                 14,700 \b    Sherwood                   2,500 \b    Tualatin                   6,000 \b    Unincorporated             1,200 \b \b \b \u001d  The network uses hair-thin strands of fiber and optical electronics to directly link homes and businesses to Verizon's network and replaces the traditional copper-wire connections for voice, high-speed Internet and TV. \b \u001d  \"The FTTP project already has had a positive impact on the local economy, creating new jobs,\" said David S. Valdez, the company's vice president for the Northwest.  \"We've employed hundreds of contractors to build the network; and we've hired more than 300 new Verizon employees over the past two years to design the network, install our FiOS broadband and voice services, and provide technical support to our customers. \b \u001d  \"More importantly, however, Verizon is offering consumers a choice by providing the best network available at a competitive price for voice, data and, eventually, TV,\" he added.  Recently, the Metropolitan Area Communications Commission board of directors recommended adoption of a video franchise agreement for Verizon to provide its FiOS TV service to Washington County communities. \b \u001d  Verizon expects to install more than 5 million feet of fiber-optic cabling throughout the Portland metro area by year-end 2007, bringing to 211,000 the total number of homes and small businesses in the area that will be linked to the new network. \b \u001d  More than 6 million homes and businesses in parts of 16 states are now passed by Verizon's all-fiber network, and the company expects its new network to pass about 18 million premises by the end of 2010.  Verizon had 687,000 FiOS (FYE'-ose) Internet customers and 207,000 FiOS TV customers by year-end 2006. \b \u001d  FiOS Internet service is offered in more than 1,600 communities in the 16 states where the company's new network is deployed: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia and Washington.  The company currently offers FiOS TV service in parts of ten states: California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. \b \u001d  Fiber offers tremendous advantages to network operators, in addition to new and superior services for customers.  For example, fiber offers reliable service in stretches of wet weather that can affect copper-based networks. \b \u001d  \"Verizon's 100 percent fiber-optic network is technically superior to other communication platforms because it offers faster data speeds than those currently available, as well as voice and video capabilities,\" said Vickie Curry, Verizon's director of customer operations in the Northwest. \"This new network will have greater reliability and lower maintenance costs. By deploying fiber to homes and businesses in our territory, Verizon is transforming its wireline business into 21st century technology.\" \b \b    Customer Feedback About Verizon Fiber Service Is Positive \b \u001d  Customer reaction to Verizon's FiOS service has been very positive, with broadband subscribers rapidly increasing in markets across the country. Verizon will notify customers in Washington when FiOS is available locally. \b \u001d  \"FiOS has been an extraordinary hit with our customers,\" said Curry. \"People are literally lining up to get what they know is a fantastic service at an excellent price. The need for speed and ability to take advantage of bandwidth-intensive applications remain a top priority for all computer users.\" \b \u001d  There are three tiers of Verizon FiOS Internet service for consumers, with downstream (download) speeds of up to 5, 15, and 30 Mbps (megabits per second).* \b \b \b    -- 5 Mbps (megabits per second) downstream and 2 Mbps upstream.

With FTTP technology, Verizon can easily add more capacity, higher speeds or video services in the future. \b \u001d  Verizon's digital subscriber line (DSL) service will remain the company's most widely available form of high-speed Internet access for the foreseeable future while the company ramps up FTTP deployment.  The company offers DSL on a widespread basis throughout Washington over existing copper lines at speeds of up to 3 Mbps. \b \b    * NOTE: Actual (throughput) speeds will vary. \b \u001d  Verizon Communications Inc.

His resignation is effective February 28, 2007. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20051028/CGF002LOGO ) \b \u001d  Josep Fornos, vice president and general manager, ride control, Europe, will replace Mr. Mehlmann. Karel Van Bael executive director, operations, ride control, Europe, will serve as interim general manager of the European ride control business unit while Tenneco conducts a search -- which will include internal and external candidates -- for Mr. Fornos' replacement. \b \u001d  Fornos, who joined Tenneco in 2000, has contributed significantly to the success of Tenneco's European operations by managing a turnaround in the ride control business unit despite an extremely challenging business sector. During his tenure, Fornos was charged with expanding and improving Tenneco's manufacturing footprint in Eastern Europe, which strengthened the company's competitiveness in the ride control segment. His focus on advanced technology has helped elevate Tenneco's position with customers as an advanced technology and engineering partner. \b \u001d  Mehlmann has accepted the position of president and CEO for Neumayer Tekfor Group, a global supplier based in Germany that specializes in innovative solutions for automotive powertrain efficiency improvements. \b \u001d  Mehlmann, who joined Tenneco in 2003, helped grow the company's OE emission control book of business largely from expanded hot-end business, including diesel technology after-treatment growth. He also oversaw initiatives that significantly improved Tenneco's quality, delivery and manufacturing efficiency in Europe. \b \u001d  \"Ulrich's commitment to Tenneco's growth and strategic alignment has enhanced our position as a leading emission control supplier globally,\" said Hari Nair, executive vice president and managing director, Europe, South America and India.  \"I know that Josep shares Ulrich's passion for the business, and he will continue to lead our success in the European segment.\" \b \u001d  Fornos will continue to report to Nair, as will Van Bael on an interim basis. \b \u001d  Tenneco is a $4.7 billion manufacturing company with headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois and approximately 19,000 employees worldwide.

(Nasdaq:VSAT) today announced a new cooperation agreement to jointly offer affordable, high-quality consumer broadband satellite service in underserved markets in Europe. The new partnership will bring together Eutelsat, Europe's leading satellite operator and its Skylogic broadband affiliate, with ViaSat, a producer of innovative satellite networking systems. Starting from June 2007, the service will use Ka-band capacity on Eutelsat's HOT BIRD(TM) 6 satellite, with hub operations supplied by Skylogic from its SkyPark teleport in Turin, Italy. \b \u001d  The new service will be based on the ViaSat SurfBeam(R) DOCSIS(R) two-way broadband satellite system, a highly-scaleable open standards-based platform that lowers the cost of consumer terminals and service. The system is already used in North America by WildBlue Communications, the fastest growing satellite broadband service which has amassed well over 100,000 customers nationwide since its 2005 launch. \b \u001d  \"ViaSat and Eutelsat have a tradition of successful cooperation, and we are excited about this initiative to bring high-quality broadband access to European consumers beyond the reach of DSL,\" said Marc Agnew, vice president of Broadband Systems at ViaSat. \"Our SurfBeam system has proven that reliable, satisfying, and cost-competitive satellite broadband services can be offered in markets around the world. By combining ViaSat DOCSIS-for-satellite technology with Eutelsat Ka-band satellite capacity and Skylogic operational experience, we're testing a competitive, affordable service to expand the reach of the European consumer broadband market.\" \b \u001d  \"With our experience over the last years in supplying turnkey broadband solutions for Europe and around the globe, Eutelsat and Skylogic are well-positioned to address the consumer market for satellite broadband services in Europe's geographically challenged locations,\" said Arduino Patacchini, director Multimedia Department at Eutelsat and CEO of Skylogic. \"ViaSat technology underpins successful satellite broadband services in North America and Latin America, making them the perfect fit for us and for future customers of our service. We look forward to a successful collaboration as we introduce this new service in Europe.\" \b \u001d  Under terms of the joint commercial cooperation agreement, commercial services in selected western European markets including Germany, Switzerland, Spain, and Portugal will start to roll out from June 2007. Eutelsat will provide additional capacity for any expansion of services on its Ka-band and/or Ku-band satellites, which provide comprehensive coverage of Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. \b \u001d  PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that by 2010, 58.1 percent (94.8 million) of households in Western Europe will be broadband households, up from 29.9 percent in 2005. Broadband access spending will increase by 12.9 percent compounded annually to $48.2 billion in 2010. \b \u001d  The ViaSat SurfBeam system is an open standards-based network that builds on the cable modem networking technology called DOCSIS. ViaSat-developed a satellite air interface that is seamlessly integrated into DOCSIS head-end termination systems and leverages low cost DOCSIS customer premises chips and software used by tens of millions of cable customers. ViaSat's SurfBeam system can enable two-way satellite broadband service pricing that is comparable to terrestrial, but in areas with population densities too low to be economical for wired or wireless networks. The satellite air interface also includes technology that mitigates rain fade, a reduction in signal strength caused by heavy rain that at one time was thought to be a potential barrier to successful deployment of Ka-band satellite systems. The ViaSat system automatically responds to rain fade with uplink power control and adaptive data coding techniques that help overcome potential outages, while optimizing the use of satellite transponder bandwidth. \b \u001d  Skylogic, Eutelsat's broadband affiliate, recently teamed with ViaSat and ARINC to provide in-flight communications to business jets flying in Europe. \b \b   About Eutelsat Communications (www.eutelsat.com) \b \u001d  Eutelsat Communications (Euronext Paris: ETL, ISIN code: FR0010221234) is the holding company of Eutelsat S.A..

Additionally, holes such as 075 and 079 demonstrate the presence of near surface mineralization. As our geological model for the property grows, so has the potential for further increases in the Gibraltar mineral resources and reserves, providing scope for the engineering group to assess additional expansions to the mine and concentrator facilities. These opportunities would take the mine beyond the 100 million pounds of copper production scheduled to begin in 2008.\" \b \bTaseko will accelerate the drilling program over the next few months. \b \bFor further details on Taseko and its properties, please visit the Company's website at www.tasekomines.com or contact Investor Services at (604) 684-6365 or within North America at 1-800-667-2114. \b \bRussell Hallbauer, President and CEO \b \bIan Thompson, P.Eng., a Qualified Person as defined under National Instrument 43-101, is supervising the drilling program and quality assurance and quality control (\"QAQC\") programs on behalf of Taseko Mines Limited. Samples from the Gibraltar exploration project are stored at a secure facility at the Gibraltar Mine prior to being shipped to Vancouver laboratories for preparation and analysis. ALS Chemex prepared and analyzed the samples except 092 which was prepared and analysed by Eco Tech Laboratory in Kamloops, BC. Sample preparation consisted of weighing, drying and crushing the entire sample to greater than 70% passing -2mm and then pulverizing a 250 g split to greater than 85% passing 75 micron. Total copper and molybdenum determinations are by HNO3/KClO3 + AlCl3/HCl digestion followed by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) finish. Laboratory Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QAQC) is monitored using assay standards and blanks submitted by Taseko, and duplicate samples submitted to Acme Analytical Laboratories in Vancouver. \b \bForward-looking Statements \b \bThis release includes certain statements that may be deemed \"forward-looking statements\".

(8603.to), for which the accounting firm now faces possible disciplinary action by the Financial Services Agency. \u001d  Misuzu, which now audits some 600 listed corporations, has entered into negotiations with Ernst & Young ShinNihon, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Japan and KPMG Azsa & Co. \u001d  Its operations as an auditing firm have been in disarray because accountants have quit and rivals have made moves to hire away its personnel.  Concerns have been growing that the auditing of many corporations will be affected unless management is stabilized. \u001d  To minimize such confusion, Misuzu has asked competitors to refrain from headhunting personnel until summer, when the auditing of corporations that close their books in March will be completed.  And it has started requesting that the auditing firms take on its corporate auditing operations as well as accountants and other personnel in the summer and afterward. \u001d  Misuzu plans to soon hold a meeting of its 300 or so partners - equivalent to a general shareholders meeting at ordinary firms - where it is expected to reach a decision to transfer its auditing operations to others.  But because the client firm chooses the auditor, it remains unclear at what scale the work will be transferred. \u001d  Misuzu's predecessor, ChuoAoyama PricewaterhouseCoopers, was slapped with a two-month business suspension order last summer because its accountants certified Kanebo Ltd.'s falsified financial statements.  This caused more than 20% of its 800 or so clients to switch to other auditing firms, and some of its accountants left to establish PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 12:12 ET (17:12 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"a95f1e6f82ff77c7349d3e82377e44f5","symR":["NSU.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006757008","DE0007664005"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Volkswagen Names Manzoni Head Of Kreativ Design >VLKAY","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T13:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NSU.XE","VLKAY","VOW.XE","DE0006757008","DE0007664005"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","XDAX","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) said Monday Flavio Manzoni will take up the newly-created post as the head of Kreativ Design as of March 1. \u001d  Manzoni will report to Walter Maria de'Silva who heads the design department of Volkswagen overall, the company said in a statement. \u001d  Manzoni will be responsible for the creation and implementation of brand-wide design criteria, according to the statement. \u001d  The company added that Klaus Bischoff will continue to head the design department of the Volkswagen brand. \u001d  Manzoni, who studied architecture with a focus on industrial design, worked for Lancia as chief designer until 1999 and at Volkwagen's Seat unit in the same position until 2002.

UT-Houston's Situational Awareness and Preparedness for Public Health Incidences Using Reasoning Engines (or SAPPHIRE) system integrates a wide range of health and epidemiological data from local healthcare providers, hospitals and pharmacies. By applying social network analysis to the disparate data from multiple sources, healthcare providers can create a single, integrated metadata model to analyze, detect, and respond to public health matters. \b \b    (Logo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20020718/ORCLLOGO ) \b \u001d  UT-Houston's SAPPHIRE system facilitates bio-surveillance and symptom trending by enabling SAPPHIRE team members to take advantage of Semantic Web capabilities to integrate and manage myriad data from a variety of sources. UT-Houston built its SAPPHIRE architecture using Oracle's Resource Description Framework (RDF) Data Model, a feature of Oracle Spatial 10g, an option to Oracle Database 10g, integrated with TopQuadrant's TopBraid Composer. \b \u001d  World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards, such as RDF and Web Ontology Language (OWL), serve as the foundation for semantic technologies, which are designed to extend the capabilities of information on the Web and enable data to be integrated in a meaningful way. Oracle's RDF Data Model offers the industry's first open, scalable, secure and reliable RDF management platform. \b \u001d  \"Oracle and TopQuadrant allow UT-Houston to shift the center of gravity for public healthcare delivery by moving beyond symptom detection to large-scale public health surveillance, via trend monitoring, detection and response,\" said Parsa Mirhaji, M.D., director of the Center for Biosecurity and Public Health Informatics Research at the University of Texas School of Health Information Sciences at Houston. \"As a result, the public health preparedness framework enables a semantic transformation from disparate data to actionable information that decision makers can easily access and compute.\" \b \b    The Semantic Web at Work -- Hurricane Katrina Aftermath in Houston, Texas \b \u001d  In a pilot project, UT-Houston used the Oracle and TopQuadrant-based approach as the basis of its SAPPHIRE system, which successfully monitored and analyzed public health information during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005 to allow public health officials to make improved decisions. Tested during the Hurricane Katrina relief efforts in 2005, SAPPHIRE's surveillance techniques analyzed the health of evacuees at the Astrodome, Reliant Park and the George R. Brown Convention Center. A PDA extension of SAPPHIRE enabled more than 300 volunteers, led by the UT School of Public Health, to collect and analyze critical health data. \b \u001d  The information gleaned from the nearly 9,000 confidential patient encounters helped caregivers respond to the specific needs of the Hurricane Katrina evacuees. \"The principles that UT employed during the Katrina disaster could serve as a model for the nationwide efforts involving public health information,\" said Oracle Vice President of Health Industries Mychelle Mowry. \"The integration between Oracle and TopBraid enables simpler navigation of disparate health data, better public health information exchange and improved bio-surveillance efforts -- ultimately helping to deliver better public healthcare.\" \b \u001d  \"Professional grade tools like TopBraid Composer and Oracle Spatial 10g represent a significant milestone marking the emergence of Semantic Web standards from the research lab to meeting the demands of enterprise system development,\" said TopQuadrant Executive Partner Irene Polikoff. \"The SAPPHIRE system is an important example of the many large scale systems we are beginning to see that are applying semantic web technology to complex, real-world problems.\" \b \b    About the UT Health Science Center at Houston \b \u001d  The most comprehensive academic health center in the Southwest, the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston is home to six schools devoted to medicine, nursing, public health, dentistry, health informatics and graduate studies in biomedical science.

(BDTI), the semiconductor industry's leading independent benchmarking and technology analysis company, today announced the industry's first certified H.264 decoder performance benchmark results - based upon the ARC(R) Video Subsystem. These results validate the low system clock rate and low energy consumption of the ARC Video Subsystem when decoding standard definition H.264 video. This low power is a benefit of ARC's configurable architecture that enables the creation of highly efficient subsystems and processors. \b \u001d  The ARC Video Subsystem requires as little as 160 MHz, with low power consumption and small die size, to decode a 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps) BDTI video stream at 30 frames per second (fps) for the H.264 Baseline Profile decoder at D1 resolution. No special modifications were made to the standard ARC Video Subsystem to achieve these results. BDTI uses a proprietary video test clip, which consists of several types of scenes commonly used to evaluate video codec performance. Further details of the benchmark results can be obtained by contacting BDTI (www.BDTI.com). \b \u001d  In an article in its InsideDSP.com newsletter, BDTI stated, \"ARC helped BDTI create a methodology which is both fair and responsive to the needs of video system and SoC developers, including a rigorous and independent certification process.\" According to BDTI's analysts, \"BDTI's findings confirm ARC's claim that the ARC Video Subsystem can perform H.264 decoding at 160 MHz, with a die area of 9.1 mm(2) and an average power consumption of 116 mW (3.9 joules of energy per frame) in a 0.13 micron process. By being the first to obtain BDTI Solution Certification for its H.264 decoder solution, ARC has taken a leadership role in bringing better information to the video solution marketplace, and has demonstrated its confidence in the ARC Video Subsystem.\" \b \u001d  Derek Meyer, ARC's senior vice president of sales and marketing, said, \"ARC partnered with BDTI because they are the industry's most respected independent authority for signal processing benchmarks. By following their rigorous and independent certification process, we now are able to provide customers with BDTI verified data that clearly shows the efficiency of the ARC Video Subsystem for H.264 decoding. This not only supports our leadership position, but will help our customers make more informed decisions for SoCs targeting video-intensive applications.\" \b \b   About the Configurable ARC(R) Video Subsystem \b \u001d  ARC Video is a configurable subsystem that offers a powerful, highly efficient solution for low power multimedia applications. It incorporates must-have video and imaging codecs in a pre-verified, programmable environment. The ARC Video Subsystem processes H.264, VC-1, MPEG-4, MPEG-2 decoders and industry standard imaging codecs at less than 40mW (90nm TSMC G) for standard definition resolutions. \b \u001d  The ARC Video Subsystem includes a configurable ARC 700 family core that is coupled with the company's award winning single instruction multiple data (SIMD) accelerator, which was specifically designed for video and audio processing. A media-centric DMA engine incorporated in the ARC Video Subsystem is highly tuned to efficiently handle multimedia packet transfers. A full set of hardware and software development tools is included with each ARC Video Subsystem license. \b \u001d  All ARC Media Subsystems are configurable, enabling system-on-chip (SoC) designers to add or remove instructions to better differentiate from their competition. By leveraging the programmable nature of ARC's subsystems, additional algorithms can be included beyond the optimized and pre-verified codecs supplied as part of the subsystem. Because the ARC Video Subsystem is based upon a configurable ARC 700 family core, it can run at up to 533 MHz in a 0.13 micron process. \b \b   About ARC International plc \b \u001d  ARC International is the world leader in configurable subsystems and CPU/DSP processors that are used by semiconductor companies worldwide to create system-on-chip (SoC) designs that provide a strategic competitive advantage. ARC's patented configurable products are smaller, consume less power, are less expensive to manufacture, and provide a higher degree of differentiation over what can be created using \"fixed architecture\" core alternatives. \b \u001d  ARC International maintains a worldwide presence with corporate and research and development offices in California and Elstree, UK.

DPS eMortgage Studio uses Oracle 10g software, including Oracle Database 10g, Oracle Data Guard and Oracle Enterprise Manager 10g, to offer customers a highly reliable IT infrastructure that can handle high volumes of transactions as well as secure highly sensitive data shared during the course of a typical closing.

Sainsbury. \u001d  Not that it wouldn't offer some interesting opportunities. \u001d  CEO Stuart Rose may be eyeing the potential to sell clothes through Sainsbury's branches. Such cross-selling of higher margin products could give it a big advantage over Asda and its George range of clothes. \u001d  And there could be significant economies of scale in putting the two retailers together. \u001d  But the timing of such a move looks problematic. \u001d  Rising interest rates are rapidly cooling the U.K. retail sector. After all, the worst-hit sectors in January, when the U.K. experienced the biggest monthly drop in retail sales in four years, were sellers of household goods and clothing shops. \u001d  At first glance, M&S, with a market capital of GBP11.8 billion, could digest an acquisition like Sainsbury, with a market capital of GBP8.84 billion and debt of GBP2.5 billion. M&S' market gearing is 16% and 7.7X interest cover seems safe. \u001d  But M&S' quick ratio - which measures whether a business can meet its obligations in hard times - seems less so, with only 0.2 times more current assets to cover current liabilities. And book gearing is 165%. \u001d  Trading conditions have been particularly rosy for M&S in 2006. It market share rose 0.9 percentage point to 11.9% in the second half. And annual revenue growth was 0.6% at the end of 2006, after falling 6% in 2005. \u001d  Revenue growth, though, looks set to slow in 2007, down to 6.9% according to the analyst consensus. \u001d  M&S shareholders might prefer, therefore, to see cash flow saved for a rainy day, or returned to them. \u001d  Besides, M&S faces plenty more capital spending as it continues to upgrade stores and product lines, measures that have underpinned Rose's success to date as CEO. \u001d  Then there is Rose's commitment to M&S' new environmentally-friendly image - a GBP200-million plan to reduce its carbon footprint. \u001d  Of course, it may be that M&S' path to Sainsbury is eased if private equity firms - among them Blackstone, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and CVC Capital - withdraw from the contest. \u001d  The media storm about private equity getting rich at the expense of employees, and British trade unions' determination to force the Labour government to clamp down, might see these groups conclude that discretion is the greater part of valor to avoid damaging their long-term interests. \u001d  If they don't, and private equity values Sainsbury as a typical LBO, then M&S risks overpaying in a bidding war. For now, the market doesn't seem to be taking an M&S bid too seriously judging by its share price, which has hardly reacted. \u001d  But if Rose feels M&S needs a transforming acquisition to safeguard its long-term future, he would be advised to get the support of an equity partner, like the Qatar investment fund that's reportedly seeking a \"strategic\" stake in Sainsbury, to share the risk M&S would be taking on. \b \u001d  (Martin Fluck joined Dow Jones Newswires in 2006.

(\"FCP\" or the \"Company\") are pleased to announce the receipt of approval from the Algerian regulatory authority ALNAFT for the Development Plan for the MLE oil and gas field on Block 405b, located in Algeria's Berkine Basin. Included as part of the Block 405b development planning are a gas plant and field gathering system and facilities designed to process 230 million cubic feet of raw gas per day on a gross basis and associated natural gas liquids and oil. The plant capacity can be expanded to treat up to 460 million cubic feet of raw gas per day. \b \bBlock 405b will be developed in a staged process designed to maximize the economic value of the block's reserves, commencing with the MLE field situated on the eastern portion of the block. Block 405b also contains a number of oil and gas discoveries situated west of the MLE field which will be layered in upon completion of the block appraisal programme and approval of commerciality. \b \bFCP and Sonatrach have recently signed a long term take or pay Gas Marketing Agreement whereby Sonatrach will market the total natural gas production from Block 405b. The marketing agreement is structured similarly to standard natural gas long term supply agreements. No commercial arrangements have been entered into in respect of the sale of liquids production; FCP's share of production will be sold at world market prices. \b \bThe MLE field will be developed for simultaneous dry gas and liquids production with first production currently targeted for late 2009. Sonatrach and FCP will form a joint operating group to design, build and operate the production, processing and block tie-in facilities and pipelines. The initial gross field reserves to be developed and recovered are 1.3 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent (approximately 230 million barrels of oil equivalent), with dry gas and liquids (oil, condensates and liquefied petroleum gas) each contributing approximately one half of total MLE production revenues. The daily volumes for the MLE field over an initial 10 year flat plateau include 200 million cubic feet per day of dry gas under contract, along with liquids of 21 thousand barrels per day while the plant, production and field gathering facilities are being designed for expansion to 400 million cubic feet per day of dry gas and associated natural gas liquids and oil to accommodate additional production. \b \bThe total gross estimated cost of the MLE development, including the expanded plant and field gathering facilities, has been revised to approximately US$1.3 billion reflecting the agreement of FCP and Sonatrach to include the cost of the block tie-in pipelines as a joint development cost. Consequently FCP will receive an increased share of production under the Production Sharing Contract, providing an offset to the increased cost. Dry gas and liquids pipelines are planned to be constructed by the joint venture from Block 405b to a tie-in point on the national pipeline grid approximately 140 km west of the block. In addition, an oil pipeline is planned to be built to a tie-in point on an existing oil pipeline in the Berkine Basin (PK0). \b \bThe development cost will be mainly incurred over the 2007-2009 period and be funded 75% by FCP and 25% by Sonatrach. The contract for the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) work has been tendered. It is expected the FEED work will be completed and an Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract will be tendered and awarded in 2007. Project costs will be refined during the FEED process. \b \bMr. Richard Anderson, President and Chief Executive Officer of FCP, commented: \"The joint development of the MLE field is a very important milestone for FCP. We are delighted the project is moving ahead and thank our partner Sonatrach and the Algerian authorities for their valuable assistance and cooperation which has enabled the partnership to advance to this stage. The Block 405b gas plant will be the first \"cryogenic\" liquids extraction facility and gas export system in the Berkine Basin. The MLE field development is a significant first step in the overall development of the block, and our share of gas and liquids production revenues will provide a sound base for meeting the Company's exciting future growth objectives. We look forward to further development of the block when we have completed our ongoing appraisal programme, and in addition are seeking new exploration opportunities.\" \b \bNotes: \b \bFirst Calgary Petroleums Ltd. is an oil and gas exploration company actively engaged in international exploration and development activities in Algeria. The Company's common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada (FCP) and on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange in the UK (FPL). \b \bFCP advises that in December 2006 the Algerian Government published a further decree setting out the detailed rules for implementing the windfall profits tax announced in July last year. The decree specifies that the new tax, which will be calculated monthly, will apply when the monthly average Brent oil price exceeds $30 per barrel. \b \bIn its application to Block 405b, the rate of tax will be set by reference to FCP's share of oil and gas production under our Production Sharing Contract. The rate of tax commences at a rate of 5% where FCP's share of production is 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) or less, rising in steps to 50% at levels where FCP's share is over 100,000 boepd. At the initial contracted rate of gas production, together with the associated liquids, for the MLE field as described above, the applicable rate of tax is expected to be a maximum of 5% of production. \b \bAs the new tax is in the early stages of its implementation, FCP and its advisors are continuing to monitor and evaluate how the tax will be applied to Block 405b in practice. Our Production Sharing Contract contains a stabilization clause that protects our existing investment and related asset value. \b \bThis news release includes statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking in nature and subject to risks and uncertainties. FCP cautions that actual performance may be affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond its control.

The Fund indirectly holds 20.9% of Jazz Air LP, with ACE Aviation Holdings Inc. holding the remaining majority interest of the outstanding Jazz LP Units. \b \bAbout Jazz Air LP \b \bJazz Air LP (Air Canada Jazz) is the second largest airline in Canada based on fleet size and the number of routes operated. Air Canada Jazz operates more flights and flies to more Canadian destinations than any other Canadian carrier. Air Canada Jazz forms an integral part of Air Canada's domestic and transborder market presence and strategy. \b \bAir Canada Jazz and Air Canada are parties to a Capacity Purchase Agreement (CPA) pursuant to which Air Canada currently purchases substantially all of Air Canada Jazz's fleet capacity based on predetermined rates. Air Canada Jazz provides all crews, airframe maintenance and, in some cases, airport operations. In turn, Air Canada determines routes and controls scheduling, ticket prices, product distribution, seat inventories, marketing and advertising for these flights. \b \bAir Canada Jazz is not a typical airline. Currently, 99% of Air Canada Jazz's revenues are derived from the CPA. Air Canada Jazz is isolated from most of the risks typically associated with airlines such as fuel and navigation costs since these costs are passed-through to Air Canada. \b \bUnder the CPA with Air Canada, Air Canada Jazz provides service to and from lower density markets as well as higher density markets at off-peak times throughout Canada and to and from certain destinations in the United States. As of February 1, 2007 Air Canada Jazz operated scheduled passenger service on behalf of Air Canada with approximately 802 departures per weekday to 56 destinations in Canada and 29 destinations in the United States with a fleet of 135 aircraft. \b \bAir Canada Jazz is the focal point of Air Canada's regional passenger strategy. Air Canada Jazz and Air Canada have linked their regional and mainline networks in order to serve connecting passengers more efficiently and to provide valuable feed traffic to Air Canada's mainline routes. \b \b     /CONTACT: Media Contacts: Manon Stuart, (902) 873-5054, Halifax, Nova Scotia; Debra Williams, (519) 659-5696, London, Ontario; www.flyjazz.ca \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 07:05 ET (12:05 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"b4a394712035b60cca0a0345b0191200","symR":["RNT.UN.T","CA8591051088"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Stephenson's Rental Services Income Fund Declares Cash Distribution>RNT.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T14:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RNT.UN.T","CA8591051088"],"IndustryCodes":["ZFU"],"Story":"\b   MISSISSAUGA, ONTARIO--(CCNMatthews - Feb. 19, 2007) - Stephenson's Rental Service Income Fund (the \"Fund\") (TSX:RNT.UN) announced today a cash distribution of $0.0917 per Class A unit for the period from February 1, 2007 to February 28, 2007, to be paid March 15, 2007 to holders of record of Class A units of the Fund on February 28, 2007. \b \bThe announcement of the February distribution is the nineteenth consecutive distribution to be declared by the Fund consistent with its intention, as stated in its final prospectus, to pay regular monthly cash distributions in the estimated amount of $0.0917 per Class A unit. \b \bAbout Stephenson's: \b \bStephenson's is the leading equipment and tool rental company in Toronto and the surrounding areas.

(ANZ) plans to buy on-line stock broker ETrade Australia Ltd. (ETR.AU) as it looks to expand beyond its traditional focus on retail lending. \u001d  ETrade shares soared 12% Monday after Australia's third largest bank said it has bid A$268 million (US$211 million) for the 65.8% of the broker it doesn't already own. \u001d  The A$4.05 a share offer, valuing ETrade at A$407 million, has the backing of ETrade's independent directors. \u001d  \"We think this is an attractive business,\" said Brian Hartzer, the managing director of ANZ's personal division. \u001d  \"We think ETrade is the future of stockbroking.\" \u001d  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AU) owns the country's biggest on-line broker, Commonwealth Securites. CBA boasted at its full year result last week that CommSec has cornered 48% of the on-line market or more than one million clients. ETrade claims 26%. \u001d  \"CommSec has clearly shown the value of combining an on-line broker with a bank and obviously done incredibly well out of that,\" Hartzer said. \u001d  \"We think in that context, the fact that ETrade has continued to grow market share at the expense of CommSec is a fantastic endorsement of the brand. And we think that combining that with the added benefits that will come from full integration with ANZ means that we will be in a strong position,\" he said. \u001d  With about a third of ETrade's customers already stemming from ANZ, Hartzer hopes to grow the broker's market share further with the help of referrals from the bank. \u001d  However, he declined to set market share targets, saying ANZ is focused on selling its own products to ETrade customers, and enhancing the services ANZ can provide to its own clients such as investment advisers. \u001d  \"We aren't focused on market share,\" he said. \u001d  \"In a sense, the broking side of this is somewhat incidental.\" \u001d  Hartzer said the ETrade acquisition would be a further step in ANZ's strategy to become a leader in personal financial services in Australia, as it grows its wealth management and investment services businesses. \b \b   Some Investors May Want Better Offer Price \b \u001d  \"The banks are moving into the asset gathering space,\" said Johan Vanderlugt, an analyst at Daiwa. \u001d  \"They want to capture the full investment and savings flow of their clients, be it savings assets, insurance assets or direct investments, and this way they improve the share of the wallet. That is the real benefit of this deal.\" \u001d  ANZ won't be usurping CommSec's dominance of the market anytime soon, he said. \u001d  \"Commsec is such a strong brand, it will take some time before ANZ is able to challenge that leadership,\" he said. \u001d  With ETrade shares trading at A$4.15, 20 cents above the offer price, ANZ's Hartzer played down the chances of a rival bidder emerging. \u001d  \"It is pretty much impossible to guess what others might do,\" said Hartzer. \u001d  \"I guess we would simply say that as people look at where this business really is, they look at what is really needs to take it to the next level, and factor in our existing shareholding of 34%, we hope people will see that we are the logical owner of this, and that the offer we have put on the table is fair and reasonable.\" \u001d  Senior traders said a rival bid is unlikely, although one said some investors might want better terms. \u001d  \"We have got a history of walking away from deals where we didn't see a value, and we thought long and hard about what we were prepared to pay before making this bid,\" Hartzer said. \u001d  ETrade chairman Kerry Roxburgh said the offer is \"compelling\" and that ANZ's resources and expertise will accelerate ETrade's growth. \u001d  Roxburgh said ETrade had reached \"an inflection point\" in its nine-year life as it adopted a model similar to ETrade in the U.S., involving deposit and investment products and margin lending. \u001d  ANZ intends to retain the ETrade brand, subject to agreement with ETrade Financial Corp. when the current licensing arrangements expire in 2009. \b   -By Rebecca Thurlow, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2959; rebecca.thurlow@dowjones.com \b   -Edited by Ian Pemberton \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 02:16 ET (07:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b59f61a330c6ea57f3af670df0aa8e6e","symR":["LPU.UN.T","CA5203191047"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Lawrence Payout Ratio Trust Declares Monthly Distribution>LPU.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T19:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LPU.UN.T","CA5203191047"],"IndustryCodes":["ZFU"],"Story":"\bTORONTO, Feb. 19 /CNW/ - The Manager of Lawrence Payout Ratio Trust (\"LPRT\") today announced the Trust's distribution to holders of Lawrence Payout Ratio Trust Units (TSX: LPU.UN).

A full feasibility study has not been carried out on the project but at present the company knows of no material affect to the stated resource from such factors. Part 3.4d of NI 43-101 requires the company to state that mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. In 1992 preliminary metallurgical testing was carried out on a composite sample of vein material from three holes by Bacon Donaldson & Associates, then of Richmond, B.C. The composite sample assay by Bacon Donaldson was 130 g/t gold. The preliminary metallurgical testwork resulted in 99% gold recovery with combined gravity and flotation and 98% recovery with combined gravity and cyanidation. Gold recovery to a gravity concentrate was 63%, producing a very high economic grade concentrate. Bacon Donaldson (1992) stated that the ore is readily amenable to processing by either method.

Excluding the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange of 0.3 percentage points, margins improved by 0.4 percentage points.  This year, margins included the benefit of 0.9 percentage points associated with the 2005 closure of the Toronto paper converting plant and product rationalizations, contributing 3.0 cents and 1.5 cents per share, respectively, to net earnings in 2006. The remaining margin decline of 0.5 percentage points in 2006 impacted net earnings by 3 cents per share. This occurred primarily because raw material cost escalations outpaced increases in selling prices. \b \bFor reference, the following presents the indexed purchased cost of Winpak's eight primary raw materials in the reported quarter and each of the preceding eight quarters, where base year 2001 equals 100. \b \b \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bQuarter and Year       4/04  1/05  2/05  3/05  4/05  1/06  2/06  3/06  4/06 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \bPurchase Price Index  127.8 144.1 140.5 135.4 153.0 149.5 146.8 155.4 148.8 \b=-------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b \bThe indexed costs of raw materials purchased by Winpak in the fourth quarter of 2006 decreased by 4.2 percent from the immediately preceding quarter.  The quarter's decrease, driven almost entirely by lower prices for polyethylene, may slightly reduce raw material costs in the first quarter of 2007. The material cost component of products sold in the final quarter of 2006 more closely reflected the materials index for the third quarter, which was 14.8 percent higher than in the comparable 2005 quarter. Average indexed material purchase costs for products sold in the year of 151.2 were 10.4 percent higher than the 137.0 comparable for products sold in 2005. \b \bExpenses, minority interest, taxation \b \bExpenses in the fourth quarter were lower than in the comparable prior period, due to the closure of the Laird Drive facility and savings in other expense categories. In the full year, savings in operating expenses amounted to 5.5 cents per share. Approximately one third of the savings derive from lower pre-production expenses in accordance with the absence from 2006 of new commercializations of major manufacturing equipment.  The closure of the Toronto plant facilitated savings of 1 cent per share.  Certain Winpak locations delivered the remaining savings from reduced selling, general and administrative expenses, including freight costs. \b \bIncreased net earnings in 2006 of a subsidiary drove the higher minority shareholder's interest amounting to 0.5 cents per share.  Higher effective rates of taxation triggered the increase in income tax expense of 1 cent per share. Greater proportions of taxable income arose in higher tax-rate jurisdictions. \b \bSale of property/business \b \bIn June 2006, Winpak completed the facility rationalization plan with the conclusion of the sale of the premises formerly occupied by the converting operating unit at Laird Drive, Toronto, Ontario.  Cash proceeds for the premises of $8.6 million generated a pre-tax gain of $5.6 million and net earnings of $4.3 million, or 6.5 cents per share. The low effective rate of tax applicable to the transaction was due to the capital gains element of the sale. \b \bIn June 2005, Winpak sold certain assets of the printed, paper bag business. Normal operations at the Laird Drive premises formerly utilized by the bag business ceased at the end of October 2005 and the facility was subsequently closed. Costs were incurred consequent to the closure for employee termination and other related expenses and favourable cumulative currency translation adjustments were realized.  In the 2005 financial statements these transactions netted a pre-tax loss of $1.7 million and the impact on net earnings was insignificant. \b \bCapital Resources, Cash Flow and Liquidity \b \bAt the close of the year, Winpak's cash amounted to $3.0 million, or $1.9 million lower than at the prior year-end. This position reflected financing and investing disbursements in 2006 of $50.7 million less total funds provided by operations of $48.5 million and a foreign exchange adjustment of $0.3 million. \b \bTotal cash used of $50.7 million included the retirement of $17.0 million long-term debt, dividends of $3.4 million and net investments in property, plant and equipment, after the receipt of $8.6 million proceeds for the property sale, amounting to $30.3 million.  Unless unexpected circumstances occur, in 2007 Winpak expects to repay a substantial portion of the $22 million long-term debt outstanding as at December 31, 2006. Capital investments included significant progress payments on the three major expansion projects announced February 15, 2006. These projects are further discussed later in this MD&A and capital spending on them will be completed in 2007. \b \bTotal funds provided by operations amounted to $48.5 million, more than 50 percent higher than in the prior year. While a 9.3 percent improvement was generated from cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital and after adjusting for non-cash items, most of the increase in funds from operations arose through an improved working capital position. Inventories remained level whereas they had increased in the prior year. In addition, disbursements for payables were substantially lower, including the delay of payments for certain plant and equipment until the first quarter of 2007. \b \bIn the last three months of 2006, the Company increased cash balances by $8.8 million, driven by a significant increase in cash provided by operating activities in the last quarter compared to the other three quarters.  This increase was substantially generated by reductions in working capital. \b \bWinpak is confident that sufficient financial resources are in place to fund cash needs for the foreseeable future. \b \bLooking Forward \b \bIn 2007, the Company expects to complete three major capital projects. New capacity in Manitoba for high-barrier films should become productive in the second quarter. Manufacturing of new shrink film products is anticipated to commence in the expanded plant in Georgia in the third quarter.  The new facility in Illinois and major items of equipment due in Illinois and Quebec are directed towards strengthening the Company's position in food lidding and broadening the offering of health care products. The project in Illinois and Quebec is expected to contribute cost savings and new product sales during the second half of the year. Over the next five years, additional annual sales generated from these three projects are anticipated to grow to as much as $60 million. Significant capital expenditures are planned for 2007 that may approach the level of spending attained in 2006. These expenditures include the completion of the three major expansionary projects, a number of smaller projects, normal ongoing equipment enhancements and efficiency improvements. Winpak, while not ignoring opportunities for acquisitions that may arise, for the immediate future will focus on identifying internal investment projects and operating efficiencies as the best approach for maximizing shareholder value. \b \b \bWinpak Ltd. \bInterim Consolidated Financial Statements \bYear-to-date Ended: December 31, 2006 \b \b \bThese interim consolidated financial statements have not been audited or reviewed by the Company's independent external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. \b \b \bWinpak Ltd. \bConsolidated Balance Sheets \b(thousands of US dollars) \b(December 31, 2006 Unaudited) \b \b                                             December 31         January 1 \b                                                    2006              2006 \b                                               ----------        ---------- \b \bAssets \b \bCurrent Assets: \b Cash                                            $ 2,994           $ 4,942 \b Accounts receivable                              53,656            50,018 \b Inventories                                      69,469            69,889 \b Prepaid expenses                                  1,747             1,707 \b Future income taxes                               2,869             3,239 \b                                               ---------         ---------- \b                                                 130,735           129,795 \b \bProperty, plant and equipment (net)              225,113           208,189 \b \bOther assets                                       5,105             5,050 \b \bIntangible assets (net)                            8,707            10,921 \b \bGoodwill                                          16,336            16,404 \b                                               ---------         ---------- \b                                               $ 385,996         $ 370,359 \b                                               ---------         ---------- \b                                               ---------         ---------- \b \bLiabilities and Shareholders' Equity \b \bCurrent Liabilities: \b Accounts payable and accrued liabilities       $ 40,950          $ 35,424 \b Current portion of long-term debt                     -            15,000 \b                                               ---------         ---------- \b                                                  40,950            50,424 \b \bLong-term debt                                    22,000            24,000 \b \bDeferred credits                                  10,896             9,370 \b \bFuture income taxes                               25,781            28,353 \b \bPostretirement benefits                            1,481             1,444 \b                                               ---------         --------- \b                                                 101,108           113,591 \b \bMinority interest                                 11,139            10,928 \b \bShareholders' Equity: \b Share capital                                    29,195            29,195 \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 07:19 ET (12:19 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"bbb0ed33270a9787e537dbc8b22a9caa","symR":["PUM.XE","DE0006969603"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Puma 2006 Net Profit EUR263.2M Vs EUR285.8M >PUM.XE","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T10:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PUM.XE","DE0006969603"],"IndustryCodes":["FOT","TEX","XDJGI","XISL","XMDAX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bbfdadeef4e9dea81510df0848eb96f3","symR":["SND.UN.T","CA83607X1006"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Sound Energy Cuts Monthly Distrib To C$0.055/Unit","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T22:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SND.UN.T","CA83607X1006"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Sound Energy Trust (SND.UN.T) has lowered its monthly distribution to 5.5 Canadian cents a unit from 10 Canadian cents, citing a \"significant drop in commodity prices.\" \u001d  The Calgary oil and gas trust said the decrease is effective with the distribution payable of March 15 to holders of record Feb. 26. \u001d  -Tara Zachariah;

In fact, if you're saving for any big future expense, chances are you're counting on doubling up, and then some. We think that's great -- and we can help you do it faster. \u001d  Thanks to the bulldozer momentum of compounding, anyone with enough time can turn a pile of money into one twice as big. Based on historical rates of return, for example, an investment in the Standard & Poor's 500 should double every seven years -- every 10, if you account for inflation. Thanks to such investments and the progress of their careers, upper-middle-income families can steadily climb the wealth ladder. Data from the Census Bureau suggests that a high-earning couple in their early 30s today can expect to double their net worth once by their mid-40s and again by around age 60. \u001d  But to stay economically secure in the long term, you may need to build your wealth more quickly. Broader economic trends can trip you up in your efforts to stockpile savings. College is a given today for most forward-looking kids, for example, but the costs of tuition and fees at four-year colleges have risen faster than inflation for more than two decades, according to the College Board, with costs at public universities soaring 35 percent in the past five years alone. Health care is also taking a bigger bite out of American budgets, with premiums and out-of-pocket costs now 75 percent higher than they were five years ago. Furthermore, because of increases in longevity, today's 45- to 54-year-olds will need much larger nest eggs than their parents did to live well throughout retirement. But only 30 percent of people in that age bracket have total savings that top the $100,000 mark, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. \u001d  It all adds up to a rationale for stepping on the gas pedal. That's why we've assembled this guide to doubling your wealth in five years, rather than 10 or 15. We've crunched numbers and canvassed experts to find strategies that can yield double-digit returns on investments in stocks as well as in that current out-of-favor category, real estate. We've gathered tips from people who turned their passions into profitable part-time businesses. And we've pored over research to learn how health considerations -- including smoking habits and time spent on the treadmill -- may affect your take-home pay. \u001d  Aggressive as our premise may sound, we've focused on realistic steps, not radical ones. We've assumed that you're happy staying in your current career and that you're not cut out for high-stakes Texas Hold 'Em in the style of Casino Royale. We've also excluded the value of your home from our calculations; though it's a big factor in your net worth, you probably don't want to sell it anytime soon. Even so, we're confident that a combination of tips from our five sections will leave you equipped for a more secure and comfortable future. \b \u001d  INVESTING \b \u001d  The out-of-favor stocks that John Buckingham likes have a propensity to either double in value or blow up in his face. Of course, he can't tell which it will be when he buys them. A classic example: In 2002 he bought two troubled but alluringly cheap companies, Apple Computer and Dura Automotive Systems, for his top-performing Al Frank Fund. Four years later Dura was down 95 percent. But Apple was up 600 percent -- more than offsetting Dura and making Buckingham look brilliant. Results like these explain why Buckingham favors buying a basket of risky stocks instead of betting the house on one company. It's a tactic that increases his chances of capturing high returns while lowering the overall risk to the fund. And if you want to double your portfolio in five years -- a goal that requires earning almost 15 percent a year from your investments -- it's an approach worth studying. \u001d  Think of it as a more aggressive take on Modern Portfolio Theory, the groundbreaking work on asset allocation that won the Nobel Prize for three economists in 1990. The basic premise: Investing in a range of assets that don't move exactly in tandem with one another increases your portfolio's expected return and lowers its overall risk. If you pick more-volatile assets, the risk does rise -- we don't recommend plowing the kids' college money or the bulk of your nest egg into a double-your-money portfolio. But by investing in several such picks at once, you keep the risk lower than it otherwise would be. \"Diversity is key,\" Buckingham says. \u001d  To put together a high-powered portfolio, we focused on potentially high-performing groups of stocks whose returns rarely march in lockstep. We relied on exchange-traded funds to tap their potential. By buying ETFs instead of individual stocks, you avoid the risk of seeing the sector perform really well while your stock falters. And their low fee structure ensures that you capture the majority of the investing gains. Our favorite sectors, and ETFs that harness them: \b \u001d  -- Biotechnology is the most promising arena for investing in the health care surge that should accompany the aging of the baby boomers. Biotech firms now receive more drug patents than traditional pharmaceutical firms, and since their drugs are newer, they can aim for blockbuster profits without fretting over expiring patents. First Trust AMEX Bio-technology (FBT, $24) gives investors access to 20 top biotech firms. \b \u001d  -- There's water, water everywhere, but not everyone has easy access to clean, drinkable water. Even in America, municipalities need help upgrading pipes and sewer systems. The PowerShares Global Water Portfolio (PHO, $18) owns everything from Aqua America, which operates local water utilities, to Watts Water Technologies, which sells filters and flow-control systems. \b \u001d  -- Microchips have become the brains inside everything from airplanes to espresso makers. Stocks of many semiconductor makers have languished, but recent private buyouts of such companies imply that at least some investors think they're undervalued. SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD, $51) offers investors exposure to Intel, Xilinx and other big chip producers. \b \u001d  -- Small companies create some of the world's most innovative products and services, and shareholders benefit: After all, Microsoft wasn't always so big. And within the small-cap universe, growth-oriented stocks look like the better buy right now, according to Bill McVail, manager of the Turner Small Cap Growth fund. Owning iShares Russell 2000 Growth (IWO, $80) gives investors the chance to profit from small-company success stories. \b \u001d  -- Round out the portfolio by going abroad. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM, $111) ETF owns everything from Korean steelmakers to Russian natural gas producers. Some of these stocks have had tremendous recent runs, so a short-term slowdown might ding the fund. But don't be discouraged; the economies of the emerging world certainly will grow faster than the U.S. economy over the next decade. \u001d  Of course, right now it could be tempting simply to park your money in the S&P 500. Including dividends, the broad market index rose 16 percent in 2006, and if it performed like that for four more years, it would more than double. But don't count on it: Since 1926, there has been only one five-year streak in which the market did that well every year -- during the '90s Internet boom. For big gains, riskier stocks paradoxically look like the safer bet. \u001d  -- R.P. \b \u001d  REAL ESTATE \b \u001d  Invest in rental housing? Now? With real estate headlines these days ranging from sober to apocalyptic, using \"invest\" and \"housing\" in the same sentence can get you some funny looks around the water cooler. But rental-market fundamentals are surprisingly sound. For one thing, rents have fallen behind sales prices in recent years and have some catching up to do. Even better, the National Association of Homebuilders expects 1.5 million new households to form each year through 2015, many created by immigrants and twentysomethings -- the folks most likely to rent. \u001d  To be sure, buying a building is a bigger hassle than spending the same money on Google shares: \"A stock doesn't call you up on Saturday night to say the roof is leaking,\" says Steven Podnos, a Merritt Island, Fla.-based financial adviser. John Stewart, a Chicago food trader, recently bought two small rental properties in that city, including a Hyde Park \"graystone.\" He says he spends six to 10 hours a week on everything from calls about ice on the porch to buying a new refrigerator -- and the hours really add up when he needs to find a new tenant or make a major repair. \u001d  Still, Stewart's rewards could be sweet, because doubling your money isn't a stretch even when prices are high and rents are low. Here's a rough example: Say you're buying a two-family home for $850,000, and you put down 20 percent, or $170,000. (A bigger down payment boosts your odds of having positive cash flow on the property.) Your annual expenses, including mortgage payments, taxes and maintenance, will run about 10 percent of the amount borrowed -- in this case, $68,000. But assuming you don't live in the building, you can write off every penny, along with capital depreciation of roughly 1/27th of the building's value. If you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, that's a $24,870 savings, leaving you $43,130 in the hole for the year. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:02 ET (11:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bdc30fb425a429f99881128d97d3e3c6","symR":["AAL.LN","AAUK","AMS.JO","ARI.JO","GB0004901517","ZAE000013181","ZAE000054045"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Strike At South Africa's Modikwa Mine Suspended - Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T06:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAL.LN","AAUK","AMS.JO","ARI.JO","GB0004901517","ZAE000013181","ZAE000054045"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","PCS","PPM","XDJGI","XFT1","XISL","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  JOHANNESBURG (Dow Jones)--A strike at the Modikwa platinum mine in South Africa, which has lasted more than three weeks and halted production, has been suspended and workers are due to return to work Monday, the South African Press Association reported Monday. \u001d  Citing National Union of Mineworkers chief negotiator Humbulani Tshikalange, SAPA says the strike was called off because the union felt it would be better for workers to return to work as the dispute would take time to resolve. \u001d  Some 3,000 mine workers walked off the job Jan. 26.

However, with the sale of his Converium stake, Patinex's assets have increased by about CHF600 million, according to analyst estimates, giving Ebner's voice again a substantial weight in the Swiss market. \u001d  -By Goran Mijuk, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 80 47; goran.mijuk@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 04:00 ET (09:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf236c8ff7eec966f8a5be72d5d67309","symR":["YLO.UN.T","CA9855691023"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": DBRS Confirms YPG Holdings Inc. and Yellow Pages Income Fund Ratings, Rates YPG Holdings Inc.

(YPG or the Company) at R-1 (low), BBB (high) and BBB, respectively, with Stable trends, while also confirming the stability rating of Yellow Pages Income Fund (Yellow Pages or the Fund) at STA-1 (low). This is after today's announcement that YPG would acquire the remaining 87.14% ownership interest in Aliant Directory Services for $330 million in cash. In addition, DBRS is now initiating a rating of Pfd-3 (high) with a Stable trend on the new Cumulative Preferred Shares being issued by YPG to help fund this transaction. \u001d  DBRS believes this acquisition supports the Company's existing strong business profile as it realigns YPG's ownership with its operating interest in the Atlantic directories business and further consolidates YPG's national presence while having very minimal execution risk. \u001d  In terms of financing, YPG will issue approximately $300 million in new preferred shares, which will receive substantial equity treatment, with the remainder of the purchase price being financed with existing cash and debt at YPG. DBRS expects that over the next twelve months, YPG will be able to bring its gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio closer to 3.0 times, from approximately 3.5 currently, as well as improve its EBITDA fixed charges coverage to nearly six times, which is more commensurate with its current ratings. \u001d  DBRS notes that it does not expect YPG to make any further significant acquisitions in the near term. If the Company were to do so, without using substantial common equity, then YPG's debt ratings and Yellow Pages' stability rating could come under negative pressure. \u001d  DBRS also acknowledges that the Yellow Pages stability rating continues to be supported by a directory/vertical media business that generates approximately 54% EBITDA margins, has a dominant presence in all major Canadian markets, has continued pricing power, along with the expectation of the Company's payout ratio moving below 90% for the next four years. \u001d  DBRS notes that the transaction is subject to regulatory clearance, with an expected closing during the first half of 2007. \b \u001d  Note: \u001d  All figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. \bIssuer Debt Rated Rating Action Rating Trend Notes Latest Event \bYellow Pages Income Fund Income Fund Confirmed STA-1 (low) Stb  Feb 19, 2007 \bYPG Holdings Inc.

David Williams has amassed a $7.4 million billion portfolio -- and an enviable track record. Why he thinks stocks will continue to rise, and what he's buying now] \b \u001d  WHEN HE WAS NINE YEARS OLD, David Williams started a coin collection by going through the change he pocketed every week on his Lakeland, Ohio, newspaper route. By the time the future portfolio manager of theExcelsior Value & Restructuring fund was 13, he had a collection of American coins dating back to 1915 that would easily be worth $40,000 today. \u001d  But being a great money manager takes more than just the dogged skill of finding undervalued stocks; it takes the fortitude to withstand short-term setbacks. Like when Williams discovered that his younger sister had used his collection to buy subway tokens in New York City when he was in college. \"She's still living that down,\" laughs the 64-year-old manager. \u001d  Eventually, the same skills that built the rare coin collection built a rarefied fund record too. Williams's $7.4 billion fund has a 10-year annualized 13.8 percent total return, compared with the Standard & Poor's 500's 8.4 percent. In pocketbook terms, $50,000 invested with Williams a decade ago would have grown to $181,415 today -- $70,000 more than a comparable investment in the index. Those gains have not always been smooth, however. Last May his fund lost 13 percent when his cyclical stocks, including Southern Copper and Celanese, tumbled on inflation fears. They made a full recovery, finishing up the year at 14.9 percent, just shy of the index's 15.8 percent gain. \u001d  Williams's forte is looking for beaten-up companies in the nascent stages of restructuring. As they peel off costs, earnings improve and the market eventually sees things his way. That can lead him to some unpopular stocks and big sector bets -- and it's one of the reasons for last year's volatility. But the unflappable portfolio manager sticks to his picks. \"It sounds easy to buy stocks cheaply,\" says Morningstar fund analyst Arijit Dutta. \"But it's how he's been able to do it again and again over such a long period of time that makes him a unique talent.\" \u001d  Though his father, an executive at PPG Industries, had finished only high school, he took his son to the Yale University campus when Williams was 14 years old to plant a seed. It took. Williams graduated from Yale in 1965 with a degree in art history, but by then investing had become his passion. As a helicopter pilot in the Navy during the Vietnam War, he spent his off hours teaching his fellow airmen how to invest. He earned an MBA from Harvard in 1974. \u001d  Williams, who got his start managing money for T. Rowe Price, joined U.S. Trust in New York in 1987. Tired of commuting, he moved his fund's operations near his home in Essex, Conn., a quintessential New England town, in 2001. His new office, once a general store on the historic town square, dates back to 1879. Through the storefront window, Williams can see a lighthouse and sparkling water down a road. But he won't be looking out that window all that much longer: In 2009, Williams plans to retire and pass the reins to Timothy Evnin, 42, who has worked with him for the past 20 years, the past five as co-manager of the fund. \"Oh, he'll do much better than me,\" gushes the surprisingly self-effacing Williams. \u001d  Indeed, Williams loves to talk about the times \"I lost my shirt\" and got \"sucked in.\" But in general, he's had more stars than black holes. So in a picture-postcard setting, SmartMoney sat down with this market veteran to find out how he finds his stocks, why he thinks they may be ready to explode upward and why investors can go wrong watching too much CNBC. \b \u001d  SmartMoney: Your market prediction for 2006 was spot on. In late 2005 you saw the market advancing 15 percent -- it finished up 15.8 percent. What's your forecast now? \u001d  David Williams: I don't pay that much attention to big-picture issues, but I see a 12 percent gain for the S&P. Last year earnings completely overwhelmed the market, which has underestimated them the past few years. We had good earnings because we have good fiscal policy. We saw a benefit from the lower, 15 percent capital gains tax and 15 percent dividend income tax. It's huge. It keeps the market up. Provides jobs. I hope the Democrats don't screw that up. \b \u001d  SM: We can't expect a continuation of those earnings gains? \u001d  DW: Right, so we hope for an expansion of price/earnings multiples. Historically, there's a huge correlation between low interest rates and P/E ratios. The 10-year Treasury yield is at 4.7 percent -- near a 35-year low. When yields are this low, P/Es should be higher than they are now. Now they are 16 times 2007's projected earnings -- very cheap. Presumably, the Fed is going to cut rates in 2007. P/Es could explode upward. \u001d  I rely on data from ISI Group that shows the asset classes -- stocks, bonds, cash, housing -- and their performance each decade. If you just bought the cheapest asset class, you'd make a fortune. If you bought housing in the 1960s, you made a fortune. If you bought bonds in the 1980s and '90s when they were the cheapest, you automatically made money. Now stocks are the cheapest asset class. \b \u001d  SM: If you had to pick one company to be the pinup girl of your portfolio? \u001d  DW: Black & Decker. We bought it seven years ago at eight times earnings, and it didn't do anything for three years. Its earnings were halfhearted, but the company continued to cut costs -- moving factories overseas and reducing the number of its products to be competitive. The stock doubled to $80. Now it sells at 12 times earnings, but it's a great brand with good cash flow, and as long as the earnings are good, we have no reason to sell. \b \u001d  SM: Restructuring is in the name of your fund. Is this some kind of marketing gimmick? \u001d  DW: U.S. Trust was high on investing themes in 1992 when this fund started. But it makes sense. Companies weren't restructuring until the prices to deal with their issues. When Fed Chairman Paul Volcker brought about strict monetary policy and ushered in disinflation, they couldn't raise prices. Companies had to start shedding costs by restructuring or consolidating. \u001d  The point is, you must buy well ahead -- when companies announce they'll be cutting costs or laying off employees but before they sell out or merge. Normally, after a company starts slicing expenses, you'll see earnings improve, and when that happens share prices generally follow. After they are merged or spun off, they tend to underperform. \b \u001d  SM: How about an example? \u001d  DW: I bought Rochester Telephone in the mid-1990s because it was shedding costs and was in an underperforming industry that was consolidating. It was renamed Frontier and merged in 1999 with Global Crossing. I hung on to it. There was a meeting with analysts -- it seemed like there were 8,000 of them. They made the case that the merged company would grow to the sky. Management had great charts. You see that and it's all over. I lost my shirt. \b \u001d  SM: Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy in 2002. The lesson? \u001d  DW: When the reason to buy a stock doesn't exist anymore, you sell. In this case, the company was no longer an acquisition target, nor was it cutting costs after it merged. \b \u001d  SM: Give us three rules for selling. \u001d  DW: One: If the market is selling at 15 times and your stock is selling at 20 times, sell it. Let a growth guy take it. Two: Sell when the restructuring or takeover is completed. Three: Sell when a company isn't doing what it said it would. If after a year and a half its plans don't materialize, the company is executing poorly. \b \u001d  SM: What have you sold lately? \u001d  DW: I sold Cendant after it spun off its real estate, Realogy Corp., and Wyndham Worldwide, the hotel company. But the stock never did much. I broke even. \b \u001d  SM: Thanks for the discouraging example. How about a good example of what you do? \u001d  DW: That would be Qualcomm, the wireless-technology company, that I bought around 1992 because telecommunications companies were actively consolidating. As tech got hot, Qualcomm took off. I made four times my money before selling in 2000 because it was well valued. Wanna hear my best sale ever? \b \u001d  SM: Assuredly. \u001d  DW: Computer Associates Chief Executive Sanjay Kumar [now in jail after defrauding shareholders] was speaking at a dinner. He had too much to drink. Kumar was talking about the company's troubles and using the F-word every other sentence. \"F this and F that.\" I sold the next day. \b \u001d  SM: Selling companies whose CEOs have potty mouths could be lesson No. 4. What about your buying criteria? \u001d  DW: I like to keep it simple. I look for companies that are cheap and that are restructuring or in an industry that is consolidating. Consolidation is going to continue in energy because the oil companies all need scale. I'm agnostic about the price of energy. But the stocks are so cheap -- in price to cash flow and price to earnings. You can buy oil cheaper on the New York Stock Exchange than you can going out and finding it in the ground. Devon Energy has been buying up smaller oil and gas companies but could be a target itself. If it makes $7 a share this year, that means it sells at less than 10 times earnings. I also like Anadarko, whose stock is selling at $41, or seven times earnings. \b \u001d  SM: How can we find such companies ourselves? \u001d  DW: If I do something well, it's reading. I read a great deal of Wall Street research. You know, people get excited about funds paying brokers too much in commission dollars. But it really does benefit the fund, and it's worth paying more per share. \u001d  --- \u001d  SmartMoney.com: For more on Williams's fund and his favorite stocks, go to  www.smartmoney.com. \b \b

(5730.FR) said more time was needed to finalize exactly where its new airplane would be built. \u001d  In a short statement, EADS said its board late Sunday opted to interrupt work on Airbus' Power8 restructuring plan that is expected to include thousands of job cuts and some outsourcing of operations. \u001d  It said the board will meet again in the next few days to find an agreement with European nations on how to share the workload on the development of Airbus' planned mid-sized A350 XWB airplane. \u001d  Airbus bosses were scheduled to meet the company's works council Tuesday to detail the Power8 program, but the meeting has now been postponed, EADS said. Airbus Chief Executive Louis Gallois was expected to outline the program at a news conference Tuesday afternoon in Toulouse. \u001d  The A350 XWB airplane, which was officially launched at the end of 2006, is Airbus' answer to rival Boeing Co.'s (BA) strong-selling 787 Dreamliner. The four main European countries that Airbus operates in - France, Germany, the U.K. and Spain - are all seeking to have involvement on the A350 program to safeguard jobs. The Power8 program is expected to outline exactly where and how the new airliner will be built. \u001d  Politicians in Germany and France are calling on EADS to keep any job losses through Power8 to a minimum and spread the burden throughout the company. Trade unions have also expressed concern in recent weeks, and early this month more than 10,000 Airbus workers in Germany rallied against the possible job losses. \u001d  French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Angela Merkel might discuss the Airbus restructuring program when they meet in Germany this Friday, according to an official close to the French leader. Airbus has its biggest plants in France and Germany. \u001d  In a statement, Airbus CEO Gallois - who is also joint CEO at EADS - stressed there was a need to quickly find a solution \"that overcomes national issues.\" \u001d  \"I made proposals, which I deem balanced, both from an industrial and a technological point of view, and which serve our objective of economic competitiveness,\" Gallois said. \"I wish that they can lead to the consensus we urgently need. Airbus cannot delay any longer implementing Power 8.\" \u001d  An EADS spokesman declined to comment further on the delay and wouldn't predict when the Power8 restructuring program will be unveiled. An EADS official - who asked not to be named - told Dow Jones Newswires separately that threatened job losses are likely to be a major reason for the delay in the announcement. \u001d  A Paris-based analyst said the delay comes after strong pressure from French and German unions and the German government. He said the delay is \"worrying\" as Airbus is in \"desperate\" need of restructuring and there's a risk the plan could be scaled down. \u001d  EADS has said Airbus likely have made an operating loss last year due to costly delays in its double-decker A380 program and initial restructuring charges. \u001d  EADS is due to release 2006 results in early March. \u001d  The Power8 program is designed to improve Airbus' internal efficiency and competitiveness against Boeing amid a weaker U.S. dollar. Airplanes are sold in dollars and much of EADS' costs are priced in euros. \u001d  EADS shares moved slightly lower after the announcement. But at the close, they were up EUR0.72, or 2.9%, at EUR25.84. The stock was boosted early Monday by reports that the state-owned Qatar Investment Authority is looking at buying a stake of up to 10%, analysts said. \u001d  Company Web sites: http://www.eads.com \u001d                     http://www.airbus.com \b   -By Rod Stone, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 9295; rod.stone@dowjones.com \u001d  (Alice Dore and Gabriele Parussini in Paris contributed to this report.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 13:17 ET (18:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c8315cb06376681c7df16ec9919d290e","symR":["000270.SE","005380.SE","7211.TO","DCX","DCX.XE","F","GM","DE0007100000","JP3899800001","KR7000270009","KR7005380001","US3704421052"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Korea Hyundai Motor Says Not Interested In Buying Chrysler","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T05:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["000270.SE","005380.SE","7211.TO","DCX","DCX.XE","F","GM","DE0007100000","JP3899800001","KR7000270009","KR7005380001","US3704421052"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","X225","XATI","XDAX","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SEOUL (AP)--Hyundai Motor Co. (005380.SE), the world's sixth-largest automaker, on Monday denied a British newspaper report that it is interested in acquiring Chrysler, the U.S. unit of German automaker DaimlerChrysler AG(DCX). \u001d  \"We are not considering to buy Chrysler because our hands are full,\" Hyundai spokesman Jake Jang said, responding to a report in the The Sunday Times newspaper that the South Korean automaker was among companies interested in bidding for the Chrysler Group. \u001d  The Times reported on its Web site that Hyundai was thought to be interested in joining possible bidders for the U.S. automaker, without citing specific sources. The paper said that Hyundai was believed to be interested in gaining access to Chrysler's network of dealerships in the U.S. \u001d  Speculation regarding Chrysler has intensified since Wednesday, when DaimlerChrysler AG Chairman Dieter Zetsche said the automaker would not rule out a possible sale of its U.S. operations, which it acquired in 1998. \u001d  Zetsche, who formerly led Chrysler Group, said the German company is considering all options for its U.S. operation, including strategic partners. \u001d  Automotive News, a trade publication, reported last week that General Motors Corp. (GM) is in talks to acquire Chrysler. GM and Chrysler officials declined to comment on the Automotive News report, which cited sources in Germany and the U.S. whom it did not identify. \u001d  Hyundai currently has an engine alliance with Chrysler and Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211.TO) under which Hyundai allows those companies to manufacture engines based on Hyundai design, Jang said. \u001d  Hyundai is in the middle of an aggressive overseas expansion, with plants either completed or under construction in the United States, China and the Czech Republic. Affiliate Kia Motors Corp.'s (000270.SE) expansion plans include a factory in the United States. \u001d  The denial is not the fist time that Hyundai has quashed speculation regarding a possible overseas acquisition. \u001d  The automaker said in August that it had no interest in acquiring Ford Motor Co.'s (F) luxury Jaguar brand, citing its priority of expanding production at overseas plants. \u001d  Hyundai has been mired in trouble for most of the past year. Net profit fell every quarter last year as the company dealt with the effects of a rising South Korean currency and chronic strikes. \u001d  Earlier this month, Hyundai Chairman Chung Mong-koo was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzlement and breach of trust. He is appealing the verdict and remains free to run the company. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 00:06 ET (05:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c87b13977bcf2572977dd25941393a1e","symR":["MEC.A.T","MECA","US5592111075"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Magna Entertainment Corp. announces non-cash asset write-down","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T19:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["MEC.A.T","MECA","US5592111075"],"IndustryCodes":["CNO","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  AURORA, ON, Feb. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - Magna Entertainment Corp.

Reasons for Restatement \b \u001d  The Company is restating its Consolidated / Non-consolidated Financial Statements for the first half of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 due to the following reasons: \b \b \b    (1) Revenue for post-contract customer support services should be deferred \b        based on their fair values and recognized ratably over the service \b        period.  However, certain inconsistencies between the revenue \b        recognition period and the actual service period were found.  In \b        addition, certain fair value amounts were erroneously calculated. \b        Thus, the Company revises its net sales to correct those errors. \b \b    (2) The fair value of the legal obligation associated with the retirement \b        of long-lived assets should be recognized as a liability as prescribed \b        in SFAS No. 143.  However, the Company had not recorded certain of \b        such obligations that were considered immaterial.  Therefore, the \b        Company provides an appropriate amount for all of its asset retirement \b        obligations. \b \b    (3) In our North America operation, a subsidiary immediately expensed \b        certain fixed assets with an acquisition cost of less than USD3,000 or \b        a useful life of less than 2 years.  The Company capitalizes such \b        fixed assets and records appropriate depreciation expense. \b \b    (4) In our North America operation, a subsidiary corrected its tax \b        calculation with regard to the transfer of intellectual property which \b        took place in 2005. \b \b \u001d  The Company quantified these misstatements by applying SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108, which was released in September 2006, and has concluded that these errors are material misstatements that warrant a restatement of its consolidated/non-consolidated financial results. \b \u001d  As a result of these adjustments, deferred tax asset (current) and deferred revenue (current) on the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2006 increased by (Yen) 1,249,722 thousand and (Yen) 3,297,852 thousand, respectively. With regard to the consolidated income statements for the six- month period ended June 30, 2006, net sales and operating expenses increased by (Yen) 552,088 thousand and (Yen) 10,163 thousand respectively.  As a result, each of operating income and net income before taxes increased by (Yen) 541,925 thousand. \b \u001d  Deferred tax asset (current) and deferred revenue (current) on the non- consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2006 increased by (Yen) 1,078,231 thousand and (Yen) 2,649,868 thousand, respectively.

Larry Puglia of T. Rowe Price sees two distinct drivers for the company's growth: dramatic international expansion and the design industry's move from two-dimensional software to 3D design. \"Anytime a company builds a building, chances are they will have to use Autodesk's software,\" he says. And since fewer than 15 percent of customers have made the upgrade so far, he sees a huge opportunity over the next couple of years. Autodesk, which is expected to post $1.8 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that ended in January, is five times bigger than its only publicly traded direct competitor, which makes valuing the company difficult. But Needham software analyst Richard Davis thinks the stock could rise to $49 in 12 months. That's 26 times his estimate for fiscal 2008 earnings, but considering Autodesk's dominance in this growing market, that doesn't seem like an unreasonable target. \b \u001d  Nortel Networks (NT, $27) \u001d  HOLLYWOOD LOVES a good comeback story -- a struggling football team gets a new coach who fires up his players for a fourth-quarter touchdown that clinches the championship. Investors in Nortel Networks are watching the same movie at the Toronto-based network-equipment maker, and increasingly, they are anticipating the warm-and-fuzzy ending before the credits roll. So far, however, the story has been a tearjerker. Accounting discrepancies forced the company to restate financial results three times in three years, leading it to ax much of its executive team. Criminal probes, class-action lawsuits and junk-bond ratings nearly crippled it. \u001d  A year ago Nortel brought in Mike Zafirovski, a Jack Welch protege, to turn the company around. Zafirovski's management style is beginning to show progress. Nortel settled its class-action suit without breaking the bank and is expected to earn a profit in 2007, after losing money in five of the past six years. And the networking market is the place to be these days. Nortel will likely benefit from a kick start in spending from the recently completed merger between AT&T and BellSouth. And the company, which competes with Cisco and Alcatel-Lucent, recently won a $2 billion contract with Verizon Wireless to help build out its wireless network. Jayne Stevlingson, manager of the Gartmore Global Technology & Communications fund, began buying the stock late last year because it showed signs it had hit its low point. \"With a new CEO and a new head of sales and $1 billion in cost-cutting, it's got great potential,\" she says. Analysts expect Nortel to earn $355 million, or 70 cents per share, in 2007 on revenue of $11.7 billion. And Zafirovski has publicly stated that he expects operating profit margins to rise to double digits in 2008, which would more than double earnings per share. \u001d  --- \b                       Great Tech-Spectations \b \b  As information-technology spending rises in 2007, these five companies \bshould prosper. \b \bCompany (Ticker) \bPrice         Market       2006          2006        2006    2007      2007 \b1/17/06 ($) Value ($bil) Rev.

(d.b.a. UNICOM), a \bprivately-held competitive services provider headquartered in Bend, \bOregon. Eschelon will pay approximately $13.9 million in cash to \bacquire UNICOM. \b \u001d  Unicom has approximately $19 million in annual revenue and sells local, long distance, Internet access services and business telephone systems throughout Oregon and parts of Washington. The company currently has approximately 28,000 equivalent access lines. \b \u001d  \"With Eschelon's existing footprint in Oregon, UNICOM was a natural fit for us,\" stated Richard A. Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer of Eschelon Telecom. \"With the addition of the UNICOM customers, Eschelon should have the highest CLEC market share in most, if not all of the significant markets in Oregon. We have a disciplined approach to our acquisitions - we want transactions that are within our existing footprint, concentrating on medium and small business customers, are EBITDA positive pre-synergies, and cash flow accretive post-synergies within 12-24 months. UNICOM fits those filters, and that reduces our integration risk and allows us to maximize the value created. We like UNICOM a lot for all of those reasons.\" \b \u001d  As with previous acquisitions, Eschelon expects to create significant synergies by integrating UNICOM with the company's existing operations taking UNICOM from a normalized EBITDA level of approximately $1.6 million to a post-synergy EBITDA level of approximately $4.5 million. \b \u001d  Craig Nelson, UNICOM's President stated \"We look forward to partnering with Eschelon to continue to bring excellent service and innovative products to our customers. Through their previous acquisitions, Eschelon has proven their ability to integrate companies without disruption to the customer base. We have worked hard to build long term relationships with our customers and are confident that will not change under the Eschelon name.\" \b \u001d  \"Last year we established an objective of acquiring $100 million of competitive local exchange carrier revenue over a two to three-year period. With the completed acquisitions and now UNICOM, we will have acquired over $74 million in revenue - we have made significant progress toward our goal and are not done yet,\" said Smith. \b \u001d  Eschelon management will provide additional details about the transaction and answer analyst and investor questions during its Fourth Quarter, 2006 earnings conference call scheduled for Monday, February 26, 2007. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2007. \b \b   About Eschelon Telecom, Inc. \b \u001d  Eschelon Telecom, Inc. is a facilities-based competitive communications services provider of voice and data services and business telephone systems in 45 markets in the western United States.

(TSX:WTM) and partner Konigsberg Corporation (OTCBB:KGBC) announced today the results of the Phase 2 surface sampling program on the Yoquivo Gold-Silver Project in Chihuahua State, Mexico. A total of 65 surface grab and chip samples, collected from portions of several mineralized trends on the Project, returned average grades of 1.57 g/t gold and 137 g/t silver. Individual sample results ranged from detection limits to highs of 22.10 g/t gold and 2,820 g/t silver. \b \b\"This Phase 2 program on Yoquivo focussed on evaluating the potential of the southern portion of the Project area, and on tracing extensions to the high-grade vein/breccia discoveries at surface,\" said Darin Wagner, President of West Timmins Mining. \"With the positive results from the Phase 1 program which focussed on identifying areas of the property with near surface bulk tonnage potential, the Phase 2 program and the results of our recently completed airborne geophysical program in hand we are now in a position to begin drilling high priority targets on the Yoquivo Project.\" \b \bHighlights of the Phase 2 surface sampling program include five samples collected from grab and vein samples ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 metres in width from the El Gambusino trend averaging 4.00 g/t gold and 581 g/t silver (high of 15.45 g/t gold, 2,860 g/t silver). Six samples, collected from veins ranging from 0.2 to 3.0 metres in width along the Texana trend averaged 4.91 g/t gold and 499 g/t silver, including one very high grade vein which returned 22.10 g/t gold and 2,070 g/t silver over 0.3 metres. \b \b \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b               Elevation                           Gold   Silver  GoldEqu. \bTrend                 (m)                          (g/t)    (g/t)      (i) \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------ \bEl Gambusino \b (Central)     2180-2220 5 samples along 400 m     4.00      581    13.68 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bTexana \b (South-East)  2120-2180 6 samples over \b                         50 x 60 m area            4.91      499    13.22 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b \bMala Suerte \b (South)            2320 6 samples along 200 m     1.72      151     4.23 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b(i) Gold equivalent calculated at 1 g/t gold equals 60 g/t silver based \b    on recent metal price ratios. \b \b \bMexico's newest gold-silver mine, Ocampo, which reports reserve grades of 1.19 g/t gold and 55.00 g/t silver, is located 35 km northeast and along a regional structural trend the Yoquivo Project. The Yoquivo Gold-Silver Project covers the entirety of the historic Yoquivo mining district. Historically reported production grades from the San Francisco mine, located near the center of the Yoquivo Project averaged 10.9 g/t gold and 1,120 g/t Ag from underground workings which exhibit widths of 3 to 7 metres. In total 22 historic pits, adits and shafts have now been identified on the property along 6 principal vein/breccia trends from which high-grade gold and silver epithermal style mineralization have been recovered. \b \bThe preliminary results from the recently completed airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey of the Project have also been received. The known mineralized trends on the property display a good correlation with zones of decreased magnetic intensity, related to magnetically destructive alteration along the host trends. A number of additional areas within the Project holdings, which exhibit similar geophysical signatures to the known mineralized trends, have been identified and are high-priority targets for additional drill testing. \b \bWest Timmins has initiated drill permitting for the Yoquivo Gold-Silver Project and approvals are anticipated within the next three to four weeks. \b \bSubject to an Option Agreement dated May 31, 2006 Konigsberg may earn an initial 50% interest in the Yoquivo Project by making cash payments of US $200,000, issuing to West Timmins 1,000,000 common shares of Konigsberg, funding US $1,000,000 in exploration expenditures on the property over a 24 month period and making all cash payments required by West Timmins to the underlying property vendor. \b \bQuality Control and Assurance \b \bGeochemical results reported herein are from grab, chip and channel samples collected from the Company's Yoquivo Gold-Silver Project. Samples were sealed on site and transport under the care and control of the staff of Minera Cascabel S.V de C.A. on behalf of the Company to the preparation facilities of ALS-Chemex in Chihuahua, Mexico. Samples were assayed for gold by standard fire assay-ICP finish with a 30 gram charge. Samples additionally underwent 34 element ICP-MS analysis. Silver assays in excess of 100 g/t were re-analyzed by fire assay.

When the effect of initial adoption is determined to be material, SAB No. 108 allows the Company to record that effect as a transitional cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning-of-year retained earnings. \b \u001d  SAB No. 108 is effective from the first annual period ending after November 16, 2006, however, as permitted, the Company has elected to adopt the provisions early from the first half period of this fiscal year.  Upon adoption of SAB No. 108, the Company corrected prior year misstatements through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning of the year retained earnings in the amount of (Yen) 2,251,639 thousand, which had previously been considered immaterial to the prior year consolidated financial statements.  A breakdown of the cumulative-effect adjustment is as follows: \b \b \b \b \b                                                           (Thousands of Yen) \b \b \b                                               Fiscal year       Increase \b            Contents and reasons of the           that      (decrease) in the \b                   misstatements              misstatements beginning of year \b                                                occurred    retained earnings \b    (1)Post-contract customer support service \b       revenue should be deferred and \b       recognized ratably over the service \b       period. The Company corrected \b       certain inconsistencies between the \b       revenue recognition period and the \b       actual service period that had \b       occurred due to an operational \b       limitation of tracking individual \b       customer contract terms.                FY 1999 -         (1,189,469) \b    (2)In Japan, revenue for certain \b       multi-year support service contracts \b       was being recognized in a one-year \b       period due to a system bug.             FY 1999 -            (12,288) \b    (3)Revenue of our North America operation \b       had been dominated by the sales \b       for the large corporate market and the \b       deferral method used for sales in \b       the large corporate market was also \b       applied to the sales in the consumer \b       market. However, the sales in the \b       North America consumer market have \b       increased in recent years. Therefore, \b       the Company changed its deferral \b       method in the consumer market to \b       reflect a more accurate fair value.     FY 1999 -           (143,845) \b    (4)The fair value of post-contract \b       customer support service in the \b       Japanese consumer market had been \b       determined in reference to the \b       retail list price (the price for \b       end-users) of each product component. \b       To calculate more accurate fair \b       value, the Company changed its \b       deferral amounts to the ones \b       which were based on the wholesale \b       price (the price for distributors).     FY 1999 -           (725,585) \b    (5)The fair value of the legal obligation \b       associated with the retirement of \b       long-lived assets should be recognized \b       as a liability as prescribed in SFAS \b       No.143. However, the Company had not \b       recorded certain such obligations \b       that were considered immaterial. \b       Therefore, the Company had provided an \b       appropriate amount for all of its \b       asset retirement obligations.           FY 2005 -            (84,019) \b    (6)In our North America operation, a \b       subsidiary had applied the same \b       deferral method for the major product \b       line to the revenue from Intermute \b       products and the products with a seat \b       number of 50,001 or more, as well \b       as the products bundled with a premium \b       support program. However, the Company \b       changed its method so that the entire \b       sales amounts are deferred and \b       recognized ratably over the service \b       period since the fair value of the PCS \b       component for those products could \b       not be determined.                      FY 2005 -            (253,742) \b    (7)In our North America operation, the \b       start date and end date information \b       for certain post-contract customer \b       service arrangements was incorrectly \b       entered into the system due to human \b       processing errors. Accordingly, the \b       Company corrected amortization of the \b       related deferred revenue.               FY 2005                23,212 \b    (8)In our North America operation, a \b       subsidiary corrected its tax \b       calculation with regard to the \b       transfer of intellectual property \b       which took place in 2005.               FY 2005               284,830 \b    (9)In our North America operation, a \b       subsidiary immediately expensed \b       certain fixed assets with an \b       acquisition cost of less than USD \b       3,000 or a useful life of less than \b       2 years.

IGM's Mackenzie Financial Corp. unit purchased investment-manager Cundill in September. \u001d  Reucassel maintained his outperform rating on IGM, noting the company remains \"strategically well positioned in the Canadian mutual fund industry with multiple distribution capabilities, significant scale and a broad product offering that should generate reasonable net flows in most market environments.\" \u001d  The analyst added that IGM's financial condition is \"exceptional\" and said it's a \"prolific generator\" of free cash flow. \u001d  Reucassel did note that, although IGM's Investors Group division continues to demonstrate consistent fund performance, Mackenzie is facing some challenges in terms of net flows due to \"relatively weak\" performance. \u001d  Reucassel doesn't own shares in IGM and his firm doesn't have an investment-banking relationship with the company. \u001d  Separately, GMP Securities analyst Timothy Lazaris said in a research report that he increased his 2007 earnings estimate for IGM to C$3.17 a share from C$3.15 based on the strong fourth-quarter results, and introduced an estimate for 2008 earnings of C$3.50 a share. \u001d  Lazaris maintained his buy rating, but raised his target price to C$61 from C$56.50. He said he bases his buy recommendation on \"the total expected return and the fact that IGM is a safe way to invest in the mutual-fund sector.\" \u001d  IGM is down 13 Canadian cents to C$50.37 in Toronto Monday. \u001d  GMP doesn't have an investment-banking relationship with IGM and Lazaris doesn't own the stock. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.igmfinancial.com \b \u001d  -Judy McKinnon; 416-306-2100; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 11:39 ET (16:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d2c2c19cd4bdcc54d7b08c534200a62f","symR":["WLF.T","CA9777523023"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Wolfden Gets Non-Binding Letter Of Interest From Zinifex, Enters Into Exclusivity Agreement","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T14:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WLF.T","CA9777523023"],"IndustryCodes":["GLD","PCS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 09:08 ET (14:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d2e4fc0ec893cac703a58b685d9722d2","symR":["RR.LN","GB0032836487"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Rolls-Royce Awarded GBP45M Offshore Vessels Deal","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T09:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RR.LN","GB0032836487"],"IndustryCodes":["ARO","ASP","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 04:51 ET (09:51 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d3c8db2279148ac7f733f2cff77c4a00","symR":["12027.FR","BGAS.YY","MOL.BU","OMV.VI","TOT","AT0000743059","FR0000120271","HU0000068952"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"OMV: Steel Shortage May Delay Nabucco Pipeline - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T09:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12027.FR","BGAS.YY","MOL.BU","OMV.VI","TOT","AT0000743059","FR0000120271","HU0000068952"],"IndustryCodes":["GAS","OIL","PIP","STL","XATX","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  VIENNA (Dow Jones)--The current high demand for steel may delay the construction of the Nabucco pipeline, OMV executive board member Werner Auli told Austrian newspaper Der Standard in an interview published Monday. \u001d  \"We need 2.5 million metric tons of steel for the pipeline. Steel is in very strong demand at the moment, that could be a problem,\" Auli said, adding however that a one year delay wouldn't be a major concern. \u001d  Completion of the pipeline, which is to run from the southern part of Turkey to Austria and is aimed at reducing Europe's reliance on Russian gas, is scheduled for 2011. Even if this is missed, the maximum capacity of 31 billion cubic meters should still be reached in 2018 or 2019 as planned, Auli said. \u001d  Auli, who's responsible for OMV's gas division, added the Nabucco consortium, which consists of OMV, Hungary's MOL (MOL.BU), Turkey's Botas, Bulgarian Bulgargas and Romania's Transgaz SA Medias, expects to select a sixth partner company to help finance the project \"within the next months\". \u001d  Asked about a partner interest from Total SA (TOT), Auli said: \"Nothing has been decided. We have a shortlist, and the big Europeans are on it.\" \u001d  The consortium wishes to have 50% of the pipeline's transport capacity reserved for partner companies. Although this conflicts with the European Union's energy liberalization plan, it has been met by understanding by the E.U., Auli said. \u001d  \"We need a guarantee that the invested money can  earn itself back. Without this guarantee, the banks won't fork out any money.

Semiconductor maker Marvell Technology Group (MRVL, $21) has been the latter for the past year, as shareholders have punished it for a sales warning, questionable acquisition and stock-options investigation. Since January 2006, shares have tumbled from the mid$30s. But that dip -- okay, crater -- spells opportunity. Marvell is \"a growth company that had a hiccup,\" contends Bob Smith, manager of the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock fund. \u001d  Marvell's sales fell short when its customers -- which use Marvell's chips to power hard-disk drives -- found themselves with a surplus of chips. But the glut was part of a broader semiconductor slowdown, and many analysts expect sales to pick up soon. The launch of Microsoft's updated operating system, Windows Vista, could spur people to buy more computers, and thus chips. \"We're expecting a nice snapback,\" says Alex Gauna, an analyst at UBS. Plus, Marvell's purchase of Intel's  XScale business, which makes chips for cell phones and personal digital assistants, gives the company its first major entr&#233;e into the vast cellular market. \u001d  Granted, Marvell is still undergoing an investigation into the way it accounted for stock options. That will likely lead to an earnings restatement, but it shouldn't affect cash flow. Marvell's shares trade at 32 times expected earnings of 64 cents a share for its fiscal year ending in January 2008, which assumes that earnings growth has permanently slowed. T. Rowe's Smith sees profits rebounding and the stock potentially doubling in the next two years -- a trend that would turn this chip's blues into green. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:01 ET (11:01 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d4bfb199e1b49c9ac50e1eab7bb2eb9f","symR":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","DCX","DCX.XE","FNC.MI","DE0007100000","IT0003856405","NL0000235190"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"EADS Says Need Solution Quickly On Implementing Power 8","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T11:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5730.FR","ABI.YY","DCX","DCX.XE","FNC.MI","DE0007100000","IT0003856405","NL0000235190"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","ARO","ASP","AUT","DFN","XCA4","XDAX","XDJGI","XENX","XMDAX","XMIB","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:15 ET (11:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d4c56bef44addf01041abaf36fb3452f","symR":["D.UN.T","CA2652701087"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Dundee REIT February 2007 Monthly Distribution>D.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T15:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["D.UN.T","CA2652701087"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  TORONTO, ONTARIO--(CCNMatthews - Feb. 19, 2007) - DUNDEE REIT (TSX:D.UN) today announced a cash distribution of $0.183 per REIT Unit, Series A for the month of February.

(TSX:AMM)(AMEX:AAU) (\"Almaden\") is pleased to announce that it has optioned its wholly owned Yago gold-silver project in Mexico to Consolidated Spire Ventures Ltd. (TSX VENTURE:CZX) (\"Spire\"). Spire can earn a 60% interest from Almaden by spending US$3.5 M and by issuing Almaden 800,000 shares of Spire to Almaden over 5 years. Spire is committed to spend a minimum of US$250,000 in the first year and to issue 100,000 shares of Spire to Almaden upon regulatory approval of the agreement. J. Poliquin, president and CEO of Almaden commented that, \"We are very pleased to be working with Spire on this project which has the potential to host a significant gold-silver deposit.\" \b \bIN DEPTH: \b \bThe Yago project covers a large area of hydrothermal alteration characterised by acid-sulphate kaolinite-alunite alteration and spatially associated strataform replacement silica alteration. Both these styles of alteration occupy areas of relatively higher relief on the property and are interpreted to represent the original surface or paleo water table of the hydrothermal system. In areas of erosion beneath these styles of alteration, quartz veins are exposed that exhibit classic low-sulphidation epithermal textures such as banded and crustiform chalcedony and quartz crystallised from amorphous silica. The northern half of the Yago project is underlain by a series of at least five low-sulphidation epithermal veins named the La Sarda-San Juan, La Esperanza, La Magnolia, La Cucaracha and El Dragon. These structures are sub-parallel, southwest-dipping quartz-adularia veins that occur over an area of 1500 by 1200 metres. There has been limited production from each of these veins, but the majority of production has been from the La Sarda-San Juan vein. Based on fluid inclusion analyses, alteration mineralogy and geochemical data gathered the veins identified are interpreted to represent a very shallowly eroded epithermal gold-silver system. An IP geophysical survey has been carried out over this part of the property. This survey was particularly effective in delineating these structures as resistivity highs and extended the potential strike length of the La Sarda-San Juan Vein by 260 metres to the northeast. The resistivity high representing the vein extended to the northern boundary of the IP survey area. Subsequent prospecting identified banded chalcedonic quartz veining 550 metres northwest of the La Sarda-San Juan Vein workings. \b \bMorgan Poliquin, M.Sc., P.Eng. is the qualified person, under the meaning of National Instrument 43-101, and a director of Almaden, has reviewed the technical aspects of this news release.

We think that the more speculative element of our client base are long dollars, and further disappointment on the economic front will contribute to disproportionate weakness in the dollar,\" said Ashley Davies, a senior currency strategist with UBS in Singapore. \u001d  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke helped to provide a certain amount of help for the U.S. currency when he expressed his concern about lingering inflation pressures in this testimony to Congress last week. \u001d  But, as a central banker, Bernanke's caution on price pressures could well be seen as predictable, despite other signs from economic data - including soft industrial production and retail sales last week - that the U.S. economy is not quite as robust as it once was. \u001d  Hans Redeker, head of global foreign exchange strategy at BNP Paribas in London, notes that apart from disappointment on the economic side, the dollar faces the negative flows suggested by the latest Treasury international capital data. \u001d  These numbers last Thursday showed that the net inflow into the U.S. economy amounted to only $15.6 billion in December, a far cry from the $60 billion that had been expected, or the amount needed to cover the $61.2 billion trade gap the U.S. clocked up that month. \u001d  Although these structural concerns remain in the background for now, a similarly small inflow in January could well trigger a more violent reaction from the dollar, analysts warn. \u001d  Given these pressures, Redeker not only expects the dollar to extend its recent pullback all the way down to Y118.50 support, he is also looking for the euro to break through recent stiff resistance at $1.3180, opening up the potential for a climb to $1.3295 and then back up to the recent high at $1.3365. \u001d  David Woo, chief currency strategist with Barclays Capital in London, also feels that balance of payments concerns alone are enough to start downgrading the dollar's prospects. He has raised the bank's forecast for the euro over the one- to three-month horizon up to $1.32 from $1.30. \u001d  In the case of the yen, few actually see a serious reversal in carry trades - in which the yen is sold against higher-yielding currencies - even if the Bank of Japan surprises the market with a rate hike this Wednesday. \u001d  However, recent capital flow figures from the Ministry of Finance in Tokyo show that there could be a yen-positive trend developing. \u001d  For the second week in a row, Japanese investors repatriated large chunks of their overseas fixed income holdings, with last week's alone amounting to over Y380 billion. \u001d  \"The repatriation of fixed income capital this past fortnight has been by far the largest seen since last September,\" said Neil Mellor, a senior currency strategist with Bank of New York in London. \u001d  \"Two weeks worth of data do not a trend make, but in view of recent developments pertaining to U.S. and Japanese monetary policy, the data are a potential harbinger of what is to come,\" Mellor added. \u001d  He is among those who feels that Bernanke's testimony last week was evidence that U.S. interest rates have now peaked. At the same time, confidence is growing Japan is about to resume hiking rates - as early as this Wednesday. \u001d  However, not all are prepared to part with their bullish scenarios for the dollar just yet. A survey by BNP Paribas and I&PE Investment Managers of fund managers shows a marked increase in their appetite for the U.S. currency. \u001d  \"There has been a sharp improvement in sentiment towards the dollar in the February survey following the more bearish expectations that were expressed in the previous few months,\" the survey concluded. \u001d  Early Monday in Europe, the dollar was mixed as investors jockeyed to adjust their positions ahead of the Bank of Japan rate announcement Wednesday. Many fear that a decision to hike rates could trigger a sharp unwinding in carry trades. \u001d  In the meantime, dollar sentiment wasn't being helped by last Friday's data showing that U.S. housing starts fell 14.3% last month and that the University of Michigan's latest consumer confidence survey put the main sentiment index down at 93.3 this month. This compares with the 96.0 consensus forecast and is well below January's 96.9. \u001d  By 0745 GMT, the dollar was up at Y119.45 from Y119.33 late Friday in New York, according to EBS. The euro was up at $1.3149 from $1.3134. \b \u001d  Bloomberg TNI FRX POV \b   Reuters   USD/DJ \b   Thomson   P/1066 or P/1074 \u001d  (Nick Hastings has covered the foreign exchange markets and industry for over 15 years.

For those who do slip into the plastic clog-like shoes made by Crocs or the roller-skate shoes by Heelys, that advice may be best ignored. \u001d  The two footwear companies were spectacularly received in the public markets in recent IPOs. Shares of Crocs (CROX, $48) have more than doubled since the company's IPO, at $21, in February 2006. Much like Birkenstocks or Uggs before them, the colorful shoes (called \"molded footwear\" by Wall Street) are unattractive but comfortable. They look like they belong in the garden but are seen more often on the streets of SoHo as well as on the feet of nurses and doctors in hospitals. But is a comfortable shoe enough to justify a long-term investment? \"It's a cult stock,\" says Ivan Feinseith, director of research for investment firm Matrix USA, who has a sell rating on the shares. A company spokesperson declined to comment, but Crocs insiders seem all too aware of that phenomenon -- CEO Ron Snyder has reaped nearly $50 million by selling shares since the IPO. \u001d  Investing in Heelys (HLYS, $32), believe it or not, is even harder to defend. The company saw its shares jump 55 percent in their debut this past December. The market for the wheel-heeled shoes is preteen boys, a notoriously fickle group, points out John Shanley, footwear analyst for the brokerage Susquehanna International Group. The company derives a whopping 99 percent of its revenue from  sales of the roller shoes, which are increasingly being banned in public places like malls for their obvious safety risks. And knockoffs of the product are a tempting alternative for parents, given the $70 to $90 price tag of Heelys. \u001d  So before you invest in the latest footwear fads, clean out your closet full of Razor Scooters, Rollerblades, Tevas, platform shoes, Vans and Dr. Scholl's, and consider putting your money elsewhere. Sometimes it's best just to wear your favorite brands, not invest in them. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:00 ET (11:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"deb2c434d4895e70424faa5fae157458","symR":["BEI.UN.T","CA0966311064"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Boardwalk Tgt Upped To C$46 From C$38 By BMO >BEI.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T15:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BEI.UN.T","CA0966311064"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 10:16 ET (15:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"deda7ca4820be6c28739cbff6be77f6b","symR":["NIF.UN.T","CA6554321027"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Noranda Income Fund Reports 2006 Earnings Of C$33.2M, 4Q Earnings Of C$4M And Feb Monthly Distrib Of C$0.085/Unit>NIF.UN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T18:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NIF.UN.T","CA6554321027"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 13:25 ET (18:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"deea538f1e05c94ed6d03ced464476f6","symR":["RBA","RBA.T","CA7677441056"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Ritchie Bros.

Last November it raised a further EUR377 million to part-finance its Revios purchase. Since the last market call, French mutual insurer Groupama sold most of its 16% stake and is unlikely to come back for more. \u001d  That said, putting Scor and Converium together isn't devoid of logic. \u001d  A merger would give Scor a more even split between potentially volatile non-life business and its more predictable life-reinsurance activities. \u001d  Scor's property and casualty revenues grew 10% in 2006, at the bottom of the company's forecast range. The upshot was that life reinsurance counted for more than 60% of premiums, hence the argument for rebalancing the business through an acquisition. \u001d  On paper, if you leave execution issues and the lack of good cultural fit between the companies to one side, there should be synergies to be had. \u001d  If the merged company was able to save around 30% of combined non-life operating costs and Converium's head office expenses, you're looking at around CHF5 a share in synergies - taxed and capitalized - for Converium shareholders. \u001d  That's fully reflected in the value of Scor's bid if you take the CHF16 at which Converium shares traded for much of the fourth quarter before merger speculation took hold. \u001d  Even so, Scor's claim that tying up with Converium has a strong rationale will have to be backed with some solid figures of its own if the company wants to persuade its shareholders to buy in. \u001d  If not, Scor will have tied up EUR550 million worth of capital in a 33% non-controlling stake in Converium without the means to buy more. That possibly leaves it vulnerable to a takeover bid. \b \u001d  (Digby Larner, a reporter since 1988, has covered business and finance from London and Paris, reporting for Dow Jones Newswires since the start of 2004.

(NXST) and other local TV companies are strutting like Best in Show winners. \u001d  Stocks of Nexstar, Lin TV Corp. (TVL), Young Broadcasting Inc. (YBTVA), Sinclair Broadcasting Group Inc. (SBGI) have climbed by 50% or better since last fall, as broadcasters squeeze cash from cable companies to carry the local stations on which Americans watch the majority of their television. \u001d  Nexstar has gotten credit for leading the crusade over the so-called retransmission fees, showering attention on the operator of 49 television stations in smaller markets like Erie, Pa., and Lubbock, Texas. In response, Nexstar's stock price has doubled since hitting a low of $3.50 in Oct. 24. \u001d  Shares traded recently at $7.44, down 5 cents, after earlier matching the 52-week high of $7.49. and the question for investors is whether shares have become overheated in the enthusiasm. Nexstar bulls say the market hasn't yet recognized Nexstar's other industry-leading positions: the company has pioneered the ownership of two television stations in the same market and by transforming its stations into TV-and-online machines, while much of the industry just starts to wake up to the Web. \u001d  To be sure, burgeoning revenue streams can't mask worries about an industry losing its privileged market position to the Internet and other media. Nexstar's uncomfortable debt load and low share float also makes any share swings - either up or down - magnified. \u001d  But local TV's believers are throwing their hat in with Nexstar, and retransmission fees are a key to growth at the Irving, Texas, company. \u001d  In 2005, Nexstar was among the first companies to stare down the cable operators over retransmission fees. In the fight, Nexstar pulled its networks from Cox Communications Inc. and Cable One Inc. in Missouri and other Nexstar markets, in some cases for nearly a year. \u001d  The cable networks eventually relented. From practically zero, Bear Stearns analyst Victor Miller estimates Nexstar ultimately could add $30 million - or about 11% of the company's estimated 2006 revenue - to its annual coffers from retransmission fees, which are essentially all profit. \u001d  \"All else being equal, one should pay a higher multiple for those cash flows than from traditional advertising,\" said Jim Bell, a portfolio manager at Liberty Ridge Capital who oversees $1.4 million in Nexstar stock. \u001d  In addition, one of Nexstar's best assets is its expertise in so-called virtual duopolies. In a legal skirting of regulations blocking ownership of more than one TV station in small towns, more than two-thirds of Nexstar's revenue comes from 17 markets in which the company operates two stations through agreements with an independent entity. \u001d  \"Perry Sook has done a very smart thing,\" said Elliot Evers of Media Venture Partners, referring to Nexstar's well respected chief executive. The duopoly condition gives Nexstar the market dominance to dictate ad prices and save money on sales staff and other operating expenses. \u001d  As traditional media struggles with the online shift of ad dollars and consumers, Nexstar also has been leading the charge into the Internet. \u001d  Less than a year ago, Nexstar lured Rajiv Lulla, a former Web guru at Viacom Inc.'s (VIA) MTV, to transform the company's online strategy. Starting last fall, eight Nexstar stations so far have beefed up their Web sites to carry more video content from the TV stations - especially local news - and sell advertising around it. \u001d  The company expects to convert the rest of its station group by this summer. So far, Lulla said, \"Every single station is exceeding the best market that I could have imagined eight months ago. \u001d  The strategy pits Nexstar directly against local newspapers and Internet giants such as Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) and Google Inc. (GOOG), who are starting to compete fiercely for local ad dollars. But Sook, Nexstar's chief executive, says Nexstar has a leg up on its rivals thanks to an established relationship with local advertisers and TV viewers. \"Google and Yahoo would love to have the local presence we have,\" Sook said. \u001d  Despite Nexstar's advantages, there are points of concern. Nexstar share price has climbed about 70% in the last year, but hasn't approached the November 2003 IPO price of $14. \u001d  \"There are some good things going on in the industry,\" said Evers. \"Does Nexstar have a likelihood of passing beyond the peer group? I think not.\" \u001d  One problem is the inexorable decline in market share for local advertising dollars, which the affiliates rely on for the bulk of its revenue. Meanwhile, Nexstar's debt stands out, even in a leveraged industry. \u001d  The company's total debt stood at about $640 million at Sept. 30, and although Nexstar has pledged to sell assets to reudce debt, it hasn't done so yet. Nexstar has said it is committed to tidying its balance sheet and expects to end the year leveraged under 7.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. The debt of the local TV group ranges from about 3 to 8 times Ebtida. \u001d  Despite worries, Nexstar could still be undervalued. Private-equity money is flowing into local TV, creating a floor on shares above where Nexstar and other public operators are trading. \u001d  Miller recently estimated Nexstar is valued at about 10.1 times estimated 2007 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, while private equity recently acquired TV stations from New York Times Co. (NYT) and CBS Corp. (CBS) for an estimated 13 to 15 times Ebitda. \u001d  \"I think you could still see some expansion in the equity,\" Bell said. Assuming things stay pretty favorable in terms for their results and economic conditions, he said, \"Another couple of dollars [a share] wouldn't surprise me.\" \u001d  (Shira Ovide covers the media and marketing industries for Dow Jones Newswires.) \u001d  -By Shira Ovide, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5287; shira.ovide@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"dfaefa3f7e03b666c5e3353d1cd08456","symR":["WAG"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Walgreen Co.

(AP)--New Jersey's gambling mecca will soon be more easily accessible by rail - but not if you live in New Jersey. \u001d  The 2 1/2-hour express train service from New York to Atlantic City, scheduled to begin in late 2007 or early 2008, has no planned stops here. \u001d  Details are being finalized for the new service, dubbed \"ACES\" for Atlantic City Express Service. But in the current scenario, the trains would run nonstop from New York to just north of Philadelphia, then head east and continue nonstop to Atlantic City. \u001d  Auggie Cipollini, senior vice president and chief administrative officer of the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, said a stop in New Jersey is still possible. \u001d  \"We're still open to it,\" Cipollini said. \"It's something we're going to have to partner with NJ Transit to see whether or not that's feasible.\" \u001d  The casinos are making the decisions because they are paying for the new train service. A joint venture involving the Borgata, Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino and Harrah's Atlantic City is buying eight double-level cars for approximately $15 million, and the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority will lease four locomotives for another $4.5 million. \u001d  The casinos want to penetrate the New York City market, specifically 20- and 30-somethings with disposable income who may have balked in the past at the idea of riding a bus to Atlantic City. \u001d  Under the current proposal, the service would operate on the weekends, with two departures planned from New York on Friday and one from Atlantic City. Four trains would leave from each destination on Saturday and three would depart Atlantic City on Sunday. \u001d  Fares have not been finalized, according to Cipollini, but he said they will be competitive with Amtrak's Acela service between New York and Philadelphia, which currently costs between $76 and $112 each way. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e32d91db674273d602767768ba167c8e","symR":["SVY.T","CA8046941073"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Savanna Energy Acquires Well Servicing And Rental Businesses>SVY.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T13:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SVY.T","CA8046941073"],"IndustryCodes":["DRL","OIE","XDJGI","XISL","XTSE"],"Story":"\u001d  CALGARY, Feb. 19 /CNW/ - Savanna Energy Services Corp.

The Savanna common shares issued pursuant to the transaction will be placed in escrow and released over a 3-year period. \b \bThe combined acquisitions include 20 service rigs plus associated field locations, boilers and support equipment, as well as 1 additional service rig under construction. The acquisition increases Savanna's current well servicing fleet by 83% to 44 rigs. \b \bThe operational focus for the purchased equipment is primarily in east central Alberta and west central Saskatchewan, areas in which Savanna does not currently operate. The majority of the fleet of service rigs was built in the last 4 years, and the purchase includes a manufacturing, maintenance and repair facility and personnel that will be used to support the entire go-forward Savanna well-servicing fleet. \b \bAll of the principles have agreed to remain with Savanna in their present roles, and all have executed independent three year employment and non-competition agreements. \b \bBased on normalized 2006 estimated results, the acquisition is valued at less than 4 times earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"). \b \bPost this transaction, Savanna's well servicing fleet will consist of 44 rigs, with 8 rigs scheduled for manufacture and delivery in 2007. \b \bThis transaction reinforces Savanna's growing position in the well servicing market in a production-oriented area of the basin, and adds significant additional scale to the core well servicing business to complement Savanna's strong existing drilling presence. \b \bSavanna Energy Services Corp. is a leading North American contract drilling and oilfield services company providing a broad range of drilling, well servicing and related services with a focus on fit for purpose technologies for the North American market and industry-leading aboriginal relationships. Post this transaction Savanna will operate 87 drilling rigs, 44 well servicing rigs and 8 coil service units in Canada and the United States. \b \bThis Report contains forward looking statements which reflect management's expectations regarding the Company's future growth, results of operations, performance and business prospects and opportunities.

McMinnville and Wilsonville to join other Oregon Communities Getting Company's Industry-Leading Fiber-to-the-Premises Network \b \b \u001d  BEAVERTON, Ore., Feb. 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Editors are advised this is a corrected version of the release issued earlier today.  Some of the pricing in the original release was inaccurate.  Complete, corrected release follows: \b \u001d  Internet users in Washington, Clackamas, Multnomah and Yamhill counties will soon be able to subscribe to state-of-the-art broadband service from Verizon, the company that is building the nation's most advanced digital all- fiber-optic network.  On Monday (Feb. 19) Verizon announced plans to deploy the advanced fiber-optic technology all the way to customers' homes and businesses in those four counties. \b \u001d  The company said it will extend its fiber-to-the premises (FTTP) network this year to the communities of Forest Grove, McMinnville and Wilsonville. It also will continue its network expansion in the Beaverton, Sherwood and Tualatin areas of Washington County, and the east Multnomah communities of Gresham, Troutdale, Fairview and Wood Village. \b \u001d  A total of 59,000 additional homes will be connected to the FTTP network, which offers the fastest data speeds available to homeowners and small businesses and is capable of offering TV services in the future.  Below are the number of households in each community that will be added to the network: \b \b \b    Community            Households \b    Forest Grove            9,600 \b    Gresham Area           15,700 \b    McMinnville             5,000 \b    Wilsonville             4,300 \b    Beaverton              14,700 \b    Sherwood                2,500 \b    Tualatin                6,000 \b    Unincorporated          1,200 \b \b \u001d  The network uses hair-thin strands of fiber and optical electronics to directly link homes and businesses to Verizon's network and replaces the traditional copper-wire connections for voice, high-speed Internet and TV. \b \u001d  \"The FTTP project already has had a positive impact on the local economy, creating new jobs,\" said David S. Valdez, the company's vice president for the Northwest.  \"We've employed hundreds of contractors to build the network; and we've hired more than 300 new Verizon employees over the past two years to design the network, install our FiOS broadband and voice services, and provide technical support to our customers. \b \u001d  \"More importantly, however, Verizon is offering consumers a choice by providing the best network available at a competitive price for voice, data and, eventually, TV,\" he added.  Recently, the Metropolitan Area Communications Commission board of directors recommended adoption of a video franchise agreement for Verizon to provide its FiOS TV service to Washington County communities. \b \u001d  Verizon expects to install more than 5 million feet of fiber-optic cabling throughout the Portland metro area by year-end 2007, bringing to 211,000 the total number of homes and small businesses in the area that will be linked to the new network. \b \u001d  More than 6 million homes and businesses in parts of 16 states are now passed by Verizon's all-fiber network, and the company expects its new network to pass about 18 million premises by the end of 2010.  Verizon had 687,000 FiOS (FYE'-ose) Internet customers and 207,000 FiOS TV customers by year-end 2006. \b \u001d  FiOS Internet service is offered in more than 1,600 communities in the 16 states where the company's new network is deployed: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia and Washington.  The company currently offers FiOS TV service in parts of ten states: California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. \b \u001d  Fiber offers tremendous advantages to network operators, in addition to new and superior services for customers.  For example, fiber offers reliable service in stretches of wet weather that can affect copper-based networks. \b \u001d  \"Verizon's 100 percent fiber-optic network is technically superior to other communication platforms because it offers faster data speeds than those currently available, as well as voice and video capabilities,\" said Vickie Curry, Verizon's director of customer operations in the Northwest. \"This new network will have greater reliability and lower maintenance costs. By deploying fiber to homes and businesses in our territory, Verizon is transforming its wireline business into 21st century technology.\" \b \b          Customer Feedback About Verizon Fiber Service Is Positive \b \u001d  Customer reaction to Verizon's FiOS service has been very positive, with broadband subscribers rapidly increasing in markets across the country. Verizon will notify customers in Washington when FiOS is available locally. \b \u001d  \"FiOS has been an extraordinary hit with our customers,\" said Curry. \"People are literally lining up to get what they know is a fantastic service at an excellent price. The need for speed and ability to take advantage of bandwidth-intensive applications remain a top priority for all computer users.\" \b \u001d  There are three tiers of Verizon FiOS Internet service for consumers, with downstream (download) speeds of up to 5, 15, and 30 Mbps (megabits per second)*: \b \b \b    -- 5 Mbps downstream and 2 Mbps upstream. Suited for Internet surfing and \b       basic computer functions. $39.99 a month. \b \b    -- 15 Mbps downstream and 2 Mbps upstream. Appealing to families that have \b       multiple computers and various needs such as media downloads and the \b       ability to access or share large files. $49.99 a month. \b \b    -- 30 Mbps downstream and 5 Mbps upstream. Designed for communications- \b       intensive power users with significant bandwidth needs, such as \b       telecommuters or work-at-home households and avid online gamers. \b       $179.95 a month with a one-year agreement. \b \b \u001d  Each consumer data offer includes: state-of-the-art, wireless broadband home router; Verizon's Surround entertainment portal optimized for high-speed access featuring news, games, streaming video and more; virtually unlimited 2 GB (gigabytes) of e-mail capacity with up to 9 e-mail accounts; 24/7 live technical support; and 30-day money-back guarantee. \b \u001d  The FTTP initiative represents a natural extension of the more than 10 million miles of fiber-optic cable Verizon already has in place and extends the high capacity, speed and quality of fiber directly to the customer's doorstep.  With FTTP technology, Verizon can easily add more capacity, higher speeds or video services in the future. \b \u001d  Verizon's digital subscriber line (DSL) service will remain the company's most widely available form of high-speed Internet access for the foreseeable future while the company ramps up FTTP deployment.  The company offers DSL on a widespread basis throughout Oregon over existing copper lines at speeds of up to 3 Mbps. \b \b    *NOTE: Actual (throughput) speeds will vary. \b \u001d  Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), headquartered in New York, is a leader in delivering broadband and other wireline and wireless communication innovations to mass market, business, government and wholesale customers. Verizon Wireless operates America's most reliable wireless network, serving more than 59 million customers nationwide.

Why the rebound is for  real this time, and how to play it: five stocks and two funds.] \b \u001d  It was March 2000, and Richard Parower had just taken a job as a technology analyst for Seligman funds. Little did he know that his universe was about to implode. Over the next two years, tech stocks went nowhere but down, and assets in the Seligman Global Technology fund fell to $377 million from $1.2 billion at the height of the boom. \"It was a very painful period,\" he says. \"There was no way to know when it was going to stop.\" Parower stuck it out, however, taking over as coman-ager of the fund in 2002. And coming off last year's 18.6 percent return, he says he's finally getting over the shell shock of the tech bust. \u001d  After seven long years, investors are finally dipping their toes back into tech. Shares of technology bellwethers like Microsoft and Cisco Systems shot up more than 30 percent in the final months of 2006, after years in the doghouse. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, which fell 17 percent in a selloff last spring, staged a rebound to close out 2006 up 10 percent. Savvy investors believe this could just be the start, thanks to a confluence of factors, including the sluggish economy and slowing corporate profit growth. \"You combat a slowdown by increasing your efficiencies and productivity,\" says Brian Belski, chief U.S. sector strategist for Merrill Lynch. \"You do that by investing in technology.\" Indeed, the New York Stock Exchange found in its annual survey of chief executives that more than three in five expect to increase corporate IT spending in 2007. \u001d  Other catalysts bode well for the sector. Microsoft is finally rolling out Vista, its first new operating system in more than five years, and both hardware and software analysts expect the release will unlock some of the corporate tech dollars that have been pent up in anticipation of its unveiling. And remember the vast investment in servers and storage in advance of Y2K? Much of that equipment is due for an upgrade, notes David Bianco, chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS. Even the weak dollar works to tech's advantage. Semiconductor giant Intel, for example, derives 85 percent of its revenue from overseas. The more the dollar falls, the cheaper it is for foreign firms to buy U.S. goods. \u001d  To be sure, investing in tech stocks requires a high tolerance for volatility. Recently, the group got clobbered by (and has since bounced back from) the options-backdating scandals. Another common hazard: The price for tech goods is constantly falling, so companies have to sell increasingly more stuff just to stay even. Nor is there a consensus on Wall Street that tech spending is on the rise. While Merrill Lynch expects it to accelerate, Goldman Sachs is predicting that IT spending growth will slow. \u001d  One thing not in dispute: Large-cap tech stocks tend to be debt free, and many generate growing piles of cash. According to Standard & Poor's, earnings for the tech sector are expected to grow more than 21 percent this year, while the forecast for the overall market is less than 10 percent. Nor is tech tied to the slowing U.S. economy. \"We're still very early on in global Internet- penetration rates,\" says Larry Puglia, who manages the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth fund. And expanding Internet access around the globe creates demand for more software, chips, servers and networking equipment. \u001d  To find the five stocks in our tech portfolio, we polled money managers and analysts and probed the various sectors within the group, from software and semiconductors to hardware and networking equipment. And because we wanted a diverse group of undervalued companies with strong fundamentals and growth prospects, we stayed away from the tech stars of 2006, including Cisco, Apple and Google, focusing instead on unloved stocks that we think have more upside potential. \b \u001d  Intel (INTC, $21) \u001d  CHIPMAKER INTEL IS like a heavyweight-boxing champ in the sixth round against an opponent who was supposed to go down with the first punch. The competitor in Intel's case is Advanced Micro Devices, and although the match has been bloody at times, it's far from over. Intel had long dominated the market for microprocessors, until AMD beat it to market with a series of chips starting in 2003 that were widely considered superior to Intel's offerings. After losing market share, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based firm slashed prices to reduce its bloated inventory; it also cut costs by $2 billion, selling off underperforming businesses and scaling back its workforce. \u001d  The result is a leaner organization with renewed drive. Indeed, late last year the firm regained an edge over AMD with the release of a faster chip for desktop computers. Nevertheless, the company's woes  have kept its stock mired in the low $20s for the past year. Analysts expect Intel to earn $6.4 billion, or $1.09 a share, this year on revenue of $38.1 billion, giving the company a forward P/E of 19, which is well below the semiconductor industry's forward P/E of 25. \"They've really been focused on margin recovery,\" says Dan Genter, president of money-management firm RNC Genter. \"We like it at the current price.\" He's not alone. Banc of America Securities analyst Sumit Dhanda recently raised his 12-month target price to $28, up 33 percent from where it trades today. \b \u001d  F5 Networks (FFIV, $79) \u001d  \"SERVER TOO BUSY.\" Those three little words may be frustrating for Internet users, but for the Web sites, an unavailable page translates into lost revenue. A site's information lives on a cluster of servers; each time you click on a link, your request is routed to one of them. Congestion happens when too many requests are routed to a single server. That's where F5 comes in. The company's networking software balances the load between servers-no small job considering that some of its clients (think Microsoft and Bank of America) have 10,000 servers or more. \u001d  The stock chart for the Seattle-based company looks like a snapshot of the dotcom era. The company's shares came public in 1999 at $10 and quickly shot to $156, before crashing back down to $4. But unlike many of the dot-com darlings, F5 not only survived, but grew into a very profitable business. This year F5 is expected to earn $86 million, or $2.54 a share, on revenue of $507 million. That's not to say there haven't been problems. Last year F5 got caught up in the options-back-dating scandal and came within a stone's throw of being delisted from the Nasdaq. But Susan Kalla, an independent portfolio manager who has followed the networking sector for more than a decade, likes F5's ability to maintain predictable margins and generate cash. \"It's a hyper growth company with not much competition,\" she says. And as a pure play -- most of its competitors have been bought by the likes of Cisco and Juniper Networks -- F5 has a leg up on the big guys in terms of innovation. \u001d  Troy Jensen, networking analyst for Piper Jaffray, is equally enthusiastic. He expects the company's revenue and earnings to grow at 30 percent a year for the next three years; his 12-month price target is $100. \b \u001d  EMC (EMC, $14) \u001d  OVER THE PAST THREE years, data-storage firm EMC has spent more than $6 billion gobbling up 21 smaller companies in the data-management business, including RSA Security and Documentum. And throughout that time, the Hopkinton, Mass.-based firm has been in a perpetual state of restructuring, shedding staff in some areas while continuing to hire in others. The new streamlined EMC, which should earn $1.4 billion, or 63 cents a share, on revenue of $12.6 billion this year, bills itself as more than just a data-storage company. It promises to help companies secure, sort and manage data as well as store it. The shift includes greater emphasis on software sales, which have the added benefit of producing  higher margins than its hardware offerings. \u001d  Today EMC, which has seen its shares bounce between $10 and $15 for the past three years, looks primed for gains. Parower of the Seligman Funds likes the fact that the company \"still has a pile of cash\" after all of its acquisitions. (EMC took on $2.2 billion in debt to finance the RSA purchase, but with its $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, it has a comfortable cushion.) Another convert to the stock, UBS hardware analyst Benjamin Reitzes, recently upgraded the shares, concluding that its three-year strategy should start paying off in earnest. Though the stock trades at a pricey 22 times estimated 2007 earnings estimates, those earnings are expected to grow by 21 percent a year for the next five years, according to Zacks's poll of Wall Street analysts. \b \u001d  Autodesk (ADSK, $44) \u001d  IN EMERGING MARKETS, the pipes are being laid, and the streets are being paved. In the U.S., our skylines are being redrawn, and landscaped office parks populate the suburbs. All of which plays to the strength of software maker Autodesk. The San Rafael, Calif.-based firm makes computer-aided design software, which is used by designers and engineers to create plans for everything from skyscrapers and sewers to espresso makers and auto assembly-line machines. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:03 ET (11:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e463a40aeca3e08ca16c6a1a37f3e633","symR":["12027.FR","RDSA","RDSA.LN","RDSB","RDSB.LN","TOT","XOM","FR0000120271","GB00B03MLX29","GB00B03MM408","US30231G1022"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"THE SKEPTIC: Giving Total A Royal Bashing","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T06:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12027.FR","RDSA","RDSA.LN","RDSB","RDSB.LN","TOT","XOM","FR0000120271","GB00B03MLX29","GB00B03MM408","US30231G1022"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XAEX","XCA4","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (This story was originally published Friday) \b \b   By Anne-Sylvaine Chassany \b   A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN \b \u001d  PARIS (Dow Jones)--Bashing oil producer Total isn't new in France. \u001d  But it's reached new heights ahead of the upcoming presidential elections in May. \u001d  It has its roots in a long-held tradition in France of distrusting, if not despising, large privately-held companies - particularly if they make a profit. \u001d  Perverse as that sounds in the 21st Century, French Socialist presidential candidate Segolene Royal has taken to this old habit with gusto. \u001d  France's largest company by market value is making too much money and should be punished for it, Royal says. If she wins, she would force the oil major to share its \"insulting\", \"incredible\" profits, through a special windfall tax, she says. \u001d  The attack underscores the populist side to Royal, as well as her ignorance on business matters, to say nothing of poor math. \u001d  First, raising taxes on Total would have little impact on the French government's budget. \u001d  French corporate levy - at 33.33% of taxable profit- is levied on profits generated by a company's operations in the country. \u001d  Unfortunately for Royal, Total is a global business. And there's not much crude oil to be found in France. The company makes only 5% to 6% of its profit at home, through refining, marketing and chemicals units. \u001d  Total's pretax profit in France was around EUR1.6 billion in 2006, according to the company's Chairman Thierry Desmarest, a small fraction of the EUR24 billion pretax profit reported by the company Wednesday. \u001d  Indeed, Royal's super-tax would miss the bulk of Total's profits from its thriving exploration and production activities, but add to the current difficulties at the company's low-margin operations in France - hardly good for jobs or future investment. \u001d  She's clearly not asked herself the question why Total's main rivals Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil are exiting the French refining sector. It's unlikely to be because the business is flourishing. \u001d  Royal's attacks against Total may simply end up giving ideas to those who can legitimately demand a piece of Total's oil wealth: the oil-and-gas producing countries. \u001d  Like its peers, Total is already facing nationalist pressure in those countries keen to gain more control over their domestic resources amid high hydrocarbon prices. \u001d  In Venezuela, the French oil major is trying to prevent the government from nationalizing its heavy oil Sincor project in the Orinoco Valley. It had to negotiate new contract terms with Bolivia and is facing constant criticism from the Russian government on the way it operates a small oil field in the Nenets region. \u001d  The pressure is visible in Total's tax bill. The company paid EUR13.7 billion taxes in 2006. The effective tax rate in the upstream division increased to 62.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006, from 59.4% on average in 2005. \u001d  The citizens of Venezuela and other oil-producing countries might be better off as a result of that, but you can be sure it's had no impact on France. French investors have nonetheless stand to share some of the EUR4 billion in dividends Total plans to pay out of its 2006 earnings. \u001d  Of course, higher foreign taxes are weighing on the prospects of a French company that's a testament to the success of French multinationals in recent years - something you would have thought an economic patriot like Royal should be celebrating, not sanctioning. \b \u001d   (Anne-Sylvaine Chassany has financial news reporter since 2001.

(FPL.LN) Monday announced that the Algerian government has approved its $1.3 billion MLE oil and gas field development plan on Block 405b in the Berkine Basin. \u001d  First Calgary obtained the block in 2001, and the approval marks a milestone for planned commercialization of the project, Chief Financial Officer John van der Welle said. \u001d  \"This is only the first stage, with considerable potential for the entire block,\" van der Welle said. \u001d  At 1104 GMT, First Calgary shares were up 1.74%, or 5 pence, at 292.5 pence. \u001d  First Calgary will fund 75% of the development costs, with its partner Sonatrach, an Algerian government-owned company, picking up the remaining 25%. \u001d  First Calgary will only take 27.7% of profits, however, with Sonatrach taking the rest once the project comes on stream in late 2009. \u001d  \"It is all about the value of the project and the costs related to revenue,\" van der Welle said. \u001d  However, concerns arose regarding an upcoming windfall tax. Tony Alves, analyst at KBC Peel Hunt, said, \"We have not yet taken this into account in our economics. It will clearly reduce the value.\" \u001d  Van der Welle said, \"We won't be paying any taxes other than a one-off 5% tax, which will not come into effect until we start production.\" \u001d  This 5% rate applies to First Calgary's production share of 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or less. It rises in steps to a maximum of 50%, however, if the company's production share exceeds 100,000 boe/d. However the total period of time over which the tax will be applied is still being decided upon, a spokesman for First Calgary said. \u001d  In December, the Algerian government published a further decree to the initial windfall tax announcement, which said the new tax would apply when the monthly average Brent oil price exceeds $30 per barrel. \u001d  The cost of development, which includes an expanded gas plant capacity to treat up to 460 million cubic feet of raw gas per day and field gathering facilities, will be incurred between 2007 and 2009. \u001d  The company estimates that these facilities will process 230 million cubic feet of raw gas per day on a gross basis and associated natural gas liquids and oil. As part of an agreement signed in November 2006, Sonatrach will market the total natural gas production from Block 405b. \u001d  There are no commercial arrangements on the sale of liquid gas production, though First Calgary said it will sell its share at world market prices. \u001d  The company estimates initial gross MLE field reserves to be developed and recovered to be 1.3 trillion cubic feet of gas equivalent reserves, or approximately 230 million boe. \u001d  This is compared to estimates of 3.9 trillion cubic feet of 2P, or probable gas equivalent reserves, estimated for the entire Block 405b as at Dec. 31, 2005. \u001d  In 2006, the company asked petroleum consultants DeGolyer & MacNaughton to conduct a review with findings expected to be released in March. \u001d  Dry gas and liquids, or oil, condensates and liquefied petroleum gas will each represent 50% of total MLE production revenues. \u001d  First Calgary expects to produce 200 million cubic feet per day of dry gas at the MLE field in the first 10 years, along with liquids of 21,000 barrels per day. \u001d  The plant, production and field gathering facilities will expand to accommodate any additional production, of up to 400 million cubic feet per day of dry gas and associated natural gas liquids and oil. \u001d  KBC Peel Hunt's Alves said, \"The development approval is clearly a milestone for the project and the company but only serves to highlight once again that the shares are seriously overvalued.\"  He has a sell rating on the company. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.fcpl.ca. \b \u001d  -By Kaveri Niththyananthan, Dow Jones Newswires; 4420 7842 9299; kaveri.niththyananthan@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:44 ET (11:44 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e6b6c6cab4ddc1b80f10e592634c3c5d","symR":["LMC","LUN.T","CA5503721063"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Lundin Mining Informs On The Accident In The Galmoy Mine In Ireland>LUN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T11:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LMC","LUN.T","CA5503721063"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI","XISL","XSXA","XTSE"],"Story":"\b   VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(CCNMatthews - Feb. 18, 2007) - (TSX:LUN)(AMEX:LMC)(SSE:LUMI) Lundin Mining Corporation (\"Lundin Mining\" or the \"Company\") deeply regrets to have to announce that the serious accident which occurred in the Galmoy mine, owned by Lundin Mining, in Ireland on Friday the 16th of February 2007, led to a fatality. \b \bA mine fitter, Michael Joyce, fell through a safety railing while working near the crusher and sustained serious head injuries.

The 2006 operating profit is expected to rise 29% to EUR10.3 billion from EUR8 billion. \u001d  Analysts expect the full-year earnings to top Allianz's own company guidance of net profit above EUR6 billion and operating profit above EUR9.5 billion. \u001d  The figures are due Thursday, but in the past Allianz has surprised markets with an early earnings release. \u001d  Allianz has said that the full ownership of RAS at the end of the fourth quarter will add between EUR40 million and EUR45 million to the group's net profit in the last quarter. \u001d  At the end of the third quarter, Allianz owned 76.33% of RAS but said it plans to reach full ownership in the fourth quarter. \u001d  Allianz has also said that its 2006 net profit will be boosted by a EUR500 million tax rebate as part of a new version of Germany's corporate income tax code. \u001d  For Allianz's banking operations, of which Dresdner Bank contributes around 96%, analysts expect improvements on the operating level and higher trading profit to result in a rise in operating profits. Meanwhile, higher restructuring costs and loan-loss provisions are expected to curb net profits. \u001d  \"We expect some seasonal deterioration in Dresdner's cost/income ratio and a small rise from its recent low bad-debt levels, although the full-year results should remain well ahead of last year's performance,\" Lehman Bros. analysts wrote who rate the shares at overweight. \u001d  On average, the analysts surveyed expect Allianz's banking operations to book a quarterly operating profit of EUR298 million, up from EUR10 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, and a net profit of EUR9 million, down from  EUR83 million. \u001d  For the full year, net profit of the banking operations is expected to rise 6% to EUR1.1 billion from EUR1.0 billion, and operating profit is seen improving to EUR1.57 billion from EUR705 million. \u001d  Allianz has said that up to EUR350 million could arise in restructuring costs for Dresdner Bank in the fourth quarter. \u001d  It also said in August that the bank's bad-debt provisions for the second half would amount to EUR200 million gross. \u001d  In 2005, both the bank's quarterly and full-year earnings benefited from net releases of EUR21 million and EUR110 million, respectively, in provisions the bank had made for expected non-performing loans. \u001d  Investors are waiting for Allianz to comment Thursday on the group's planned dividend payment for 2006 and on its pledge to gradually increase the dividend payout ratio in coming years. \u001d  \"We would be disappointed if the (2006) dividend were less than EUR3.20 (a share) and would not be completely surprised it reached EUR3.50,\" Fox-Pitt, Kelton analysts wrote who rate the share at in-line. For 2005, the dividend was EUR2 a share. \u001d  Investors also expect fresh earnings targets for 2007 and 2008, and more details about the financing of the minority buyouts of French Assurances Generales de France SA (12592.FR) and of Germany's Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG (ALL.XE), both announced in January.

In a separate case, Nordic telecommunications firm TeliaSonera (TLSN.SK), another major shareholder in Turkcell Iletisim with 13%, has taken legal action against Alfa and Cukurova for the control of Turkcell Iletisim. \u001d  In March 2005, debt-laden Turkish group Cukurova Holding had agreed to sell all its shares in Turkcell Iletisim to TeliaSonera for $3.1 billion. \u001d  But this was derailed by the Alfa Group and its $3.3-billion loan package for Cukurova in return for sharing the control of Turkcell Iletisim. Cukurova decided to cancel its agreement with TeliaSonera and signed a new agreement with Alfa. \u001d  But at the start of this year an international arbitration court ruled that Cukurova has to comply with its original agreement with TeliaSonera. \u001d  Some analysts say, Alfa does not want to be obliged to buy the remaining shares of the minority shareholders and is more likely to reach an agreement with TeliaSonera for sharing control of Turkcell Iletisim or get out of the deal completely. \u001d  Last week, Russian press reports said that Alfa Group's telecoms arm Altimo might swap its shares in Russian mobile phone group MegaFon and Turkcell Iletisim for a minority stake in TeliaSonera. \u001d  Turkcell Iletisim is currently controlled by Turkcell Holding AS, which is 51% owned by Cukurova Holding; 23.4% of the company is traded on the stock exchange. \u001d  TeliaSonera owns 43.7% of MegaFon.

However, the average spot TCE rate for Suezmax tankers in the West Africa to U.S. trade was lower than the preceding quarter and the rate prevailing in the same period of last year. This was the result of weaker oil demand growth, because of warm winter weather in the Northern hemisphere, and relatively high oil inventories which resulted in falling oil prices and oil production cuts by OPEC. Freight rates in the crude oil tanker market have continued at high levels thus far in the first quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  The average OPEC oil production in the fourth quarter of 2006 totaled about 29.4 million barrels per day (\"b/d\"), about 0.8 million b/d lower compared to the preceding quarter and 0.4 million b/d below the level prevailing in the same quarter of last year. Almost all of the sequential quarterly decrease was from the long haul Middle East. This was due to OPEC's successful agreement to cut its oil production by 1.2 million b/d beginning on November 1, 2006, in an attempt to reverse a decrease in oil prices. Subsequently, OPEC has agreed to lower its oil production by an additional 0.5 million b/d from February 1, 2007. \b \u001d  World oil demand in the fourth quarter of 2006 was about 1.0 million b/d higher than the preceding quarter and averaged 1.1 million b/d higher compared to the same period of last year. World oil demand in 2006 was about 0.8 million b/d, or 1.0% higher than in 2005. The moderate world oil demand growth in 2006 was the result of high average oil prices due to low spare oil production capacity and on-going geopolitical risks. \b \u001d  Total preliminary commercial crude oil and petroleum products inventories in the United States, Western Europe and Japan at the end of 2006 were about 35 million barrels, or 1.6% higher than the year earlier level, and 3.5% above the average of the last five years. At the same time, crude oil inventories were 4.0% and petroleum products inventories were 3.3% higher than the average of the last five years, respectively. \b \u001d  The world tanker fleet totaled 345.4 million dwt at the end of 2006, up by about 20.4 million dwt or 6.3% from the year-end 2005 level. The total tanker fleet includes 45.8 million dwt Suezmaxes, excluding shuttle and U.S. flag Suezmaxes, up by 7.5% from the year-end 2005 level. \b \u001d  The tanker orderbook totaled about 129.0 million dwt, or 37.3% of the existing fleet at the end of 2006. Approximately 30.7 million dwt are for delivery in 2007, 35.3 million dwt in 2008, 45.6 million dwt in 2009, and most of the balance in 2010. The tanker orderbook includes 123 Suezmaxes of about 19.5 million dwt or 42.6% of the existing internationally trading Suezmax tanker fleet. Twenty-five Suezmaxes are for delivery in 2007, 22 in 2008, 61 in 2009 and the balance in 2010. \b \u001d  At the end of 2006, approximately 30.4 million dwt or 8.8% of the total tanker fleet was 20 or more years old, including 9.9 million dwt or 2.9% of the fleet which was 25 or more years old. Furthermore, six Suezmaxes were 20 or more years old, including one which was 25 or more years old. Tanker sales for scrap and for Floating Production Storage Offloading (\"FPSO\") and heavy-lift vessel conversion totaled about 5.1 million dwt in 2006, including four VLCCs and nine Suezmaxes of which three were U.S. flag and two were shuttle tankers. \b \u001d  The EU adopted tanker regulations which commenced on October 21, 2003. In response to the EU regulations, the IMO adopted new strict tanker regulations which commenced on April 5, 2005. At the end of 2006, there were about 91.7 million dwt of tankers or 26.5% of the total tanker fleet which will be affected by these regulations. \b \b   Product Tanker Overview \b \u001d  Freight rates in the product tanker market continued at high levels in the fourth quarter of 2006, though the average spot TCE for handysize product tankers in the Caribbean was below the preceding quarter rate and the rate prevailing in the same period of last year. The product tanker market strength was the result of continuous growth in the demand for oil and shortage of refinery capacity in consuming areas, notwithstanding an increase of the world product tanker fleet. Freight rates in the product tanker market have continued at high levels thus far in the first quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  The world product tanker fleet, (which ranges from small 10,000 dwt product carriers to larger than 100,000 dwt for coated Aframax tankers) totaled about 83.2 million dwt at the end of 2006, up by about 10.9% from the year-end 2005 level. The total product tanker fleet includes about 45.7 million dwt handysize and handymax product tankers, up by 8.6% from the year-end 2005 level. \b \u001d  The product tanker orderbook for delivery over the next few years totaled about 40.5 million dwt, or about 48.7% of the existing product tanker fleet at the end of 2006. Approximately 12.6 million dwt are for delivery in 2007, 13.1 million dwt in 2008 and most of the balance in 2009. At the end of 2006, approximately 13.4 million dwt or 16.1% of the existing fleet was 20 or more years old. \b \u001d  The orderbook for handysize and handymax product tankers at the end of 2006 totaled about 15.0 million dwt or 32.8% of the existing handysize and handymax product tanker fleet. Approximately 5.7 million dwt are for delivery in 2007, 5.2 million dwt in 2008 and most of the balance in 2009. \b \u001d  Total preliminary commercial inventories of oil products in the United States, Western Europe and Japan at the end of 2006 were 43 million barrels or 3.1% higher than the same time a year ago, and 3.3% above the average of the last five years. At the same time, inventories of middle distillates, the seasonal product, in these areas were 3.1% and 4.7% higher than last year and the last five years average, respectively. \b \b   FLEET SUMMARY \b \u001d  Our fleet is concentrated into two vessel types: Suezmax tankers (\"crude\" vessels), which generally carry crude oil from areas of oil production to refinery areas, and product carriers (\"clean\" vessels), which generally carry refined petroleum products (such as gasoline and aviation fuel) from refineries to distribution areas. At December 31, 2006, our fleet comprised 46 vessels, including the ASHLEY which was sold in February and the SEINE, which is scheduled to be delivered in March 2007 and excluding the vessels from the other participants in our wholly owned Gemini and Libra Pools. We charter-in 9 vessels, 6 Suezmax tankers and 3 product carriers (See Exhibit 1 for OMI's Fleet Report by vessel). \b \u001d  The following table of OMI's fleet includes wholly owned and chartered-in vessels at December 31, 2006 and revenue days for the fourth quarter: \b \b \b                                                               Total \b             Number    Number   Number of   Number    Total    Number \b                of      of        Vessels      of     Number     of \b              Vessels   Revenue  Chartered-  Revenue    of     Revenue \b               Owned    Days         In       Days    Vessels   Days \b             -------- --------- ----------- -------- -------- -------- \bSuezmaxes - \b Spot(a),(b)       4       365           3      275        7      640 \bSuezmaxes - \b TC(c)             3       276           3      276        6      552 \bProduct \b Carriers - \b Spot(d)           2       304           1       43        3      347 \bProduct \b Carriers - \b TC               28     2,503           2      184       30    2,687 \b             -------- --------- ----------- -------- -------- -------- \bTotal             37     3,448           9      778       46    4,226 \b             -------- --------- ----------- -------- -------- -------- \b \b(a) Excludes 7 vessels owned by other pool participants that operate \b in the Gemini Suezmax Pool. \b(b) We had 4 Synthetic time charters which reduce our exposure to the \b spot market for 368 days and were included in time charter revenue. \b(c) Two of the owned Suezmaxes (ADAIR and INGEBORG) on time charter \b are part of the Gemini Suezmax Pool. \b(d) Excludes 1 vessel owned by another pool participant that operates \b in the Libra product carrier pool. \b \b   FINANCIAL INFORMATION \b \u001d  The following table summarizes OMI Corporation's results of operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2005. \b \bRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \b------------------------- \b(In thousands, except per share data) \b \b                           For the Three Months  For the Twelve Months \b                            Ended December 31,    Ended December 31, \b                             2006       2005        2006       2005 \b                           ---------- ---------  ----------- --------- \bVoyage and time charter \b revenue                   $ 160,345  $188,754   $  715,645  $650,848 \bVoyage expense                30,673    40,480      139,550   136,743 \b                           ---------- ---------  ----------- --------- \bTime charter equivalent \b revenue                     129,672   148,274      576,095   514,105 \bOther revenue                    950       493        3,262     1,519 \bVessel expense                25,804    23,635       93,386    89,115 \bCharter hire expense          42,846    30,348      158,120    72,782 \bDepreciation and \b amortization                 14,592    17,177       61,586    68,399 \bGeneral and \b administrative                9,661    10,563       34,296    31,683 \bGain on disposal of \b vessels(1),(2)              (30,283)  (55,091)    (108,321)  (57,965) \b                           ---------- ---------  ----------- --------- \bOperating income              68,002   122,135      340,290   311,610 \b                           ---------- ---------  ----------- --------- \b \bGain on purchase of \b Convertible Notes                 -     1,861            -     4,672 \bInterest expense              (9,334)  (11,853)     (41,938)  (43,739) \bInterest income                1,962       440        5,279     1,225 \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 15:16 ET (20:16 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"ee1cea42c3f72e5952f19652f01b78b5","symR":["2211.TO","2212.TO","JP3821200007","JP3935600001"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Yamazaki To Become Fujiya Top Shareholder-Nikkei","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T05:01:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["2211.TO","2212.TO","JP3821200007","JP3935600001"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 00:01 ET (05:01 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"ee60311f586c164f50f2f17d48d1282d","symR":["UMN.LN","UMN.T","VGG9298V1067"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UraMin To Buy Mago's Stake In South African JV >UMN.T","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T19:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UMN.LN","UMN.T","VGG9298V1067"],"IndustryCodes":["ONF"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  UraMin Inc.

Thomson Corp (TOC) put its education unit up for sale last October, while Wolters Kluwer (39590.AE) announced a strategic review of its education unit last November, both citing the need for sustained investment to maintain a strong position in this market. And while there is scope for growth for the biggest and most technologically advanced market players, analysts think growth prospects are more limited for those who haven't yet embraced digital products. \u001d  Dresdner Kleinwort highlighted in a recent research note that London-based Pearson PLC (PSO), in particular, and to a lesser extent the McGraw Hill Cos. (MHL) have made much greater investment in technology-based education tools than other education publishers, and believes that increasingly those publishers without the resources or the inclination to put capital investiture into technology may exit the sector. \u001d  \"(The growth of digital) leaves incumbent publishers with a stark choice: invest in technology and systems that power interaction between their content and their network, or exit the business now while valuations look attractive,\"  Dresdner analysts say. \u001d   To some, Harcourt's recent performance suggests it may not be at the vanguard of the education publishing sector. In 2006, its underlying operating profit fell by 20%. Analysts this week estimated Harcourt will sell for between GBP1.6 billion and GBP2.0 billion, before tax and pension costs. \u001d  \"Education businesses usually command a multiple of 10-12x earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which equates to GBP1.6 billion-GBP1.92 billion,\" Numis Securities said in a research note. \u001d  \"However, given that there are other education businesses (notably Thomson College) for sale at the moment, we expect the proceeds to be at the lower end of this range; we expect private equity to be the buyer,\" Numis said. \u001d  Private equity firms, typically attracted to professional publishing businesses as their cashflow isn't tied to the advertising cycle, are expected to look at Harcourt. But many analysts said that because Thomson and Wolters Kluwer are also selling education publishing assets, Reed could get less for its assets than it would in other circumstances. \u001d  Reed Elsevier's chief executive, Crispin Davis, last week raised the possibility that a private equity bidder could combine Harcourt with Thomson's higher education unit, Thomson Learning, effectively reuniting two parts of a company that was split when Reed acquired Harcourt in 2001, and some analysts see this as a credible plan. \u001d  \"It's possible a private-equity buyer would see a way of putting together Thomson's higher education business with Harcourt's school business,\" Davis said. \"Certainly we will have (buying interest) from private equity. This is a favorable time to be selling this business.\" \u001d  Usman Ghazi, a media analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort, said he sees extensive sales, editorial and marketing synergies in recombining the split education business. \u001d  \"There's definitely a play for private equity to combine Thomson Learning and Harcourt,\" he said. \u001d  Paul Gooden, a media analyst at ABN Amro, said a bidder could potentially use the combined assets to create a \"mini-Pearson,\" focused on the education market, extract synergies and raise margins before re-floating the company. \u001d  Reed paid $4.45 billion for Harcourt and took on an additional $1.2 billion of debt, then immediately sold Harcourt's higher education business to Thomson for $2 billion. \u001d  The highly consolidated nature of the sector means existing trade players are unlikely to acquire Harcourt. \u001d  Dublin-based Riverdeep Group PLC, a \"big four\" U.S. publisher that recently completed a reverse takeover of Houghton Mifflin, is \"interested,\" a person familiar with Riverdeep said. Riverdeep declined to comment. \u001d  Some analysts say Riverdeep, which paid about $1.75 billion and assumed about $1.61 billion in net debt for Houghton Mifflin, may face antitrust scrutiny, although its share of the market is lower than its larger rivals. \u001d  But the concentration of the market would likely bar Pearson and McGraw Hill from bidding, people familiar with those companies say. The two key education publishing markets in the U.S., where many of the big publishers make most of their revenue, are already highly consolidated. \u001d  In the schools sector, McGraw Hill, Pearson Group and Reed account for almost 75% of the market, while Houghton Mifflin has around 14%, according to 2005 market share figures from Dresdner Kleinwort. In higher education, Pearson, McGraw Hill and Thomson's combined market share is nearly 80%, Dresdner Kleinwort says. \u001d  A person familiar with Pearson, the largest player in the schools market, said a bid would almost certainly be blocked on antitrust grounds and thought it was likely the same criteria would apply to McGraw Hill. Neither Pearson nor McGraw Hill has said whether they would bid for Harcourt. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission couldn't immediately be contacted for comment Monday. \u001d  \"We believe a trade buyer is unlikely to step in, with private equity the most likely acquirer,\" ABN Amro said in a research note. \u001d  Analysts forecast strong growth in the State Adoption cycle as individual U.S. states step up the commissioning  of new text books. \u001d  Some analyst point to the private equity industry's strong appetite for education assets, which they say could work in Reed's favor. Those that have showninterest in such assets in the recent past include Blackstone Group, Bain Capital, Thomas H. Lee & Partners, the former owner of Houghton Mifflin, Apax Partners, which has extensive U.K. media interests, Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, which has recently made education-based acquisitions and was reported to be looking at Pearson, and Cinven Group Ltd., which has held many publishing investments. All of these companies either declined to comment or weren't available when contacted by Dow Jones Newswires. \u001d  Some analysts, however, are less convinced. \u001d  \"The problem with selling the business is who is the ultimate buyer?\" said Patrick Wellington, a media analyst at Morgan Stanley. \"Unless someone comes fresh into the publishing business; I can see how private equity might buy it, but who would they sell it to?\" \u001d  However, Dresdner Kleinwort's Ghazi said private equity companies moving into the college market may be able to find synergies in combining these with text book and software providers. \u001d  He cited the $3.1 billion buyout of Laureate Education, which owns a network of U.S. colleges, by an investor group including Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts and Citigroup Private Equity, a unit of Citigroup, in January. In March 2006, the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs Group (GS), along with Providence Equity, bought a similar college company, Education Management, for $3.4 billion. \b \u001d  -By Jessica Hodgson, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 207 842 92 93; jessica.hodgson@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 09:17 ET (14:17 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f2986038bb380cc8d8a9d1c5391510dc","symR":["1004086.FR","MVC.MC","ES0154220414","FR0010040865"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"2nd UPDATE: Metrovacesa Top Holders Agree To Divide Company","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T11:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1004086.FR","MVC.MC","ES0154220414","FR0010040865"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","RED","REI","XDJGI","XIBEX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (This updates an article published at 0917 GMT to add background and analyst comments.) \b \u001d  By Santiago Perez \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  MADRID (Dow Jones)--Real estate company Metrovacesa SA (MVC.MC) Monday said its top shareholders - Chairman Joaquin Rivero, the Soler and the Sanahuja families - have agreed to divide the company in two, to end a board dispute for control of the firm. \u001d  Metrovacesa, the euro-zone's largest real-estate company by assets, will be divided into two separate entities - bringing to an end a high-profile bidding war for company stakes launched by two rival shareholder groups last year. \u001d  \"The bidding process for Metrovacesa shares, conducted during 2006, resulted in discrepancies at the board, stemming from different views over the development model,\" Metrovacesa said in a filing with regulators. \u001d  The planned separation, the first of its size and kind for a listed company in Spain, takes place as the country's red-hot housing market is beginning to cool down after a decade of steady increases in house prices and vast mortgage lending. \u001d  One of the entities, to be called Metrovacesa, will comprise the company's Spanish real-estate assets as well as its French rental assets, and will be have the Sanahuja family as its main shareholder. The Sanahujas, who control Barcelona-based real-estate company Sacresa, currently own about 39% of Metrovacesa. \u001d  The second entity, to be called Gecina, will include the company's French real-estate assets and some of its Spanish office rental business. The rival group, led by Rivero and the Solers, will be its main shareholder. \u001d  Metrovacesa directors Bautista Soler Crespo and Maria Victoria Soler Lujan are also the leading shareholders of Valencia CF, one of Spain's top soccer clubs. The Rivero-led group currently owns about one-third of Metrovacesa. \u001d  \"This goes in the opposite direction of Spain's corporate history, which has been more about mergers,\" said Inverseguros analyst Alberto Roldan, who has a sell rating on Metrovacesa. \u001d  The deal would also mark the departure of Rivero after he took control of the company in 2002. He was the main driver behind the positioning of Metrovacesa as a real-estate power house through an aggressive growth strategy. \u001d  Rivero's new focus on French real-estate and office rentals in Spain also takes place at a time of dramatic consolidation in Spanish real-estate listed companies through intense M&A activity ahead of an expected slowdown.    Metrovacesa, which acquired control of France's Gecina (1004086.FR) in 2005 in a deal valued at more than EUR5 billion, has a market capitalization of EUR12.6 billion and 107 million shares outstanding. \u001d  Spain's stock market supervisors Monday suspended trading in Metrovacesa shares ahead of the announcement. The trade halt \"won't be lifted until the company submits sufficient information,\" the regulator said in a statement Monday. Metrovacesa said more information on the proposed separation will be disclosed later Monday. \u001d  It said minority shareholders will be given mechanisms to choose between the two projects. The proposed transaction still requires regulatory clearance. \u001d  Metrovacesa's shares closed Friday at EUR117.85. \u001d  With a thin free-float of about 14%, Metrovacesa share prices had staged a volatile ride in the past 12 months, doubling their value in just one year. \u001d  The free-float of Metrovacesa was squeezed by competing tender offers for company stakes as the dispute for control of Metrovacesa's board escalated last year. With the support of some smaller shareholders, the Rivero-led group maintained control of the company in its clash with the Sanahujas. \u001d  \"We believe that the legal requirements for the operation will be long and complicated,\" said local brokerage Banesto, which has a sell rating on Metrovacesa shares and a price target of EUR65.14. \u001d  \"From a stock price perspective, we believe that once the war between the top two shareholders concludes, Metrovacesa share prices should correct and adjust to the real value of their assets,\" wrote Banesto analyst Marta Gomez, who estimates the company's net asset value to be of about EUR51.2 per share. \u001d  Metrovacesa net profit for the first nine months of 2006  almost tripled to EUR861 million, on strong rental income and higher home sales in Spain. \u001d  After Metrovacesa took control of Gecina, the company has raised profit targets several times. Metrovacesa's management expects net profit to inch closer to EUR1.1 billion for the whole 2006. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.metrovacesa.es \b \u001d  -By Santiago Perez, Dow Jones Newswires; 34-91-395 8119; santiago.perez@dowjones.com \u001d  (Jonathan House and Christopher Bjork contributed to this article.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 06:21 ET (11:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f2d5d0c6857af1cdece0f71d6e4d8f75","symR":["PSD.AU","PSDV","AU000000PSD7"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"PSivida Announces A$11.5M Private Placement >PSDV","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T16:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PSD.AU","PSDV","AU000000PSD7"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","XDJGI","XORD"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  pSivida Ltd.

Evidently, wide price swings can be profitable, but they don't have that buy-it-and-forget-it kind of comfort. \u001d  Even so, the short-term market suggests that the next move is liable to be higher, and at least the jobbers can get in on the fun. \u001d  Indeed, the takeover rumor caused shares to open nearly $2 higher on Tuesday at $34.85 and shares haven't given any ground since - that's bullish for the short term, anyway.  Shares as of this writing are trading roughly in the middle of a band of technical resistance between $33.75 and $35.18. Charts show that a breakout above that technical range would point the stock up to $41.24, although traders could expect a pullback of some description when resistance at the May 2006 high of $36.96 was tested. \u001d  But if $33.75 support is taken out then the stock would have been set up for an initial dip to $32.92, which is now the nearest stop-loss point for trades based on the monthly chart. A move below $32.92 might not stop before $30.15 support was tested. \b \u001d  (Stephen Cox, a chartered market technician, is chief technician for Dow Jones Newswires.) \u001d  -By Stephen Cox, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2064; stephen.cox@dowjones.com \u001d  Data by CSI, Commodity Research Bureau, TradeStation Securities \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 07:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f46f9ebeea971a55e64f0851bde81943","symR":["PLPC"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Preformed Line Products 4Q Net More Than Doubles On Higher Sales","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T12:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PLPC"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Preformed Line Products Co.'s (PLPC) fourth-quarter earnings more than doubled to $2 million on higher sales. \u001d  For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the Cleveland-based company earned $2.0 million or 38 cents a share, up from $883,000 or 15 cents a year earlier. \u001d  Sales for the quarter rose to $51.8 million from $46.7 million. \u001d  The company said its international operations had a record year for both sales and income and domestic sales, though lower on the year as a whole, recovered in the fourth quarter and were 9% stronger than a year earlier in its core energy and telecommunications markets. \u001d  Preformed Line Products designs and makes products and systems used in the construction and maintenance of overhead and underground networks for energy, communications and broadband network companies. \u001d  -Judy McKinnon; 416-306-2100; AskNewswires@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 07:57 ET (12:57 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f4b6a25e48f4cf88c50f7e5563a40136","symR":["SAG.YY"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Prosecutors Call For 6-Mo Sentence For Swissair's Last CEO","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T20:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SAG.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BUELACH, Switzerland (AP)--Prosecutors proposed a six-month prison sentence for Mario Corti, the last chief executive of the now defunct Swissair, and a range of suspended sentences for 18 other airline executives, board members and consultants. \u001d  The defendants in Switzerland's largest corporate trial face have all pleaded innocent to charges that include damaging creditors, mismanagement, making false business statements and forging documents. Some have blamed the big Swiss banks and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks for the airline's downfall. \u001d  Creditors and others damaged by the airline's collapse will present their case first, followed by the defense. Public hearings conclude on March 9, when the three-judge panel will start discussing the case behind close doors. It was unclear when a verdict could be announced. \u001d  Swissair was grounded abruptly on Oct. 2, 2001, after months of financial problems led to its being unable to pay for fuel and landing fees. Tens of thousands of passengers were stranded worldwide. Thousands of employees and shareholders lost their life savings, and the country's four main political parties demanded that former executives be held responsible. \u001d  The prosecution on Monday said that Corti, who was the last chief executive of parent SAirGroup, and the group's former head of finance Jacqualyn Fouse had failed to take action following the company's insolvency, and therefore caused \"immense damage.\" \u001d  They were too late in filing for protection from creditors - a step short of bankruptcy under Swiss law - which led to a loss in liquidity of CHF177 million, the prosecution said. \u001d  Corti had released false information to the public covering up the extent of the financial problems, state prosecutor Ralph Ringger said. \u001d  Prosecuting Attorney Christian Weber said that, as the main person responsible for the collapse, Corti should be sentenced to 28 months in prison, but that 22 months of that sentence should be suspended, which means it would be ignored on condition of good behavior. \u001d  Weber also demanded a penalty of CHF1.08 million for Corti, which also would go unpaid after three years of good behavior, but that Corti be fined CHF10,000. \u001d  For all of the other defendants, prosecutors requested suspended sentences ranging up to 18 months, penalties up to CHF720,000 francs and fines up to CHF20,000 francs. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 15:25 ET (20:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f4da2fa44ec8ef598225a532108b5942","symR":["T.T","TU","CA87971M1032"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Telus Corp.

The Flying Diamond deposit is located about four miles southeast of the Company's Lisbon Valley copper mine and process plant. This release contains information on ten new drill holes which are located to the northwest and to the southeast of the original discovery area. Drilling continues in the Flying Diamond area with both a core drill and a rotary drill, and additional assay results will be released as they become available. \b \bA drill hole location map of the Flying Diamond and Stateline deposits has been posted on the Company's website. The Stateline deposit is located to the southeast of, and is contiguous with, the Flying Diamond deposit. \b \bThe map shows all holes drilled (rotary, reverse circulation and core) in the deposit area including the holes discussed in this release, the holes discussed in previous releases and holes for which assay data is not yet available. During 2006 a total of 24 core holes, 8 reverse circulation holes and 32 rotary holes were completed in the Flying Diamond/Stateline area. An additional 5 core holes and 4 rotary holes have been completed so far in 2007. \b \bAssay results are only presented by the Company for core holes drilled in the Flying Diamond and Stateline deposit areas. Assay results from conventional rotary and reverse circulation drill holes drilled in this area are not considered by the Company to be reliable for resource estimation purposes due to sample contamination resulting from high inflows of groundwater into the drill holes while drilling. Assay results from rotary holes are believed to be indicative of copper mineralization, however, and many of these holes have later been twinned with core holes. \b \bCurrently the Flying Diamond/Stateline deposit appears to be closed off to the northeast where it is terminated against the east splay of the Lisbon Valley Fault. Based on the results of the 10 drill holes, as well as the visual results from rotary holes and core holes not yet assayed, the Flying Diamond/Stateline deposit appears to be about 10,000 feet long in a northwest-southeast orientation parallel to the east splay of the Lisbon Valley Fault. Mineralization appears to persist away from the fault at least 600 feet to the southwest in much of the deposit. Copper mineralization is generally found within two flat-lying sandstone layers of Cretaceous age, an upper layer in the Dakota Formation and a lower layer in the Burro Canyon Formation, the same rock types and formations that host mineralization at the Centennial and Sentinel pits that are currently being mined farther to the northwest. The bulk of the copper mineralization is present as the leachable sulphide chalcocite. \b \b \b    << \b    Drill Hole     From(ft)  To(ft)  Thickness(ft)  Cu% Total     Formation \b \b    06C-FLD-11       525      585          60          0.25     Burro Canyon \b \b    06C-FLD-12       475      490          15          0.46     Burro Canyon \b                     520      540          20          0.28     Burro Canyon \b \b    06C-FLD-13       461      550          89          0.56     Burro Canyon \b \b    06C-FLD-14       515      570          55          0.26     Burro Canyon \b \b    06C-FLD-15       430      452          22          0.41     Burro Canyon \b                     470      475           5          0.56     Burro Canyon \b \b    06C-FLD-16       530      555          25          0.66     Burro Canyon \b                     565      590          25          0.41     Burro Canyon \b                     610      615           5          0.66     Burro Canyon \b \b    06C-FLD-17       475      530          55          0.43     Burro Canyon \b \b    06C-FLD-18       235      240           5          0.16     Dakota \b                     475      525          50          0.26     Burro Canyon \b \b    06C-FLD-19       462      535          73          0.32     Burro Canyon \b \b    06C-FLD-20       515      580          65          0.36     Burro Canyon \b                     600      635          35          0.33     Burro Canyon \b    >> \b \b \bThe average intercept for the ten holes listed above is 61 feet grading 0.38% copper. All of the above holes are vertical and hence the thicknesses noted are considered to be true. Core hole 06C-FLD-21 was drilled into the Lisbon Valley Fault and only intersected a thin zone of mineralization in the Dakota Formation, while hole 06C-FLD-23 was abandoned due to drilling problems. Assays for core holes O6C-FLD-22 and -24 are pending. Core from holes 07C-STL-01, -02 and -03 is being logged and sawn prior to being shipped for assay. The core drill is currently active on hole 07C-STL-04 while the rotary drill is active on hole 07R-STL-03. \b \bResults confirm the good overall continuity of grade and thickness of the Flying Diamond/Stateline deposit, particularly for the Burro Canyon-hosted mineralization. Copper mineralization at the Flying Diamond deposit is known to become closer to the surface going to the southeast, parallel to the east splay of the Lisbon Valley Fault, where it merges with the Stateline deposit. Drilling with both the core and the rotary rigs is currently focused on defining the mineralization in this southeast area where based on visual observations of core the depth to mineralization is in the range of 250 to 350 feet, rather than an average of approximately 500 feet in the majority of the Flying Diamond deposit defined to date. \b \bAdditional claims have been leased along the west side of lower Lisbon Valley, about two miles to the west of Flying Diamond, covering areas where outcropping copper mineralization exists. We plan on drilling these areas later in 2007 once permits have been obtained. We have also recently completed approximately ten line miles of shallow seismic survey lines in the lower Lisbon Valley area in an effort to better define the depth to favourable formations and the location of faults in this area which is largely covered by soil. The interpretation of the survey lines will be completed in the next few months and it is anticipated that a number of quality drilling targets will be identified. \b \bAll of the sample preparation and assays in this report have been performed by Skyline Labs, Tucson, Arizona. An assay QA/QC program is routinely followed and calls for the regular insertion of independent standards, blanks and duplicate samples. The results of the QA/QC program have been satisfactory. The drilling and assaying program are being performed under the supervision of Gary Parkison, Vice President Exploration & Development for Constellation Copper Corporation, a Certified Professional Geologist and a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101, who also prepared this release. \b \bThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements.

(RUKN.VX) of General Electric Co.'s (GE) reinsurance operations, a deal that was aimed at boosting both firms' capital strength and global reach. \u001d  Scor said a tie-up with Converium was \"a unique strategic opportunity to create a top five global multiline reinsurer in this time of market consolidation.\" \u001d  A takeover of Converium by Scor would create a company with substantial life and non-life business with annual premiums of about EUR5.3 billion. \u001d  It would catapult the emerged company close to the world's largest reinsurers - led by Swiss Re; Munich Re (MUV2.XE); Berkshire Hathaway Re, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKB); and Germany's Hannover Re (HNR1.XE). \u001d  Analysts said the timing of the bid was sensible as Converium shares are still relatively cheap due to the company's restructuring. \u001d  But some, like Oddo Securities analyst Nicolas Jacob, cautioned that investors are concerned that Scor would have to make another call on capital markets to finance a merger and that the move indicates a troubling strategic shift toward the risky non-life reinsurance sector, where Converium is focused.   Scor came close to financial collapse in 2002 after losses from contracts written in the 1990s plunged it deep into the red. It was saved by a series of capital hikes worth more than EUR1 billion and a massive restructuring plan. \u001d  Its focus shifted toward life reinsurance, which has a steadier claims record than the more volatile property-and-casualty reinsurance sector that is often prone to huge claims from catastrophes such as hurricanes or earthquakes. \u001d  In July 2006, Scor agreed to acquire German life reinsurer Revios Rueckversicherung AG from Globale Rueckversicherungs AG for EUR605 million, a move that is expected to help Scor to pursue a path of profitable growth. \u001d  At 1300 GMT, Scor shares were down EUR1.68, or 8%, at EUR19.43. Converium was up CHF2.10, or 11%, at EUR20.90. \u001d  \"The directors are unanimous in their rejection of this proposal,\" Converium said. \"The proposal fundamentally fails to recognize the value of Converium's franchise and growth prospects, and is, therefore, not in the interest of Converium, its shareholders and its customers.\" \u001d  Under Scor's offer, the French company, which is roughly double the size of Converium, would be prepared to pay CHF21 per Converium share, constituting a 12.3% premium to Converium's closing price Friday of CHF18.7. \u001d  \"A takeover of Converium by Scor would make sense, as it would give Scor's underwriting ability another boost,\" said Stefan Schuermann, analyst at Cheuvreux, who rates Converium at outperform. \u001d  Converium is still smarting from a heavy restructuring in the wake of a massive reserve shortfall in the U.S. in 2004, which required the company to issue new shares, reduce its staff and exit the U.S. reinsurance market. \u001d  Although the company has turned profitable since then and today boasts a strong capital base, Converium is still rated triple-B by most rating agencies, a level that is deemed too low for a reinsurer to do bulk business. \u001d  However, Converium expects an upgrade to the crucial A-level later this year once an industrywide probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to be finalized. \u001d  Such a step wouldn't only boost its share price but also likely help spur premium growth and profitability, analysts said. \u001d  Converium itself expects its return on equity to reach 14% by 2009, up from 4.1% at the end of 2005, bringing it more in line with leading industry peers. \u001d  Given the company's prospects and Converium's close partnership with JP Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Credit Suisse (CS), which advised the reinsurer to reject the deal, analyst expect the road to a successful takeover to be bumpy. \u001d  \"The board's negative stance could trigger a bidding war, or probably a higher bid from Scor,\" said Rene Locher, analyst at Bank Sal. Oppenheim, who suggested that a Bermuda-base player with a strong capital base could enter the ring and grab Converium away from Scor. \u001d  While Swiss privately held investment company Patinex AG, which is led by Swiss financier Martin Ebner, said it has sold its near-20% stake in the company, Converium has a relatively widespread shareholder base, which won't be easy to persuade to sell at the current price, analysts said. \u001d  Around 51% of Converium's shareholders are in Switzerland, often pension funds, followed by 24% in the U.K. and 21% in the U.S. \u001d  Among the larger shareholders are Zuercher Kantonalbank with a roughly 7% stake and San Francisco-based investment company Dodge & Cox with a 5% stake. Zuercher Kantonalbank declined to comment, while Dodge & Cox couldn't be immediately reached. \u001d  \"We are currently observing what is going on and have no intention to sell right now,\" said Peter Gachnang, portfolio manager at Swisscanto, one of Switzerland's largest asset managers with around CHF60 billion in funds. \"There is a chance that the offer will be increased or that a white knight could appear.\" He didn't specify the size of the fund's Converium stake. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.converium.com \b   -By Goran Mijuk and Digby Larner, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 80 47; goran.mijuk@dowjones.com \u001d  (Digby Larner reported this item from Paris.) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  February 19, 2007 08:21 ET (13:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f6c65d373c0d717680ea2d5d67ae82d6","symR":["AVM.T","CA03734N1069"],"date":"2007-02-19","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Anvil to Proceed with Detailed Evaluation of Itogon Mineral Properties in the Philippines","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-02-19T08:12:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AVM.T","CA03734N1069"],"IndustryCodes":["MNG","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \b\b \b\bTSX, ASX: AVM \b\b \b\bCommon shares outstanding 56.7 million \b\b \b\bAll amounts are expressed in US dollars, unless otherwise stated. \b\b \b\bMONTREAL, Feb. 19 /CNW/ - Anvil Mining Limited (TSX, ASX: AVM), (\"Anvil\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to announce that following completion of due diligence in December 2006, it has elected to proceed with a detailed evaluation of the Itogon Suyoc Resources Inc. (\"Itogon\") mineral properties in the Philippines. The Company made a cash payment of $2.0 million to Itogon on February 16, 2007 and will provide funding to a minimum of $2.0 million in exploration expenditures and use its best efforts to complete the detailed evaluation within a two-year period. \b\b \b\bIn August 2006, the Company signed an Evaluation and Development Agreement with Itogon, a private Philippines minerals company, for their gold properties in the Baguio District on Luzon Island in the Philippines. The Itogon properties cover an area of 2,896 hectares and are located 12 km to the southeast of Baguio City and approximately 200 km north of Manila, the capital of the Philippines. A map of the properties can be accessed at http://www.anvil.com.au/itogon.shtml. The properties also include the Itogon underground gold mine which, up until it was put on care and maintenance in 1996, produced approximately one million ounces of gold and 400,000 ounces of silver from ore with an average gold grade of 6.9 g/t. \b\b \b\bThe Baguio District has been the most significant gold producing district in the Philippines with historical production of 28 million ounces of gold and 2.3 million tonnes of copper. It is located within a dilation zone at a change of direction of the Philippine Fault Zone, a major geological feature which transgresses the Philippine archipelago for a distance of more than 1,200 km. A great number of the epithermal gold and porphyry copper deposits in the Philippines appear to be spatially related to this major fault zone. The Philex Mine located 10 km to the southwest of the Itogon properties has historical production of 5 million ounces of gold, 5 million ounces of silver and almost 2 million tonnes of copper. \b\b \b\bThe agreement provides for the Company to acquire 100% of the Itogon mineral properties by completing a staged evaluation process, which, in addition to the cash payment of $2.0 million to Itogon, and funding to a minimum of $2.0 million in exploration expenditures includes the following terms and conditions: \b\b \b\b \b\b    << \b\b    -   Subsequent to the detailed evaluation, completion of a feasibility \b\b        study on a 'best efforts' basis within a period of two years; \b\b \b\b    -   A cash payment of $500,000 upon transfer of Itogon's rights to the \b\b        mineral properties to the Company; \b\b \b\b    -   Payment of a Net Smelter Return (NSR) Royalty to Itogon on all \b\b        mineral production derived from the Itogon mineral properties by the \b\b        Company. For silver and copper production, the NSR Royalty will be \b\b        calculated at a rate of 2.5% and 3% respectively, while for gold, it \b\b        will be calculated according to a sliding scale, at a rate from 1.5% \b\b        to 5%, directly dependent upon the selling price of gold; and \b\b \b\b    -   A one-off production bonus payment to Itogon of $1.25 million, once \b\b        200,000 ounces of gold has been recovered from the Itogon mineral \b\b        properties by Anvil. \b\b    >> \b\b \b\b \b\bFollowing the cash payment of $2 million in February 2007, the Company will now progress with the detailed evaluation of the properties which will include geological mapping and sampling and other evaluation work leading to a drilling program expected to commence in early 2008. \b\b \b\bAnvil Mining Limited is an unhedged copper and silver producer whose shares are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (as common shares) and the Australian Stock Exchange (as CDIs) under the symbol AVM. It owns and operates the Dikulushi copper-silver mine and the Kulu copper tailings operation in the Katanga Province of the DRC.

(OTCBB: ITRO) operates the only plant in North America approved by the Environmental Protection Agency to recycle photochemicals, removing the heavy metals and turning the liquids into an environmentally friendly liquid fertilizer it markets under the GOLD'n GRO label. But it also removes the silver and from it manufactures a 5-ounce pure silver bar of numismatic quality which every year are numbered, pushing the silver bars' value up as collectors snap them up. \b \u001d  Itronics announced on January 23 that it was making its 2007 limited edition Silver Nevada Miner bars available to the public. It marks the seventh year in a row that the Company has offered a limited edition 5-ounce silver bar to the public and with it, growing demand. \b \u001d  Itronics founder Dr. John Whitney credited the public's rising interest in silver for the substantial increase in sales. \"In 2006 the price of silver was up 58 percent, generating significant consumer interest in this precious metal,\" said Dr. Whitney. \b \u001d  While sales rose substantially Itronics has had to go outside to buy silver in larger quantities in order to keep up with demand. That has meant buying the commodity on spot prices, which in the last month have been rising. That increase could support better margins for Itronics silver sales in the upcoming period. \b \u001d  Just days before the 2007 series Silver Nevada Miner bars were announced, Itronics reported that fourth quarter sales of silver bars rose 235 percent over the same period last year while fertilizer sales climbed 47 percent. But with silver prices closing in the $14 per ounce range on Friday, its existing inventory should add to the company's first quarter results. In a telephone interview, Whitney said that though silver prices were higher the increase would not be that substantial to Itronics' overall results, pointing out that GOLD'n GRO revenue was far outpacing silver bars. Dr. Whitney declined to give an early forecast ahead of the company's filings. \b \u001d  Monday, spot silver traded $14.02 to $14.07 an ounce in London, up from Friday's $13.95 to $14.00 price range.

(CNI) have caused the country's other major rail line, Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP), to declare force majeure on shipments to and from some terminals at Vancouver's North Shore, a CP Rail official confirmed Monday. \u001d  A memo was sent out last week declaring force majeure to any affected customers moving products to and from the North Shore of the Burrard Inlet in Vancouver, CP Rail spokesman Ed Greenberg said. \u001d  \"Overall, operations are functioning effectively,\" Greenberg said. \"However, we are experiencing a slowdown in traffic destined to CN-served locations on the North Shore.\" \u001d  Through a co-production agreement between the two railways, CN handles train switching operations on the North Shore. With management personnel handling the work of CN's striking conductors and yard workers, the interchange traffic on the North Shore isn't running very smoothly, according to Greenberg. \u001d  Greenberg couldn't talk about any particular shipments that were being affected by the force majeure. However, industry sources said grains and potash were both involved. Of Canada's major grain handlers, James Richardson International and the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (SWP.T) both have terminals on the North Shore of Burrard Inlet. \u001d  Greenberg said CP Rail wasn't actively seeking to pick up any incremental business as a result of the CN labor disruption. \"Our priority remains on CP customers,\" he said. \u001d  About 2,800 CN Rail employees have been on strike since Feb. 10. CN Rail maintains that the strike by the United Transportation Union is illegal, as the union's international leadership hasn't given its approval.

The new digital printer features a unique, small-footprint design and innovative fusing technology that results in better image quality and productivity than competitive systems. \b \u001d  With the addition of the 500 image-per-minute Xerox 495, the Xerox continuous-feed line now includes 11 different products that range in speed from 250 simplex to 1064 duplex ipm, giving commercial print shops, in-plant print operations and service bureaus even more flexibility to produce high-volume print jobs. \b \u001d  \"Xerox is targeting the continuous-feed market with the same intensity as the cut-sheet side of the business,\" said Quincy Allen, president, Xerox Production Systems Group. \"The Xerox 495 is a great example of our increasing investment in innovative continuous-feed technology to complement our production printing portfolio. And there is more to come.\" \b \u001d  The Xerox 495 system offers users the opportunity to produce new revenue-generating applications. Print providers can use the printer to expand beyond transactional jobs, such as invoices or statements, and efficiently tackle publishing applications like owners' manuals, catalogs and on-demand books that are typically reserved for cut-sheet printers. \b \u001d  The Xerox 495 offers a unique configuration for \"wide-web duplex printing.\" It is the only system currently on the market that simultaneously prints both sides of an 18\" wide web with a single, compact print engine. This design occupies about half the space of competitive twin-duplex configurations, saving significant space in a print operation. Printing duplex on a wide web is key to maximizing productivity for print-on-demand applications or two-up documents -- two individual statements or invoices on one sheet of paper. \b \u001d  \"The Xerox 495 is an affordable continuous-feed solution with a compact and flexible design that will bring a new dimension of productivity into transaction environments, particularly those where space is at a premium,\" said Jim Hamilton, director, InfoTrends On Demand Printing & Publishing Consulting Service. \b \u001d  A key competitive advantage of the Xerox 495 printer is its \"non-contact flash fusing\" technology. It creates an image using high-intensity flash lamps and a uniquely designed toner instead of conventional heat and pressure rollers. Flash fusing only heats the toner; there is no direct heat or pressure roller contact with the paper, maintaining moisture in the paper and minimizing or eliminating stock shrinkage, paper curl and static electricity. The result is improved registration and increased productivity and reliability because the chances of paper jamming during the printing or finishing processes are reduced. \b \u001d  Furthermore, the reliability of flash fusing technology allows document designers to use a wide range of substrates to create innovative applications that require adhesives, such as plastic identification cards and peel-off labels on statements, price tags and stickers, and RFID transponder inlays. \b \b   Entry-level offering \b \u001d  The printer's speed, image quality and flexibility let users quickly switch between print-on-demand jobs, such as newsletters and brochures, and transactional jobs, driving page-volume growth and profits across both segments of their business. The product is particularly suited for print providers seeking a high-volume system with more productivity than a cut-sheet digital printer. It is also aimed at users transitioning a single-stock application, where only one type of media is being used for the job, from cut-sheet to continuous-feed. \b \u001d  RPM Print & Design in the United Kingdom selected the Xerox 495 system for its productivity and image quality. \b \u001d  \"We had been looking at the continuous-feed market for some time but had been a little disappointed with the quality of the output, particularly the halftones,\" said Jonathan Harry, managing director, RPM Print & Design. \"But what really impressed us about the Xerox 495 was the superior image quality and speed it delivers. This printer is a real step forward in terms of economics of operation and quality.\" \b \b   The Xerox 495 printer also: \b \b   --  Prints on pin-fed paper, either roll or box fed, at 115 \b        feet-per-minute. \b \b   --  Runs 250 ipm in simplex mode, 500 ipm duplex, regardless of \b        the substrate being used. Many competitive machines have to \b        slow down for lightweight, heavier or specialty stocks. \b \b   --  Offers tight front-to-back registration and 600 dots-per-inch \b        resolution to enhance the graphics and photos accompanying \b        publishing and transactional printing applications. \b \b   --  Offers an easy auto-loading and auto-registration/alignment \b        system for quick or frequent stock changes for shorter run \b        lengths. \b \b   --  Operates simply and efficiently with a built-in Xerox print \b        controller and color touch-screen graphical user interface. \b \b   Availability and pricing \b \u001d  The Xerox 495 Continuous Feed Duplex Printer is immediately available in North America, Europe and developing markets through Xerox sales representatives at a list price of U.S. $425,000. \b \b   Customer Contacts: \b \u001d  For more information about Xerox production systems, software and services, visit www.xerox.com/products or call 800-ASK-XEROX. \b \u001d  NOTE TO EDITORS: For product photography and more information about Xerox, visit www.xerox.com/news.

LEUVEN, Belgium, February 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- \b \u001d  - GTM478 Module Incorporated in eMobile's Next Generation Broadband Terminal \"EM-ONE\" \b \u001d  Option (Euronext: OPTI; OPNVY), the leading wireless technology company, today announced that it is supplying eMobile Japan with both the new GTM478 embedded wireless module and the GlobeTrotter EXPRESS 7.2. Both products uniquely operate the 1.7 GHz frequency band. The wireless module is incorporated in the \"EM-ONE\", the next-generation mobile broadband device, designed to deliver a high-speed, always-on broadband environment as an alternative to a personal computer. The \"EM-ONE\" is manufactured by Sharp, Japan's leading vendor in mobile device development. The products were unveiled today by eMobile's Chairman and CEO Sachio Semmoto at the press conference in Tokyo announcing the launch of the HSDPA Mobile Data Service \"EM Mobile Broadband\" from March 31 2007. Also presenting at eMobile's press conference were Sharp, Qualcomm and Microsoft. \b \u001d  \"EM-ONE\" supports eMobile's HSDPA communications service with a maximum downlink speed of 3.6Mbps. \"EM-ONE\" adopts Japan's first W-VGA (800 X 480 dot) under Windows Mobile 5.0 environment, and is also equipped with the industry's first 4.1 inch high definition liquid crystal large screen. Such a screen enables the user to view PC websites without horizontal scrolling. Furthermore, \"EM-ONE\" is equipped with the same keyboard layout as a PCs yet at just 18.9 mm thick, the device is one of the thinnest mobile terminals with a QWERTY keyboard in Japan. \b \u001d  \"I am honoured that eMobile has selected Option as its partner for both for our new compact wireless module embedded in the \"EM-ONE\" and our GlobeTrotter EXPRESS 7.2 data card. eMobile is a pioneer of wireless broadband multimedia services and devices that go beyond the mobile phone and has an exciting vision for the future,\" said Jan Callewaert, CEO of Option. \"Our partnership with eMobile and Sharp recognises Option's world class wireless technology expertise and relentless customer focus.\" \b \u001d  The new GTM478 is a compact module with a board-to-board connector making it the ideal module for embedding into small mobile devices such as PDA's and mobile multimedia devices. It incorporates HSDPA, UMTS and EDGE, GPRS and GSM. It is designed to achieve peak HSDPA download speeds of 7.2 Mbps while backward compatibility ensures HSDPA connections can also be made at lower data rates of 3.6 Mbps and 1.8 Mbps with upload speeds to 384 Kbps. The GTM478 also supports both A-GPS and S-GPS. \b \u001d  The GlobeTrotter EXPRESS 7.2 Express Card, based on he PCI-standard, delivers true wireless broadband performance, while dual-antennae Advanced Receiver Technology sustains faster and more stable connections over wider coverage areas. For launches before availability of HSDPA 7.2 Mbps networks, the product can be provided with HSDPA 3.6Mbps and boosted to 7.2 Mbps via a simple firmware upgrade. In all cases backward compatibility ensures HSDPA connections at lower data rates of 3.6 Mbps and 1.8 Mbps. In spite of its advanced performance, the GlobeTrotter EXPRESS 7.2 is a truly \"plug and play\" device. When the EXPRESS 7.2 is inserted into the Express Card slot of a laptop, Option's patented Zero CD(R) technology automatically loads all necessary software and drivers from the data card itself: no software needs to be installed from a CD-ROM. \b \u001d  eMobile Ltd. is a subsidiary of eAccess Ltd.

Pretty much as soon as we went to press, the dollar rebounded, ultimately turning in a 10 percent gain against other major currencies in 2005. Our portfolio held up in spite of the bad call, returning 9 percent that year and beating the S&P 500 by two percentage points. Then, in 2006, the dollar returned to its downward trajectory, and we couldn't help but revisit the portfolio in 2007. The news was even better this time: The portfolio returned 38 percent, trouncing the S&P 500's 24 percent. \u001d  Sure, we were wrong (or as some investors call it, \"early\"), but at least we were in good company: Berkshire Hathaway lost more than $1 billion betting on the greenback's decline in 2005. And the dollar's resurgence didn't last long: In 2006, thanks in large part to the nation's massive trade deficit and low interest rates, it returned to the downward spiral begun in 2002. The decline indeed contributed to the spectacular overall return of our portfolio, though in the future, investors should evaluate these stocks on company-specific factors, not the direction of the dollar. \u001d  The top performer was Commercial Metals; the steelmaker's profit nearly tripled from 2004 to 2006 as steel prices skyrocketed. The weaker dollar, combined with higher worldwide demand, has sent the prices of all metals higher. Metal users worldwide switched to Commercial's product, which is made from recycled steel, instead of buying newly made, more expensive steel. But now that China has become a net exporter of steel, expect prices to fall, along with Commercial's pricing power. Its earnings -- and its stock -- don't have much room to grow. \u001d  Tractor maker Deere jumped 38 percent, but much of that growth came from investors betting that U.S. farmers would buy more equipment to plant more corn  for ethanol production. Deere sold only 2 percent more farm equipment abroad in 2006 than it did in 2005, so the weaker dollar didn't help much with sales. There are better investment ideas. \u001d  The weak dollar did help propel Colgate-Palmolive's stock 38 percent higher. Nearly a quarter of its $11 billion in sales comes from Brazil, Mexico and other Latin American nations, whose currencies gained the most ground versus the dollar. The greenback's more recent decline against the euro should benefit Colgate in 2007 since 28 percent of its sales comes from Europe. \u001d  And the world still loves Coca-Cola. More than 70 percent of its $24 billion in revenue comes from outside the U.S., and that helped Coke's stock rise 25 percent. However, Coke still has problems convincing more Americans and Japanese to drink The Real Thing, and those two nations make up nearly half of sales. At 20 times expected 2007 earnings, Coke isn't cheap, either. PepsiCo looks like a better buy. \u001d  3M's stock dropped over the past two years, but its dividend helped investors break even. The dollar's fall certainly helped sales, but any gains were canceled out by 3M's need to cut prices to unload excessive inventory, an issue that seems to have been resolved. The company bought back a record $1.2 billion worth of stock last summer at about the same price it commands now. Individual investors would do well to follow suit. \u001d  --- \b       THE DOLLAR IS FALLING, BUT RETURNS ARE NOT \b                                   Price    Price     Total \bCompany (Ticker)                  1/19/05   1/10/07   Return \b \b3M (MMM)                           $82.17    $77.85     -0.9% \bCoca-Cola (KO)                      41.10     48.68     25.0 \bColgate-Palmolive (CL)              50.07     66.04     37.7 \bCommercial Metals (CMC)             27.14*    25.30     89.9 \bDeere (DE)                          70.05     92.63     37.5 \bPortfolio                             -         -       37.9 \bS&P 500                               -         -       24.0 \b \b*Split-adjusted.
