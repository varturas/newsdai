\u001d  (This updates an item timed at 1316 GMT with comments from Merck's conference call and details of unsuccessful bidders) \u001d  By Andrew Dowell and Gangolf Schrimpf \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Mylan Laboratories Inc. (MYL) said late Saturday it has agreed to pay EUR4.9 billion ($6.7 billion) in cash for the generic drugs unit of Germany's Merck KGaA (MRK.XE). \u001d  The price is near the top of the EUR4 billion to EUR5 billion analysts had expected the unit to fetch. To pay down debt taken on to fund the deal, Mylan Laboratories said it will issue $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in equity or equity-linked securities and suspend its dividend. \u001d  The transaction will create a top global generic drugs company with combined revenues of $4.2 billion in 2006 and about 10,000 employees. Merck Generics was the world's No. 3 generics business by revenues in 2006, the companies said. \u001d  Merck said in early January that it was evaluating strategic options for the division, which in 2006 reported an operating profit of EUR307 million, up 29% on the year, on sales of EUR1.8 billion. \u001d  A spokeswoman for Merck said the proceeds will be used to reduce debt - which rose sharply when Merck took control of Serono for EUR10.6 billion at the start of this year - but that shareholders can also expect a dividend from the transaction. \u001d  Merck's net debt at March 31 was EUR5.46 billion. \u001d  Merck KGaA Chief Executive Karl-Ludwig Kley said on a conference call that Merck was aiming for both organic growth and growth through acquisition. He said the company was trying to build headroom for more purchases, but nothing concrete was on the agenda. \u001d  Merck KGaA isn't affiliated with Merck & Co. (MRK) of the U.S. \u001d  The deal will hurt Mylan Laboratories' cash earnings per share in the first year and be neutral in the second year, the company said. The company expects cost savings of $250 million by the end of the third year after the deal closes, seen in the second half of 2007. It doesn't plan to cut many jobs. \u001d  Members of the Merck unit's senior management, including Chief Executive Hank Klakurka, will make the move to Mylan Laboratories, the companies said in a release. \u001d  Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER), Citigroup Inc. (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are providing debt financing for Mylan Laboratories. Merrill Lynch advised Mylan Laboratories on the deal. \u001d  Among the losing bidders was Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) which said in a statement that the unit would have been a strategic fit but the deal didn't meet its \"stringent financial criteria.\" Other companies that were reportedly interested included India's Torrent Pharmaceuticals (500420.BY) and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.(500359.BY), Actavis Group HF (ACT.IC) of Iceland and a private-equity group comprising Bain Capital and Apax Partners. \u001d  Company web sites: http://www.merck.de \u001d  -By Andrew Dowell, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5175; andrew.dowell@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 11:26 ET (15:26 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1186ac1ef69eaa0faef569d0c4c2a675","symR":["NORGAN.OS","NO0010272636"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Norgani Hotels ASA","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T08:46:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NORGAN.OS","NO0010272636"],"IndustryCodes":["LOD","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Norgani Hotels ASA: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=NO0010272636 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 04:46 ET (08:46 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"11986013368d038b8bfda172c5a95654","symR":["RWF"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Cohen & Steers Worldwide Realty Income Fund (RWF)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T07:44:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RWF"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Cohen & Steers Worldwide Realty Income Fund (RWF): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=RWF or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 03:44 ET (07:44 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"11adff683e2f6fe9f41331ae28df14ac","symR":["SXT"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Sensient Technologies","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T09:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SXT"],"IndustryCodes":["CHM","CHS","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  Sensient Technologies: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=SXT or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 05:25 ET (09:25 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"11e03bf6b2f6ad71a0e40dea588c72f4","symR":["RET.LN","GB00B05KXB62"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Retec Digital plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T09:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RET.LN","GB00B05KXB62"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","MED"],"Story":"\u001d  Retec Digital plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B05KXB62 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"11ed7358991a6c64153f594826838275","symR":["DCX","DCX.XE","MG.A.T","MG.B.T","MGA","ONXC","CA5592224011","CA5592225000","DE0007100000"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Magna, Onex Want Majority Stake In Chrysler - Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T12:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DCX","DCX.XE","MG.A.T","MG.B.T","MGA","ONXC","CA5592224011","CA5592225000","DE0007100000"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","BLD","OTA","XDAX","XDJGI","XES","XNYA","XST5","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Magna International Inc.

(NYSE: KOR) (\"Koor\", \"Company\"), a leading Israeli holding company, announced today that its affiliated company, Makhteshim Agan Industries Ltd. (\"MAI\"), a company in which Koor currently holds approximately 39%, made the following announcement today in connection with its 2005 employee share option plan: \b \u001d  On March 13, 2005, MAI's Board of Directors approved an employee share option plan. Relying on the transitional rules of Accounting Standard 24, \"Share-Based Payments\", MAI in its financial reports according to Israeli GAAP did not apply that Standard to the grants made under the option plan, and did not record an expense in respect thereof, pursuant to the Standard's transitional rules which provide that the Standard applies to grants after March 15, 2005, and which had not vested prior to January 1, 2006. \b \u001d  In connection with review of the draft prospectus submitted by MAI for listing of bonds it issued, and following a meeting with the staff of the Israeli Securities Authority on May 8, 2007, questions arose regarding the factual circumstances leading to removal of the grants from application of the aforesaid Standard. \b \u001d  Had Standard 24 been applied to all of the grants made under the 2005 option plan, MAI estimates the maximum additional expense that would have been recorded in its financial reports according to Israeli GAAP in respect thereof at the sum of approximately $6 million in 2005, approximately $8 million in 2006 (approximately $2 million per quarter) and approximately $2 million in the first quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  MAI's Board of Directors has decided to re-examine the facts on the basis of which the grants were treated for accounting purposes, under the supervision of MAI's Audit Committee. If the outcome of the examination indicates that MAI should have applied the Standard to the aforesaid grants, or part thereof, and taking into account the materiality of this matter, MAI may restate its financial statements according to Israeli GAAP for the years 2005 and 2006 and for the first quarter of 2007, by the maximum amounts stated above. \b \u001d  In the event that MAI shall restate its financial statements according to Israeli GAAP as described above, under Israeli GAAP Koor's share in the maximum additional expenses to be recorded by MAI will amount to approximately $1.9 million, $2.8 million and $0.8 million in respect of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 and for the first quarter of 2007, respectively and Koor may restate its financial reports accordingly. \b \b    About Koor Industries \b \u001d  Koor Industries is a leading Israeli holding company, focusing on high-growth, internationally-oriented, Israeli companies. Koor actively invests in agrochemicals through Makhteshim Agan Industries; in telecommunications through its holdings in ECI Telecom, ECTel and Telrad Networks; and in venture capital through Koor Corporate Venture Capital.

\b   By Nedra Pickler \b   Of THE ASSOCIATED PRESS \b \u001d  WASHINGTON (AP)--Democratic-controlled Washington stepped in to help save Chrysler nearly 30 years ago when the automaker was on the verge of bankruptcy due to lackluster sales of its fuel-thirsty vehicles. \u001d  With the Big Three U.S. automakers struggling again, many political leaders now are taking the industry to task for failing to do more to reduce how much gas their vehicles use. The Democratic presidential candidates are pledging tougher gas mileage rules. Automakers say such changes would hurt an industry already down. \u001d  But the political climate is turning against the companies. Concern is increasing about global warming. Pump prices are high. People are worried about U.S. dependence on oil from the Middle East. \u001d  \"We're talking about saving the auto industry from itself,\" said Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd, who is proposing the highest increase of any presidential candidate. \u001d  Dodd wants to double the average fuel economy for each automaker, to 50 miles to per gallon by 2017. \u001d  \"The industry just digs its heels in to fight any of these changes, but it's hard to maintain a very sympathetic ear when you realize that other (foreign) automakers are moving\" in the direction of more fuel-efficient vehicles and \"devouring market share in the country,\" Dodd said in a telephone interview. \"Why aren't we doing this?\" \u001d  Other Democratic candidates have talked about mileage increases, too: \u001d  -New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a former energy secretary, also wants to reach 50 mpg, but his deadline would be three years later than Dodd's. Richardson plans to offer details of his proposal Thursday. \u001d  -Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards wants 40 mpg by 2016. He has urged his audiences to consider sacrificing their gas-guzzling vehicles for the good of the country. In a campaign line that he uses often and that wins applause, the 2004 vice presidential nominee says, \"It's time for Americans to be patriotic about something other than war.\" \u001d  -New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to announce her proposal for increasing fuel economy in the coming weeks. Clinton spokesman Phil Singer noted that in the past she has supported increasing fuel efficiency by 10 mpg over the next decade. \u001d  -At a speech last Monday at the Detroit Economic Club, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama lectured automakers on their home turf for investing in bigger, faster cars while dependency on oil is jeopardizing U.S. security and the global environment. \u001d  \"The auto industry is on a path that is unsustainable for their business, for their workers, and for America, and America must take action to make it right,\" Obama said. \"That's why my first proposal will require automakers to meet higher fuel standards and produce more fuel-efficient cars, while providing them the flexibility and assistance to do it.\" \u001d  Obama's speech irritated industry officials. They say the sentiment he expressed - while shared by other political leaders - ignores the reality that they are making the vehicles that people in the U.S. want to buy: Cars and trucks with big engines, towing capacity and room for passengers. \u001d  Dave McCurdy, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who recently took over as president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said Obama's presentation was \"great campaign speak.\" \u001d  \"A politician talks about, 'Well we're going to help you and my pollster says this and my interest group says this,\"' McCurdy said. \"The executive has to make a cold, calculated decision about whether he's betting the future of his company on a technology that may or may not be there because the consumer will decide what they want to buy.\" \u001d  Auto executives have said they support an increase in government standards, as long it is determined by experts at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u001d  They appear to have a more sympathetic ear among Republican presidential candidates, including Arizona Sen. John McCain. McCain has voted for some fuel economy increases in the past, but says he would negotiate with automakers on the appropriate increase if he were president. \u001d  \"I'm not prepared to name a certain number,\" McCain said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"I'm hopeful that the marketplace itself and the sale of hybrid cars - the (Toyota) Prius, electric cars - would address this issue in an effective fashion.\" \u001d  Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney opposes increasing the standards without taking other steps that include increased use of alternatives fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel and the development of hybrid technologies, said his campaign spokesman, Kevin Madden. \u001d  Republican Sen. Sam Brownback has voted against increased standards in the past, but said the threat of U.S. dependence on foreign oil has him so concerned that he would consider changing his position. He said an increase couldn't be so steep that it would endanger the U.S. auto industry while it is at financial risk. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 16:10 ET (20:10 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1898fe8f110374402cb193cb48a95077","symR":["CII"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc.

\u001d  (This updates an item timed at 0318 GMT with additional details of Merck's use of the proceeds and a statement from Teva.) \u001d  By Andrew Dowell and Gangolf Schrimpf \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \u001d  Mylan Laboratories Inc. (MYL) said Saturday it has agreed to pay EUR4.9 billion ($6.7 billion) in cash for the generic drugs unit of Merck KGaA (MRK.XE). \u001d  The price is near the top of the EUR4 billion to EUR5 billion analysts had expected the unit to fetch. To pay down debt taken on to fund the deal, Mylan Laboratories said it will issue $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in equity or equity-linked securities and suspend its dividend. \u001d  The transaction will create a top global generic drugs company with combined revenues of $4.2 billion in 2006 and about 10,000 employees. Merck Generics was the world's No. 3 generics business by revenues in 2006, the companies said. Merck said in early January that it was evaluating strategic options for the division, which in 2006 reported an operating profit of EUR307 million, up 29% on the year, on sales of EUR1.8 billion. \u001d  A spokeswoamn for Merck said the proceeds will be used to reduce debt - which rose sharply when Merck took control Serono for EUR10.6 billion at the start of this year - but that shareholders can also expect a dividend from the transaction. \u001d  The deal will hurt Mylan Laboratories' cash earnings per share in the first year and be neutral in the second year, the company said. The company expects cost savings of $250 million by the end of the third year after the deal closes, seen in the second half of 2007. It doesn't plan to cut many jobs. \u001d  Members of the Merck unit's senior management, including Chief Executive Hank Klakurka, will make the move to Mylan Laboratories, the companies said in a release. \u001d  Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER), Citigroup Inc. (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are providing debt financing for Mylan Laboratories. Merrill Lynch advised Mylan Laboratories on the deal. \u001d  Merck KGaA isn't affiliated with Merck & Co. (MRK) of the U.S. \u001d  Among the losing bidders was Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) which said in a statement that the unit would have been a strategic fit but the deal didn't meet its \"stringent financial criteria.\" \u001d  -By Andrew Dowell, Dow Jones Newswires;

Berman \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  Private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management appears to be the winning bidder for the Chrysler Group and an announcement on the deal could come Monday, people familiar with the matter said. \u001d  DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) would get a substantial payment for the transaction, and unload Chrysler's $18 billion pension and health-care liability off of its balance sheet, these people said. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  Chrysler Chief Executive Tom LaSorda would continue to run the company while former Chrysler Chief Operating Officer and Cerberus adviser Wolfgang Bernhard wouldn't have an executive role, but could have a board seat. \u001d  The key to the deal, people familiar with the discussions say, isn't the headline price but what happened to the company's $18 billion in pension and health-care liabilities, essentially a debt owed to Chrysler's United Auto Workers employees. Daimler's goal is to get this debt off the German company's books. \u001d  Daimler would contribute Chrysler into a new corporation while keeping a minority stake in the business, people familiar with the matter said. Chrysler's $18 billion in pension and health-care liabilities would travel along with the rest of the company. The new company would be majority-owned by the new buyer. This party would then contribute a big slug of equity to fund the operations. \u001d  However, the process could still change until an agreement is signed, people familiar with the matter said. \u001d  Cerberus was seen as a strong contender because of its financial resources and its ability to create synergies with Chrysler Financial due to Cerberus' 51% stake in GMAC, the financing arm of General Motors Corp. (GM). If Cerberus emerged as the winner, analysts and deal makers say it could slash costs by consolidating Chrysler Financial and GMAC. \u001d  Cerberus strengthened its bid even further after it hired Bernhard as an adviser. Bernhard is highly regarded by his former Chrysler colleagues and was seen as a hands-on manager. \u001d  However, a sale to Cerberus will likely face opposition from the unions, which have said they oppose a private equity takeover of Chrysler. The UAW, in particular, has a contentious relationship with Cerberus because of a deal to purchase auto supplier Delphi Corp. (DPHIQ). Cerberus, which was leading a group of Delphi investors, will likely pull out of the deal after the UAW refused to give in to demands for wage cuts. \u001d  Other parties bidding for Chrysler were Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc. (MGA) and a team made up of the Blackstone Group and Centerbridge Capital Partners, which both submitted a second round of bids recently. Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, who publicly offered $4.5 billion in cash for Chrysler, was frozen out of the talks. \b \u001d  -By Jason Singer, Gina Chon and Dennis K.

Reid and Anne Flaherty \b   Of THE ASSOCIATED PRESS \b \u001d  BAGHDAD (AP)--A string of heavy losses from powerful roadside bombs has raised new questions about the vulnerability of the Stryker, the Army's troop-carrying vehicle hailed by supporters as the key to a leaner, more mobile force. \u001d  Since the Strykers went into action in violent Diyala province north of Baghdad two months ago, losses of the vehicles have been rising steadily, U.S. officials said. \u001d  A single infantry company in Diyala lost five Strykers this month in less than a week, according to soldiers familiar with the losses, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorized to release the information. The overall number of Strykers lost recently is classified. \u001d  In one of the biggest hits, six American soldiers and a journalist were killed when a huge bomb exploded beneath their Stryker on May 6. It was the biggest one-day loss for the battalion in more than two years. \u001d  \"We went for several months with no losses and were very proud of that,\" a senior Army official said in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity because he isn't authorized to comment publicly. \"Since then, there have been quite a few Stryker losses.\" \u001d  \"They are learning how to defeat them,\" the Army official said of Iraqi insurgents. \u001d  The Army introduced the $11 billion, eight-wheeled Stryker in 1999 as the cornerstone of a ground force of the future - hoping to create faster, more agile armored units than tank-equipped units, but with more firepower and protection than light-infantry units. \u001d  But the Army and the Marines are already looking for something different that can survive big roadside bombs - the main threat to soldiers in Iraq - meaning the Stryker's high-profile status as the Army's \"next generation\" vehicle may be short-lived. \u001d  \"It is indeed an open question if the Stryker is right for this type of warfare,\" said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior analyst with the Brookings Institution. \"I am inclined to think that the concept works better for peacekeeping. But based on data the Army has made available to date, it's hard to be sure.\" \u001d  Supporters of the Strykers, which have been used in Iraq since late 2003, say the vehicles that carry two crew members and 11 infantrymen offer mobility, firepower and comfort. \u001d  Lighter and faster than tracked vehicles like tanks, each Stryker can rush soldiers quickly to a fight, enabling commanders to maintain security over a wide area with relatively fewer troops. Humvees can carry only four soldiers - and are more vulnerable to bombs even when their armor is upgraded. \u001d  But some analysts have long questioned the wisdom of moving away from more heavily armored tracked vehicles like tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles to wheeled transports, like the Stryker. \u001d  They say that is especially true in Iraq, where powerful bombs - not rocket-propelled grenades or small arms fire - are the main threat. \u001d  \"The Stryker vehicle was conceived at a time when the Army was more concerned about mobility and agility than it was about protection,\" said Loren Thompson, a military analyst from the Lexington Institute. \"Stryker was the answer to that need.\" \u001d  The Stryker's vulnerabilities have become increasingly apparent since a battalion of about 700 soldiers and nearly 100 Stryker vehicles from the Army's 2nd Infantry Division was sent to Diyala province in March to bolster an infantry brigade struggling to restore order there. \u001d  Trouble started as soon as the Strykers arrived in Baqouba, the provincial capital of Diyala. \u001d  U.S. commanders ordered the vehicles into Baqouba's streets at dawn the day after they arrived. The hope was that the large, menacing vehicles - armed with a heavy machine gun and a 105mm cannon - would intimidate insurgents and reassure local residents. \u001d  Instead, insurgents hammered the Strykers with automatic weapons fire, rocket-propelled grenades and a network of roadside bombs. By the end of that first day, one U.S. soldier was dead, 12 were wounded and two Strykers were destroyed. \u001d  Losses have since mounted. A few days before the attack that killed the six soldiers and a Russian journalist, troops scrambled out of another damaged Stryker and took cover in a house while they watched the vehicle burn. Several of them were injured but none seriously. \u001d  Lt. Col. Bruce Antonio, who commands a Stryker battalion in Diyala, said he and soldiers still have confidence in the Strykers and noted they had survived many bombs, which the military calls improvised explosive device or IEDs. \u001d  But Antonio said some insurgents had found \"the right mix of explosives and IED positioning to inflict severe damage on the vehicle.\" He also noted that tanks had also proved vulnerable too. \u001d  The insurgents also apparently are becoming better at hiding the devices - the IED that killed the six soldiers and the journalist was believed hidden in a sewer line. To add potency, insurgents surrounded the device with cement to channel the blast force up into the tank, according to soldiers familiar with the investigation. \u001d  Supporters of the Strykers say all that proves that it's the lethality of bombs in Iraq - not the Strykers themselves - that are the problem: The bombs are now so powerful that even Abrams main battle tanks are vulnerable to some of them. \u001d  \"I'm not sure if it's any reflection on the (Stryker) but rather on how things are getting worse\" in Iraq, according to a senior Democratic congressional staffer who tracks Army programs, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly. \u001d  Stryker soldiers said that when they were based in Mosul in the north, roadside bombs weren't so big - often, little more than pipe bombs. In Baqouba, the bombs are bigger and buried deeper, making them difficult to detect. \u001d  \"With what we got hit with the other day, it wouldn't have mattered what we were in,\" said Spc. John Pearce, speaking of the May 6 bomb. \"We were going to take casualties, regardless.\" \u001d  Either way, the Army and Marine Corps already are pushing for new Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, or MRAPS, whose V-shaped hulls are designed to deflect bomb blasts outward, rather than through the vehicle. \u001d  The Pentagon has requested nearly 7,800 of the new vehicles at a cost of $8.4 billion and is considering ordering thousands more to give soldiers better protection. \u001d  Such moves, however, serve only to reinforce the views of critics, who believe the Army opted for a vehicle that was useful in Balkan peacekeeping or other \"low threat\" missions but is inadequate in so-called \"asymmetric warfare,\" where a weaker opponent devises simple tools to exploit a strong opponent's weak points. \u001d  \"As long as the Stryker-equipped light infantry was used...against lightly armed insurgents, there was no problem,\" said retired Col. Douglas Macgregor, who writes on defense issues. \u001d  \"Now, they are being tossed into the urban battle where only tracked armor can survive.\" \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 15:45 ET (19:45 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2078d1fc31e527bbce6cd076c55c9b0b","symR":["NGK"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen CT Dividend Adv Muni Fund 2 (NGK)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T08:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NGK"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen CT Dividend Adv Muni Fund 2 (NGK): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NGK or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 04:50 ET (08:50 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"20cc2365142b2a1a9e5ff737f7c57da2","symR":["LLOY.LN","LYG","GB0008706128"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Lloyds TSB Group PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T08:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LLOY.LN","LYG","GB0008706128"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\u001d  Lloyds TSB Group PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0008706128 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 04:30 ET (08:30 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"20cc7239e8543805eebd7766af1316cd","symR":["HRI.LN","GB0004228648"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Herald Investment Trust plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T08:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["HRI.LN","GB0004228648"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Herald Investment Trust plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0004228648 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 04:09 ET (08:09 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"211851c9632ba4d4a791a8c904957ad6","symR":["PCK"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for PIMCO California Municipal Income Fund II (PCK)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T09:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PCK"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  PIMCO California Municipal Income Fund II (PCK): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=PCK or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 05:11 ET (09:11 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"2144b5537be8aa4c7fb7e57dc4f57e49","symR":["MUA"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for BlackRock MuniAssets Fund, Inc.

 LONDON (Dow Jones)--Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN) chairman Tom McKillop was warned by at least four major institutional investors last week not to overpay for ABN Amro Holding NV, The Sunday Telegraph reports. \u001d  The RBS-led consortium has made a EUR72 billion bid to acquire ABN Amro. \u001d  The paper, which quoted an unnamed top-10 investor in the bank, said shareholders are demanding detailed evidence on the cost and revenue savings that the consortium expects from a deal. \u001d  The paper also said that Merrill Lynch, as adviser to the consortium that includes Fortis NV (FOSRY) and Santander Central Hispano SA (STD), has lined up European and U.S. banks to underwrite the offer, while Fortis has gained informal support from investors for a possibly huge rights issue for its involvement. \u001d  A spokeswoman for RBS declined to comment on the report, but noted that McKillop recently advised shareholders at the group's AGM in late April that the bank wouldn't overpay for the assets. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.telegraph.co.uk \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9320 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May

\u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Compass Group PLC (CMPGY) said Saturday that it has agreed to sell its Selecta European vending business to a company managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH for GBP772.5 million on a debt and cash-free basis. \u001d  The company also said it intends to return GBP500 million of the proceeds to shareholders by way of a share buyback program over the next 12-18 months. The buyback would be in addition to the return of GBP500 million to shareholders following the sale of SSP and Moto in 2006. \u001d  Compass said it will contribute GBP45 million of the proceeds to its U.K. pension plans, taking the total amount of special contributions to the Compass U.K. pension plans over the past 12 months to GBP325 million. The remaining proceeds of the deal, which is expected to close in July, will be used to reduce net debt, the company said. \u001d  Compass said the disposal is conditional upon Competition Clearances, and is subject to closing adjustments. Tax and other transaction costs are expected to be about GBP20 million. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.compass-group.com \u001d  -By Henry E.

\u001d  LOS ANGELES (AP)--Even when he takes a huge fall, Spider-Man comes out on top. \u001d  Sony's \"Spider-Man 3\" took in $60 million in its second weekend, a hefty 60% drop from its record debut a week earlier but good enough to easily outdistance the competition and remain the No. 1 movie, according to studio estimates Sunday. \u001d  \"After a record-breaking opening weekend, to me this is an appropriate second-weekend drop,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Media By Numbers. \"Any studio would be happy to have a movie opening with $60 million, let alone a second weekend with $60 million.\" \u001d  With $242.1 million domestically in just 10 days, \"Spider-Man 3\" continued to beat the box-office pace of its predecessors. After 10 days, 2002's \"Spider-Man\" had grossed $223 million, while 2004's \"Spider-Man 2\" had taken in $225 million. \u001d  \"Spider-Man 3\" quickly became the year's top-grossing film, hurtling past \"300,\" the Warner Bros. battle epic that has taken in $208 million. \u001d  Second-weekend drops for successful studio films typically are well below 50%. But \"Spider-Man 3\" shattered records with $151.1 million in its first weekend, making a big decline virtually inevitable since so many people already had seen the film. \u001d  \"When you're in that stratosphere, we had to assume we would be in the range of a 60% drop,\" said Rory Bruer, head of distribution for Sony. \u001d  The weekend's other new movies had fair to poor openings. \u001d  Debuting in second place with $10 million was Fox Atomic's horror sequel \"28 Weeks Later,\" a follow up to \"28 Days Later\" that continues the story of a virus in Britain that turns people into raging, cannibalistic zombies. \u001d  Universal's \"Georgia Rule,\" starring Lindsay Lohan, Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman, opened at No. 3 with $5.9 million. Lohan plays a rebellious teen who's put under the charge of her no-nonsense grandma (Fonda). \u001d  Lionsgate's \"Delta Farce\" premiered at No. 5 with $3.5 million. Larry the Cable Guy stars in the comedy about three weekend warriors mistakenly dumped in Mexico, where they take on a gang of bandits. \u001d  The Weinstein Co. and MGM's workplace comedy \"The Ex\" tanked with $1.4 million, coming in at No. 12. The movie stars Zach Braff as a husband dueling with a co-worker who also is his wife's ex-boyfriend. \u001d  \"Spider-Man 3\" made up for an otherwise soft crop of movies. The top-12 films took in $96.9 million, up 14% from the same weekend last year, when \"Mission: Impossible 3\" was No. 1 with $25 million and \"Poseidon\" debuted in second place with $22.2 million. \u001d  Overseas, \"Spider-Man 3\" pulled in an additional $85.5 million for the weekend, raising its international total to $380 million and worldwide total to $622 million. The previous \"Spider-Man\" movies each took in about $800 million worldwide. \u001d  \"Spider-Man 3\" has a shot at topping $1 billion worldwide, Bruer said. Only three other movies, \"Titanic,\" \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,\" have hit that mark. \u001d  After two weekends of light competition, \"Spider-Man 3\" faces the summer's next heavy-hitter Friday with the debut of DreamWorks Animation's \"Shrek the Third,\" the latest adventure of the cartoon ogre. \u001d  A week later, Disney's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" sails into theaters, the Johnny Depp action comedy joining \"Spider-Man 3\" and \"Shrek the Third\" to set up what could be Hollywood's biggest Memorial Day weekend ever. \u001d  Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Media By Numbers LLC. Final figures will be released Monday. \u001d  1. \"Spider-Man 3,\" $60 million \u001d  2. \"28 Weeks Later,\" $10 million \u001d  3. \"Georgia Rule,\" $5.9 million \u001d  4. \"Disturbia,\" $4.8

\u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Pentax Corp.'s (7750.TO) theoretical share price comes to an estimated Y633, according to a Nikkei Financial Daily calculation based on a medium-term business plan announced Friday by the camera and optical equipment manufacturer, the newspaper reported in its  Monday edition. \u001d  This figure falls short of the Y770 tender offer price under consideration by Hoya Corp. (7741.TO), which is seeking a business integration with Pentax. \u001d  The theoretical share price assumes that Pentax will achieve its growth targets through the year ending March 31, 2010, and continue to record steady expansion.  It factors in a discount rate of 4%, a group dividend payout ratio of around 28.5% - in line with the firm's projection for the current fiscal year - and an effective tax rate of 40%. \u001d  The share price was calculated based on Nikkei Digital Media Inc.'s NEEDS-cBRAIN corporate information data service.  The sum of projected net profit for the next 20 years and shareholder equity in 20 years' time was discounted to present value. \u001d  Pentax, which unveiled the business plan as an alternative after it rebuffed a proposed merger with Hoya, will now need to explain its measures aimed at improving enterprise value to top shareholder Sparx Group Co. (8739.JA) and others calling for a management overhaul. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 13:45 ET (17:45

However, a court in Amsterdam had said earlier in May that a deal requires shareholder approval. \u001d  Lewis said buying an investment bank in continental Europe \"could be an option if the price is

\u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--This summer's bonuses at 247 major corporations will average Y831,009, up 3.05%, for a fifth straight year-on-year rise, according to interim data compiled Sunday by Nikkei Inc. \u001d  Automakers and steelmakers will dole out more than Y1 million per employee on average, reflecting their robust earnings, The Nikkei reported in its Monday morning edition. \u001d  With Japanese companies increasingly exposed to harsh global competition, they remain reluctant to boost base pay, which would increase their fixed costs. \u001d  This summer's planned increase in bonuses is up 0.99 percentage point from last year's 2.06%. \u001d  Bonuses at manufacturers are expected to rise 4.96%, almost matching the 4.99% of 2003 that marked the highest jump since the bursting of the economic bubble.  Automaker bonuses will average Y1.04 million, up 9.31% and exceeding Y1 million for the first time. \u001d  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203.TO) will top the list in yen terms.  With parent-only operating profit for fiscal 2006 having set a record, the firm will pay an average of Y1.43 million per employee. \u001d  \"Robust earnings will be reflected in bonuses,\" President Katsuaki Watanabe says.  Japan's largest automaker kept its 2007 pay raises at the same level as last year's. \u001d  Steelmakers see their bonuses rising 3.24%, topping Y1 million for a second straight year, with the figures coming to 5.48% at manufacturers of nonferrous metals and 4.67% at chemical companies. Of the top 10 risers in percentage terms, eight are materials makers. \u001d  Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. (5713.TO) - second only to Toyota in yen terms, with a planned Y1.15 million payout - rejected labor's request for a base pay raise but fully met its bonus request. \u001d  \"We will share the earnings growth with employees,\" says an official at electric furnace steelmaker Yamato Kogyo Co. (5444.TO), which ranked fifth in yen terms. \u001d  Nonmanufacturers, on average, will increase bonuses for the first time in two years, if not by much.  The hike will come to 0.28%, with two of nine industry categories - railways and buses on the one hand, and trucking on the other - reporting increases after declining last year. \u001d  At 425 major companies, base pay raises averaged 1.77% for 2007.  As they face intensifying global competition and pressure to defend themselves from takeover attempts, they would rather spend more on rewarding shareholders and on plants and equipment. \b \u001d

The violence has forced the central government to re-evaluate some of its policies for acquiring such land, and it encourages companies to negotiate with rural residents directly instead of purchasing property for them. Posco's plans represent a high-profile test of the policy. \u001d  Three Posco employees were visiting the proposed project site Friday afternoon when their car was surrounded by villagers wielding bamboo poles and a window was smashed, according to Choudhury Pranavananda Das, a public-relations executive with Posco and one of the three who was detained. The trio also were pushed and shoved, two other observers said. \u001d  The protesters escorted Mr. Das and the two other Posco employees to the village of Dhinkia, the heart of a movement opposing the project. A female Posco employee was quickly released. The two men weren't let go until early Saturday morning, after they signed a statement promising not to return, according to Mr. Das and the leader of the anti-Posco movement, Abhaya Sahoo. \u001d  \"We told them that this was between the government and the people,\" Mr. Sahoo said in a telephone interview. \"Why did they have to come?\" \u001d  No arrests have yet been made in connection with the incident, according to Y.K. Jethwa, the superintendent of police for the Jagatsinghpur district. \u001d  Posco aims to acquire about 1,600 hectares of land to build a facility able to produce 12 million metric tons of steel a year in what would be one of the biggest foreign investments in India. The plant is to be linked to the world with new roads, bridges and a dedicated seaport. Iron ore, the major steelmaking ingredient, will come from nearby mines. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 17:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

\bTEL AVIV, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 13, 2007-- \u001d  Makhteshim Agan, the world's leading generic provider of crop protection products and ranked 7th in the world's agrochemical sector, has today reported its results for the first quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  The Company reported record sales during the first quarter of 2007, which amounted to $559.3 million, compared to $493.9 million in 2006, an increase of 13.3%. The Company also reported record net profit, which amounted to $66.6 million, compared to $57.7 million in 2006, an increase of 15.4%. EBITDA amounted to $119.2 million, compared to $96.3 million in 2006, an increase of 23.8%. \b \u001d  The growth in sales compared with the corresponding quarter in 2006 stemmed mainly from mild climate conditions in Europe, which brought about early, high level demand for crop protection products, as well as strengthening of the Euro which increased the dollar value of sales. An increase in demand for agricultural produce such as corn, sugar cane and soy also caused an increase in derivative demand for the Company's products. \b \u001d  In Europe, sales amounted to $268.5 million compared to $229.9 million in 2006, an increase of 16.8%. \b \u001d  In South America, sales amounted to $105.2 million, compared to $83.2 million in 2006, an increase of 26.4%. The increase stems mainly from Brazil. \b \u001d  Avraham Bigger, Chairman and CEO of Makhteshim Agan, said that: \"The improvement in the agrochemical sector over recent months provides support for relentless implementation of the change and efficiency improvement plan we launched two months ago. Makhteshim Agan has continued growing at a faster pace than most of its peers, as happened in the difficult year of 2006 as well as in earlier and better years for the sector. Notwithstanding this performance, we operate in a sector that is both cyclical and seasonal, which is affected by factors that are external to the Company such as climate, currencies and the prices of agricultural produce.\" \b \u001d  Avraham Bigger added that the change and efficiency improvement plan, which the Company launched in March, is progressing according to its timetable. The Global Leadership Group has been launched and started operating. Responsibilities for Product Development and Marketing, Finance and IT at the head office of the Company and subsidiaries Makhteshim and Agan have been integrated. Preparation for integration of responsibilities in the areas of sales and production is ongoing, such integration being planned to take place in the coming months. In the area of purchasing, a combined team comprising both Makhteshim and Agan personnel has been working for several weeks and is progressing toward centralizing purchasing and making use of the group's size advantages, and the process of planning the group-wide supply chain continues. \b \u001d  Ran Maidan, the Company's CFO, said that: \"Gross profit in the first quarter of this year amounted to $198 million, representing growth of 11% compared with 2006. Operating profit amounted to $100 million, representing growth of 19.6% compared to 2006. The slight decline of gross profitability to 35.4% rather than 36.1% in 2006 stems from erosion of prices during 2006, which stabilized during the first quarter, and which was offset by improvements in the cost of raw materials. Operating profitability increased to 17.9% compared to 16.9% in 2006, due to containment of operating expenses lower than the increase in sales.\" \b \u001d  The delay in releasing the Company's financial results was due an issue that was raised the day prior to their planned release, as explained in note 3(4) of the financials statements, which is summarized in the following: \b \u001d  On March 13, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved an employee share option plan, an immediate report and related description in respect of which was published on March 14, 2005. Relying on the transitional rules of Accounting Standard 24, \"Share-Based Payments\", the Company did not apply that Standard to the grants made under the option plan, and did not record an expense in respect thereof, pursuant to the Standard's transitional rules which provide that the Standard applies to grants after March 15, 2005, and which had not vested prior to January 1, 2006. \b \u001d  In connection with review of the draft prospectus submitted by the Company for listing of bonds it issued, and following a meeting with the staff of the Israeli Securities Authority on May 8, 2007, questions arose regarding the factual circumstances leading to removal of the grants from application of the aforesaid Standard. \b \u001d  Had Standard 24 been applied to all of the grants made under the 2005 option plan, the Company estimates the maximum additional expense that would have been recorded in respect thereof at the sum of approximately $6 million in 2005, approximately $8 million in 2006 (approximately $2 million per quarter) and approximately $2 million in the first quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  The Company's Board of Directors has decided to re-examine the facts on the basis of which the grants were treated for accounting purposes, under the supervision of the Company's Audit Committee. If the outcome of the examination indicates that the Company should have applied the Standard to the aforesaid grants, or part thereof, and taking into account the materiality of this matter, the Company may restate its financial statements for the years 2005 and 2006 and for the first quarter of 2007, by the maximum amounts stated above. \b \b    CONTACT: Makhteshim Agan \b             Ron Zakai, 972-3-6947965 \b             Mobile: 972-52-7310002 \b             Investor Relations Manager and Corporate Secretary \b             ron.z@main.co.il \b \b    SOURCE: Makhteshim Agan \bCopyright Business Wire 2007 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 03:45 ET (07:45 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9e50abfafa58bce0b52ba97a8bc2a8da","symR":["KIM"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Kimco Realty Corporation","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T08:31:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KIM"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  Kimco Realty Corporation: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=KIM or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 04:31 ET (08:31 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9e55e7a288fe6432a39d428eb1ee806c","symR":["DHI"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for D.R.

\u001d  TOKYO (Nikkei)--Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316.TO) plans to boost its annual dividends by Y3,000 per share for the year ending March 2008 from fiscal 2006's Y7,000, The Nikkei learned Sunday. \u001d  SMFG will announce this second straight dividend hike May 21, the day it releases its fiscal 2006 earnings, The Nikkei reported in its Monday morning edition. \u001d  The group's net profit appears to have declined 36% to about Y440 billion, mainly because of such one-time factors as huge losses at a consumer lending subsidiary. But SMFG decided to announce the dividend hike early in the fiscal year based on its confidence that profit will grow. \u001d  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306.TO) is discussing increasing dividends by about Y1,000 from fiscal 2006's Y10,000. \u001d  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411.TO) says it has not yet decided whether to raise its dividends. But it doesn't want to be overshadowed by rivals, so it is likely to consider a hike of its own. \u001d  Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co. (8403.TO) may also raise dividends, as it seeks to boost its payout ratio to 30% in the medium term. \u001d  Most major banks' payout ratios are still low, as they have focused on repaying public funds and rebuilding their finances. Their ratios of around 10% are far below the 40%-50% of the U.S.-based Citigroup Inc. (C) and the U.K.-based HSBC Holdings PLC (HBC) as well as the 20%-plus average for publicly traded Japanese companies. \u001d  Combined net profit at Japan's six major banking groups is expected to decline to around Y2.5 trillion from about Y3.1 trillion in fiscal 2005. \u001d  SMFG, MUFG and Mizuho are expected to report double-digit drops in profit for the year ended March 31, mainly because of loan-loss reserves against possible defaults by nonbank lenders. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 13:57 ET (17:57

2007-- \u001d  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NASDAQ: TEVA) announced today that, as the global market leader in generic pharmaceuticals, Teva is constantly evaluating opportunities to maximize shareholder value, including looking at potential acquisitions. Teva's long-held practice is to only pursue transactions that fit our long-term strategy of delivering profitable growth and enhancing our global leadership position while meeting our stringent financial criteria. While Merck's generics business would have been a strategic fit for Teva, the terms of this opportunity did not fully meet our investment criteria. \b \u001d  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., headquartered in Israel, is among the top 20 pharmaceutical companies in the world and is the leading generic pharmaceutical company. The company develops, manufactures and markets generic and innovative human pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as animal health pharmaceutical products. Over 76 percent of Teva's sales are in North America and Europe. \b \u001d  Safe Harbor Statement under the U. S.

Reports Quarterly Results","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T21:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EROC"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\bHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 13, 2007-- \u001d  Eagle Rock Energy Partners, L.P. (Nasdaq: EROC) today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007. \b \u001d  For the first quarter of 2007, the Partnership reported $106.8 million of revenues as compared to $96.3 million for the first quarter of 2006 and $115.7 million for the December quarter of 2006. The Partnership reported a net loss of $19.7 million for the first quarter of 2007, compared to a net loss of $15.5 million for the same period in 2006 and an $11.7 million net loss for the December 2006 quarter. Included in the net loss for the March 2007 and 2006 and December 2006 quarters were non-cash, unrealized risk management activities with an increase to net loss of $12.3 million, $15.9 million, and $4.8 million, respectively. In addition, the first quarter of 2007 was negatively impacted by the recording of an accrual of $1.4 million for an unanticipated arbitration award related to a marketing fee dispute in the Panhandle segment for a period dating prior to the assets being acquired by the Partnership. \b \u001d  Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2007 was $14.1 million as compared to $17.1 million for the March 2006 quarter and $19.0 million for the December 2006 quarter. The reduction in Adjusted EBITDA for the current period quarter from the December 2006 amount is largely attributable to impacts from the severe winter weather in the Panhandle segment during the March 2007 quarter resulting in producer well freeze offs and related operational impacts which negatively affected gathering volumes for the segment and resulting NGL equity volumes. The March 2007 quarter as compared to the December 2006 quarter had a 5% decrease in gathering volumes in the Panhandle segment and a 19% decrease in NGLs and condensate equity volumes. This volume decrease negatively impacted the adjusted EBITDA by approximately $4.7 million. Also contributing to the decrease between periods was an increase in general and administrative expense of $0.9 million due to the additional costs of being a publicly-traded partnership. \b \u001d  Operating costs were considerably reduced by $1.1 million in the current period as compared to December 2006 levels reflecting the initial benefits of the cost management initiatives announced in January. \b \u001d  The Tyler County Pipeline extension was placed in service at the end of the March 2007 quarter, and therefore its contribution was minimal for the quarter. \b \u001d  \"We had a very challenging first quarter which included winter storms and cold weather in the Texas Panhandle area that resulted in producer well shut-ins, subsequent plant downtime and reduced volumes,\" said Alex Bucher, president. \"The weather impact lasted several weeks with well volumes being stabilized in the middle of March. The gas volume reduction occurred primarily in the western portion of the Panhandle segment where the NGLs and condensate composition are much greater on a unit volume basis. In our East Texas segment, we were able to complete the Tyler County Pipeline at the end of the quarter with current volumes flowing at better than expected levels.\" \b \u001d  Segment profit for the current year first quarter is $16.1 million as compared to $4.3 million for the prior year first quarter and $27.0 million for the December 2006 quarter. The Segment profit decrease in the current quarter as compared to the December 2006 quarter resulted primarily from the reduced volumes caused by the weather related impacts during the current quarter and unfavorable change in non-cash, unrealized risk management activities recorded in revenues in the current period. \b \u001d  \"While the first quarter operating results were disappointing, there were several positive items in the quarter that are creating momentum for us,\" stated Joseph A. Mills, chief executive officer and chairman. \"We started to see favorable movement in commodity prices that has continued in the second quarter. We completed the Tyler County Pipeline project with better than expected throughput and additional gathering prospects identified in the immediate area.\" \b \u001d  \"Total gathering volumes toward the end of the quarter for both segments were a record for the Partnership. Operating cost management initiatives continue to show very good progress as our costs compared quite favorably to those from the past two quarters. The expected start up of our 20 Mmcf/d Red Deer processing plant in the Texas Panhandle by the end of the second quarter will contribute significantly in the second half of the year. Producer drilling activities continue to be strong in the Panhandle and East Texas areas,\" continued Mills. \"With the recent closing of the Laser and Montierra acquisitions, both of which are not reflected in this quarter's numbers, as well as the associated private equity transaction and credit facility revolver expansion, we are in a position to actively grow the company, both through acquisition and organic capital growth. We are starting to see many opportunities to fuel the next level of growth for Eagle Rock. Our gathering and processing and oil and gas production business lines will offer acquisition opportunities as well as additional organic growth projects. We are very focused on the transition and integration of the new operations as well as identifying the next set of growth opportunities. We are now a much larger and financially stronger company with significant available borrowing capacity. Our pro forma 2007 EBITDA, adjusting for our recent acquisitions' expected contribution as if both transactions occurred at the beginning of the year, should be $115 - $120 million based on our current asset base.\" \b \u001d  Eagle Rock will host a conference call to discuss financial results on Monday, May 14, 2007, at 10 a.m. CT (11 a.m. ET).

ASIA) \b   By Deborah Ball in London and Eric Bellman in Mumbai \u001d  Indian entrepreneur and beer magnate Vijay Mallya is close to an agreement to purchase distiller Whyte & Mackay of Scotland for about GBP 600 million, or about $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. \u001d  People familiar with the negotiations between Mr. Mallya's UB Group and Whyte & Mackay said some details of the acquisition were still being worked out. Talks between the two companies became public last year. Mr. Mallya, chairman of UB Group, which includes India's biggest beer and whiskey makers as well as a two-year-old airline, is scheduled to hold a news conference in Glasgow on Wednesday. UB officials declined comment. Representatives of Whyte & Mackay couldn't be reached. \u001d  At GBP 600 million, the purchase would be one of the five largest international acquisitions ever by an Indian company, demonstrating the nation's growing economic power and importance in the global economy. After years when they focused on their home markets, many large Indian companies have made significant overseas acquisitions in the past few years. \u001d  Whyte & Mackay's brand of Scotch has lost its luster in the U.K., but the distiller is the biggest producer of private-label Scotch. With the acquisition Mr. Mallya could bring the Whyte & Mackay brand to India, where it would carry more cachet, and could use the private-label supplies to create new Scotch brands for the Indian market. \u001d  International whiskey brands could become another big source of income for UB Group, analysts said, as India is expected to lower its import tariffs on alcohol over the next two years. Tariffs on imported alcohol can run from 100% to 500% in India. \u001d  Mr. Mallya is perhaps India's most flamboyant entrepreneur. Earlier this month, his Kingfisher Airlines, one of the many new Indian airlines to have appeared in the past several years, brought a new double-decker Airbus 380 to India. He hosted demonstration flights out of New Delhi and Mumbai.

(532617.BY), India's largest airline by market share, Sunday said it plans to raise $400 million via a rights issue to reduce its debt, meet working capital requirements and fund expansion plans. \u001d  Vic Dungca, member of Jet's board of directors, told reporters that the company is currently putting together proposals from investment bankers and will finalize details of the rights issue in a couple of weeks. \u001d  \"Once we finalize the details, we can go to the board for approval, after which it would take about four months for the rights issue,\" Dungca said on the sidelines of a press conference where the company showcased its new aircraft for international operations. \u001d  He added that the founders of the Mumbai-based company may also consider a stake dilution at higher valuations to fund the expansion of its international operations. \u001d  \"Today we're going in the direction of no dilution, but as the stock price improves we may want to sell shares to the public,\" he said. \u001d   Earlier in April, Jet had said it plans to raise up to $400 million in the next few months to fund the expansion of its international operations. \u001d  The company, which is launching its international route to London, also plans to fly from India to New York, Chicago, Toronto and Los Angeles in about eight to nine months, Jet Chairman Naresh Goyal said, adding that flights to Shanghai will also start soon. \u001d  The company is also planning to begin flights to the Middle East in 2008 after getting regulatory clearances from the federal government, Goyal said. \u001d  \"In about five years, half our revenues would be from international operations. By that time, we should have revenues of $3 billion-$4 billion,\" Goyal said. \u001d  The company is also in talks with German carrier Lufthansa to start a cargo airline by the end of 2007, he said, without elaborating. \u001d  Speaking about its acquisition of rival Sahara Airlines Ltd., also popularly known as Air Sahara, Goyal said that Jet will spend $50 million to rebrand Sahara Airlines as JetLite and refurbish the fleet. \u001d  Jet Airways bought Sahara Airlines in April for INR14.50 billion. \u001d  Dungca added that Jet hopes to launch JetLite in about two months. \u001d  Separately, federal Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel said the Indian government is planning to shortly bring out a new policy for the fast-growing domestic aviation industry. \u001d  \"We are coming with a Vision 2020 (statement), which will spell out in a couple of months lots of issues that are not yet resolved,\" Patel said, without elaborating. \u001d  He added that he will also take up the issue of high turbine fuel prices with the federal oil ministry. \b \u001d  -By John Satish Kumar and Romit Guha; john.kumar@dowjones.com; +91-99001-81471 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 09:16 ET (13:16 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"f348fc3f7f0c8471155235999ed25ddb","symR":["OEX.AU","AU000000OEX8"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Oilex Ltd.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T08:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["OEX.AU","AU000000OEX8"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS"],"Story":"\u001d  Oilex Ltd.: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=AU000000OEX8 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 04:49 ET (08:49 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f35cc3342e9459627ea2f9121b68b5da","symR":["DCD.LN","GB0009369892"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for DCD Media plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T07:40:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DCD.LN","GB0009369892"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","MOV"],"Story":"\u001d  DCD Media plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0009369892 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 03:40 ET (07:40 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f3b717fdc1d507d0dca27a9aaf2a22e7","symR":["PDC"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Pioneer Drilling Company","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T09:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["PDC"],"IndustryCodes":["DRL","OIE","XDJGI","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Pioneer Drilling Company: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=PDC or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 05:14 ET (09:14 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f3db25711986e10db09a6efb3d37f154","symR":["BUR.LN","GB0033942946"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Burren Energy PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T07:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BUR.LN","GB0033942946"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI","XISL"],"Story":"\u001d  Burren Energy PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0033942946 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 03:24 ET (07:24 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f413b7c3e45704bf5329002aeafa03c9","symR":["CHY"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Calamos Convertible & High Income Fund (CHY)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-05-13T07:36:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CHY"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Calamos Convertible & High Income Fund (CHY): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=CHY or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  May 13, 2007 03:36 ET (07:36 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"f41563b5c456757ba64b106383fcdf26","symR":["SWZ"],"date":"2007-05-13","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for The Swiss Helvetia Fund Inc.
