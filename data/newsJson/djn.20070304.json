UBS' Orgill Reflects On What's

STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \b   By Rebecca Thurlow \u001d  Brad Orgill, chief executive of UBS AG in Australia, was introduced to the world of financial services when he was just 12 years old and growing up in the Australian state of Victoria. His father, who had retired at age 35 to day trade, started giving his son annual reports to read. \u001d  Now a father himself of two teenage boys, Mr. Orgill returned to Australia in May 2005 after 10 years in Hong Kong and Singapore with UBS or its predecessor companies. He had gone to Hong Kong in 1994 with S.G. Warburg to be head of Asian equities research. The following year, S.G. Warburg was purchased by Swiss Bank Corp. After UBS and Swiss bank merged in 1998, Mr. Orgill was head of the UBS Asia and then its Asia Pacific equities businesses. Concurrently, he was country head for UBS in Hong Kong and China from 1999 to 2003 and country head for Singapore from 2003 to 2005. \u001d  Under Mr. Orgill's leadership, UBS Australia has had a role in the lion's share of the big deals in the country's surging mergers and acquisition market. UBS boasts the largest share of advisory roles on buyouts in Australia last year, with 15 deals valued at A$20.7 billion (US$16.19 billion) in total, according to Thomson Financial. It is currently advising Qantas Airways Ltd. on a A$11.1 billion consortium bid led by Macquarie Bank Ltd. and Texas Pacific Group. \u001d  Mr. Orgill, 46, is also a key decision maker at the Switzerland-based UBS, with a seat on the group managing board and the global investment bank managing committee. UBS, the investment-banking giant, reported revenue of 48.17 billion Swiss francs ($39.6 billion) in 2006 and employs more than 78,000 people , including 1,500 in Australia. Rebecca Thurlow interviewed Mr. Orgill at the investment bank's new Sydney headquarters. \b \u001d  WSJ: What was your first job, and what did you learn from it? \u001d  Mr. Orgill: At Monash University [in the Australian state of Victoria], where I was studying economics, I started my own cleaning company. I learnt about how hard it was to make money, and therefore I focused on going back to university to continue my education so I could use my knowledge rather than just doing manual labor. \b \u001d  WSJ: Would you recommend someone starting out in your field attend business school or learn along the way? \u001d  Mr. Orgill: What you want is the best and brightest people, and what they have studied is much more secondary. Increasingly in our industry, doing a further postgraduate study, i.e., a masters, is becoming a base requirement. But what field it is in is much less important. In fact, doing psychology or history or technology are probably more important than doing an M.B.A. You are bringing different perspectives to the firm. \b \u001d  WSJ: What advice would you give to someone starting out in your field? \u001d  Mr. Orgill: If they want to get to the top of the firm, move around among different types of jobs in the firm through their careers. Increasingly, our business isn't about being an equity specialist or a fixed-income specialist. \b \u001d  WSJ: Who gave you the best business advice, and what was it? \u001d  Mr. Orgill: My father, Allan. Introducing me to the whole world of stockbroking and investment banking was the best advice I ever had. \b \u001d  WSJ: Do you have a favorite business book? \u001d  Mr. Orgill: One is \"The Work Of Nations: Preparing Ourselves for 21st Century Capitalism\" by Robert Reich. It shaped my view of how the world was globalizing. It encouraged me to look at Asia and understand what was happening in the world rather than just in one country. \b \u001d  WSJ: What is one thing you wish every new hire knew? \u001d  Mr. Orgill: History, a sense of what has happened before. If you look at our industry, a lot of people only understand the last 10 or 15 years. If you are a graduate starting off, you tend to only understand the last two or three years. Understanding what happened 10, 20, 30 years ago will help people make better decisions and manage risk better. \b \u001d  WSJ: What are the three most important attributes of a good manager? \u001d  Mr. Orgill: The willingness to make decisions, and the ability to think strategically rather than just tactically or day to day. Then I would say the third is setting the right culture and framework so that people from all backgrounds and perspectives can contribute. \b \u001d  WSJ: What are the most satisfying decisions you've made as a manager? \u001d  Mr. Orgill: One is making the strategic decision not to close down the offices in the Asian financial crisis. Most of the other firms were closing down in 1997 and 1998 in Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, the smaller markets. We consciously decided we would stay invested across the region, and that made a huge difference in our ability to get to No. 1 [for market share for equities in the Asian-Pacific region]. \u001d  The second was, in 1999 and 2000, to see the importance of derivative products and the move from cash to derivatives and to build out that business. And the third area I would mention would be Japan. When people thought Japan was facing a potential crisis in 2001 and 2002 and were reducing staff in equities and investment banking, we were actually hiring people and building out that business. And now Japan is coming back strongly, we are very well positioned. \b \u001d  WSJ: Is there a time when you let your company or your colleagues down? \u001d  Mr. Orgill: We went through two mergers in 1995-1996 and then 1998 and we had complete overlap in Asia. In the first, we focused on picking the best people. But I underestimated the importance of team dynamics. If you have the best people, but you don't have them working effectively as a team or they have baggage because they have come from other sides of the merger and therefore they are unlikely to work together well, you can't get a good result. I tried in Thailand to put together the best four analysts from one team and the best four from the other team. We lost quite a few of those people. \b \u001d  WSJ: Have you had bad bosses, and what made them bad? \u001d  Mr. Orgill: One thing that has frustrated me with people above me has been an excessive focus on trying to build consensus rather than take decisions. You do want to take input from people, but ultimately, in a leadership position, people want you to take decisions and lead. They prefer people to decisively take decisions and get it wrong occasionally than not take decisions. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright

This represents the highest level of third quarter revenues \b       in the Company's history. \b \b    -  Gross margins for the quarter were 28.0 percent, compared to \b       21.8 percent for the corresponding period last year. Gross profit for \b       the quarter was $25.2 million compared to $12.7 million for the prior \b       year quarter. \b \b    -  Record third quarter earnings from continuing operations at \b       $5.7 million or $0.25 per share, up from a loss of $1.0 million or \b       $0.05 per share for the prior year quarter. \b \b    -  Net earnings for the quarter, after loss on discontinued operations, \b       were $5.0 million or $0.22 per share compared to a net loss, after \b       gain on discontinued operations, of $0.7 million or $0.03 per share \b       for the prior year quarter. \b \b    -  Increase of 171 percent in cash from operations, before changes in \b       non-cash working capital items, at $14.9 million for the quarter, \b       compared to $5.5 million for the same quarter last year. \b \b    \"The third quarter is typically our weakest while exploration companies \bshut down operations, often for extended periods, over the holidays, and the \bCompany has historically shown a loss in the third quarter. This year for the \bfirst time in ten years, the Company posted a profit in its third quarter, at \b$5.7 million on continuing operations, a record for this period. We also had \bour best revenue month ever in November,\" said Francis McGuire, President and \bCEO of Major Drilling. \"As discussed in our press release dated January 22, \b2007, shorter than expected shutdowns, generally improved pricing, and an \bincreased number of rigs in the field, contributed to these strong results,\" \bsaid Mr. McGuire. \"Drilling programs that would typically end during November \bwere extended well into December. Also, January was exceptionally strong with \bearly startups in most of our operations. Finally, rigs that were delivered \blate at the end of the second quarter made a contribution this quarter. All of \bthis combined to produce not only record revenues for the third quarter, but \balso the Company's third largest overall quarterly revenue in its history, \btrailing only the first and second quarters of fiscal 2007.\" \b    \"During the quarter, we announced the purchase of the operations of the \bLongstaff group, which carries on drilling operations in South Africa, \bBotswana and Namibia. As discussed on December 1, 2006, these operations were \bprimarily conducted on a single shift basis, and we intend to gradually \bincrease utilization of these rigs. The Company is already making good \bprogress on that front with an expansion of the labour force since the \bacquisition was announced,\" Mr. McGuire observed. \"Pricing in these countries \bhas tended to lag trends in other parts of the world but demand is increasing \bsignificantly. As the months go by, we expect pricing and utilization to \bcontinue to improve.\" \b    \"We continued to see an overall increase in demand for the Company's \bservices during the quarter, creating a favorable pricing environment for the \bupcoming year. Nickel, copper, gold, silver, uranium and zinc prices remain \bwell above economical thresholds for exploration,\" commented Mr. McGuire. \b\"Given this environment and the Company's favorable financial position, we \bexpanded our capital expenditures program this quarter, spending \b$14.5 million, bringing in 11 new rigs. With these additional rigs, the \bAfrican acquisition, and increased pricing, the Company's positive momentum is \bexpected to continue into the fourth quarter and beyond.\" \b \b    Third quarter ended January 31, 2007 \b \b    Total revenue for the third quarter was $90.1 million, up 54.3 percent \bfrom the $58.4 million recorded for the prior year period. Year-over-year \brevenue and profit comparisons were not affected by the variations of the \bCanadian dollar against both the U.S. and Australian dollars. \b    Revenues from Canada-U.S. drilling operations were up $12.0 million or \b65.6 percent to $30.3 million for the quarter compared to $18.3 million for \bthe same period last year. In Canada, improved winter conditions, as compared \bto last year, allowed early startups for most of the Company's contracts. Last \byear, warm weather conditions slowed the development of the winter roads \brequired to gain access to many project sites, which caused delays or \bcancellation of a certain number of projects. In the U.S., the Company had up \bto five rigs working in the energy sector during the quarter with good pricing \band good performance. \b    In South and Central America, revenue for the quarter was $29.6 million, \bup 91.0 percent from $15.5 million recorded in the prior year quarter. This \bstrong year-over-year quarterly growth was driven primarily by very strong \bdemand in Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Also, operations in Venezuela made a \bsignificant contribution to the region's growth. \b    Australasian/African drilling operations reported revenues of \b$30.2 million, up some 22.3 percent from $24.7 million reported in the same \bperiod last year. This growth was led by Tanzania, where revenues almost \bdoubled compared to the prior year quarter, as well as by revenue from the new \bAfrican acquisition. Revenue grew moderately in Indonesia and was relatively \bflat in Mongolia and Australia. \b    The overall gross margin percentage for the quarter was 28.0 percent, up \bfrom 21.8 percent for the same period last year. Gross margin percentages \bimproved year-over-year in all three regions due to generally improved pricing \band much shorter shutdowns over the holidays. Margins were still somewhat \bimpacted by mobilizations, demobilizations and increased repairs during this \bperiod. \b    General and administrative costs were $8.8 million for the quarter, \bcompared to $7.3 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily \bdue to additions to management to accommodate growth and the administrative \bcosts relating to the African acquisition. \b    Other expenses were $2.0 million for the quarter compared to $0.9 million \bfor the same period last year, due to higher incentive compensation expenses \bgiven the Company's improved profitability in the current year and increased \bprovision for bad debt, muted by a gain on sale of investments. \b    Foreign exchange gain was nil for the quarter compared to a loss of \b$0.2 million for the prior year period. \b    Short-term interest revenue was $0.3 million for the quarter compared to \ban expense of $0.1 million last year, while interest on long-term debt was \b$0.7 million compared to $0.6 million for the prior year quarter. \b    Amortization expense increased to $5.2 million for the quarter compared to \b$4.5 million for the same quarter last year, as a result of increased \binvestment in equipment. \b    The Company's tax expense was $3.2 million for the quarter, reflecting the \bCompany's profitability compared to nil for the same period last year as the \bCompany still had non-tax effected Canadian losses. \b    Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $5.7 million or \b$0.25 per share ($0.24 per share diluted) compared to a loss of $1.0 million \bor $0.05 per share ($0.05 per share diluted) in the prior year period. \b    Loss from discontinued operations was $0.7 million or $0.03 per share \bcompared to a gain of $0.4 million or $0.02 per share for the same period last \byear. Discontinued operations include the sale of the manufacturing division \band the termination of operations in China. The loss from discontinued \boperations in the third quarter of 2007 reflects adjustments to the tax \bprovision from the sale of the manufacturing division and ongoing costs as the \bCompany was closing its Chinese operations and redeploying rigs to other \boperations. Gain from discontinued operations for the third quarter of 2006 \brepresents operating results from the discontinued operations that have been \breclassified from continuing operations. \b    Resulting net earnings were $5.0 million or $0.22 per share ($0.21 per \bshare diluted) compared to a loss of $0.7 million or $0.03 per share ($0.03 \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d

\u001d   Candente Resource Corp. (TSX: DNT) is very pleased to report that an updated independent mineral resource estimate has been completed on the Canariaco Norte Zone of the Canariaco property, Northern Peru. The report estimates a resource of 820 million tonnes (MT) grading 0.45% copper at a cut-off grade of 0.30% copper. Measured and Indicated resource categories make up 78% of the 820 MT. Contained metal in the 820 MT equals 8.1 billion (B) pounds (lb) of copper. \b \u001d  Within the 820 MT, a Starter Pit of 107 MT grading 0.60% Cu has been delineated with a strip ratio of 1.4 to 1. A total of 97% of the 107 MT is in the Measured and Indicated categories. Contained metal in the Starter Pit equals 1.4 B lb Copper. \b \u001d  The new resource is based on all drilling results as of December 2006, which include 82 holes drilled by Candente. As of March 1, 2007 a total of 101 holes have been drilled by Candente on the deposit. Drilling continues to both expand the size of the deposit laterally and vertically and move Inferred resources into the Indicated and Measured categories. \b \b    DECEMBER 2006 UPDATED RESOURCE \b \b \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b- \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------ \b                                                           Highly \b                                                        Leachable \b                Contained                                      (i) \bTotal    Copper    Copper  Measured Indicated  Inferred    Copper  Cut-off \bTonnes    Grade  (Billion    Tonnes    Tonnes    Tonnes     (% of    Grade \b(Million) (% Cu)      lbs) (Million) (Million) (Million)  Deposit)   (% Cu) \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b219        0.61       2.9        92        94        33      48.5      0.5 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b474        0.52       5.4       170       223        81      44.4      0.4 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b820        0.45       8.1       255       388       177      43.3      0.3 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b1,177      0.39      10.1       320       540       317      41.2      0.2 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                STARTER PIT \b                             Within the 820 MT \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b107        0.60       1.4        65        39         3      60.9     0.28 \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b=------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b(i) Highly leachable copper (chalcocite and oxide copper) \b \b \u001d  This increase from 489 to 820 MT in the resource is expected to greatly enhance the cash flow analyses from the Preliminary Assessment and Economic Study (PAEE) completed in June 2006. At that time NPV's for the project varied from $109M to $707M using copper prices from $1.25 to $2.50 per lb and a discount rate of 10%. A new PAEE is now in progress based on the new resource. \b \u001d  Highly leachable copper (chalcocite and oxide copper) makes up approximately 43% of the total contained copper in the Canariaco Norte deposit. Distinct zones of highly leachable copper appear both at the top of the deposit near surface, as well as at depth. The Feasibility Study will begin this month and will address the economics of an SX-EW copper operation at Canariaco and is initially focused on the 107 MT Starter Pit for quick pay back of capital costs. The Feasibility Study will also address the economics associated with the entire known deposit and determine whether the operation should continue with only leaching or add components for conventional milling once payback has been achieved. \b \u001d  The mineral resource estimate is based on assay results from 26,019 meters of drill core from a total of 28,928 meters drilled in 93 holes of which 82 were drilled by Candente in during 2004, 2005 and 2006. 11 holes were drilled in 1973, 1995 and 1999 by Ingemmet, Placer Dome and Billiton. Drill spacings vary from 50 to 225 metres. Independent engineer, Dr. David M. Stone, P.Eng., of MineFill Services, Inc., and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument (NI) 43-101, was responsible for the mineral resource estimate dated March 4th, 2007. The resource estimate is classified as a Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource, consistent with the CIM definitions referred to in NI 43-101. This estimate will be filed in a Technical Report, compliant with NI 43-101 on SEDAR within 45 days. Mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, have not demonstrated economic viability. Candente is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other issues which may materially affect its estimate of mineral resources. \b \u001d  One half of the split core was collected by Candente's Peruvian geologists in accordance with industry standards and submitted to Actlabs in Lima, Peru for copper. Copper was analyzed by a four acid leach process on a 50 g split to give values for total copper, acid soluble copper, cyanide soluble copper and residual sulphide copper. Pulps from some of the same samples were sent to Actlabs laboratory in Ancaster, Ontario, Canada and analysed for an additional 36 elements (including silver) using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP). Gold analyses on these same samples was carried out by Actlabs, Lima using Fire Assay Fusion and Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) method on a 50g split. Five percent of all core samples were also sent to a second laboratory for check assays of total copper and total gold. Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC), including the use of sample standards, blanks and duplicates as well as chain of custody was monitored by Candente Exploration Manager, Robert van Egmond, P. Geo., and reviewed by the Qualified Person. \b \b    Maps, cross-sections and data can be viewed at: http://www.candente.com/s/PeruProjects_Canariaco.asp \b \u001d  Candente is a diversified exploration company with copper, gold, silver, and zinc projects in Peru and Mexico.

The purchaser is Arrowpoint Capital, a vehicle set up by RSA's U.S. managers. \u001d  Royal & Sun said in September the unit will be sold for GBP158 million in a transaction that will result in a pretax loss from the deal of about GBP443 million. \u001d  Last month, a Delaware insurance regulator granted conditional approval for Royal & Sun to exit the U.S. market. \u001d  General Motors Corp. (GM) and groups rebuilding the World Trade Center, site of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, challenged Royal & Sun Alliance's decision to get out of the U.S. market, leaving billions in asbestos, environmental and other liabilities behind. \u001d  Royal & Sun Alliance says it has paid what it owes on insurance policies written in the U.S., and disputes claims by GM and the World Trade Center groups for more coverage. \u001d  The U.S. operation made a pretax loss of GBP17 million in the six months to June 30, 2006. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.royalsunalliance.com

\u001d  FRANKFURT (AP)--Fuel efficiency through new technology and hybrid vehicles will be a top theme at this year's Geneva Motor Show, with DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) displaying a lower-emission diesel engine and Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) unveiling its Hybrid X concept marrying an electric motor with a gas engine. \u001d  The 77th edition of the show comes amid stronger concern about global warming and the environment, and a debate about auto emission limits in Europe. One sharp focus is on making engines more fuel-efficient and more environmentally conscious -while helping to maintain a healthy bottom line. \u001d  DaimlerChrysler AG's Mercedes brand will unveil its BLUETEC emission-control technology in combination with a consumption-optimized four-cylinder diesel, an engine that could lower emissions while increasing gas mileage. \u001d  \"Our diesel strategy is an effective answer to the question of how to save fuel and, therefore, CO2, how to further reduce all exhaust emissions,\" said DaimlerChrysler CEO Dieter Zetsche. \u001d  Japanese automaker Toyota Corp. is also slated to have the next-step designs of its hybrid Prius models, which uses electricity, batteries and a gas-powered internal combustion. \u001d  As it moves to combat global warming, the European Union has set a goal of 130 grams of CO2 per kilometer per vehicle by 2012, down from around 163 grams per kilometer on average now. \u001d  Smaller and more fuel-efficient cars from China will be getting attention. China's Brilliance JinBei Automobile unveils its first car aimed at European consumers, the BS 6, to be distributed through HSO Motors Europe. \u001d  \"The exclusive ambiance of this top salon forms a tremendous springboard for launching our top of the range model, the BS 6, and for the introduction of the Brilliance brand to the European market,\" said Hans-Ulrich Sachs, chairman and managing director of HSO. \u001d  China is more and more a crucial market and source of partners for Europe's big automakers, and last week DaimlerChrysler, which is in the midst of reorganizing its American Chrysler Group, announced a plan to start selling Chinese-made cars under the Chrysler name in North America and western Europe. \u001d  \"Small vehicles such as these will allow Chrysler Group brands to compete in segments in which the brands do not currently compete, and which are especially important in price- and fuel-economy sensitive markets,\" the German-U.S. automaker said in a statement. \u001d  For those still in the market for SUVs, upcoming models of GM's GMC Acadia and Toyota's Highlander offer improved internal seating. \u001d  Previous models have typically favored bench seats in the back, but now designers are more keen on letting occupants move from one seat to the next without having to stumble or crawl by installing aisle seats, or captain's chairs, in the second and even third rows. \u001d  Meanwhile, struggling Ford Motor Co. (F), which is trying to stage a turnaround amid billions of dollars in losses in recent months, is bringing a new version of its Mondeo, an important vehicle as the company seeks to gain ground in the sedan market with SUVs in disfavor because of low gas mileage. \u001d  \"We wanted to create an emotional connection with the new Mondeo that would attract people from an aesthetic point of view even before they appreciate its technology,\" said Martin Smith, executive director of design at Ford of Europe. \u001d  The car will come in four-door, five-door hatchback and station wagon styles. \u001d  Germany's BMW AG (BMW.XE) is set to show off a restyled 5-Series, a key sales generator, while Volkswagen AG (VOW.XE), Europe's biggest car maker, will have its new Golf Estate on display, a roomier version of the standby Golf line. \u001d  Among the concept cars -ideas that might or might not go into production -DaimlerChrysler's Dodge goes for a sportier tone with its Demon, a compact roadster with a fierce front end that recalls older model British sports cars. \u001d  In all, more than 250 companies are signed up for the 11-day show, taking up nearly 77,000 square meters at the Geneva Palexpo. \u001d  Organizers expect more than 700,000 visitors to the show, which is open to the public from March 8-18. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 11:40 ET (16:40

2007) - Candente Resource Corp. (TSX:DNT) is very pleased to report that an updated independent mineral resource estimate has been completed on the Canariaco Norte Zone of the Canariaco property, Northern Peru. The report estimates a resource of 820 million tonnes (MT) grading 0.45% copper at a cut-off grade of 0.30% copper. Measured and Indicated resource categories make up 78% of the 820 MT. Contained metal in the 820 MT equals 8.1 billion (B) pounds (lb) of copper. \b \bWithin the 820 MT, a Starter Pit of 107 MT grading 0.60% Cu has been delineated with a strip ratio of 1.4 to 1. A total of 97% of the 107 MT is in the Measured and Indicated categories. Contained metal in the Starter Pit equals 1.4 B lb Copper. \b \bThe new resource is based on all drilling results as of December 2006, which include 82 holes drilled by Candente. As of March 1, 2007 a total of 101 holes have been drilled by Candente on the deposit. Drilling continues to both expand the size of the deposit laterally and vertically and move Inferred resources into the Indicated and Measured categories. \b \bDECEMBER 2006 UPDATED RESOURCE \b \b \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                                           Highly \b                                                        Leachable \b                Contained                                      (i) \bTotal    Copper    Copper  Measured Indicated  Inferred    Copper  Cut-off \bTonnes    Grade  (Billion    Tonnes    Tonnes    Tonnes     (% of    Grade \b(Million) (% Cu)      lbs) (Million) (Million) (Million)  Deposit)   (% Cu) \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b219        0.61       2.9        92        94        33      48.5      0.5 \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b474        0.52       5.4       170       223        81      44.4      0.4 \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b820        0.45       8.1       255       388       177      43.3      0.3 \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b1,177      0.39      10.1       320       540       317      41.2      0.2 \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b                                STARTER PIT \b                             Within the 820 MT \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b107        0.60       1.4        65        39         3      60.9     0.28 \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b(i) Highly leachable copper (chalcocite and oxide copper) \b \b \bThis increase from 489 to 820 MT in the resource is expected to greatly enhance the cash flow analyses from the Preliminary Assessment and Economic Study (PAEE) completed in June 2006. At that time NPV's for the project varied from $109M to $707M using copper prices from $1.25 to $2.50 per lb and a discount rate of 10%. A new PAEE is now in progress based on the new resource. \b \bHighly leachable copper (chalcocite and oxide copper) makes up approximately 43% of the total contained copper in the Canariaco Norte deposit. Distinct zones of highly leachable copper appear both at the top of the deposit near surface, as well as at depth. The Feasibility Study will begin this month and will address the economics of an SX-EW copper operation at Canariaco and is initially focused on the 107 MT Starter Pit for quick pay back of capital costs. The Feasibility Study will also address the economics associated with the entire known deposit and determine whether the operation should continue with only leaching or add components for conventional milling once payback has been achieved. \b \bThe mineral resource estimate is based on assay results from 26,019 meters of drill core from a total of 28,928 meters drilled in 93 holes of which 82 were drilled by Candente in during 2004, 2005 and 2006. 11 holes were drilled in 1973, 1995 and 1999 by Ingemmet, Placer Dome and Billiton. Drill spacings vary from 50 to 225 metres. Independent engineer, Dr. David M. Stone, P.Eng., of MineFill Services, Inc., and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument (NI) 43-101, was responsible for the mineral resource estimate dated March 4th, 2007. The resource estimate is classified as a Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource, consistent with the CIM definitions referred to in NI 43-101. This estimate will be filed in a Technical Report, compliant with NI 43-101 on SEDAR within 45 days. Mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, have not demonstrated economic viability. Candente is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other issues which may materially affect its estimate of mineral resources. \b \bOne half of the split core was collected by Candente's Peruvian geologists in accordance with industry standards and submitted to Actlabs in Lima, Peru for copper. Copper was analyzed by a four acid leach process on a 50 g split to give values for total copper, acid soluble copper, cyanide soluble copper and residual sulphide copper. Pulps from some of the same samples were sent to Actlabs laboratory in Ancaster, Ontario, Canada and analysed for an additional 36 elements (including silver) using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP). Gold analyses on these same samples was carried out by Actlabs, Lima using Fire Assay Fusion and Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) method on a 50g split. Five percent of all core samples were also sent to a second laboratory for check assays of total copper and total gold. Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC), including the use of sample standards, blanks and duplicates as well as chain of custody was monitored by Candente Exploration Manager, Robert van Egmond, P. Geo., and reviewed by the Qualified Person. \b \bMaps, cross-sections and data can be viewed at: http://www.candente.com/s/PeruProjects_Canariaco.asp \b \bCandente is a diversified exploration company with copper, gold, silver, and zinc projects in Peru and Mexico. Candente subscribes to principles, which ensure that its exploration and development activities are beneficial to the local communities. \b \bThis News Release may contain forward-looking statements including but not limited to comments regarding the timing and content of upcoming work programs, geological interpretations, receipt of property titles, potential mineral recovery processes, etc. Forward-looking statements address future events and conditions and therefore involve inherent risks and uncertainties.

operation, managing director of Centrica Energy said in an interview with The Observer Sunday. \u001d  The Nordstream Baltic pipeline, which will run underneath the Baltic Sea into Germany, is expected to be completed by autumn 2010 and will help supply a large chunk of Russian gas to the U.K. Ulrich said that there were no discussions about a potential tie-up at the moment. \u001d  Ulrich also said Centrica plans to invest $3 billion each year over the next three years \"to replenish our reserves and get (our own) production up to 35%\" of the gas needed to meet customers needs. \u001d  Concerning a merger with gas major BG Group PLC (BRG),  Ulrich said \"I don't think it is inconceivable, but I don't think it's likely.\" He said that BG doesn't attach a great importance to

  New program gives selling partners more voice, access to \b                    resources, training, incentives \b \bVANCOUVER, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 04, 2007-- \u001d  New Edge Networks said it revamped its partner program offering its channel a direct voice, access to resources, training, and incentives for selling high-speed broadband networks to businesses. The wholly-owned subsidiary of EarthLink Inc. (NASDAQ: ELNK) made its announcement at the Channel Partners Conference & Expo in Las Vegas. \b \u001d  In conjunction with the channel program overhaul, New Edge Networks also created an agent council with three members from each of the company's three operating regions in the eastern, central, and western United States. This provides agents direct representation to executive management, input on program development, and first look at products. The council will meet monthly. \b \b   New Edge Networks also is launching a series of cross-country \bseminars for educating selling partners how to package and offer \bbusinesses complete IP solutions. A seminar schedule is available at \bwww.newedgenetworks.com/register. \b \b   At the Channel Partners Conference & Expo, New Edge Networks also \bis participating on an educational session about managed services \bentitled: MPLS VPN: Find out what it means to you (and Your \bCustomers). The session is scheduled for 9 a.m. Monday, March 5 at The \bVenetian Resort Hotel Casino. \b \b   \"In an environment where many communications providers have a \bquestionable commitment to their channel partners and industry \bconsolidation will produce questionable product and service results, \bNew Edge Networks has made a significantly greater commitment to \bchannel sales,\" said Bruce Barnes, newly appointed director of channel \bprogram for New Edge Networks. \b \u001d  \"Thanks to support from EarthLink (which acquired New Edge Networks last April), New Edge Networks has reinvested in its partner program adding resources from product management, marketing, IT, sales, and sales support to initiate new programs, training, and events,\" Barnes said. \b \b   \"We will be looking for every possible way that we can better \breward our partners for the business they do with us,\" said Barnes, \bnoting that New Edge Networks and EarthLink are working together to \bcreate additional offerings that fill in the lower end spectrum of \bbusiness-class broadband products. This enables channel partners to \boffer complete solutions to their clients. \b \b   New Edge Networks recently opened full access for its channel \bpartners to the company's order management and troubleshooting system. \bThrough a secure online portal, selling partners have the same access \bto their customers' records as New Edge Networks' customer care \brepresentatives. This helps partners manage their clients and improve \boverall customer experience. \b \b   CrosStar Network Solutions, a master agent based in New York City, \brecently signed on as an agent for New Edge Networks after working \bwith most major telecommunications carriers. \b \b   \"The key to our success is to affiliate ourselves with nimble and \bquick providers that clearly understand the sense of urgency that our \bcustomers have and also make it easy for us to work with them,\" said \bEric Savitsky, managing partner of CrosStar Network Solutions, \b(www.crosstarnetwork.com). \b \b   \"The tools and access that New Edge Networks provides its channel \bpartners empower us to manage our relationship with our clients and \bquickly help us cut through the typical smoke and mirrors,\" Savitsky \bsaid. \"If we are successful, they will be successful.\" \b \b   To give its revamped channel program a boost, New Edge Networks \bbeefed up sales incentives for partners in the first quarter of 2007. \bFor example, one incentive gives partners an additional $500 bounty \bfor each full T-1 sale they make on behalf of New Edge Networks. This \bis in addition to the regular commission payment for the sale. \b \b   New Edge Networks has more than 350 active channel partners. These \binclude agents, value added resellers, systems integrators, resellers, \band referral partners. \b \b   About New Edge Networks \b \b   New Edge Networks, based in Vancouver, Wash., is a wholly-owned \bsubsidiary of EarthLink Inc. (NASDAQ: ELNK). New Edge Networks builds \band manages private networks for businesses and communications \bproviders.

(TSX:SGO) (\"Sepp's\" or the \"Company\") announces that a shareholder and insider group of the Company has agreed to provide the Company with a line of credit for up to $500,000. The line of credit bears interest at 10.25%, is repayable by April 30, 2008 (subject to an extension provision) and is secured by a charge over the Company's assets, subordinated to all existing debt except for a previously announced shareholder line of credit with which it ranks pari passu. In the event that the Company is unable to repay the amount of the loan, the $500,000 line of credit can be converted at April 30, 2009 to 1,351,351 shares (a conversion price of $0.37). Additionally, up to 476,190 share purchase warrants exercisable at a price of $0.37 will be issued to the shareholder group as consideration for providing the line of credit. The warrants are exercisable for a period of two years and any shares issued on the exercise of warrants will be subject to a four month hold period which will expire on June 29, 2007. Funds from the line of credit will be used to fund the Company's capital requirements under its recently completed relocation of its British Columbia manufacturing facility and for general working capital purposes. \b \bAs well, the previously announced $500,000 standby letter of credit extended by a shareholder and insider has been amended. In the event that the Company is unable to repay the amount of that loan, the $500,000 drawn down on the line of credit can be converted at December 31, 2008 to 1,351,351 shares (a conversion price of $0.37). \b \bSepp's Gourmet Foods Ltd. is a producer and marketer of specialty prepared foods for the retail grocery and food service sectors in North and South America, Iceland, and Southeast Asia.

MANITOBA--(CCNMatthews - March 2, 2007) - HudBay Minerals Inc. (TSX:HBM) (HudBay) announces results from its second half 2006 exploration in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Illustrations and previously released data are available at www.hudbayminerals.com. \b \bDuring the second half of 2006, approximately 23,738 meters of diamond drilling in 39 surface drill holes was completed, with a focus on mineral deposit targets and structural targets. HudBay's subsidiary, Hudson Bay Exploration and Development Company Limited (HBED) managed the exploration in the Flin Flon Greenstone Belt and the majority of the exploration was funded by flow-through financing. \b \b\"Drill results continued to be encouraging at the Bur deposit and at the Talbot Lake deposit where one intersection was 12.44% copper over 9.65 meters,\" said Peter Jones, President & CEO. \"For 2007 we have increased our total exploration program expenditure plans to $37 million, making it one of the largest in Canada.\" \b \bExploration results reported in this release exclude results from exploration within HudBay operating mines and exploration at locations other than northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan. HudBay recently announced that its January 1, 2007 aggregate estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources increased compared to those at January 1, 2006, after taking into account 2006 ore production. \b \bMineral Deposit Targets \b \bBur Deposit \b \bThe Bur deposit is 22 kilometres from the Snow Lake concentrator. Drilling at the Bur deposit in the second half of 2006 improved the definition of mineralization. As a result of earlier drilling, HudBay announced in December 2006 plans to invest approximately $8.5 million at the Bur deposit for additional in-fill diamond drilling, underground excavations to extract a 10,000 tonne ore sample, obtaining production permits as well as completion of a feasibility study. During the second half of 2006, 1,150 meters of drilling were completed. Notable intersections included: \b \b \b- 3.25% Cu, 17.65% Zn over 1.21 meters in drill hole BZS015; \b- 5.34% Cu, 4.99% Zn over 1.47 meters in drill hole BZS022; \b \b \bDrilling will continue in 2007 as part of the $8.5 million planned investment. \b \bTalbot Lake Deposit \b \bThe Talbot Lake deposit is located 83 km from the Snow Lake concentrator. \b \bIn the second half of 2006, 7,084 meters were drilled in eleven holes. Ten of those holes intersected mineralization. \b \bThe last drill hole of the program - hole TLS020, made a very encouraging intersection which assayed 11.16 grams/tonne gold, 184.37 grams/tonne silver, 12.44% copper and 3.50% zinc over 9.65 meters. \b \b \bOther main zone intersections were: \b \b- 1.09% Cu, 6.32% Zn over 1.69 meters in drill hole TLS010; \b- 4.24% Cu, 0.59% Zn over 3.15 meters in drill hole TLS011; \b- 0.62% Cu, 1.03% Zn over 1.72 meters in drill hole TLS012: \b- 2.15% Cu, 1.68% Zn over 1.29 meters in drill hole TLS013; \b- 0.10% Cu, 8.13% Zn over 0.74 meters in drill hole TLS014; \b- 0.94% Cu, 0.53% Zn over 1.66 meters in drill hole TLS015; \b- 0.61% Cu, 0.08% Zn over 1.20 meters in drill hole TLS016; \b- 0.47% Cu, 0.40% Zn over 9.70 meters in drill hole TLS017; \b- 0.60% Cu, 2.63% Zn over 2.09 meters in drill hole TLS018; \b- TLS019 was abandoned \b \b \bHudBay will follow up exploration of the significant mineralization intersected in drill hole TLS020 at the earliest opportunity. \b \bStructural Targets \b \bChisel Target \b \bDrilling continued at the previously mined Chisel and Photo Lake properties, and on targets related to the operating Chisel North mine. 5388 meters were drilled in 10 parent drill holes and two wedge cuts. \b \bNotable intersections included: \b \b \b- 0.10% Cu, 3.34% Zn over 1.00 meter in drill hole CH0602; \b- 0.13% Cu, 7.65% Zn over 0.69 meters in drill hole CH0602W1 \b \b \bDrill holes CH0603, CH0505, CH0606, CH0607, CH0608 and DUB166 tested Quantec Titan 24 deep penetrating geophysical anomalies identified in a survey completed in the first quarter of 2006. Although no notable assay intervals were intersected, CH0606 intersected 7.71 meters of massive pyrite from 531.71 to 539.42 meters coincident with a Titan 24 anomaly and also with the Chisel Mine horizon. Additional exploration is planned to test this mineralization in 2007. \b \bTwo drill holes, DUB165 and DUB167 tested targets below the now closed Photo Lake mine. There were no notable intersections in DUB165 however DUB167 intersected a wide interval of quartz-staurolite-biotite-chlorite gneiss with disseminated chalcopyrite (copper) stringer mineralization. \b \bFlin Flon, Manitoba \b \b2,130 meters were drilled in four holes testing the hanging wall stratigraphy and along the strike of the Flin Flon - 777 mine. There were no notable intersections. \b \bFlin Flon, Saskatchewan \b \b4,774 meters were drilled in five holes that tested a structurally repeated fault block of the Flin Flon mine stratigraphy located deep in the footwall of the Flin Flon mine, previously intersected by holes completed in 2005. There were no notable mineral intersections. \b \bGeophysical Targets \b \b738 meters were drilled in three holes east and south of Snow Lake to test geophysical anomalies. There were no notable intersections. \b \b \b2007 Expenditure Plans(i) \b ------------------------ \b \b --------------------------------------------------------------------- \bFlin Flon Greenstone Belt \b \b                                    ($ millions) \bElectromagnetic anomalies                   8.5 \bKnown deposits                              4.5 \bOperating mines                             4.0 \bGeophysics                                  3.0 \bStructural targets                          3.0 \bAdministration/miscellaneous                3.0 \b                                                     26.0 \b \bOther Locations \b \bBalmat District                             4.0 \bUnallocated                                 7.0 \b                                                     11.0 \b                                                  ------- \bTotal planned 2007 expenditure                      $37.0 million \b \b --------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b(i)All expenditures are preliminary estimates and actual expenditures may \b   vary depending on several factors \b \b \bHudBay's exploration properties include approximately 380,000 hectares in the prolific Flin Flon Greenstone Belt of Manitoba and Saskatchewan and approximately 20,000 hectares in the Balmat district of New York state. In addition, HudBay owns the Tom zinc/lead mineral deposit in the Yukon and holds an option to purchase the adjacent Jason zinc/lead mineral property. Additional exploration assets include copper exploration properties in Chile and zinc exploration properties in Southwestern Ontario. \b \b2006 HudBay Procedures \b \bExploration core drilling was either NQ or BQ size. The core was logged and mineralized intersections were marked for sampling and assaying, by HBED employed geologists. The marked intersections or intervals were sawn in half by a diamond saw and one half of the core was placed in plastic bags and tagged with unique sample numbers, while the second half was returned to the core box and stored. \b \bEach bagged core sample was transported to the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited's assay laboratory in Flin Flon, Manitoba where it was dried, crushed and pulverized and a 250-gram sample was prepared for assaying. From each 250 gram sample 0.25 grams was removed and leached in aqua regia and analyzed by ICP-AES for Ag, Cu, Zn, As, Pb, Ni and Fe. Also from the 250-gram sample, 15 grams was removed for gold determination by fire assaying with Atomic Absorption finish. \b \bAssaying integrity is monitored internally with a quality control program, which includes the use of assay sample standards, blanks, duplicates and repeats and externally through national and international programs. In addition, within each group of 20 core samples, one core sample has a second 250 gram split collected for check assaying at Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd. in Vancouver, B.C. \b \bNews Release and Attachments \b \bThe news release and attached tables provide core lengths and additionally where indicated, horizontal or vertical lengths of mineralization intersected. True widths are not provided. Where metal assays are provided for intersections they are either a single assay of a sample of the entire intersection length or a composite of assays calculated from interval weighted assays over the intersection length. \b \bThe data herein and the contents of this news release have been reviewed by Kelly Gilmore, B.Sc. P. Geo., Chief Exploration Geologist with HBED, who is a Qualified Person, within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101, with the ability and authority to verify the authenticity and validity of the data. \b \bAttached to this news release are tables showing the second half 2006 drill results.

Denies Kidnapping Of 5 Britons, 13 Ethiopians","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T17:13:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BBC.YY"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (Updates an item published at 1427 GMT to lead with Eritrea's denial and add further detail.) \u001d  MEKELE, Ethiopia (AP)--Eritrea on Sunday dismissed allegations that its forces crossed into neighboring Ethiopia and kidnapped five Britons and 13 Ethiopians who were touring a remote region near the countries' long-disputed border, saying the claims were fabricated by archrival Ethiopia. \u001d  The tour group went missing Thursday while traveling in Ethiopia's Afar region, a barren expanse of salt mines and volcanoes 800 kilometers (500 miles) northeast of the capital, Addis Ababa. The Britons are employees of the British Embassy in Addis Ababa or their relatives, and Britain has sent a 10-member crisis team to help secure their release. \u001d  Communication and travel into Afar are extremely difficult, and any attempts to reach the group could be arduous. The region isn't heavily traveled by foreigners - in part because of its proximity to the countries' disputed border - although the moonlike landscape draws adventure tourists. Travelers are required to have armed guards. \u001d  Eritrean Information Minister Ali Abdu said claims by two senior Ethiopian officials that Eritrean commandoes seized the group were fabricated to make Eritrea look bad. Relations between the countries have been strained since Eritrea gained independence from the Addis Ababa government in 1993 following a 30-year guerrilla war. \u001d  \"Simply denying this is not enough,\" Abdu told The Associated Press on Sunday. \"People have to ask what is the motive behind this accusation.\" \u001d  Last week, the British Broadcasting Corp., quoting unidentified government sources, said there was a \"national security dimension\" to the disappearance of the Britons. British officials haven' commented on the report, and a spokeswoman for the embassy in Addis Ababa, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, had no new information Sunday. \u001d  Late Saturday, the state-run Ethiopian News Agency said five of the 13 Ethiopians in the tour group were found near the border with Eritrea, but it wasn't clear whether they had escaped or were released. \u001d  Esmal Ali Sero, head of the Afar administrative region, said Saturday that about 25 Eritrean \"commandoes\" kidnapped the British citizens along with their Ethiopian drivers and translators Thursday night, then set fire to the house where they were staying and their cars. He cited local investigators. A senior Ethiopian official in the ruling party, who asked not to be named, also said Eritreans were behind the kidnapping. \u001d  Also Sunday, a group of French tourists who had also been missing since Thursday arrived in Mekele, the Afar region's capital, and said they hadn't been kidnapped, as was previously believed. \u001d  \"Not at any time were we unsafe,\" said one of the tourists, who refused to give his name. He said the group simply didn't have a satellite phone and so couldn't check in with Origins Ethiopia tour group. Samson Teshome, head of Origins Ethiopia, also said the group hadn't been kidnapped. \u001d  French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy released a statement Sunday saying the group had been able to meet with an embassy representative. \u001d  \"We are continuing to verify that no French person is currently in that zone,\" he said in the statement. \u001d  Bandits and a small rebel group operate in Afar, where the famous Ethiopian fossil of Lucy, the earliest known hominid, was discovered in 1974. The Ethiopian government requires tourists to travel in Afar with armed guards; the British and French groups were believed to have complied. \u001d  Britain sent a crisis team to Ethiopia on Saturday in an effort to obtain the release of the five Britons. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 12:13 ET (17:13 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company,

\u001d  Jake Ulrich, managing director of Centrica Energy, the gas exploration and production arm of the group, said he had been advised against seeking a long-term gas supply deal with the Iranian National Oil Company, the newspaper reports, citing Ulrich. \u001d  \"We have to deal with Iran,\" the newspaper quoted Ulrich as saying. \"I don't think we are in a position to deal with them at this stage. In our discussions with the Foreign Office, for instance, they say it would be good to have a commercial relationship but this is not the time.\" \u001d  Ulrich said \"It is hard to envisage a long-term (liquefied natural gas) strategy without Iran.\" He added it might be possible to strike a supply deal with one of the foreign oil companies already in Iran, such as Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RSDB). \u001d  Iran, which has the world's third largest gas reserves, is currently embroiled in a tense standoff with the U.S. and Europe over its nuclear program. \u001d  Newspaper Web site:

JANUARY 31, 2007 AND 2006 \b    (in thousands of Canadian dollars) \b \b    1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION \b       --------------------- \b \b    These interim financial statements were prepared using accounting policies \band methods consistent with those used in the preparation of the Company's \baudited financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2006. These interim \bfinancial statements conform in all respects to the requirements of Canadian \bgenerally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements, with \bthe exception of certain note disclosures. As a result, these interim \bfinancial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited \bfinancial statements and notes for the year ended April 30, 2006 contained in \bthe Company's 2006 annual report. \b \b    2. SEASONALITY OF OPERATIONS \b       ------------------------- \b \b    The geographic distribution of our growth is having an impact on our \bhistorical seasonal patterns. With the exception of the third quarter, the \bCompany exhibits comparatively less seasonality in quarterly revenues than in \bthe past since a relatively higher proportion of revenues is coming from \bregions with more temperate or tropical climates that are not impacted by \bwinter weather conditions, and strong cyclical growth tends to mute normal \bseasonal patterns. Historically, the Company's operations tended to exhibit a \bseasonal pattern whereby its fourth quarter (February to April) was its \bstrongest. The third quarter (November to January) is normally the Company's \bweakest quarter due to the shutdown of mining and exploration activities for \bextended periods over the holiday season, particularly in South and Central \bAmerica. \b \b    3. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS \b       --------------------- \b \b    Effective December 1, 2006, the Company acquired 55 conventional drill \brigs, together with related support equipment, inventory, and contracts owned \bby the Longstaff group's drilling operations in southern Africa. These include \bthe operations of Raldril (Pty) Limited in South Africa, RA Longstaff \b(Botswana) (Pty) Ltd in Botswana, and R.A. Longstaff Namibia (Pty) Limited in \bNamibia. The total purchase price including post closing adjustments was \b$15,369. \b \b    Net assets acquired at fair market value at acquisition are as follows: \b \b    Assets acquired \b    Inventories           $     637 \b    Capital assets           14,311 \b    Other assets                421 \b                          ---------- \b    Net assets            $  15,369 \b                          ---------- \b                          ---------- \b \b    Consideration \b    Cash                  $  13,058 \b    Accounts payable          2,311 \b                          ---------- \b                          $  15,369 \b                          ---------- \b                          ---------- \b \b \b    4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS \b       ----------------------- \b \b    On June 7, 2006, the Company sold its manufacturing subsidiary (\"UDR\") for \bA$46.8 million (C$39.2 million). The consideration for the sale was \bA$43.3 million (C$36.2 million) cash and a holdback due in 18 months in the \bamount of A$3.5 million (C$3.0 million). The net gain before income taxes is \bC$22.3 million, being the proceeds of C$39.2 million less the book value of \bthe assets of C$13.3 million and expenses relating to the sale of C$3.6 \bmillion. UDR previously constituted the Company's entire manufacturing \bsegment. The Company made the strategic decision to focus its corporate \bresources on the mineral drilling business, where it competes as one of the \bworld's largest contract drillers. \b \b    The gain from discontinued operations of UDR is summarized as follows: \b \b                                2007 YTD    2006 YTD     2007 Q3     2006 Q3 \b                               ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------- \b \b    Revenue                    $   4,291   $  23,517   $       -   $   7,034 \b                               ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------- \b                               ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------- \b \b    Earnings (loss) before \b     income tax                      231       3,328         (49)      1,104 \b    Gain from disposal of \b     discontinued operations \b     before income tax            22,262           -           -           - \b    Income tax expense            (6,989)     (2,065)       (415)       (775) \b                               ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------- \b    Gain (loss) from \b     discontinued operations   $  15,504   $   1,263   $    (464)  $     329 \b                               ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------- \b                               ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------- \b \b \b    The Company made the strategic decision to close its operations in China \bin July, 2006. The Company opened a branch in China with the goal of quickly \bdeveloping a large pool of Chinese drillers. Having shown little progress to \bdate in building a local driller pool in China, the Company decided to close \bthe operation. Chinese operations were previously reported within the \bAustralasian and African segment. \b    The loss from discontinued operations of the branch in China is summarized \bas follows: \b \b                                2007 YTD    2006 YTD     2007 Q3     2006 Q3 \b                               ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------- \b \b    Revenue                    $     820   $   1,031   $       -   $     420 \b                               ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------- \b                               ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------- \b \b    (Loss) earnings               (2,466)       (256)       (262)         22 \b    Loss on disposition \b     including write-down \b     of assets                      (790)          -          (9)          - \b    (Loss) gain from \b     discontinued operations   $  (3,256)  $    (256)  $    (271)  $      22 \b                               ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------- \b                               ----------  ----------  ----------  ---------- \b \b \b    The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations of UDR and China are \bsummarized as follows: \b \b                                          January                      April \b                            UDR    China     2007      UDR    China     2006 \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b    Current Assets \b      Accounts \b       receivable       $     -  $     -  $     -  $ 6,048  $ 1,167  $ 7,215 \b      Other receivable    3,202        -    3,202        -        -        - \b      Inventories             -        -        -   13,587        -   13,587 \b      Other assets            -        -        -      113        8      121 \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b                          3,202        -    3,202   19,748    1,175   20,923 \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b \b    Long-Term Assets \b      Capital assets          -        -        -    1,167      731    1,898 \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b                              -        -        -    1,167      731    1,898 \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b \b    Current Liabilities \b      Accounts payable  $ 3,855  $    83  $ 3,938  $ 9,162  $   329  $ 9,491 \b      Income tax \b       payable            5,637        -    5,637      406       11      417 \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b                          9,492       83    9,575    9,568      340    9,908 \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b \b    Long-Term \b     Liabilities              -        -        -       18        -       18 \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b \b    Non-Controlling \b     Interest                 -        -        -      434        -      434 \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b                        -------  -------  -------  -------  -------  -------- \b \b \b    The comparative figures have been restated to reflect the discontinuation \bof these components. \b \b    5.

\u001d  (Adds details.) \b \u001d  By Stephen Wright \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--Star Cruises Ltd. (S21.SG), the minority partner in a Malaysian consortium that's developing a S$5.2 billion (US$3.4 billion) casino-resort in Singapore, is withdrawing from the investment after a tie-up with Macau casino baron Stanley Ho jeopardized chances of getting a casino license. \u001d  Bowing to pressure from the Singapore government, Star Cruises has agreed to sell its 25% stake in the casino-resort to consortium partner Genting International Ltd. (G13.SG), according to a statement filed Sunday with the Singapore Exchange. \u001d  The price of the stake will be agreed at a later date, Singapore-listed Genting International said in the statement. It has hired CIMB-GK Securities as a financial adviser. \u001d  In a related move, Genting International said Saturday it has pulled out of an investment with Star Cruises in a Macau casino and hotel that involves Ho - a controversial businessman who is alleged to have links to organized crime in the former Portuguese enclave. \u001d  Both developments come after the Singapore government Tuesday said Genting International, Star and their associates have to prove they can run a clean gambling venue if they want a casino operating license. \u001d  That warning was triggered by Genting International and Star Cruises, both units of Malaysian gambling group Genting Bhd. (3182.KU), announcing a deal to pay HK$1.47 billion for a 75% stake in the Macau project. \u001d  As part of the deal, a group of investors including Ho would get a 7% stake in Star Cruises, a cruise ship operator, giving Ho an indirect stake in the Singapore casino-resort that's being built on Sentosa Island. \u001d  Ho, through his closely held conglomerate Sociedade de Turismo & Diversoes de Macau, held Macau's exclusive gambling franchise from 1962 until 2002, when the government liberalized the industry. \u001d  Genting International said that taking 100% control of the Sentosa development will help it get a casino license. \u001d  \"The proposed acquisition will give Genting International full control over the Sentosa project. This will assist Genting International in the management process of casino application in due course,\" it said. \u001d  The city-state legalized casino gaming in 2005 and said it will allow two casino-resorts to be built as part of ambitious plans to double annual visitor arrivals to 17 million by 2015. \u001d  Genting's Resorts World at Sentosa is expected to open in 2010 and the Marina Bay Sands, which is being built by Las Vegas Sands Corp., is slated for completion in late 2009. \b \u001d  -By Stephen Wright, Dow Jones Newswires;

He said that the oil spill was caused by a rupture in a worn out section of the pipe that crosses the river. \u001d  One of TNK-BP's parent companies, BP PLC (BP), is already under intense scrutiny after a corroded transit pipe at its giant Prudoe Bay oil field in Alaska ruptured in March, resulting in an oil leak. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 09:32 ET (14:32 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"903711e85a6276144b57ebffe2fba979","symR":["VPL"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Vanguard Pacific ETF (VPL)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T10:51:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VPL"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\u001d  Vanguard Pacific ETF (VPL): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=VPL or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 05:51 ET (10:51 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"907d2fdf3d4fae32b6562d2f1d81e1aa","symR":["STAR.LN","GB00B00W1F70"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Star Energy Group PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T10:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["STAR.LN","GB00B00W1F70"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Star Energy Group PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB00B00W1F70 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 05:21 ET (10:21 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9096a856f36fe8a3c3c3444f072bbb5e","symR":["SUS.LN","GB0007655037"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for S & U PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T10:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SUS.LN","GB0007655037"],"IndustryCodes":["CFN"],"Story":"\u001d  S & U PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0007655037 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 05:08 ET (10:08 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"90a76e08d1b8e00cab148b30d7bdc2d5","symR":["CIT"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for CIT Group Inc.","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T08:35:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CIT"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\u001d  CIT Group Inc.: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=CIT or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 03:35 ET (08:35 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"90c92a72774ba317b92cadba9328dd6d","symR":["GDX"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Van Eck Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T10:45:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GDX"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT"],"Story":"\u001d  Van Eck Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=GDX or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 05:45 ET (10:45 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"90f8344757e27c848a5c477377dc354d","symR":["KEX"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Kirby Corporation","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T09:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["KEX"],"IndustryCodes":["MAR","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\u001d  Kirby Corporation: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=KEX or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 04:32 ET (09:32 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"9126209c2a695c37d05b64949694a0d7","symR":["OMG"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for OM.

Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements with respect to HudBay's exploration plans and spending. Generally, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"plans\", \"seeks\" \"budget\" or variations of such words or state that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"will\", \"will aim\" or \"will be focused\". Forward-looking information is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of HudBay to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including risks associated with the mining industry such as economic factors as they effect exploration, government regulation, environmental risks, success of exploration activities, future commodity prices, capital expenditures, conclusions of economic evaluations, risks related to acquisitions; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; access to capital as well as those factors discussed in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in HudBay's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2005, available on www.sedar.com. Although HudBay has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information.

Morrison Supermarkets PLC (MRW.LN), and Asda, the U.K. arm of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) - have pledged to compensate customers who can prove they had to buy parts for their car after using fuel that was contaminated by traces of silicon, The Sunday Telegraph reports, without citing sources. \u001d  Although the supermarkets are willing to compensate motorists for their parts, the three supermarkets are refusing to guarantee salesmen, taxi drivers and businesses compensation for lost sales stemming from the use of the contaminated fuel, the newspaper reports. \u001d  The total compensation bill for parts costing up to GBP2,000 a vehicle - whether voluntary or through claims in civil courts - could add up to GBP10 million, the newspaper reports, without citing sources. \u001d  Asda said it was already getting bogus compensation claims while Morrisons said it hasn't yet confirmed that it has sold the contaminated fuel, the newspaper reports. Morrisons has withdrawn fuel from 41 sites in southern England. The fuel had been sourced from the Vopak storage facility where the contaminated fuel was discovered. \u001d  Garages said they had begun reporting the news to the standards officers from Feb. 18 - ten days before the Tesco acknowledged a problem. \u001d  The three supermarket chains have removed the contaminated fuel from 221 gasoline stations - 150 of them at Tesco stores, the newspaper reports. \u001d  The silicon was traced to a chemical additive used by Harvest Energy Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blue Ocean Associates PLC, which shares a Vopak owned storage facility at West Thurrock, Essex, with Greenergy. Harvest Energy supplies fuel to Asda while Greenergy supplies fuel to Tesco and Morrisons. \u001d   Newspaper Web site: http://www.telegraph.co.uk \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44

(3182.KU), announcing a Macau casino-and-hotel deal with Stanley Ho, a controversial businessman who is alleged to have links to organized crime in the former Portuguese enclave. \u001d  On Saturday, Genting International said it had agreed to sell its 25% stake in the joint venture company that is making the Macau investment to Star Cruises for HK$58.5 million. \b \u001d  -By Stephen Wright, Dow

\u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The private equity consortium circling J Sainsbury PLC (SBRY.LN) will decide within eight days whether to abandon a possible GBP11 billion bid or to launch a formal offer, The Independent on Sunday newspaper reported. \u001d  Citing unnamed sources close to the deal, the paper said the private equity groups' decision to bring matters to a head has been triggered by a wave of negative publicity the bid has created. \u001d  On Feb. 2, CVC Capital Partners Ltd., Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Ltd. and Blackstone Group International Ltd. said they were at the \"preliminary stages of assessing\" a bid for Sainsbury. No price was mentioned in their brief statement to the London Stock Exchange. \u001d  Citing unnamed advisers, The Observer newspaper reported that the deal is on a knife edge and the private equity group is prepared to walk away from a bid following a strong rise in Sainsbury's share price. \u001d  The Mail on Sunday paper said separately that Sainsbury's may ask the Takeover Panel to issue a so-called \"put up or shut up\" notice to the private equity suitors. \u001d  Officials at Sainsbury's or the private equity companies couldn't immediately be reached for comment. \u001d  Newspaper

\u001d  LOS ANGELES (AP)--The biker buddy comedy \"Wild Hogs\" and its ensemble cast of John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, William H. Macy and Tim Allen was the weekend box office champ with a $38 million take, according to studio estimates Sunday. \u001d  It was Walt Disney Co.'s (DIS) biggest March opening ever. It was also the largest-ever debut for the 53-year-old Travolta as well as the best non-animated movie debut for Allen, who is also 53. Macy turns 57 next week and Lawrence turns 42 next month. \u001d  \"It's so easy to see in the material how much fun they were having together. The audience was looking for that first great comedy of the year,\" Disney president of distribution Chuck Viane said. \u001d  \"Wild Hogs\" performed well beyond expectations, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Media By Numbers.

\u001d  DUBAI (AP)--Dubai's government bolstered its holdings of New York City real estate, announcing Sunday that its Istithmar PJSC holding company had purchased a majority stake in Manhattan's five-star Mandarin Oriental hotel. \u001d  The $340 million purchase of the Mandarin Oriental, part of the Time Warner Center on Manhattan's Columbus Circle, adds to the growing U.S. real estate portfolio held by the Arab world's financial powerhouse. \u001d  Istithmar's New York properties include the W Hotel on Union Square, the Knickerbocker Hotel on Times Square and commercial buildings at 280 Park Avenue, 230 Park Avenue and 450 Lexington Avenue. The firm also owns the Hotel Washington in Washington D.C. \u001d  \"We're building a portfolio of both luxury and budget hotels in key target markets around the world,\" said Joe Sita, chief executive of Istithmar's hotels group. \u001d  Another Dubai government-held firm, Jumeirah International, owns the Jumeirah Essex House hotel on Manhattan's Central Park South. \u001d  Istithmar said in a prepared release that it bought a 73% share of the Mandarin Oriental, buying 25% from Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group and 48% from a joint venture between New York-based developers Apollo Real Estate Advisors LP and Related Cos. \u001d  Istithmar already holds 2.4% of Time Warner shares and options. \u001d  Dubai, one of seven city-states that form the U.S.-allied United Arab Emirates, has grown into a global financial capital despite its lack of petroleum reserves. The city has instead lured energy revenues from neighboring states through liberal investment and residency laws, booming financial and real estate sectors, and the Mideast's largest port and airport. \u001d  Istithmar is a sister company to the Dubai government-owned Dubai Ports World, one of the world's largest ports operators. DP World's purchase last year of operations in six U.S. ports touched off a political firestorm in the U.S. Congress, which cited security reasons for voting to force the Dubai company to sell its U.S. holdings. \u001d  The imbroglio damaged relations between Washington and the Emirates, where many said U.S. opposition to the deal smacked of anti-Arab bias. \u001d  American International Group Inc. (AIG), an insurance conglomerate, received approval last month from U.S. federal antitrust authorities to complete its purchase of the ports. \u001d  Last July, Istithmar paid $300 million for New York-based specialty retailer Loehmann's. Istithmar said it planned to increase the number of Loehmann's stores to 100 from 60 over the next five years and open a flagship on Manhattan's Upper West Side. \u001d  Elsewhere, Istithmar bought a $1 billion stake in London-based bank Standard Chartered Plc and acquired London's Adelphi building for $567 million . \u001d  Istithmar Hotels, founded less than a year ago, has already amassed a $3 billion portfolio of hotels and resorts. Besides those mentioned, it holds a portion of Kerzner Group, the developer and operator of Atlantis Resorts and luxury resort One and Only; as well as the franchise for budget hotel chain easyHotels in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia. \u001d  Jumeirah's other properties include a pair of luxury hotels in London, the Jumeirah Carlton Tower and the Jumeirah Lowndes Hotel. Jumeirah is building a luxury resort in Bermuda as well as hotels and resorts in China, Thailand and the Middle East. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 04:48 ET (09:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf7fbbf9300c8bb6b93a9ceea8f583be","symR":["EXE.FR","FR0004527638"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Exel Industries","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T08:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EXE.FR","FR0004527638"],"IndustryCodes":["TRQ"],"Story":"\u001d  Exel Industries: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=FR0004527638 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 03:54 ET (08:54 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"bf82e5b9806104dfc086c463e0619387","symR":["5767.FR","LU0122624777"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Orco Property Group","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T09:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["5767.FR","LU0122624777"],"IndustryCodes":["LOD","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Orco Property Group: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=LU0122624777 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 04:50 ET (09:50 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"bf83dece2bc82698fc88ce5008515e3d","symR":["30110.AE","ABN","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Influential Dutch Hldrs Back ABN Break-Up - Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T13:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30110.AE","ABN","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Some of The Netherlands' most influential shareholders have joined the calls of a London-based hedge fund in demanding the break-up of ABN Amro Holding NV (ABN), reports The Sunday Times. \u001d  VEB, the shareholder action group, has said it supports The Children's Investment fund's demands for a shake-up of strategy and management at ABN, the paper said.

New antitrust rules could make it even harder for a would-be foreign acquirer to get its hands on a Japanese steel producer. \u001d  This could support shares of Nippon Steel (5401.TO), the nation's largest producer by output and revenue, and JFE Holdings (5411.TO), the No. 2 maker. Their shares have risen in recent months on speculation that they could become acquisition targets. \u001d  The new guidelines, set to take effect in April, lower the hurdle for mergers among Japanese companies because they allow Japan's antitrust watchdog to consider the market share the combined company would have in the world, not just within Japan. \u001d  The regulations, which hew to global standards, would make it easier for a major Japanese steelmaker to buy a local rival and possibly become big enough to prevent being taken over by an overseas competitor. It also would allow a Japanese steel company to make a friendly \"white knight\" bid -- where a company tries to rescue a firm from an unwanted advance -- were another domestic steel producer to face a takeover threat from a foreign firm. \u001d  Japanese steel companies would prefer a domestic partner because of concerns about steelmaking technology falling into foreign hands. There is also an issue of national pride for them as one of the drivers of the nation's early 20th-century industrialization and post-World War II high-speed expansion, and as suppliers of components for Japan's current industrial might. \u001d  The rules might spark more consolidation among Japanese companies, says Nobuo Sayama, a partner at M&A boutique GCA in Tokyo. \"Whether the motive is as a white knight or a pre-emptive, defensive merger, consolidation will speed up,\" he says. \u001d  The regulatory changes come at a time when an increasing number of foreign companies are interested in buying Japanese companies, analysts and bankers say. After Mittal Steel, of the Netherlands, last year made its hostile bid for Luxembourg-based Arcelor, Japanese companies feared that eventually, they, too, could be gobbled up by an acquisitive global steelmaker. (The bid for Arcelor eventually succeeded, and the two soon will be legally merged, forming the world's biggest steelmaker in terms of volume and sales.) \u001d  Arcelor Mittal hasn't indicated that it is interested in buying a Japanese steel maker. \u001d  \"We are in support of further industry consolidation and as the market leader, we intend to continue to participate in such consolidation,\" says Luc Scheer, a spokesman for the steelmaker. \"We would not comment on specific countries or opportunities, but our long-term growth focus is particularly oriented toward the potential of developing economies.\" \u001d  Japanese steel companies could be attractive targets. Nippon Steel, JFE and others provide major components for Japan's world-class exports such as ships, machine tools and automobiles, supplying the likes of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota Motor. The century-old domestic industry is at the forefront of global steel-production technology. Nippon Steel has some 7,000 steelmaking patents. That compares with 5,500 at Arcelor Mittal, which has more than double the revenue and more than three times the output of the Japanese maker. \u001d  Noboru Yamamoto, a managing director at Nikko Citigroup's investment-banking unit, says Japanese steelmakers will become a \"must have\" for companies like Arcelor Mittal because of their technology and strong relationships with heavyweight Japanese customers. \u001d  That possibility hasn't been lost on the Japanese producers. Nippon Steel adopted a poison pill in March last year, a takeover defense that enables it to dilute an acquirer's share stake. Smaller rivals Sumitomo Metal Industries and Kobe Steel followed suit over the next month. Nippon Steel and JFE also have bought back shares to reduce the number traded on the open market and bolster their firms' valuations. JFE said Thursday that it is planning defenses against takeovers. \u001d  A Japanese trade-and-industry official said the ministry has been pressing steelmakers for \"quite a while\" to put in antitakeover measures, including poison pills. \u001d  The firms have been forging closer ties with friendly partners. In addition to holding shares in each other, Nippon Steel, Sumitomo and Kobe agreed in March 2006 to consult each other on what steps they might take if one of the companies comes under attack. Nippon Steel has tightened its relationship with Posco, the world's No. 3 steel producer in terms of output, and has ties with German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp. \u001d  Speculation of a hostile move on one of Japan's major integrated steelmakers has helped lift their stock prices. Even without foreign moves on them, there is the possibility of a domestic merger that would buoy their stock prices. \u001d  Nippon Steel and JFE have nearly doubled since Mittal announced its Arcelor bid Jan. 27 last year. Friday, shares of Nippon Steel rose 32 yen (27 cents), or 3.9%, to 849 yen -- compared with 429 yen when Mittal unveiled its Arcelor plan. JFE's shares, which were at 4,030 yen when Mittal first moved, rose 120 yen, or 1.7%, Friday to close at 7,350 yen. \u001d  Under the new rules, which use the same Herfindahl Hirschman Index -- a gauge of a market's concentration rather than the share of individual companies when assessing pending deals -- that U.S. and European Union regulators use, a Nippon Steel-JFE combination will be theoretically possible. Most analysts believe that under the old rules, Japanese antitrust regulators would have vetoed the idea, as a combined entity would have more than 50% of the home market. The broader scope of the new rules might allow such a merger, as the two steelmakers together have 6% of the global market. \b \u001d  -By James Simms, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; james.simms@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 17:27 ET (22:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c00cf5416deb35755efba88b7d90717c","symR":["JEO.LN","GB0000197722"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Jupiter European Opp Tst PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T09:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["JEO.LN","GB0000197722"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Jupiter European Opp Tst PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0000197722 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 04:26 ET (09:26 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c00d1a014028795ae7ecdb226cf7dbec","symR":["ELE","ELE.MC","EN","ENEL.MI","EOA.XE","EON","GS","DE0007614406","ES0130670112","IT0003128367","US38141G1040"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"E.ON Advised To Buy Enel Stk As Move In Endesa Battle -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T11:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ELE","ELE.MC","EN","ENEL.MI","EOA.XE","EON","GS","DE0007614406","ES0130670112","IT0003128367","US38141G1040"],"IndustryCodes":["ELC","MUT","SCR","XDAX","XDJGI","XFFX","XIBEX","XISL","XMIB","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  BERLIN (Dow Jones)--German utility E.ON AG (EON) has been advised by bankers to acquire a stake in Italian rival Enel SpA (EN) to use as bargaining tool in its takeover bid for Spain's Endesa SA (ELE), German magazine Spiegel reports without citing its sources. \u001d  According to the magazine, the move to buy a stake of up to 25% in Enel on the international markets, has been advised by U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Abdu said the claims were baseless. \u001d  Relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea have been consistently strained since Eritrea gained independence from the Addis Ababa government in 1993 following a 30-year guerrilla war. \u001d  The tour group went missing Thursday while traveling in Ethiopia's Afar region, a barren expanse of ancient salt mines and volcanoes some 800 kilometers northeast of the capital, Addis Ababa. Communications to Afar are extremely difficult, but the otherworldly, moonlike landscape draws adventure travelers. \u001d  The British Broadcasting Corp., quoting unidentified government sources, said there was a \"national security dimension\" to the disappearance of the Britons, all of whom are employees of the British Embassy in Addis Ababa or their relatives. The British Foreign Office and the British Defense Ministry wouldn't comment on the BBC report. \u001d  Esmal Ali Sero, head of the Afar administrative region, said about 25 Eritrean \"commandoes\" kidnapped the British citizens along with their Ethiopian drivers and translators Thursday night. He cited local investigators. \u001d  A senior Ethiopian official in the ruling party, who asked not to be named, also said Eritreans were behind the kidnapping. He said a herder saw the British group at the Ara-ta military camp in Eritrea and reported it to the Ethiopians. Herders in Afar frequently travel between the two countries. \u001d  Tour operators in the area also said they were told by police that Eritreans in military uniforms kidnapped the Britons and burned down the house where they were staying, along with several vehicles. \u001d  A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Addis Ababa, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said she had no information: \"We do not know where they are or who is holding them. We are not prepared to speculate.\" \u001d  Also Sunday, a group of French tourists who had also been missing since Thursday arrived in Mekele, the Afar region's capital, and said they hadn't been kidnapped, as was previously believed. \u001d  \"Not at any time were we unsafe,\" said one of the tourists, who refused to give his name. He said the group simply didn't have a satellite phone and so couldn't check in with Origins Ethiopia tour group. Samson Teshome, head of Origins Ethiopia, also said the group hadn't been kidnapped. \u001d  Sources including French diplomats and local businessmen had been reporting that the French were kidnapped. \u001d  French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy released a statement Sunday saying the group had been able to meet with an embassy representative. \u001d  \"We are continuing to verify that no French person is currently in that zone,\" he said in the statement. \u001d  Bandits and a small rebel group operate in Afar, where the famous Ethiopian fossil of Lucy, the earliest known hominid, was discovered in 1974. The Ethiopian government requires tourists to travel in Afar with armed guards; the British and French groups were believed to have complied. \u001d  Britain sent a crisis team to Ethiopia on Saturday in an effort to obtain the release of the five Britons. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 09:27 ET (14:27 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c18c0e363511e3fc9d344e745a5931dc","symR":["NNJ"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Nuveen NJ Premium Income Municipal (NNJ)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T10:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["NNJ"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Nuveen NJ Premium Income Municipal (NNJ): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=NNJ or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 05:03 ET (10:03 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c1ccbe8e741b8e9fe6466c10021dac34","symR":["QSC.XE","DE0005137004"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for QSC AG","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T10:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["QSC.XE","DE0005137004"],"IndustryCodes":["ISV","XDJGI","XNMP","XTDX"],"Story":"\u001d  QSC AG: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=DE0005137004 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 05:02 ET (10:02 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c221c858b332f97f398a3df9c6a1985a","symR":["BLR.LN","GB0030371917"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Black Rock Oil & Gas Plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T08:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BLR.LN","GB0030371917"],"IndustryCodes":["OIS"],"Story":"\u001d  Black Rock Oil & Gas Plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0030371917 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 03:21 ET (08:21 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"c24025d12fe8aeef93c6ea96e4062dfe","symR":["1066.KU","1309.KU","MYL1066OO009","MYL1309OO003"],"date":"2007-03-04","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"RHB Said To Attract Kuwait Fin House, EPF Offers- Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-04T06:50:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["1066.KU","1309.KU","MYL1066OO009","MYL1309OO003"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","IDD","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  KUALA LUMPUR (Dow Jones)--Kuwait Finance House Malaysia Bhd. has applied to the Bank Negara Malaysia for permission to make a general offer for Rashid Hussain Bhd.

WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \b   By James Simms \u001d  Tokyo -- POISON PILLS, SHARE buybacks, friendly alliances and cross-shareholdings -- Japanese steelmakers have tried them all to become less appealing takeover targets to foreign steel companies. New antitrust rules could make it even harder for a would-be foreign acquirer to get its hands on a Japanese steel producer. \u001d  This could support shares of Nippon Steel, the nation's largest producer by output and revenue, and JFE Holdings, the No. 2 maker. Their shares have risen in recent months on speculation that they could become acquisition targets. \u001d  The new guidelines, set to take effect in April, lower the hurdle for mergers among Japanese companies because they allow Japan's antitrust watchdog to consider the market share the combined company would have in the world, not just within Japan. \u001d  The regulations, which hew to global standards, would make it easier for a major Japanese steelmaker to buy a local rival and possibly become big enough to prevent being taken over by an overseas competitor. It also would allow a Japanese steel company to make a friendly \"white knight\" bid -- where a company tries to rescue a firm from an unwanted advance -- were another domestic steel producer to face a takeover threat from a foreign firm. \u001d  Japanese steel companies would prefer a domestic partner because of concerns about steelmaking technology falling into foreign hands. There is also an issue of national pride for them as one of the drivers of the nation's early 20th-century industrialization and post-World War II high-speed expansion, and as suppliers of components for Japan's current industrial might. \u001d  The rules might spark more consolidation among Japanese companies, says Nobuo Sayama, a partner at M&A boutique GCA in Tokyo. \"Whether the motive is as a white knight or a pre-emptive, defensive merger, consolidation will speed up,\" he says. \u001d  The regulatory changes come at a time when an increasing number of foreign companies are interested in buying Japanese companies, analysts and bankers say. After Mittal Steel, of the Netherlands, last year made its hostile bid for Luxembourg-based Arcelor, Japanese companies feared that eventually, they, too, could be gobbled up by an acquisitive global steelmaker. (The bid for Arcelor eventually succeeded, and the two soon will be legally merged, forming the world's biggest steelmaker in terms of volume and sales.) \u001d  Arcelor Mittal hasn't indicated that it is interested in buying a Japanese steel maker. \u001d  \"We are in support of further industry consolidation and as the market leader, we intend to continue to participate in such consolidation,\" says Luc Scheer, a spokesman for the steelmaker. \"We would not comment on specific countries or opportunities, but our long-term growth focus is particularly oriented toward the potential of developing economies.\" \u001d  Japanese steel companies could be attractive targets. Nippon Steel, JFE and others provide major components for Japan's world-class exports such as ships, machine tools and automobiles, supplying the likes of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toyota Motor. The century-old domestic industry is at the forefront of global steel-production technology. Nippon Steel has some 7,000 steelmaking patents. That compares with 5,500 at Arcelor Mittal, which has more than double the revenue and more than three times the output of the Japanese maker. \u001d  Noboru Yamamoto, a managing director at Nikko Citigroup's investment-banking unit, says Japanese steelmakers will become a \"must have\" for companies like Arcelor Mittal because of their technology and strong relationships with heavyweight Japanese customers. \u001d  That possibility hasn't been lost on the Japanese producers. Nippon Steel adopted a poison pill in March last year, a takeover defense that enables it to dilute an acquirer's share stake. Smaller rivals Sumitomo Metal Industries and Kobe Steel followed suit over the next month. Nippon Steel and JFE also have bought back shares to reduce the number traded on the open market and bolster their firms' valuations. JFE said Thursday that it is planning defenses against takeovers. \u001d  A Japanese trade-and-industry official said the ministry has been pressing steelmakers for \"quite a while\" to put in antitakeover measures, including poison pills. \u001d  The firms have been forging closer ties with friendly partners. In addition to holding shares in each other, Nippon Steel, Sumitomo and Kobe agreed in March 2006 to consult each other on what steps they might take if one of the companies comes under attack. Nippon Steel has tightened its relationship with Posco, the world's No. 3 steel producer in terms of output, and has ties with German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp. \u001d  Speculation of a hostile move on one of Japan's major integrated steelmakers has helped lift their stock prices. Even without foreign moves on them, there is the possibility of a domestic merger that would buoy their stock prices. \u001d  Nippon Steel and JFE have nearly doubled since Mittal announced its Arcelor bid Jan. 27 last year. Friday, shares of Nippon Steel rose 32 yen (27 cents), or 3.9%, to 849 yen -- compared with 429 yen when Mittal unveiled its Arcelor plan. JFE's shares, which were at 4,030 yen when Mittal first moved, rose 120 yen, or 1.7%, Friday to close at 7,350 yen. \u001d  Under the new rules, which use the same Herfindahl Hirschman Index -- a gauge of a market's concentration rather than the share of individual companies when assessing pending deals -- that U.S. and European Union regulators use, a Nippon Steel-JFE combination will be theoretically possible. Most analysts believe that under the old rules, Japanese antitrust regulators would have vetoed the idea, as a combined entity would have more than 50% of the home market. The broader scope of the new rules might allow such a merger, as the two steelmakers together have 6% of the global market. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 04, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30

Notonthehighstreet.com (www.notonthehighstreet.com), the UK based shopping website that supports over 500 of Britain's most creative small businesses, today announces a major development as NewMedia SPARK plc (LSE:NMS), the quoted venture capital organisation focused on early stage investments in the technology, media and telecoms sectors, becomes a significant minority shareholder in the company. In addition, Tom Teichman, Chairman and Founder of NewMedia SPARK plc, who handed over the first investment cheque to lastminute.com, joins the board of notonthehighstreet.com with immediate effect. \b \u001d  Notonthehighstreet.com launched in April 2006 selling high quality original products from 130 of Britain's best small businesses. Such has been its rapid success that, in less than a year, it now helps over 500 carefully selected quality small businesses to sell over 10,000 products under its unique umbrella shopping website giving an original product offering and service to consumers that is not available on the high street. \b \u001d  NewMedia SPARK's investment will enable even more small businesses to become part of the notonthehighstreet.com community and to build notonthehighstreet.com into a brand that is synonymous with small, creative lifestyle businesses and products. \b \u001d  Founders of notonthehighstreet.com, Holly Tucker and Sophie Cornish, commented: \"NewMedia SPARK's investment in the company is the most exciting news for us, and will make a huge commercial and competitive difference to the small businesses we already support and to the new ones that we look forward to joining us. This investment will enable us to accelerate our expansion plans and launch internationally over the next two years, increase our product categories as well as undergo a series of business developments particularly in the areas of technology and marketing. NewMedia SPARK is a great investor for us with its unprecedented knowledge of the online business world with a portfolio to match. We are delighted that Tom is joining our board: his long-standing experience and reputation, as well as passion and commitment to our business, is amazing.\" \b \u001d  Tom Teichman added: \"Notonthehighstreet.com is a great addition to SPARK's existing portfolio and I am looking forward to bringing our expertise in digital start-ups to the business. Holly and Sophie have that contagious passion we know as 'the spark' - an undefined magic ingredient that we share for notonthehighstreet.com. Together we are going to fully exploit and grow notonthehighstreet.com's potential to create something of real value in the small business and digital worlds.\" \b \u001d  Note to Editors: Holly Tucker, Sophie Cornish and Tom Teichman are available for interview. \b \b   Notonthehighstreet.com \b \u001d  Notonthehighstreet.com was an overnight success when it launched on 3 April 2006.

WIRE) -- 03/02/07 -- \u001d   HudBay Minerals Inc. (TSX: HBM) (HudBay) announces results from its second half 2006 exploration in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Illustrations and previously released data are available at www.hudbayminerals.com. \b \u001d  During the second half of 2006, approximately 23,738 meters of diamond drilling in 39 surface drill holes was completed, with a focus on mineral deposit targets and structural targets. HudBay's subsidiary, Hudson Bay Exploration and Development Company Limited (HBED) managed the exploration in the Flin Flon Greenstone Belt and the majority of the exploration was funded by flow-through financing. \b \u001d  \"Drill results continued to be encouraging at the Bur deposit and at the Talbot Lake deposit where one intersection was 12.44% copper over 9.65 meters,\" said Peter Jones, President & CEO. \"For 2007 we have increased our total exploration program expenditure plans to $37 million, making it one of the largest in Canada.\" \b \u001d  Exploration results reported in this release exclude results from exploration within HudBay operating mines and exploration at locations other than northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan. HudBay recently announced that its January 1, 2007 aggregate estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources increased compared to those at January 1, 2006, after taking into account 2006 ore production. \b \b    Mineral Deposit Targets \b \b    Bur Deposit \b \u001d  The Bur deposit is 22 kilometres from the Snow Lake concentrator. Drilling at the Bur deposit in the second half of 2006 improved the definition of mineralization. As a result of earlier drilling, HudBay announced in December 2006 plans to invest approximately $8.5 million at the Bur deposit for additional in-fill diamond drilling, underground excavations to extract a 10,000 tonne ore sample, obtaining production permits as well as completion of a feasibility study. During the second half of 2006, 1,150 meters of drilling were completed. Notable intersections included: \b \b \b- 3.25% Cu, 17.65% Zn over 1.21 meters in drill hole BZS015; \b- 5.34% Cu, 4.99% Zn over 1.47 meters in drill hole BZS022; \b \b \u001d  Drilling will continue in 2007 as part of the $8.5 million planned investment. \b \b    Talbot Lake Deposit \b \b    The Talbot Lake deposit is located 83 km from the Snow Lake concentrator. \b \u001d  In the second half of 2006, 7,084 meters were drilled in eleven holes. Ten of those holes intersected mineralization. \b \u001d  The last drill hole of the program - hole TLS020, made a very encouraging intersection which assayed 11.16 grams/tonne gold, 184.37 grams/tonne silver, 12.44% copper and 3.50% zinc over 9.65 meters. \b \b \bOther main zone intersections were: \b \b- 1.09% Cu, 6.32% Zn over 1.69 meters in drill hole TLS010; \b- 4.24% Cu, 0.59% Zn over 3.15 meters in drill hole TLS011; \b- 0.62% Cu, 1.03% Zn over 1.72 meters in drill hole TLS012: \b- 2.15% Cu, 1.68% Zn over 1.29 meters in drill hole TLS013; \b- 0.10% Cu, 8.13% Zn over 0.74 meters in drill hole TLS014; \b- 0.94% Cu, 0.53% Zn over 1.66 meters in drill hole TLS015; \b- 0.61% Cu, 0.08% Zn over 1.20 meters in drill hole TLS016; \b- 0.47% Cu, 0.40% Zn over 9.70 meters in drill hole TLS017; \b- 0.60% Cu, 2.63% Zn over 2.09 meters in drill hole TLS018; \b- TLS019 was abandoned \b \b \u001d  HudBay will follow up exploration of the significant mineralization intersected in drill hole TLS020 at the earliest opportunity. \b \b    Structural Targets \b \b    Chisel Target \b \u001d  Drilling continued at the previously mined Chisel and Photo Lake properties, and on targets related to the operating Chisel North mine. 5388 meters were drilled in 10 parent drill holes and two wedge cuts. \b \b    Notable intersections included: \b \b \b- 0.10% Cu, 3.34% Zn over 1.00 meter in drill hole CH0602; \b- 0.13% Cu, 7.65% Zn over 0.69 meters in drill hole CH0602W1 \b \b \u001d  Drill holes CH0603, CH0505, CH0606, CH0607, CH0608 and DUB166 tested Quantec Titan 24 deep penetrating geophysical anomalies identified in a survey completed in the first quarter of 2006. Although no notable assay intervals were intersected, CH0606 intersected 7.71 meters of massive pyrite from 531.71 to 539.42 meters coincident with a Titan 24 anomaly and also with the Chisel Mine horizon. Additional exploration is planned to test this mineralization in 2007. \b \u001d  Two drill holes, DUB165 and DUB167 tested targets below the now closed Photo Lake mine. There were no notable intersections in DUB165 however DUB167 intersected a wide interval of quartz-staurolite-biotite-chlorite gneiss with disseminated chalcopyrite (copper) stringer mineralization. \b \b    Flin Flon, Manitoba \b \u001d  2,130 meters were drilled in four holes testing the hanging wall stratigraphy and along the strike of the Flin Flon - 777 mine. There were no notable intersections. \b \b    Flin Flon, Saskatchewan \b \u001d  4,774 meters were drilled in five holes that tested a structurally repeated fault block of the Flin Flon mine stratigraphy located deep in the footwall of the Flin Flon mine, previously intersected by holes completed in 2005. There were no notable mineral intersections. \b \b    Geophysical Targets \b \u001d  738 meters were drilled in three holes east and south of Snow Lake to test geophysical anomalies. There were no notable intersections. \b \b \b2007 Expenditure Plans(i) \b=------------------------ \b \b=--------------------------------------------------------------------- \bFlin Flon Greenstone Belt \b \b                                    ($ millions) \bElectromagnetic anomalies                   8.5 \bKnown deposits                              4.5 \bOperating mines                             4.0 \bGeophysics                                  3.0 \bStructural targets                          3.0 \bAdministration/miscellaneous                3.0 \b                                                     26.0 \b \bOther Locations \b \bBalmat District                             4.0 \bUnallocated                                 7.0 \b                                                     11.0 \b                                                  ------- \bTotal planned 2007 expenditure                      $37.0 million \b \b=--------------------------------------------------------------------- \b \b(i)All expenditures are preliminary estimates and actual expenditures may \b   vary depending on several factors \b \b \u001d  HudBay's exploration properties include approximately 380,000 hectares in the prolific Flin Flon Greenstone Belt of Manitoba and Saskatchewan and approximately 20,000 hectares in the Balmat district of New York state. In addition, HudBay owns the Tom zinc/lead mineral deposit in the Yukon and holds an option to purchase the adjacent Jason zinc/lead mineral property. Additional exploration assets include copper exploration properties in Chile and zinc exploration properties in Southwestern Ontario. \b \b    2006 HudBay Procedures \b \u001d  Exploration core drilling was either NQ or BQ size. The core was logged and mineralized intersections were marked for sampling and assaying, by HBED employed geologists. The marked intersections or intervals were sawn in half by a diamond saw and one half of the core was placed in plastic bags and tagged with unique sample numbers, while the second half was returned to the core box and stored. \b \u001d  Each bagged core sample was transported to the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co., Limited's assay laboratory in Flin Flon, Manitoba where it was dried, crushed and pulverized and a 250-gram sample was prepared for assaying. From each 250 gram sample 0.25 grams was removed and leached in aqua regia and analyzed by ICP-AES for Ag, Cu, Zn, As, Pb, Ni and Fe. Also from the 250-gram sample, 15 grams was removed for gold determination by fire assaying with Atomic Absorption finish. \b \u001d  Assaying integrity is monitored internally with a quality control program, which includes the use of assay sample standards, blanks, duplicates and repeats and externally through national and international programs. In addition, within each group of 20 core samples, one core sample has a second 250 gram split collected for check assaying at Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd. in Vancouver, B.C. \b \b    News Release and Attachments \b \u001d  The news release and attached tables provide core lengths and additionally where indicated, horizontal or vertical lengths of mineralization intersected. True widths are not provided. Where metal assays are provided for intersections they are either a single assay of a sample of the entire intersection length or a composite of assays calculated from interval weighted assays over the intersection length. \b \u001d  The data herein and the contents of this news release have been reviewed by Kelly Gilmore, B.Sc.

On a non-GAAP basis, EBITDA* (defined as income before financial income (expenses), net; other income (expenses), net; income taxes; depreciation and amortization) for 2006 increased by 13% to NIS 147 million compared to NIS 130 million recorded in the previous year. \b \u001d  Net income for the year was NIS 41 million. This includes the effect of a one-time charge of NIS 6 million relating to 012 Golden Lines' uncompleted initial public offering. Excluding this one-time charge, the Company's net income in 2006 reached NIS 47 million, an increase of 74% compared with NIS 27 million in 2005. \b \b    Non-GAAP Measure \b \u001d  EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not in accordance with GAAP. The company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the Company's results and facilitates comparison of results across reporting periods. The Company used this non-GAAP measure when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal resource management, planning and forecasting purposes. This non-GAAP measure should not be viewed in isolation from or as a substitute for the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. For more information, please see the table included at the end of this release. \b \b    Comments of Management \b \u001d  Commenting on the results, Ms. Stella Handler, CEO of 012 Golden Lines, said, \"We are proud to report an excellent year across all parameters. We reported record revenues along with strong operating profit, net profit and EBITDA, the tangible results of the professional execution delivered throughout the year by each of our business segments. \b \u001d  \"As we move into 2007, our goal is to continue building each of our businesses while simultaneously merging with Smile.Communications, building a forceful new company with a significant share of several large markets and annual revenues above of NIS 1.2 billion. We will work to further expand our Internet access customer base, adding significant numbers of new residential and business customers. In parallel, we intend to immediately begin taking advantage of our new VOB license with the roll-out of an attractive variety of innovative services, to make VOB one of our strongest growth drivers during the next several years.\" \b \u001d  012 Golden Lines is Israel's largest provider of domestic telephony over broadband (VOB) services, and the first company to receive a permanent VOB license.

Saturday. \u001d  The government wants the network to be capable of speeds of 1 gigabits a second or more and to connect to 95% of businesses and homes by 2012. A wireless component will extend broadband Internet access to public places. \u001d  The companies bidding alone are Japan's Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (9432.TO), Siemens AG (SIE.XE) and two Singapore-based telephone companies, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (Z74.SG) and StarHub Ltd. (Z81.SG). \u001d  A third Singapore telecommunications company, MobileOne Ltd. (M31.SG), is a member of a consortium led by Hong Kong Broadband Network Ltd. \u001d  SingTel is also leading a consortium comprising Australian investment bank Babcock & Brown Ltd.

Earnings from continuing operations, \bon the same rolling 12-month basis, increased by 56.4 percent to $38.0 million \bfrom $24.3 million for the corresponding period last year. \b \b    Year to date ended January 31, 2007 \b \b    Revenues for the nine-month period ending January 31, 2007 increased \b25.9 percent to $286.4 million from $227.5 million for the corresponding \bperiod last year. More than half of this increase in revenues is related to \bLatin America. \b    Gross margins for the nine-month period were 31.3 percent compared to 28.3 \bpercent last year due mainly to an improving pricing environment. With the \bincrease in revenues and improving gross margins, gross profit for the \bnine-month period increased by 38.9 percent to $89.6 million compared to \b$64.5 million for the prior year period. \b    General and administrative expenses increased to $23.6 million compared to \b$20.9 million for the same period last year. The increase is primarily due to \badditions to management to accommodate growth and salary increases across the \boperations. \b    Other expenses were $7.1 million for the nine-month period compared to \b$5.3 million for the same period last year due, in part, to an increase in \bincentive provisions as a result of improved profitability and increased \bprovision for bad debt, muted by a gain on sale of investments. \b    Foreign exchange loss was $0.4 million for the nine-month period compared \bto $0.8 million in the prior year period. \b    Short-term interest revenue was $0.3 million for the nine-month period \bcompared to an expense of $0.6 million last year, while interest on long-term \bdebt was $1.9 million compared to $2.1 million for the same period last year. \b    Amortization expense increased to $14.6 million for the nine-month period, \bcompared to $12.9 million for the same period last year, as a result of \bincreased investment in equipment. \b    The provision for income tax for the nine-month period was $13.6 million \bcompared to $5.9 million for the prior year period reflecting the increase in \bpre-tax earnings. \b    Earnings from continuing operations for the nine-month period were \b$28.7 million or $1.24 per share ($1.22 per share diluted) compared to \b$15.9 million or $0.70 per share ($0.69 per share diluted) for the same period \blast year. \b    Gain from discontinued operations was $12.2 million or $0.53 per share \bcompared to a gain of $1.0 million or $0.05 per share for the same period last \byear.

The oil leak occurred on Feb. 28, Reuters said. \u001d  Local media reported last week that about five tons of oil products had leaked into the river in the Orenburg region. \u001d  TNK-BP couldn't be reached for comment on Sunday. \u001d  Mitvol said the worn-out machinery at Orenburgneft, which produced 120 million barrels of crude oil in 2006, had caused the leak. The leak posed a danger to water supplies in the eastern Russian region, which borders Kazakhstan, Reuters reported. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.tnk-bp.com \b \u001d  -By Alex MacDonald,

The pipeline pumps oil products from the Orenburgneft's Krasnoyarskoye oil field. \u001d  Mitvol said that initial tests show that a minimum of 150 tons or 1,100 barrels of oil products spilt into the river. The pipeline was shut down on Feb. 28, but Mitvol said it wasn't clear how long the pipe had been leaking oil products into the river. \u001d  \"We don't know how many days or weeks oil has been going into the river,\" Mitvol said. \u001d   He added the environment agency was working to purify the water supplies of cities affected by the oil spill. The Kinel river flows into the much larger Volga river via the Samara river, posing a danger to water supplies in the eastern Russian region, which borders Kazakhstan. \u001d  Mitvol said the agency will provide more details about the size and impact of the oil spill on Monday. The leak had already contaminated water supplies at three small cities 60 kilometers from the source of the spill, Mitvol said. The oil spill was caused by a rupture in a worn out section of the pipe that crosses underneath the river. \u001d  One of TNK-BP's parent companies, BP PLC (BP), is already under intense scrutiny after a corroded transit pipe at its giant Prudoe Bay oil field in Alaska ruptured in March, resulting in an oil leak. \u001d   Mitvol said that TNK-BP had failed to reinforce the aging pipeline in accordance with environmental standards regarding river crossings. Pipelines that cross rivers must have two pipes: one inside the other. The leaking oil pipe only had one layer, Mitvol said. \u001d  The TNK-BP joint venture is already facing uncertainty after Russian state authorities began threatening to revoke TNK-BP's license to develop the Kovykta gas field in eastern Siberia due to underproduction rather than environmental problems at the field. \u001d  Mitvol has become famous in Russia for his aggressive stance against oil companies, especially foreign ones, both over their environmental policies and other issues not directly in his portfolio. \u001d  Spokespeople for TNK-BP couldn't be reached for comment on Sunday. \u001d  TNK-BP is half-owned by BP and half-owned by a consortium of Russian investors. \b \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.tnk-bp.com \b \u001d  -By Alex MacDonald, Dow Jones Newswires;
