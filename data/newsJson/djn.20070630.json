But the British company should be careful about what it wishes for. \u001d  Vodafone, whose American depositary shares trade under the ticker VOD, might get the deal, but on terms far less favorable than it's accustomed to receiving from other equipment suppliers because of Apple's iPod-charged bargaining power. \u001d  Despite the desire by mobile operators for an exclusive deal to carry the iPhone in the U.S., Verizon Wireless -- a joint venture of Vodafone and Verizon Communications (VZ) -- walked away from talks with Apple (AAPL) because it felt the tech company's demands were too onerous. Apple (see page 15) insisted on controlling how and where the iPhone could be sold, restricting its availability to a few locations and leaving major retail chains out of the loop. \u001d  Apple also demanded control of the relationship with customers, relegating Verizon Wireless to a backseat role. That was too much for Verizon Wireless, and similar proposals could well prove too much for Vodafone. \u001d  The agreement between Apple and AT&T (T) includes revenue-sharing, with a proportion of AT&T's monthly subscription plan for the iPhone going to Apple. This is a pretty audacious demand because the iPhone could turn out to be only a niche product, despite the thousands queuing up to buy it Friday. \u001d  Vodafone also must take into account the fact that the multimedia end of Europe's handset market is much more competitive than the U.S.' And doing a deal with Apple comes with extra costs. To carry iPhone-compatible e-mail traffic, European operators will have to invest in their infrastructure. \u001d  Thus, it's hard to believe that Vodafone would agree to an AT&T-style arrangement, giving away subscriber revenue to Apple, which would be a first in Europe. Not that Arun Sarin, the CEO of Vodafone, won't be tempted. He wants 10% of his company's revenue to come from data services in the next three years, and the iPhone could help to drive demand. \u001d  But the selling price of Apple's handset is one reason for not projecting sales on the scale of the iPod's. European mobile customers are used to receiving heavy discounts on phones, and many handsets are fast approaching commodity status. \u001d  Persuading people to spend a possible 300 British pounds or 450 euros ($600) on the iPhone, in addition to contract costs, will prove difficult, despite the device's innovative design. And with only 10 million iPhones expected to be sold worldwide in the first year, the device's overall market share will be small. Europe alone should account for 200 million mobile-phone sales in the same period. \u001d  So, even though shares of Vodafone edged up last week, after a Dutch newspaper reported that the company was the favorite to get rights to the iPhone in Europe, investors should keep in mind that a deal with Apple could be an expensive venture. \b \u001d  Investors like a sure thing. Yet Diageo's consistency in delivering what it has promised isn't reflected in its stock-market valuation. \u001d  The premium drink maker's American depositary shares (DEO) fell more than 2% Thursday, to 83.20, although management said that it's on track to meet earnings expectations. \u001d  If that were a one-off, there'd be nothing to worry about. But Diageo, which is being valued at 16 times 2008 estimated earnings, trades at a 6% discount to Anheuser Busch, (BUD) almost 11% to Heineken (HEIA.Netherlands) and about 9% to its nearest wine-and-spirits rival, Pernod Ricard (RI.France). \u001d  Investors may be unfairly marking down Diageo's shares. While the market wasn't pleased by a dip in earnings in 2005, attributed to tough market conditions and foreign-exchange movements, cost-cutting and higher prices enabled Diageo to quickly recover. It delivered respectable 8% earnings growth in 2006, a performance that it's on track to repeat this year. \u001d  In the U.S., the world's top drinks market, Diageo has the No. 1 position with a 30% market share. Its U.S. profits rose 6% last year, and analysts see double-digit gains in the future. In contrast, Pernod has just a 10% U.S. market share, and it's expected to have organic sales growth of 4.5% and 5% in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Diageo's organic U.S. sales are likely to climb more than 6% in each of those years. \u001d  Yet Diageo's stock has trailed Pernod's by 11% in the past year, even though the U.K. wine-and-spirits merchant has bought back GBP 1.4 billion worth of its stock in that span and promises to purchase another GBP 1 billion by the end of 2008. In sum, with good growth prospects and a track record of providing investor value, Diageo looks worth imbibing. \u001d  --- \u001d  Sean Walters, who is based in London, is a contributor to The Skeptic, a Dow Jones Newswires column on which this European Trader is based. \u001d  --- \b                          DOW JONES GLOBAL INDEXES \b \bRegion/ \bCountry \b    DJ Global           DJ Global           DJ Global     Point \b     Indexes,            Indexes,            Indexes,      Chg.    % Chg. \b  Local Curr.

Forsyth \u001d  It's a miracle! \u001d  The long wait by the patient faithful has been rewarded by the arrival of the Jesus Phone, as the flock of Apple's true believers has come to call the iPhone. They already had been queueing up for days in front of their shrines, aka the Apple stores, just for the chance to receive their own Jesus Phones when they first were offered to Apple's acolytes Friday evening. \u001d  But why have the digerati dubbed it the Jesus Phone? Because the iPhone has inspired such religious fervor? Because the iPhone can perform miracles, combining a cell phone, music player and an Internet device in a single gizmo? Because waiting for its arrival required the patience of Jobs? \u001d  To an agnostic, when it comes to Apple and the ardent worship its many works seem to inspire, the deafening buzz about the Jesus Phone is a mystery, not least because the name relates to a product from a company whose logo depicts (and seems to celebrate) Original Sin. \u001d  But the real miracle would seem to be the 30-odd billion-dollar increase in Apple's stock-market capitalization since the iPhone's creator (with a lower-case \"c\"), CEO Steve Jobs, unveiled the prototype earlier this year. \u001d  Even at $599 a pop, Apple supposedly will sell 10 million iPhones by 2009. (OK, there's a $499 version but it's doubtful many buyers won't spring for the extra C-note to get the higher-memory version.) And that doesn't include the hefty monthly charges AT&T will be collecting from each of those eager iPhoners. \u001d  Even taking into consideration the burgeoning population of that fictional land of Richistan, you've got to wonder if there really are enough kids of private-equity and hedge-fund managers to scoop up all those pricey iPhones. (It's hard to imagine that the grownups who are raking in the big bucks needed to pay for all the little urchins' indulgences will abandon their CrackBerries, however.) \u001d  Then there is the real world, where the unpleasant reality of $3-a-gallon-plus gasoline and milk intrudes, along with falling home values and rising mortgage costs and taxes. With the housing ATM pretty well tapped out, there might be less left over for expensive toys, no matter how miraculous. \u001d  Connecting the dots of the housing downturn, Merrill Lynch's chief domestic economist, David Rosenberg, spies a marked slowing in consumer spending. In May, real consumption rose only 0.06%, which gets rounded up to 0.1%, he notes. \"On a three-month basis, real consumer-spending growth has throttled back to a mere 0.9% annual rate, which is a far cry from the 5% pace at the turn of the year, and outside of the Katrina disruption in the fall of 2005, this represents the softest trend in three years,\" Rosenberg wrote in a research note. \u001d  Then again, Apple may find that the iPhone is immune to these pocketbook pressures. Or that American consumers can continue on their merry spending ways unimpeded by rising prices and slowing real income growth. That would be the greatest miracle of all. \b \u001d  As a modern miracle, the iPhone doesn't come close to the true blessings of our age. Even a gadget geek would gladly give up his laptop, cellphone, MP3 and flat screen for antibiotics or the polio vaccine, which were genuine miracles a half-century ago. \u001d  But as marvels of imaginative engineering, none of Steve Jobs' creations can come close to financial derivatives. \u001d  In the beginning, there were mortgage-backed securities that turned ordinary home loans into bonds. Then came collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs, which sliced and diced the mortgage securities according to when they'd get paid off, which is uncertain, especially given homeowners' proclivity to refinance when it suited them. \u001d  The next step was the collateralized debt obligation and its cousin, the collateralized loan obligation. CDOs and CLOs represent pools of corporate bonds or other loans -- including subprime mortgages --  that are split up into tranches of varying risk and return. The first in line to get paid get the highest credit rating and the lowest yield, and so on down the line. \u001d  Here's where the real alchemy comes in: The top tier of CDOs and CLOs can be backed by a pool of junky credits and still get a triple-A rating. The pawns at the lower tiers absorb the losses to protect the kings and queens at the top. And so these derivatives have exploded in just a few years, to as much as $1 trillion by some estimates. \u001d  Pimco's Bill Gross wrote on his Website last week that the ratings agencies were bedazzled into giving triple-A ratings to these fancy derivatives by their \"makeup, those six-inch hooker heels and a 'tramp stamp.' Many of these good-looking girls are not high-class assets worth 100 cents on the dollar,\" the Bond King observed. I'd say it was more a case of dressing up trashy assets in prim-and-proper attire to pass off to good families as having pedigrees. \u001d  While the ratings agencies have granted their imprimatur to this sleight of hand, skepticism about a triple-A carved out of junk is in order. According to a Bloomberg news story, about 65% of the bonds in indexes that track subprime-mortgage debt don't meet the rating criteria at the time they were issued. That means Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch are masking mounting losses by failing to downgrade these securities, according to the Bloomberg analysis. Were those downgrades to take place, it would force selling that would further roil the subprime and CDO markets, it added. \u001d  This suggests the travails that befell Bear Stearns' hedge funds aren't one-off events. \"This is not an isolated LTCM-type complex trade that has gone wrong,\" writes Albert Edwards, Dresdner Kleinwort's global strategist, referring to the famous meltdown of hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998. \"These 'financial weapons of mass destruction' are widely owned. And the housing market is still sinking....\" \u001d  While Bear had to put up $1.6 billion to bail out one of its namesake funds, the CDO market remained back on its heels. CDOs trade rarely, if at all, in a thin market. As a result, these exotica aren't marked to market, like most securities, but \"marked to model,\" quips Barry Ritholtz, chief market strategist of Ritholtz Research & Analytics. Indeed, various reports indicate the high-quality CDOs that Bear tried to sell fetched bids as low as 85 cents on the dollar. \u001d  And without the support of the derivatives market and a rising queasiness about risk, a whole parade of leveraged financings were either postponed, restructured or left on underwriters' shelves. \u001d  Indeed, says Martin Fridson, the veteran observer and chronicler of the high-yield market, a \"turning point in leveraged finance has been reached.\" Writing in his authoritative Leverage World letter, he lists a litany of woes, among them: \u001d  Dealers reportedly are cutting back on making markets in high-yield paper because of the capital they have tied up in bridge loans and problematic mortgage paper. Meanwhile, securities in the secondary market may face markdowns if new issues have to be priced at concessions to draw buyers. \u001d  Private-equity firms have been slow to face up to the deterioration in the financing environment for leveraged buyouts, he adds. Dealers who have been unable to persuade deal sponsors to adjust terms to the new reality instead are leaning on investors. \u001d  \"They warn that portfolio managers who refuse to take their 'fair share' of the troubled deals will face reduced allocations on good deals in the future,\" Fridson writes, recalling similar tactics employed by Drexel Burnham Lambert in the latter days of its reign over the junk market in 1989. \u001d  A pickup in default rates could slow the creation of CLOs, he continues, cutting off a key financing source for new LBOs. Already, lenders increasingly are balking at aggressive deals featuring debt that exceeds seven times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, says Fridson, private-equity firms' affiliated asset-management companies are said to be showing less enthusiasm for LBO paper created by their associated LBO funds. \u001d  All these capital-market machinations ultimately will cut back on financing for deals. \"Reduced aggressiveness by private-equity firms, in turn, could remove the buyout premium from stock prices,\" Fridson concludes with a bit of understatement. \u001d  Bob Prince and Fred Post, in Bridgewater Associates' Daily Observations, write that an array of factors has \"conspired to produce at least a short-term turning point in perceptions of risk.\" In addition to the subprime-mortgage and CDO woes hitting hedge funds, they see \"overextended carry bets by naive players,\" combined with hawkish comments on monetary policy and emerging-market central banks shifting from dollar bonds, pushing volatilities higher. \u001d  That would mark a key reversal. Since the bursting of the dot-com bubble, central banks have tamped down volatility by flooding the global financial system with liquidity. China's currency peg adds to the flood by massive printing of yuan to buy up dollars that are recycled into U.S. assets, keeping a lid on American interest rates and providing cheap financing for U.S. home buyers. Japan, by holding its interest rates at just 0.5%, provides fuel for global speculation in high-yielding assets via the carry trade. \u001d  In essence, this cycle has seen a massive arbitrage, using cheap debt financing to buy up equity and property assets all over the globe. It has been the source of mind-boggling fortunes, as the Blackstone Group flotation amply demonstrates. \u001d  The key question now is when, not if, the credit flows end. Then the movie will be rewound. Besides the impact on equities, that would mean other processes could go into reverse, notably the yen carry trade. \u001d  As borrowings in cheap yen are paid back to meet margin calls, the carry traders will have to buy back the Japanese currency they sold in exchange for higher-yielding assets. So far, that hasn't happened. But when the yen-carry trade unwinds, you'll know the global margin call is on. \u001d  --- \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0c3064f78cafe6b9657b1b3296e7d988","symR":["BCICF","BI.H.V","CA0779143076"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Bell Canada Is Said To Agree To Buyout Offer -NYT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T12:54:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BCICF","BI.H.V","CA0779143076"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 08:54 ET (12:54 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0fe8619863feb5ea0b961c07b8469fc0","symR":["2816.TW","W08.SG","SG1M36902971","TW0002816006","2816.TW","W08.SG","SG1M36902971","TW0002816006"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Taiwan Union Insurance To Sell 75% To Fund Of Want Want Chmn","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T05:15:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["2816.TW","W08.SG","SG1M36902971","TW0002816006"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","INP","INS","OFP","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 01:15 ET (05:15 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"12cf4c3bbd39cab01c32cc1a4ab72e8a","symR":["BCE","BCE.T","BCICF","BI.H.V","CRP.XX","KKR.XX","OTP.YY","T.T","TU","CA05534B7604","CA0779143076","CA87971M1032"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Canada Telecom BCE Says It's Agreed To C$51.7B Buyout","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T13:39:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BCE","BCE.T","BCICF","BI.H.V","CRP.XX","KKR.XX","OTP.YY","T.T","TU","CA05534B7604","CA0779143076","CA87971M1032"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","FIS","FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XNYA","XSTT","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  TORONTO (AP)--BCE Inc.

Nelms, 46, expects similarly bell-ringing results from Discover (ticker: DFS), which is trading around 30 on a when-issued basis. In recent weeks he has told potential investors that the Riverwood, Ill.- based company, founded by Sears, Roebuck in 1986, will have better opportunities for growth as an independent concern, as it seeks to gain greater acceptance of the Discover card among merchants, and higher transaction volume. \u001d  But both goals may be more elusive than Discover fans think, given the dominance of industry rivals American Express (AXP) Master Card (MA) and privately held Visa. Craig Maurer, an analyst at Calyon Securities, has a Sell rating on the stock and a price target of 22, or 15 times his below-consensus estimate for 2008 earnings of around $1.50 a share. He contends Discover deserves to trade at a five-point discount to to his target '08 multiple for American Express. \u001d  Like American Express, Discover operates a \"closed-loop network,\" signing up merchants, issuing cards and processing transactions. To compensate for the risks entailed in lending money to cardholders, it pockets all transaction fees. MasterCard, in contrast, acts purely as a payment processor, and shares fees with network banks. \u001d  Discover has long been an industry laggard, with limited merchant acceptance relative to the plastic-payment sector's top guns. As of this year's first quarter, its card was welcomed by 4.9 million merchants, compared with 9 million for AmEx and 25 million each for MasterCard and Visa. Maurer calculates spending over its network grew at a compound annual rate of 5.4% in the past five years, versus 14.6% for MasterCard and 16.8% for AmEx; gross dollar volume reached $115 billion in 2006, against $562 billion for AmEx and $1.9 trillion for MasterCard. These metrics help explain why Discover's \"discount,\" or fee, is 1.76% of transaction costs, considerably below the 2.41% charged by AmEx. \b \u001d  To be sure, Discover's lagging fundamentals are an opportunity as much as a deficit, and the company has made some smart moves in recent years, including the acquisition of the Pulse debit-card network and the development of co-branding card deals with companies such as Wal-Mart (WMT). \u001d  Discover's takeover potential also has fueled investors' hopes, though Maurer thinks Morgan Stanley opted to spin off the company -- giving holders one Discover share for every two Morgan Stanley shares -- because it couldn't find a buyer at an attractive price. Besides, any deal done in the next two years might jeopardize the spinoff's tax-free status. \u001d  MasterCard has dazzled Wall Street, more than tripling since its May 2006 IPO to  164. But Discover is no MasterCard, as its market penetration and growth rate suggest.

Norton \u001d  Suddenly, everyone's a fan. Since our column about Mandarin Oriental International (\"Checking In to the Mandarin,\" Asian Trader, Aug. 22, 2005), shares of the luxury-hotel chain with the iconic fan logo have jumped 143%, to a recent $2.20 a share from 90.5 cents when we wrote about it. \u001d  We had pointed out that Mandarin (ticker: MAND.Singapore), is one of Asia's great hotel brands and has been busily expanding to North America and Europe and renovating existing properties. Room rates were shooting higher, and the company was following an \"asset-lite\" strategy, opting for a more efficient use of capital by focusing on lucrative management contracts versus ownership. \u001d  In 2004, Hong Kong and Macau accounted for 43% of Mandarin's revenue. \u001d  Warren Yeh of Adapa Partners, an early enthusiast, maintains that Mandarin's developments beyond 2008 will drive the stock still higher. \"Of the 15 upcoming hotel projects that Mandarin has slated, all but one are management contracts,\" he notes. \u001d  He predicts that operating cash flow will grow by 64% by 2009, even though assets will rise by just 16% in that span. \"In addition to the strong operating cash flow, there is a chance that more asset sales could take place, which could unlock more value,\" he adds. He believes Mandarin is worth more than $3 a share. \u001d  For all the fretting about toppiness in lodging stocks, Amit Kapoor of Gabelli & Co. sees \"favorable luxury-hotel- room supply/demand\" in Mandarin's key markets, including Hong Kong, New York and London. \u001d  In Hong Kong, he observes, Mandarin's average daily room rate is up 50%, to over $400. Tokyo's average room rate is $470. In London, the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park is commanding $736 per room, on average. \u001d  Kapoor estimates that Mandarin will increase earnings at a 25% annual clip until 2012 and nearly double its revenue over the same stretch. \u001d  Says Kapoor: \"My numbers are conservative, and it still looks like the stock could essentially triple in the next five years, to $6.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"31408bbceef106842aad4bca8df4c52b","symR":["GS","MS","XLB","XLE","XLF","XLI","XLK","XLP","XLU","XLV","XLY","US38141G1040"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) Fund Of Information: Financial And Utility SPDRs Get Shorted","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["GS","MS","XLB","XLE","XLF","XLI","XLK","XLP","XLU","XLV","XLY","US38141G1040"],"IndustryCodes":["EXT","SCR","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF","ZFU"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Lawrence C. Strauss \u001d  In an era when new versions of exchange-traded funds seemingly get rolled out daily, the Select Sector SPDRs (pronounced \"spiders\") can seem like throwbacks to a simpler time. Launched in 1998, these funds allow investors to play pieces of the S&P 500. And right now, they're proving to be handy tools in a market that's hard to get a fix on. \u001d  There are nine of these funds, each corresponding to a sector within the broader index, together accounting for a shade over $20billion at the end of June. The buying and selling of these funds, together with the short interest they generate, provides a glimpse of investor sentiment and market activity. \u001d  For example, June saw a big spike in the shorting of utilities and financials. Overall, shorting of such funds rose by 31% versus May's activity. \u001d  \"There are some rate fears you are seeing here,\" notes Dan Dolan, director of wealth-management strategies for the Select Sector SPDRs. Late last week, the 10-year Treasury was yielding about 5.10%, down from where it was in early June, but well above its 4.50% level in mid-March. \u001d  Exchange-traded funds can provide good ways to hedge, such as when a portfolio manager shorts a particular sector to provide downside protection against one or more long positions in the group. That is occurring now. \u001d  Of the nine ETFs, the Financial Select SPDR (ticker: XLF) was the only one with a negative performance in 2007, as of June 25; it was down 0.93%. Investors no doubt are concerned about rising rates, which often put pressure on the profits of firms like Merrill Lynch (ML), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), all of which have big weightings in that ETF. \u001d  Dolan maintains that the increased shorting of the financial ETFs also reflects concern about how these firms will hold up if rates continue to rise. \u001d  The financial-sector ETF has had outflows of about $300 million in 2007, whereas most other sectors have taken in more cash. Financials have by far the largest sector weighting in the S&P 500, accounting for nearly 21% of the index. Technology, including telecom, makes up a little over 19%; energy, about 10.80%. \u001d  Investors have increased short positions in the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), which is up 5.60% this year. Utilities, which often have large borrowing costs for capital expenditures, are also considered interest-rate sensitive. All of this activity largely reflects institutional-investing sentiment, says Dolan. \"This is not retail guys moving money around.\" \u001d  Sonya Morris, who tracks ETFs for Morningstar and edits a monthly newsletter on the topic, points out that Sector SPDRs are weighted by market value. Relative to other sector ETFs, Morris says, \"the Sector SPDRs are looking quite good\" in terms of valuation. \u001d  Among the funds that look cheap to Morningstar are the Health Care Select SPDR (XLV), which includes Pfizer (PFE), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Amgen (AMGN), and the Consumer Staples Select SPDR (XLP), which includes Procter & Gamble (PNG) and Wal-Mart (WMT). The health-care ETF was up 17.38% this year; the consumer-staples ETF, 3.33%. The S&P had risen 5.60%. \u001d  As of May 31, the health-care ETF, which is market-cap weighted, fetched a forward price-earnings ratio around 18 times, according to Morningstar. That's a bit cheaper than the Rydex S&P Equal Weight Health Care ETF, which had a price-earnings ratio of nearly 20 times. \u001d  Morningstar doesn't see as much value now in the Energy Sector Select SPDR (XLE), Morris says. That's not surprising, given that it's appreciated about 19% this year and has posted double-digit gains in every year since 2003. \u001d  Other results this year include the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB), up 4.50%; the Consumer Discretionary Sector SPDR (XLY), up 2.58%; the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI), up 11.80%; and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), up 9.60%. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: lawrence.strauss@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"325c56ca3229cb7a1c1d2718cbbd9797","symR":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ABN Amro: Plan To Add 6 Outlets In Mainland China This Year","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T10:22:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 06:22 ET (10:22 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4182a6cb94454fdb1871961abba75d7e","symR":["FCSX"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) Streetwise: At Quarter's End, Fears Coalesce","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["FCSX"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","REA","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Michael Santoli \u001d  These are days when investors are anxiously fixated on their margin clerk, a fellow who not long ago was so easily taken for granted. Is he in a good mood? Did he get a good night's sleep? Did he call while I was out? What does it mean that he didn't call? \u001d  For the stock market, this margin clerk is the credit market. The favorable supply/demand regime serves at the pleasure of the corporate-bond market. The bond folks are not merely the gatekeepers of the marginal dollar that can sluice into stocks as buybacks or buyouts, but are perhaps the best gauge of perceived economic risk and financial confidence. \u001d  With a handful of smallish buyout bond and loan deals having been pulled or modified last week, and financial shares sagging as a result, the stock indexes traded in an emotional and irresolute manner on the way to a flat weekly performance. An uncomfortable pattern of early rallies and steep declines was evident. Of the five days last week, all but Wednesday saw the Dow industrials drop by more than 100 points from their intraday high to the close. \u001d  The jumpy action Friday -- the Dow lost 13 but finished 115 points off its intraday high and 94 above its low -- suggests that traders have gone from anticipating Merger Mondays to bracing for a Mark-to-Market Monday. \u001d  The trendy fear of the moment is that the nastiness in subprime mortgage securities and resulting hedge-fund losses will trigger a round of markdowns of credit values generally, which would fuel fund losses, prompt sloppy liquidations, sap the appetite for corporate debt and raise borrowing costs generally. \u001d  The arrival of quarter's end helped this fear coalesce, with blogs and instant messages on the Street thick with foreboding chatter about the possible hedge-fund losses that would emerge once the quarterly books were closed (not to say cooked). And so, for the moment, the paragons of prudence are perched on the dunes, peering through binoculars in search of distress signals or even bodies that might wash up on the beach. This will be the thing to watch for the next little while, it seems. \u001d  The good news here is that there is such a widespread fear of bad news coming from the market's margin clerk. The devil we all expect usually isn't the one who shows up. Even better that the clerk seems to be in decent enough spirits, gauged by the risk spreads in corporate bonds. \u001d  Joe Mezrich, quantitative strategist at Nomura Securities, monitors the interplay of spreads on low-investment-grade corporate bonds and the market's implied forecast of stock volatility. These things have been highly correlated in recent years. \u001d  When stocks' implied volatility has shot higher while bond spreads have stayed calm -- as is the case now -- the bond market usually had it right and stocks recovered or rallied over the coming months. This script played out both in May 2006 and this past March. \u001d  For sure, if the junk-bond market gags hard on more and larger deals, high-grade spreads won't matter for stock-trader's sentiment, raising as it would a nice excuse for a deeper, fear-inducing and more cleansing selloff than we've suffered so far this year. \u001d  Some skilled tape watchers are placing heavy significance on the indexes' ability to hang above last week's low in the S&P 500, 1% below current levels, implying a thin cushion above a trap door. Yet for all the quite-valid but well-publicized fear out there, the persistence of traders embracing the bearish case continues to argue against the idea that disaster looms. Nasdaq reported last week another 9% one-month rise in short interest, which brings its five-month increase to a huge 33%. \u001d  Some technical and structural factors are certainly buoying short volumes, but that can't be all. If stocks melted down from here, it would mean the market was uncharacteristically rewarding an exceedingly popular trade. \u001d  The coinage \"agflation\" is newly popular. But this idea of runaway crop-and-meat price increases already has a bellwether stock, FCStone (ticker: FCSX), a commodity broker that helps farmers and processors hedge. \u001d  The Iowa company came public March 15 at $24 a share and by Friday had roared to 57.29, off a high above 62. The company is a direct play on ag-price volatility, has a fine franchise and is growing pretty nicely. It's roughly like GFI Group (GFIG), a credit-derivatives and commodity broker but with less electronic-trading leverage and lower margins. GFI took a year to go up 140% from its 2005 IPO, FCStone just 15 weeks. \u001d  Investors should hope the momentum crowd loses interest soon, bringing a needed shakeout in the stock so that it can be bought somewhere below its current valuation of 30 times fiscal 2008 forecast earnings and closer to GFI's 20. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: michael.santoli@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4aa3b343aa294b979597679e316489d9","symR":["000761.SZ","0728.HK","0857.HK","0883.HK","0941.HK","3328.HK","601328.SH","CEO","CHA","CHDX","CHL","CMED","MR","PTR","Y62.SG","DPCAX","CN0007867483","CN0009118885","CN0009365379","CN000A0ERWC7","HK0883013259","HK0941009539","SG1T27930083"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) Asian Trader: Finding Good Bets In China's Bull Market","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["000761.SZ","0728.HK","0857.HK","0883.HK","0941.HK","3328.HK","601328.SH","CEO","CHA","CHDX","CHL","CMED","MR","PTR","Y62.SG","DPCAX","CN0007867483","CN0009118885","CN0009365379","CN000A0ERWC7","HK0883013259","HK0941009539","SG1T27930083"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","CTS","FTS","MDS","MDV","OIL","OIS","POL","STL","SVC","TLS","XATI","XDJGI","XHSG","XISL","XNYA","XSTT"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Keri Geiger \u001d  Summertime action-seekers can head to the Spanish village of Pamplona to experience the death-defying running of the bulls. U.S. investors looking for another kind of action can head to China to view its gravity-defying stock markets. Fund managers around the globe are pouring billions of dollars into these markets. But do any Chinese stocks still offer good value? \u001d  Romeo Dator, co-manager of the U.S. Global Investors China Region Opportunity Fund (ticker: USCOX),seesgood reasons to keep buying Chinese stocks. \"We think there is a lot of fair value in the market, and the growth will continue to justify valuations.\" \u001d  This includes red-chips and H-shares, the easiest way for foreign investors to access China's equity market. Class H-shares are issued by Hong Kong-listed companies registered and based in China, while red-chips are Hong Kong-registered, but controlled by mainland shareholders. Dator adds that Hong Kong-listed shares still offer better value than equivalent American depositary receipts. \u001d  He says that \"asset-injection play\" should prove profitable this year; this occurs when a state-owned company trims its holdings by injecting assets into its listed subsidiaries. \"The listed companies get new assets for good rates, and it is very earnings-accretive.\" Among those that have benefited are metals and mining companies and port operators, such as China Cosco Holdings (1919.Hong Kong). \u001d  Analysts say that H-shares will get a boost from a new wave of mainland liquidity, thanks to the recently introduced Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor scheme, which lets Chinese institutional investors buy foreign equities. Until QDII, mainland investors could only buy shares traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Dator says that Chinese investors will likely scoop up shares in hot Chinese companies that they can't get in the mainland stock markets, including China Mobile (0941.HK) and oil companies PetroChina (0857.HK) and Cnooc (0883.HK), which only trade in Hong Kong. \u001d  Chris Ruffle, who runs the China Fund at investment-house Martin Currie in Shanghai, is betting on China's emerging health-care firms: \"We are very bullish on this sector right now. The administration has boosted health-care spending 82%, and companies should benefit greatly.\" Among his picks: U.S.-listed Chindex. (CHDX), China Medical Technologies (CMED) and Mindray Medical. (MR). \u001d  In contrast, the former darlings of the Hong Kong market -- banks -- are starting to lose their luster. Fund managers say stocks such as China Construction Bank (939.HK) and Bank of Communications (3328.HK ) have peaked and are just too expensive. \u001d  Hugh Simon, CEO of Hamon Investment Group, subadviser of the $1 billion Dreyfus Premier Greater China Fund (DPCAX), agrees. \"We do not favor the prospects for the mega banks at the moment, as they are being restricted with lending policies and tighter margins, and have risen a long way in the last 12 months.\" \u001d  Greater China returned 85.6% in 2006, making it one of the top China funds. Says Simon: \"While excess liquidity is driving the market right now, there is also strong earnings growth and M&A activity, which makes companies more attractive on a three-to-five-year investment horizon.\" He adds Hong Kong stocks haven't moved up that much this year and that in his view the H-share market isn't a bubble, so there's still plenty of value there. \u001d  The Hang Seng Index was up 10% as of June 22 and the H-shares index had risen 18.4% and was trading at about a 17 times expected fiscal 2007 earnings, says Simon. He adds that his fund sold mainland telecom operator China Mobile to buy rival China Telecom (0728.HK). \u001d  \"We own China Telecom because of its fixed-business line, broadband operation and its intention to enter into the mobile market with a  wireless license.\" He adds that, based on 2006 earnings, China Telecom shares trade at a price/earnings ratio of 14, while the leading mobile operator China Mobile is trading on a multiple exceeding 24. \u001d  Simon points out that B-shares provide another good way to tap into China's red-hot growth story. B-shares trade in hard currency on the mainland exchanges and are available to both domestic and foreign investors. \"Valuations of B-shares are still attractive, trading at a significant discount to A-shares, and some will benefit from,\" including Bengang Steel Plates (200761.China), which is changing hands at 11 times forecast earnings. \u001d  Simon also notes that China is home to 16 of the world's most polluted cities, and there will be hefty spending on cleanups. \"There is a whole industry developing in China to clean the air and the water, so we are investing in companies doing this.\" This includes Singapore-listed Sino-Environment Technology Group (Y62.Singapore). \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"5643c6ca54a47da4746f029039d5edc9","symR":["BCE","BCE.T","CA05534B7604"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": BCE - Media Advisory","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T14:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BCE","BCE.T","CA05534B7604"],"IndustryCodes":["FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XNYA","XSTT","XTSE"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MONTREAL, June 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ - BCE Inc. will hold a media conference call today, Saturday June 30, at 1:00 pm to discuss its proposed acquisition by an investor group led by Teachers Private Capital.

Savitz \u001d  Rolla Huff got to work last week on a daunting mission: figuring out how to fix Earthlink (ticker: ELNK). \u001d  A pioneer in consumer dial-up Internet access, Earthlink for several years has been scrambling to find a new business model. The dial-up business isn't completely dead -- the company still has about 3.2 million subscribers, about evenly split between its premium Earthlink brand and its budget-priced PeoplePC operation -- but it certainly is dying. To prepare for the inevitable, the company has been casting around for a new model. \u001d  In fact, it has been trying out a variety of models. It has made a reasonably successful foray into the broadband business, reselling DSL service from Covad; it has a voice over IP telephony business; it runs a municipal Wi-Fi operation that is just getting off the ground; and it has a joint venture with Korea's SK Telecom called Helio that has made a risky but ambitious move into the cellular market. \u001d  The real problem facing Huff, who has been CEO just a few days, is that Earthlink has too many moving parts. In particular, the company has invested heavily in both the Wi-Fi operation and in Helio, neither of which makes money -- and Wall Street is losing its patience. And that's what makes this an interesting stock. For starters, it's not very expensive. The company has a stock-market value of just under $950 million. In 2007, the Street expects revenue of $1.3 billion. It has net cash and investments of more than $200 million. And Huff has made it clear that changes -- of the shareholder-value enhancing variety -- are coming. Now all he has to do is figure out what they'll be. \u001d  Huff tells Barron's that he plans to spend the next 60-to-90 days sorting through Earthlink's moving parts and figuring out exactly what he's got. By the end of the process, he says, he should have a workable strategy. Huff says it's possible Earthlink could keep all of its parts, but it seems clear some are going to have to go. He won't say which, but he does provide hints. \u001d  \"Earthlink's mission has been, and at its core will be, the idea of bringing connectivity to interesting content and applications...bringing the power of the Web to the people,\" Huff says. \"I can't imagine we would take a right turn off of that fundamental mission.\" But he adds that, \"at the end of the day, we have to have a clear and focused strategy.\" \u001d  Huff says he comes to Earthlink \"with no pre-conceived notions...I am not married to anything other than driving a return for our shareholders. And for me.\" \u001d  That last statement reflects the fact that Huff bought 100,000 shares of the company's stock on the day he took the job, handing over a check for $750,000. \"I didn't do that to make a statement,\" he says, although pretty clearly he was making a statement. \"I did it because I think I am going to make a great return on that money.\" \u001d  Huff walks gingerly around the issue of what might be wrong with the existing Earthlink strategy, which was set in place in large part by Gary Betty, a beloved former CEO who died from a rare cancer in January at age 49. Knocking Betty would not be a popular move at Earthlink or anywhere else. But I think Huff is going to move aggressively to remake the company. \u001d  The dial-up business will stay. As Huff notes: \"It still generates an enormous amount of cash for the business,\" even though it is clearly not a growth story. That, he says, makes it \"a vital part of our business.\" \u001d  He declines to take swings at Helio, the joint venture mobile virtual network operator, basically a cellular provider that has no access of its own, in this case reselling 3G service from Sprint (S). Helio sells its own branded handsets, including a nifty dual-slider model called the Ocean (recently featured on the cover of Technology Review for its cool design). With reportedly fewer than 100,000 customers, it doesn't have enough to be declared a success. Whether Earthlink can extract itself from Helio remains to be seen; Huff says he \"owes them 45 days to hear the whole story.\" \u001d  As for muni Wi-Fi, which the Street has been more or less begging Earthlink to abandon as a bad business, Huff says that \"anything that bypasses a monopoly network is a good thing on its face.\" But he says the question is whether Earthlink can get that business producing cash in a time frame that makes sense for shareholders. Do not be surprised if the answer is \"no.\" \u001d  In short, Earthlink is going to be fixed, and soon. Eventually, it might be sold. Huff has not historically been shy about finding M&A exits: In 2006, he sold his previous company, Mpower Communications, for just over $200 million, and he was president and COO at Frontier Communications when it merged with Global Crossing. I wouldn't be surprised if Earthlink eventually goes the same route. Meanwhile, if Huff take the aggressive approach to remaking the business, holders should get a short-term reward. \b \u001d  A smart investor I know buzzed by the other day with a fairly alarming investment idea. He thinks there is a bull case to be made for -- ye gads, I must be insane for passing this along -- Vonage (VG). Now, this guy is no fool. Vonage turned out to be a terrible IPO, and the company continues to face severe competitive forces in the residential phone- service market. It also continues its patent battle with Verizon, and a bad outcome from the case could mean another down leg for the stock. Personally, I think the company as a standalone voice provider won't survive. \u001d  That said, my buddy thinks the stock might be an interesting speculation. He notes that the appeals court on the Verizon case has been urging the companies to settle. If they do, the stock could get a short-term lift. And while Vonage continues to lose money, my friend notes that it actually earns about $10 per subscriber a month in operating income before marketing expenses. My guy notes that the stock is trading at about $120 per subscriber; Vonage itself pays more than $300 to add each new subscriber. Churn has ratcheted up a bit in recent months; he figures the average subscriber sticks around for three years. In short, he thinks Vonage could turn off its marketing engine, let the existing subscribers gradually run off, and generate well north of $300 in cash per customer over the next three years. \u001d  The bottom line is that he thinks the cash flow -- and customer base -- could be valuable to a bigger player. Sprint is the most obvious buyer; it was supposedly nosing around before Vonage went public. But there are other potential buyers, he insists. Again, I see no long-term future for a stand-alone VoIP company -- I still say this is the cable companies' market to lose. But someone might want to have control of Vonage's 2.4 million customers. And if they do, Vonage might have a profitable last act. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: eric.savitz(@)barrons.com; blog: blogs.barrons.com. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"570f5574a7f601a7ace93cec87c59905","symR":["IFSIA","SCPP.XX"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) Follow-up: Carpet-tile Maker's Prospects Still Plush","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["IFSIA","SCPP.XX"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS","FTR","HPR","XDJGI","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Sandra Ward \u001d  Interface, the world leader in commercial carpet-tile, will sell its underperforming fabric business, clearing the way for the company to further reduce its debt load, improve its balance sheet and focus on its high-margin core tile business. \u001d  Investors had high expectations for such a move, as we noted when Barron's wrote favorably about Interface (ticker: IFSIA) on April 9 (\"A Wall-to-Wall Wonder\"). Since then, the shares, at a recent $18.80, are up about 15%. Theyhit a high of 19.46 at one point, and are on track to continue to outperform. \u001d  Interface, based in Atlanta, entered into a definitive agreement with Sun Capital Partners, a private investment firm in Boca Raton, Fla., to sell its Interface Fabric division in an all-cash transaction valued at $70 million. \u001d  Interface will receive approximately $63.5 million at the closing of the transaction -- and an additional $6.5 million, subject to the division's meeting certain performance measures, over the subsequent six to 18 months. \u001d  \"Look for a leaner, cleaner company going forward, with much less drag on their operating profits,\" says Chad Kilmer, portfolio manager of William Blair's Value Discovery Fund, who has been bullish on the carpet-tile maker's prospects. \u001d  Kilmer points out that the carpet-tile business is booming, and that Interface's backlog is growing.

Each year, 138,000 Europeans die from the disease. However, colorectal cancer is preventable in most cases and highly treatable if diagnosed in its early stages. \b \u001d  \"With colorectal cancer affecting so many people, we as physicians need to understand how each available therapy affects patients, so we can evaluate their benefits when choosing treatment options,\" said Markus Moehler, Assistant Professor for GI Oncology, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. \"Metastatic disease means patients need a lot of treatment, so we need to consider how well they can cope with each element of therapy. FOLFIRI is an important regimen of choice throughout the world, due to its tolerability as well as its efficacy, and is a valuable backbone on which to deliver targeted therapies to patients.\" \b \u001d  The CRYSTAL trial, presented this week at the 9th World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer, evaluated cetuximab combined with the irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Results showed that the risk of cancer spreading or growing was reduced by 15% for patients in the FOLFIRI plus cetuximab arm (p=0.0479), and that significantly more patients in this arm experienced a shrink in tumour size (46.9% versus 38.7% in the FOLFIRI only arm, p=0.0038). \b \u001d  Furthermore, in a subgroup analysis of patients who had liver-limited disease (patients who had liver metastases only), the positive effect of the addition of cetuximab was even more pronounced, resulting in a progression-free survival of 11.4 months with cetuximab versus 9.2 months in the control arm, and a 36% reduction in the risk of metastatic colorectal cancer growing or spreading. The number of complete resections of the metastases in the subgroup who had liver metastases only was more than double with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI versus the control arm (9.8% versus 4.5%). The number of complete resections in the overall population was three times higher in the cetuximab plus FOLFIRI arm. \b \u001d  Treatment was generally well-tolerated, and side-effects were similar between the two groups. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events in the FOLFIRI + cetuximab group versus FOLFIRI alone were diarrhea (15.2% versus 10.5%), neutropaenia (26.7% versus 23.3%) and grade 3 skin reactions (18.7% versus 0.2%). These skin reactions showed a strong correlation with cetuximab efficacy. \b \u001d  \"The results of this trial confirm the benefits of improving and refining treatment regimens to get better patient outcomes,\" continued Professor Moehler, who participated actively in the trial. \"Additionally, this trial confirms the evidence of the updated BICC-C trial, presented at ASCO in 2007, which assessed first line therapy with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab in patients with mCRC.\" \b \u001d  The BICC-C trial was divided into two separate study periods. The first demonstrated that FOLFIRI was superior to other chemotherapy regimens studied in the trial, providing improved progression-free survival (7.8 months, compared to 5.9 months and 5.8 months in the other regimens). The second study period showed that after 29 months' follow up, first-line FOLFIRI + bevacizumab significantly improved overall survival compared with mIFL + bevacizumab (p=0.01) - one-year survival was higher in the FOLFIRI + bevacizumab arm (87%) than in the mIFL + bevacizumab arm (61%). Median overall survival was not yet reached in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab arm, but was 19.2 months in the mIFL arm. The most frequent serious adverse events in this study were diarrhea, neutropaenia, nausea and vomiting, hypertension and dehydration. \b \u001d  \"What we can learn from both these trials is that when combined with new targeted agents, irinotecan is demonstrating improved outcomes in terms of progression-free and overall survival,\" Professor Moehler added. \b \u001d  The CRYSTAL and BICC-C data continue to reinforce evidence from previous clinical studies, demonstrating the efficacy of irinotecan as a first line therapy of choice for patients with mCRC, as FOLFIRI alone, or combined with these targeted agents. \b \b   Irinotecan important safety information \b \u001d  Irinotecan is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer: \b \b   --  In combination with 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid in \b        patients without prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. \b \b   --  As a single agent in patients who have failed an established \b        5-fluorouracil containing treatment regimen. \b \u001d  Irinotecan in combination with cetuximab is indicated for the treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of irinotecan-including cytotoxic therapy. \b \u001d  Irinotecan in combination with 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and bevacizumab is indicated for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. \b \u001d  The most common adverse effects associated with irinotecan therapy are diarrhoea, neutropaenia and myelosuppression. \b \u001d  For full prescribing information, safety information and black box warnings applicable in your country, please contact your local Pfizer affiliate. \b \b    CONTACT: Pfizer \b             Joel Morris, +44 1304 648 922 \b \b    SOURCE: Pfizer \bCopyright Business Wire 2007 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5b6cf3777b412184af0d8cd76e68e147","symR":["MPAA"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Motorcar Parts of America, Inc.

Secondly, we focused on enhancing our operating margins by moving the majority of our production offshore. We are also in the process of moving the bulk of the remaining logistics support from our California location to our new Mexico facility.  We accomplished a great deal, including generating strong revenue growth from new customers and increased sales to existing customers.  In addition, the Company was able to grow its sales to the professional installer market, which now represents approximately 21% of total net sales.  The Company also successfully transitioned the majority of its production to offshore locations and has established a footprint to move core sorting and logistics offshore.  Progress at our Mexico facility to date is proceeding in accordance with our plans.  Our operating costs as recently as May 2007, are right on target with expectations.  Shortly after our fiscal year end, we successfully completed a private placement financing that provided us with net proceeds of approximately $36.5 million in additional capital to grow our business, take advantage of new business opportunities and complete our off-shore initiative.\" \b \b    GAAP Net Sales and Gross Profit - Quarter \b \u001d  Net sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2007 were $31.4 million, up 11.6% from $28.1 million in the same quarter last year.  This increase was primarily due to additional sales to new and existing customers. Gross profit and gross margin were $3.3 million and 10.6%, respectively, as compared to $7.5 million and 26.8%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was negatively impacted by start-up expenses relating to our initiative of moving production offshore and by the write-down of inventory related to reduction in standard costs from the end of the third quarter, which reduction resulted from the cost savings we are experiencing in Mexico.  In addition, during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, $1,575,000 of core revenues were deferred. No core revenues were deferred in prior periods. \b \u001d  \"During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we saw strong growth in our top line from sales to new and existing customers,\" Mr. Joffe continued. \b \b    Non-GAAP Discussion \b \u001d  Non-GAAP financial results for the three month and twelve month periods ended March 31, 2007 discussed in this release reflect operating results excluding the impact of (i) revenues and core inventory adjustments recorded as a result of termination of the pay-on-scan (\"POS\") inventory arrangement, (ii) front-loaded marketing allowances in conjunction with new business, (iii) stock adjustments related to update orders shipped in later periods, (iv) FAS 123R stock compensation expenses, (v) consulting fees incurred in connection with Sarbanes-Oxley (\"SOX\") compliance, (vi) restatement expenses, (vii) cost reductions associated with the recording of a shareholder note receivable, and (viii) severance and other costs related to staff reductions at the Company's Torrance facilities. \b \u001d  Non-GAAP financial results for the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2006 discussed in this release reflect operating results excluding the impact of (i) front-loaded marketing allowances in conjunction with new business, (ii) stock adjustments related to update orders shipped in later periods (iii) outside professional and consulting fees associated with the SEC's review of the Company's SEC filings and the related restatement of financial statements (iv) consulting fees incurred in connection with SOX compliance, and (v) start-up costs related to the Company's new production location in Mexico and new distribution center in Tennessee. \b \u001d  For a reconciliation of the non-GAAP results to the relevant GAAP results, please see the financial schedules that accompany this release. \b \b    Non-GAAP Net Sales and Gross Profit - Quarter \b \u001d  Non-GAAP net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 were $31.6 million, up 23.0% from non-GAAP net sales of $25.7 million in the same quarter of the prior year.  Non-GAAP gross profit was $3.8 million, or 12.1% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to non-GAAP gross profit of $6.1 million, or 23.8% of net sales, in the same quarter of the prior year. \b \u001d  \"Our success in our offshore initiative will begin to show in our first quarter results for fiscal year 2008.  If we were to pro-forma our fourth quarter results with the existing production costs that we experienced as recently as May, our fourth quarter fiscal 2007 gross margins would be approximately 26% after taking into account the effect of GAAP to Non-GAAP adjustments.  This compares to a gross margin of approximately 24% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.  These pro-forma results are very encouraging as we expect our operating costs to further decrease as we complete our transition,\" said Mr. Joffe. \b \b    GAAP Operating Results and Interest Expense - Quarter \b \u001d  Operating loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $4.2 million, compared to operating income of $2.6 million in the same quarter of the prior year.  Operating expenses increased 52.9% in the quarter, driven primarily by higher costs caused by: \b \b \b    -- production start-up expenses in our offshore locations \b    -- redundant costs associated with moving our operations to our Mexico \b       facility \b    -- consulting and professional fees incurred in connection with SOX \b       compliance \b    -- severance costs related to staff reductions at the Company's Torrance \b       facilities \b \b \u001d  It is expected that the above costs will decline going forward especially the production start-up expenses, redundant moving costs and SOX-related fees. FAS 123R non-cash stock compensation expenses will continue. \b \u001d  Interest expense also increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 due to increased interest rates and higher levels of debt.  Net loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $2.6 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted share for the same quarter last fiscal year. \b \b    Non-GAAP Operating Results - Quarter \b \u001d  Non-GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was $1.7 million, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $1.2 million in the same quarter of the prior year.  Non-GAAP net loss was $2.2 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to non-GAAP net income of $0.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the same quarter of the prior year. \b \u001d  Operating results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were negatively impacted by start-up expenses relating to our initiative of moving production offshore and redundant costs associated with moving our operations to our Mexico facility. \b \u001d  Mr. Joffe further stated, \"Pro-forma operating income results, with the existing production costs that we experienced as recently as May, for the fourth quarter fiscal 2007 would be approximately $3.4 million after taking into account the effect of GAAP to Non-GAAP adjustments.\" \b \b    GAAP Net Sales and Gross Profit - Fiscal Year \b \u001d  For the year ended March 31, 2007, net sales were $136.3 million, up 25.8% from $108.4 million in fiscal 2006.  Net sales in fiscal 2007 were favorably impacted by a one-time catch up of $19.8 million in net sales from the sale of products previously shipped on a POS basis, which was partially offset by $8.1 million in core inventory adjustments, $3.3 million in front-loaded marketing allowances and $0.6 million in expenses related to the buy back of core inventory. Gross profit was $21.3 million, or 15.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2007 versus $25.4 million, or 23.4% of net sales in fiscal 2006. Gross profit in fiscal 2007 was negatively impacted by the previously mentioned core inventory adjustments, front-loaded marketing allowances, stock adjustments as well as the fourth quarter inventory write-down.  In addition, during the year ended March 31, 2007, $1,575,000 of core revenues were deferred. No core revenues were deferred in prior periods. \b \b    Non-GAAP Net Sales and Gross Profit - Fiscal Year \b \u001d  Non-GAAP net sales for the year ended March 31, 2007 were $130.1 million, up 17.4% from non-GAAP net sales of $110.8 million in fiscal 2006.  Non-GAAP gross profit was $29.3 million, or 22.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2007, compared to non-GAAP gross profit of $28.5 million, or 25.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2006. \b \b    GAAP Operating Results - Fiscal Year \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 02:19 ET (06:19 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"5c3a27911585ab78a86d6f2f22a4b882","symR":["SSW"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) Smooth Sailing","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SSW"],"IndustryCodes":["MAR","XDJGI","XNYA"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Kopin Tan \u001d  Seaspan is many things to many investors. It's a China play, since it's one of the largest container-ship leasing outfits serving that country. An appealing 6% dividend also makes it a yield play, while a 49% rise in its shares  over the past year lends it the allure of a growth stock. \u001d  Such multifaceted charms ought to have buyers lunging for the shares (ticker: SSW). But in reality, they've multiplied the ways in which the company can be misunderstood. \u001d  For example, the bond-market selloff has scared away investors who fret that Seaspan's yield will begin to pale next to higher bond rates. The China hype has worried value seekers, while growth players have chased volatile commodity shippers like Dryships (DRYS), whose shares have surged 262% in the past year. \u001d  All of which is a pity, since Seaspan offers longer-term investors not only a rich payout, but strong-yet-safe growth that some think will propel a 15% rise in its shares in the next year or so. \u001d  Incorporated in the western Pacific's Marshall Islands, with management in Vancouver, Seaspan was among the first to identify and exploit a sea change: shippers' reluctance to have heavy assets on their books, and their increasing preference for leasing, rather than owning, ships. Seaspan's founders, who include Montana's self-made billionaire Dennis Washington and CEO Gerry Wang, devised a plan to buy ships that they then lease to cargo companies under long-term, fixed-rate contracts. With  steady cash flow, Seaspan is structured like a master limited partnership: It owns fixed assets, but distributes its income as dividends. \u001d  Business is booming. When Seaspan went public in 2005 -- it was the largest shipper to ever debut on the New York Stock Exchange -- it had 23 vessels, valued at $1.5 billion. That has swiftly expanded to a 55-strong fleet worth $3.9 billion, making it the world's sixth biggest container-ship owner; Wang tells Barron's that his goal is to own more than 100 vessels worth $7 billion to $10 billion, come 2010. \u001d  His goal is within reach, thanks to the rising tide of world container trade, which exploded from 54 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units, a measure of capacity) in 1998 to 117 million TEUs last year. Experts see the pace quickening as manufacturing moves farther from consumers. Today, China accounts for a third of the world's container volume and its two biggest shippers --  China Shipping Group and Cosco -- are Seaspan customers. \u001d  While shipping is famously cyclical, Seaspan's reliance on long-term, fixed-rate contracts helps it navigate through economic storms. In May, for example, it ordered eight new ships. But well before their 2010 delivery, Seaspan has signed 12-year charter agreements for them at rates of $42,900 a vessel per day. That decreases its susceptibility to short-term shifts in the market, and lets Seaspan amass its armada with minimal risk. Fluctuating energy costs? Those are borne by customers. \u001d  Stability should only increase as Seaspan grows. It went public with two Chinese charterers as clients, but has added five more from a broader geographic base, including Japan, Denmark and Chile. It  also has diversified the size of its vessels, and staggered contracts so that they come due for renewal in different years. \u001d  That's not all. \"Right now, we rely primarily on equity and bank debt\" to fund expansion, says Wang, 45, a graduate of Shanghai's Maritime University and the London School of Economics. \"But as we become bigger, we'll be able to use bonds and other financial instruments.\" \u001d  Given management's track record and global expansion, Seaspan should \"continue to deliver dividend growth,\" while \"making that payout safer,\" says James \"J.J.\" Gartland, research director of 12% stakeholder Neuberger Berman's \"Team-Kaminsky\" unit. \u001d  Lazard Capital analyst Urs Dur figures the shares are worth 36, about 15% above where they trade today, using a discounted-cash-flow model that considers what the ships will earn and the cost of their operation. Dur expects 10% dividend hikes in both 2009 and 2010. \u001d  Seaspan isn't a household name, so there's upside as more investors discover it. The most comparable public container-ship entity is Greece's Danaos (DAC). Financial projections also may prove modest, if growth surpasses conservative estimates, Gartland says. \u001d  Skeptics say the rush of family-owned shippers to go public in a hot market and the influx of capital eventually will drive up ship prices and dampen freight rates. But Seaspan's head start and heft will help it stand out, giving it access to funding. Its growing fleet has an average age of 4.5 years, compared with the industry average of well over a decade.

In the face of such uncertainty, investors now can earn 10%-plus returns on such targets as Harrah'sEntertainment (ticker: HET), Alltel (AT), Alliance Data Systems (ADS) and First Data (FDC). \u001d  \"The market is about as attractive as we've seen in a while,\" says Mike Shannon, co-manager of the $1.9 billion Merger Fund (MERFX), an arbitrage fund. He says the annualized return on about 150 targets worldwide is about 15%, versus 12% just a week ago. \u001d  Merger arbitragers buy shares of companies that have agreed to be taken over. The investor stands to earn a return based on the spread between a company's current share price and the presumed takeover price. Because most takeovers are now leveraged buyouts, merger arbitrage hinges on private-equity firms' getting financing for their deals. \u001d  Takeover stocks sold off last week when investors balked at a $3.6 billion debt offering from U.S. Foodservice, being sold by Ahold (AHO), the Dutch supermarket operator. LBO shares later rebounded, following the success of a financing by $7 billion LBO target Dollar General, albeit at higher-than-expected interest rates. Dollar General, whose shares dipped below $21.50 Monday, finished Friday at $21.91, just shy of the $22 price for the deal, due to close this week. Said one arbitrager: \"Disaster has been postponed, if not averted.\" \u001d  Harrah's, which has agreed to be bought by Apollo Management and TPG Group for $17 billion, or $90 a share, traded Friday at $85.40. So investors buying Harrah's stand to make $4.60 a share, about a 12% annualized return, assuming the transaction closes around year end. \u001d  The best scenario for arbitragers is a bidding war. After Blackstone Group (BX) announced a deal to buy Equity Office Properties last November for $48.50 a share, a group led by Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) sought to top the bid. Ultimately, Blackstone prevailed, offering $55.50 a share. Bidding wars are growing less frequent as LBO financing gets more problematic. Archstone-Smith (ASN), an apartment REIT, is due to be purchased in a $13 billion LBO at $60.75 a share. Its shares have dropped to $59.10 from a June high of $62, as investors figure there will be no topping bid. \u001d  One deal with a wide arbitrage spread involves XM Satellite Radio, which has agreed to merge with its only direct competitor, Sirius Satellite Radio. XM trades at $11.70, $2 below the value of Sirius' all-stock offer, because of worries that the accord may blow up on antitrust grounds, sending XM shares tumbling. \u001d  Another deal worrying Wall Street involves Tribune, the newspaper and broadcasting company being purchased by real-estate tycoon Sam Zell in an LBO for $13 billion, or $34 a share. A month ago, Tribune bought 126 million of its shares at $34 and plans to purchase the remaining 117 million outstanding at $34 by year end. \u001d  Investors' fears about Zell's ability to complete the transaction have sent Tribune down to $29.50 from $33 a month ago. The company now has $9 billion of debt, which will rise to about $13 billion if it completes the leveraged buyout -- a big load given the financial pressures facing Tribune and the newspaper industry. This year's cash flow may not top $1.2 billion, meaning a private Tribune could have debt exceeding 10 times cash flow. Most companies try to keep debt below three times cash flow, and even highly leveraged firms seek to hold the ratio to seven or eight. Underscoring the challenge, Tribune's revenue sank 11% in May. \u001d  Craig Huber, a bearish newspaper analyst at Lehman Brothers, has written that, if the Zell buyout fails, Tribune will sink to $4 to $5. He may be overly pessimistic, but his analysis is helping spook investors -- and presenting opportunities. \u001d  The LBO business is getting tougher as financing gets scarcer and more expensive. Yet investors willing to play the takeover arbitrage game are being reasonably paid to take the risks. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6668af65025ebdce4fba48d522ae49e9","symR":["CVX","PTT.TH","TH0646010007","US1667641005"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Thai PTT:Star Petroleum Refining Seen Launching IPO By End-07","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T08:34:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CVX","PTT.TH","TH0646010007","US1667641005"],"IndustryCodes":["OIL","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  PATTAYA (Dow Jones)--Star Petroleum Refining Co., or SPRC, is expected to launch its initial public offering by the end of this year, said Prasert Bunsumpun, president of PTT PCL (PTT.TH), Thailand's oil and gas giant, adding that PTT plans to partially divest its 36% stake in the company. \u001d  \"We've decided we would divest some stake in SPRC via the share offering,\" Prasert told reporters late Friday. \u001d  Earlier, PTT considered selling its stake to U.S.-based Chevron Corp.

(See related story on page 16.) \u001d  The prelaunch verdict for the iPhone was positive as all four technology critics from the country's three largest newspapers and a major newsweekly gave it a thumbs up, based largely on its software-driven features. But the vote of the masses over the next several weeks is what matters most, and will determine the fate of what Jobs called \"the most revolutionary and exciting product in Apple's history.\" \u001d  The true test will be the durability and reliability of the devices as well as consumer acceptance of AT&T's (ticker: T) less-than-3G network. Together they could determine the iPhone's success in the cut-throat world of wireless handsets over just a few months. \u001d  That same period will be crucial for investors.They must decide whether the iPhone is the next Nano, Apple's home-run music player, or the next Newton, its mega-flop personal digital assistant. \u001d  So far, they've bet Nano. Apple shares (AAPL) have soared more than 40% since Jan. 9 when the company announced it was going into the smart-phone business; in all they've risen 1,417% going back to May 2003, when Apple revealed that one million tunes had been downloaded from its iTune Website -- a software asset that could play a significant role in any success the iPhone enjoys. \u001d  There's no doubt the stock reflects a lot of iPhone success -- at nearly five times sales and more than 30 times future earnings -- and is likely headed into a volatile patch. In fact, the shares bear some resemblance to the iPhone -- very pricey but full of promise. Taking some profits is prudent while waiting to see if sales measure up. \u001d  \"There's been such hysteria around the phone that it led to what I would regard as a premature increase in the share price,\" says consultant and former Needham analyst Charlie Wolf, author of the technology newsletter Wolf Bytes. \u001d  Even some bulls anticipate a postlaunch stumble in the shares. \"There have been letdowns after Apple product launches in the past,\" says Glen Kacher, a principal of Menlo Park, Calif.-based Integral Capital, which owns an undisclosed stake in Apple. \u001d  Walter Price Jr., a technology fund manager for Allianz Capital in San Francisco, says he has been cutting his Apple position, with the idea of rebuilding it for the long haul after shares stop sputtering. \u001d  Wolf, too, has sold some shares in his personal account, but is still a long-term bull, looking for shares to hit 135 over the next 12 months. \u001d  Another way to protect against the volatility surrounding the iPhone is by using options (see my colleague Steve Sears' Striking Price column on page M8). \u001d  There is cause for pause. If a lot of early quality-control problems with the devices arise, for example, sales could suffer and the shares would stumble. If Apple fails to stay on pace to meet its sales goal of three million units for 2007, then shares would also get hit. And if it fails to keep pace next year to sell 10 million units, the same holds true. \u001d  How bad could it get? \"If the phone was a total flop, it could take the dip down into double digits,\" Wolf says. \u001d  But he doesn't think that will happen. In fact, he suggests the opposite. If Apple can blow through its initial sales goals cleanly -- without reliability or durability problems -- by September or so, the analyst thinks the shares could snap back sooner rather than later. But first, investors will have to ride out the turbulence of the introductory phase as hard-core Apple devotees begin to give way to less-forgiving customers. \"You won't have any sustainability in the stock until late summer or fall,\" says Wolf. \u001d  If the launch avoids quality or service glitches, there is likely to be a short supply of handsets for the rest of the year, says Tony Ursillo, an analyst at asset-manager Loomis Sayles. Apple will exploit demand to its advantage by tightening the flow of supply just enough to support the phone's initial high price tags of $499 and $599, and help spur even greater demand, Ursillo says. \"You can even look at precedents like previous iPod refreshes and see that when there is supply constraint, it works in the company's favor,\" Ursillo says. \u001d  As important as iPhone's launch is, computer sales will be key to the stock's maintaining its upward trajectory well into 2008. To put things in context, if Apple sells 10 million iPhones in 2008, that would add only $500 million in revenue, or 2% of its $21.6 billion estimated total. \u001d  Thus, a big part of the story is the Mac. As Barron's outlined in a cover story last summer (\"Bruised but Tasty,\" July 17, 2006), the addition of Intel-powered computers and this fall's introduction of a new operating system, code-named Leopard, should make Macs more Windows-friendly. The result should be a conversion of Windows users to Macintosh computers, based on the halo effect of the iPod -- and possibly the iPhone. \"For the stock to work at these [valuation] levels, that part of the story has to work. Mac has to do great,\" says Integral's Kacher. \u001d  So far, even before the introduction of Leopard -- delayed to accommodate the iPhone launch -- Mac sales have been picking up momentum. Third-party software called Parallels, which allows Macintosh owners to use Windows, has been selling briskly, with nearly a half-million copies of the program sold, Wolf says. \u001d  The arrival of Boot Camp should kick-start Mac sales into an even higher gear. The recent Apple software developers' conference confirmed that the game-changing Boot Camp, which enables users to boot into either Mac or Windows, will ship with the new Mac operating system OS 10.5 (Leopold), says Needham analyst John Lynch, who rates Apple a Buy with a $135 target. \u001d  To be sure, the iPhone, like the shares, carries risks. It's expensive, has an unconventional keyboard, and is being deployed on AT&T's slower EDGE network. On top of that, corporations are telling their employees -- the biggest users of smart phones -- that they will not buy or support the Apple phones. (Jobs, however, has promised one for every Apple employee.) Plus, mobile handsets are simply more complex than music players or computers, and the industry demands rigorous quality, says Charter Equity telecom analyst Ed Snyder, who does not cover the stock. \u001d  \"The hardware needs to be bullet-proof, and the software has to be easy to use,\" Snyder says. \u001d  It all comes down to software. \u001d  --- \u001d  Barron's Online staff writer Tiernan Ray contributed to this story. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6a35a28efb7a4a24099077268e4b278c","symR":["RBS.LN","GB0007547838"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"RBS Agrees To Sell 15 Hotels To Robson Asset Management-Paper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T11:14:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RBS.LN","GB0007547838"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.LN) has agreed to sell 15 hotels, including 12 Hiltons, to Robson Asset Management, a new vehicle set up by Jeremy Robson, the former head of principal finance at Royal Bank of Scotland, The Times reports Saturday without citing sources. \u001d  The hotels, which were to have been sold to Vector, are changing hands for slightly more than GBP1.1 billion, the newspaper reports. \u001d   Newspaper Web site: http://www.timesonline.co.uk \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9413 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 07:14 ET (11:14 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6cc0f2371be19227207c40b429284a0b","symR":["BBY","BOO","BSC","BX","EVST","VLO","XLE","US0865161014","US91913Y1001"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) The Trader: Doubts On Debt Weigh On Stocks","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BBY","BOO","BSC","BX","EVST","VLO","XLE","US0865161014","US91913Y1001"],"IndustryCodes":["CLO","ENT","EXT","FIS","OIS","OTS","REQ","RTS","SCR","SGD","TEX","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Kopin Tan \u001d  In theory, the second half of 2007 should begin quietly. The July 4 holiday beckons, and distractions abound. Except for Friday's jobs report, the flow of economic news will slow to a trickle. \u001d  But how stocks behave in a noiseless week can indicate the market's inclination, which lately has become harder to discern. For almost a year, stocks have melted up stubbornly on good and bad news, or even when there's no news. But that hot streak of four winning quarters ended on a discordant note in June, when stocks pulled back to register just their second decline in 13 months. \u001d  Last week, investors continued to fret about rising borrowing costs and trouble from leveraged speculation in the debt market, and the extent of such trouble could become clearer soon. With the quarter ended, many hedge funds will begin to give investors an account of their performance, and traders will be straining for a whiff of the kind of tumult that tripped up two hedge funds at Bear Stearns (ticker: BSC). \u001d  Nervous investors in junk-bond mutual funds also withdrew more than $400 million last week, while a $3.6 billion financing to help two buyout firms acquire U.S. Foodservice foundered. With stock prices supported by lavish buyouts and bounteous debt, traders will keep an anxious eye to see how this summer's pipeline of junk-bond deals, pegged at about $100 billion, is greeted in the market. \u001d  That anxiety is manifested in last week's erratic trading and thwarted advances. While stocks finished the week flat, the major benchmarks pushed repeatedly to intraday highs only to falter and fall. Crude oil ticked to a 10-month high of $70.68 a barrel, but the yield on 10-year Treasuries retreated slightly to 5.034%. \u001d  For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crept up 48, or 0.4%, to 13,409. The Standard & Poor's 500 barely eked out a one-point gain to 1503. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 14, or 0.6%, to 2603, while the Russell 2000 index of small stocks lost a point to 834. \u001d  The quarterly gains were impressive: The Dow's 8.5% surge marked its best quarter since 2003. The S&P 500 has climbed 5.8% since April 1 and the Nasdaq 7.5%; both have rallied in eight of the past nine quarters. But the quarter ended with a whimper. For the month of June, the Dow fell 1.6%, the S&P 500 fell 1.8%, the Nasdaq gave up 0.05% while the Russell 2000 fell 1.6%. \u001d  Uneasiness over a potentially over-levered market was summed up recently by Punk Ziegel analyst Richard Bove, who outlined a wobbly inverted pyramid. At the bottom is real GDP growth of about 1.9% over the past year. On top of that is personal income growth of about 5.8%. But total credit outstanding has increased 8.7%, asset-backed securities have grown 18.7%, while debt held by broker dealers is up more than 26%. \u001d  \"The growth in real GDP and personal income is supposed to generate the funds necessary to pay the interest on the debt instruments,\" he notes. When that fails, a financial shock could result. \u001d  Still, investors are willing to wait and see. Over the past four years, stocks have overcome a litany of woes to march higher, and bulls see little reason for this time to be different. Record short bets make it hard to paint this market as overly complacent, but it's also hardly as fretful as increasingly shrill market commentary suggests. The consensus gleaned from many money managers' mid-year outlooks remains largely nonplussed, with many penciling in high single-digit gains for the year. \u001d  Robert Pavlik, Oaktree Asset Management's chief investment officer and senior portfolio manager, says he would not be surprised by a second-half pullback of 3% to 5% but sees no worse suffering than that. \"Market gains will likely be fueled by an increase in business spending and strong global growth, relatively low interest rates and modest stock valuations,\" he says. \u001d  Further support for stocks should come from the market's willingness to buy on dips, robust employment, booming tourism, and increased demand for U.S. goods and services stoked by the weaker greenback. Still, Pavlik's year-end S&P 500 target of 1550, just 3.1% above current levels, suggests less than compelling upside for investors buying today. \u001d  \"It's a liquidity-driven market, yet there's evidence that access to capital is getting a little more difficult,\" says Jack Ablin, Harris Private Bank's chief investment officer. Ablin recently fashioned a \"liquidity barometer\" from credit spreads, the shape of the yield curve, gauges of the market's risk appetite, and even the value of the yen. While these show liquidity to still be abundant, they \"are beginning to tighten, suggesting that easy money is getting slightly harder to come by.\" \u001d  That worry showed in a 17% drop in shares of Blackstone Group (BX), the subject of a cautionary Barron's cover story last week. Another sign? Ablin divided the S&P 500 into five groups ranked by their price-to-cash-flow multiples. The cheapest stocks relative to their cash flow have long made the most-coveted buyout targets, and rabid speculation had propelled that cheapest quintile up 11.2% this year -- well ahead of the field. But for the most recent five days ended Thursday, this group pulled back the furthest and declined 1.2%. \u001d  Earnings will provide the next test, and here expectations have ticked higher. Analysts forecast second-quarter profit growth of 4.3%, up from less than 3% just two months ago, although bulls hope for growth of 5% to 8%. \u001d  The strongest improvement should come from industrials and technology (see story on page 33), while consumer discretionary profits are projected to fall 9%. For all the fretting about the consumer's demise, segments like hotels, restaurants, and electronic retailers have posted strong profit growth -- until recently, when retailers like Best Buy (BBY) missed estimates and trimmed its forecast. Says Thomson Financial analyst David Dropsey: \"Now, for the first time in a while, there's more uncertainty about whether weakness from homebuilders and autos will spread.\" \u001d  What worked in the first half of 2007? Construction, mining, railroads, technology, and other beneficiaries of a global economic boom led the market. A Jan. 8 call made here to bet on energy also paid off with the Energy Select SPDR Fund (XLE) rallying 23% since, while the refiner Valero Energy (VLO), flagged here late-February, is up 45% this year. On the other hand, sectors reliant on the American consumer have lagged, with homebuilders, casinos and apparel retailers suffering. \u001d  This isn't surprising as the U.S.' share of global gross domestic product continues to slip -- to about 27% from 32% over the past five years. The widening chasm between overseas and domestic earnings is stark: S&P 500 pretax profits derived from foreign operations surged 20% in the first quarter, according to Merrill Lynch, while domestic profits slipped 0.4% -- the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2002. \u001d  Things may not change much in the second half. A ranking of countries by annual GDP growth sees the U.S. in the middle of the pack last year but bringing up the rear in 2007. In contrast, Merrill sees some $1.25 trillion of spending on infrastructure in emerging markets over the next three years. \u001d  \"Our message is to stick with what works,\" says Merrill's North American economist David Rosenberg. \"Ensure the cyclical part of the portfolio retains a global reach, and the domestic segment overweighs the defensive-growth sector.\" \b \u001d  Two weeks ago, this column questioned why the boxing equipment company Everlast (EVST) had agreed hastily to a seemingly low merger bid from an affiliated licensee (and promptly heard from Everlast's lawyers). Since then, the market has quickly weighed in. \u001d  Everlast shares jumped more than 11% Thursday morning after the affiliate, the Hidary Group, disclosed in a regulatory filing that it was amending its buyout offer to $30.55 a share from $26.50. The reason? Another bidder apparently has emerged. \u001d  Minutes before Thursday's closing bell, Everlast announced a $168 million pact to be bought by a unit of Sports Direct, a U.K. sports retailer looking to expand stateside. The deal valued shares at 30. \u001d  Is this latest jab the best deal for Everlast stockholders? That cannot be properly answered when questions from Round One still linger: Did management conduct an auction for the company? What steps were taken to seek the best possible price? Management said Thursday it was \"pleased with the terms of this transaction and believe it is in the best interests of the company's stockholders.\" Funny, it said the exact same thing of the previous offer. \u001d  Not to be outdone, Hidary on Friday upped its bid for a second time in quick succession -- to $31.25 a share. Everlast shares climbed another 9% to trade above 32. After Friday's close, the Sports Direct unit raised its offer to 33. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a fight on our hands. \b \u001d  Changing something as fundamental as a name can often signal a bigger transformation to come. Demetria Guynes morphed into Demi Moore. Brad's Drink became Pepsi-Cola. And would Google (GOOG) have colonized the world if it was still called BackRub? \u001d  On July 1, the sporting goods company Collegiate Pacific marked its new fiscal year by changing its name to Sport Supply Group, and swapping its ticker symbol from BOO to RBI. But the transformation should go deeper than that. \u001d  The small Dallas company supplies sports equipment to schools, teams and the non-retail market through catalogs, the Internet, and its sales team. The sports run the gamut from archery to wrestling, and the goods range from baseball bats to bleachers and goal posts. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"74b0e5edd74ddaaf73481eed6e3d3382","symR":["ADM","BG","PPC","TSN"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) Commodities Corner: Corn Prices Get Crushed","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ADM","BG","PPC","TSN"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","OFP","XDJGI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Angie Pointer \u001d  The heartland issued a collective gasp Friday, as farmers and traders absorbed a sharply higher, new estimate of corn-planted acreage in the U.S. -- versus a starkly shrunken soybean figure. \u001d  The huge pop in corn plantings sent the crop's Chicago Board of Trade prices down Friday, while soy prices rallied. And on the week, December corn fell 30.75 cents a bushel, to settle at $3.5075, while the November soybean contract rose 51 cents a bushel, to $8.8175. Both contract months represent the fall harvest. \u001d  In the near-term, analysts see CBOT soybean futures rising further. Meanwhile, more declines in corn futures are expected near-term, as fears are quelled about shortages of corn for use in the ethanol and livestock industries. \u001d  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's latest, nearly 93-million-acre forecast for corn -- an astonishing 18.6% higher than last year and the highest planted area since 1944 -- jostled for commodity headlines with the news that soybean planting was down about 15% from last year, or about 11.4 million acres, from the year-ago, to 64 million, the smallest planted area since 1995. \u001d  The implications for futures prices, the biofuels industry and food producers are far-reaching. Says Don Roose, president of brokerage U.S. Commodities, \"We need more [soybean] acres in South America,\" to meet biodiesel demand. He adds that CBOT soybean futures need to reach about $9 a bushel to spur planting in South America -- particularly by megaproducer Brazil, as soybean prices are dollar-denominated, while the real's value is falling. \u001d  Brazilian analysts agree. \"If prices go to $10 a bushel, and that's a real possibility, you will have farmers planting soybeans in clay pots and flower vases,\" says Flavio Franca, a soy-market analyst for private consulting firm Safras & Mercado. \u001d  Analysts in Brazil said that, prior to the new data, the soybean area was expected to increase by 5%, from the 20 million hectares (49.4 million acres) planted in 2006-'07. Now, the prospect of higher prices could stimulate increased Brazilian plantings yet more. \u001d  Regarding corn, analysts say that the acreage figure suggests U.S. farmers could produce up to a 13-billion-bushel corn crop, as long as the weather remains favorable to plant development and maximum yields are achieved. Ultimately, this level of increase provides a much-needed cushion for the corn market. \"You can have some weather problems, and still have a good corn crop,\" Roose says. \u001d  David Driscoll, analyst with Citigroup Investment Research, says the declining corn prices create a bullish scenario for the corn-processor and ethanol-producer Archer Daniels Midland (ticker: ADM). The expected jump in the South American soybean crop is also seen as a positive over the long term for agribusiness company, Bunge (BG), analysts say.

So it is right now with Vancouver-based, independent Lionsgate Entertainment. The spoiler: Fiscal fourth-quarter earnings dropped to $25 million, or 19 cents a share, on  $331.6 million in revenue. And while the Friday opening of Lionsgate-distributed Sicko, by Michael Moore -- about what many consider the real-life horror story of the U.S. health-care system -- may be getting more buzz than the buckets-of-guts Saw movies, it's not expected to bring much box-office bling. \u001d  Wall Street foresaw earnings of about 22 cents. Worse still, in a conference call, CEO Jon Feltheimer warned that Lions Gate (ticker: LGF) expected to report a loss of about $50 million in the new fiscal year, a considerable reverse from analysts' targets of $50-million-plus in profit. So the shares fell from a $12 peak, to 11. \u001d  But Lionsgate hasn't yet run out of red carpet. As we noted in our bullish story \"The Little Studio that Could\" (July 10, 2006), profits and earnings are wobbly indicators at Lionsgate, since movie releases cause big, sudden earnings swings, and accounting rules require the company to book production costs as they occur -- way earlier. \u001d  Much of the fourth-quarter shortfall was driven by a 15% year-over-year rise in direct operating expenses, along with a 6% increase in general costs, both due to the fact that Lionsgate is shooting a combination of both more movies and more expensive movies (which tend to make more money). \u001d  Since we wrote about Lionsgate, the stock has risen nearly 50%, from what was then a low of 8.60. We still see more growth to come, and three analysts see the shares headed above 15. \u001d  Lionsgate has a very healthy balance sheet, with about $289 million in cash and short-term investments. It continues to spin off from its franchise of horror movies; the coming releases of War, Hostel II and Saw IV are expected to deliver. \u001d  On top of that, it's been among the faster movers into new methods of digital delivery: The 15 movies that Lionsgate made available earlier this year to Microsoft's Xbox Live helped boost digital revenue 50%, while Feltheimer notes that video-on-demand sales for Employee of the Month \"exceeded $3 million on a film that grossed about $27 million at the domestic box office.\" The company has, he explains, \"nearly a dozen active agreements in place for digital delivery\" of its content with major companies, including Best Buy (BBY). \u001d  Finally, Lionsgate is one of the last remaining pure-play entertainment companies, and has been rumored to be a takeover candidate, especially on the strength of its library of more than 11,000  titles, including such gems as Rambo, American Psycho, and The Blair Witch Project. \u001d  Says Feltheimer: \"There are no more libraries out there to be bought.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"796eee8369e0d4ed4521d49d9dfe3668","symR":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ABN Amro: Merger Shouldn't Impact ABN Amro's China Ops","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T10:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 06:25 ET (10:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7ac81b5c5147f6584b54c865845ba97f","symR":["BWTR","CVLT","IMX","MIG","TSFG"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) Research Reports: How Analysts Size Up Companies","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BWTR","CVLT","IMX","MIG","TSFG"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","INP","INS","MDV","SOF","WAT","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   Edited by Anita Peltonen \u001d  The research reports excerpted here were issued recently by investment firms.

We estimate the company can grow its revenue at a 40% compound annual rate through [decade's] end...with even greater growth off small base for earnings. Customers include Aqua America, American Water, California Water Services, Arizona-American Water, and American States Water. Basin's patented process [to bring contaminated groundwater to drinking-water standards] employs multiple beds controlled by a computer. The patent has 17 years to run. The process produces one-tenth the waste of a conventional ion-exchange plant. Although upfront cost of a Basin Water system is about 20% higher than competing [systems'], the cost over a 10-year contract is about 50% less. If new technology were to emerge, we believe it would take years of testing to secure regulatory approval. The company ended the 1Q07 with cash of $51.2 million/nearly $2.60 a share. We expect BWTR to be cash-neutral in '07 and generate free cash in '08. \b \u001d  CommVault Systems \u001d  -- CVLT-NNM \b \u001d  Market Outperform \u001d  -- Price 16.58 on June 26 \u001d  by JMP Securities \b \u001d  Initiating coverage with Market Outperform and 12-month target of 20, or 21% upside from current level. CommVault is a leading provider of storage software solutions, including flagship product Galaxy Backup and Recovery. We believe CommVault is well-positioned in the storage-software market, given its unique technical architecture, comprehensive data-management platform, upcoming product cycle and solid distribution relationships. We are introducing our fiscal-year '08 non-GAAP earnings-per- share estimate of 57 cents, one cent above consensus. We are introducing our FY09 non-GAAP EPS estimate of 72 cents, 2 cents above consensus. Our price target places CommVault at a calendar 2008 price-earnings multiple of 30 times, a premium to its peer group, but only a slight premium to its estimated earnings-growth rate of 29% from calendar-year '07 to CY08. \b \u001d  Implant Sciences \u001d  -- IMX-Amex \b \u001d  Neutral \u001d  -- Price 1.80 on June 26 \u001d  by Taglich Brothers \b \u001d  Implant Sciences, headquartered in Wakefield, Mass., develops, acquires and commercializes ion-implantation and thin-film-coating technology with applications in medical devices, semiconductor manufacturing and trace-explosive detection. Maintaining Neutral: The explosives-detection business has significant longer-term upside potential, but until it shows more consistent revenue gains and product-development progress, IMX is unlikely to outperform the market in next 12 months....With release of benchtop-mounted Quantum Sniffer and detection portal for head-to-toe passenger screening, both still in development, explosive-detection systems revenue gains might accelerate. Citing intensifying competition, IMX sold its Accurel Int'l. semiconductor business for $12.5 million...[which] should improve liquidity, offset cash burn through FY08 and provide funding for expansion of explosives-detection...[but the sale] reduces annual revenue by $8.5 million and lowers gross margins three to five percentage points...operations are likely to remain unprofitable through FY09...[but should not require] further financing. \b \u001d  Meadowbrook Insurance Group \u001d  -- MIG-NYSE \b \u001d  Outperform \u001d  -- Price 10.20 on June 26 \u001d  by Friedman Billings Ramsey \b \u001d  Upgraded from Market Perform. MIG shares are down 17% from 52-week high in October '06.

Best, a [credit-rating organization focused on financial-services, including banking and insurance]...In addition to [book value] growth, we believe there's room for multiple expansion...as top-line growth increases.

The number of initial public offerings, or IPOs, completed year-to-date is up about 25% from the first half of 2006, while the backlog of deals in waiting is valued at $17.6 billion, around the same level as last year. More important, the quality of companies in the pipeline suggests somenew stocks will be big winners. \u001d  It has paid to invest in IPOs this year; the average new issue has returned about 12% since its offering, well above the mid-single-digit returns logged by the Dow Jones industrials and other market measures. That is a reflection, in part, of the financial health of companies coming public today. Another indication of their attractiveness to investors: more than 75% of this year's new issues priced at or above the range expected by hopeful executives and underwriters. \u001d  IPOs raised $40.7 billion in 2006, says Dealogic, whose data exclude offerings priced below $5 a share; special-purpose companies, or SPACs, and unit offerings. The Class of 2007 is on track to match that total, having raised $20 billion so far, excluding the Blackstone Group's (ticker: BX) $4.1 billion sale of units June 21. Ironically, Blackstone hasn't joined the gallery of winners; its shares priced at 31, popped to 38 in their first day of trading and then fell to 30 amid concerns about valuation and potential changes to the federal tax code that could clip the firm's future earnings. (For more on the deal, see last week's Barron's cover story, \"Top of the Market.\") \u001d  The pace of new-issue filings has quickened in recent months, spurred by a healthy economy and stock market, and a rash of offerings seeking to capitalize on technology and telecommunications innovations. Tech and energy offerings are up this year, and the buzz surrounding Blackstone has boosted interest in financial-sector issues. Rival buyout firms including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Carlyle Group and Citadel Investment are thought to be eyeing public offerings of their own. \u001d  A year ago health care was vying for the IPO spotlight, but many young biotech shares have since turned in a lackluster performance. \u001d  Fueling demand for IPOs is the profitability of the companies coming public. Roughly 70% of this year's new stocks were issued by companies operating in the black or on the verge of doing so, something all but unheard of during the dot-com -- and IPO -- booms of the late 1990s. Also, institutional investors are on the prowl for new names, as more public companies slip behind closed doors via corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts. \u001d  But the door swings both ways. Says Linda Killian, manager of the IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund, with $19 million of assets, \"We are looking to increase our holdings in technology and the health-care area. A number of companies that went private are coming public again.\" \u001d  Fresh from its own offering, Blackstone is set to spin out one of its holdings, Orbitz Worldwide, the online consumer-travel service. One of the larger deals in the pipeline, Orbitz hopes to raise $750 million. \u001d  Blackstone got Orbitz when it purchased Cendant's Travelport businesses, which also include Galileo, an electronic travel-services company. It's a bullish sign for Orbitz that Expedia (EXPE), a competitor, is about to buy back its own shares near all-time highs, says Richard Peterson, an IPO expert at Thomson Financial. \u001d  Another Web-based company, Dice Holdings, hopes to raise $200 million in coming months. The New York concern operates employment Websites for recruiters and companies seeking experts in technology, engineering and finance. Given the number of civilians employed as consultants to the U.S. military in Iraq and elsewhere, Dice also is well positioned with ClearanceJobs.com, aimed at people with U.S. government security clearance. \u001d  With oil prices near $70 a barrel, some energy issues in registration, such as Concho Resources, an exploration company, and Stallion Oilfield Services, look promising. Other deals in the pipeline include unit offerings for oil and gas limited partnerships, which have been growing in popularity. Oil prices would have to fall precipitously for these prospective offerings to be postponed or canceled. \u001d  Still other companies seek to cash in on the growing demand for alternative fuels. Seattle-based Imperium Renewables, which is developing biodiesel production technology, hopes to raise $345 million. And Global Energy, based in Cincinnati and run by a former Procter & Gamble executive, hopes to raise $350 million. The company recently signed a 10-year deal to provide synthetic gas to P&G Paper Products. \u001d  Chinese solar listings were sizzling performers in the first half of 2007, but fund manager Killian thinks the cycle has peaked. JA Solar Holdings (JASO), which makes solar cells for the Chinese market, has soared 129%, to 34.40, since its February IPO. \u001d  Tech and telecom issues have been stars this year; tech IPOs have returned an average of 27%, and telecom issues 14%. One sign of the market's healthy appetite for tech deals was Wednesday's 66% first-day pop in shares of Data Domain (DDUP), a data-recovery concern that finished the session at 24.95. It boasts the year's second-best stock-market debut after Fortress Investment Group (FIG), which rallied 68% in its first day of trading in February. \u001d  Thomson's Peterson questions the prospects for Virgin Mobile's U.S. IPO, likely to price later this year. With Wall Street riveted by the introduction of Apple's iPhone, shares of the global mobile-phone service provider could suffer. \u001d  Health-care IPOs did poorly in the year's first half, especially those of pharmaceutical and biotechnology concerns. Among the year's worst performers to date, stent-maker Xtent (XTNT), came out of the gate in January at 16 a share. But the stock has plummeted 35%, to 10.35, amid growing concerns about the safety of drug-coated stents. \u001d  Among the biggest deals expected this year is a $2 billion U.S. offering by Cosan, Brazil's largest sugar and ethanol producer. The company trades in Sao Paulo and now is seeking a New York Stock Exchange listing. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is rumored to be considering an offer for the company, which should benefit from consolidation among Brazilian producers as global demand for sugar and ethanol increases. \u001d  Roughly 20% of this year's IPOs have been floated by non-U.S. companies. In addition to JA Solar, Acorn International (ATV), a Chinese marketing concern, has been a strong performer in the aftermarket. The stock came public in May at 15.50 a share and finished last week around 25. \u001d  Some foreign deals have hit rough waters, too, including Xinhua Finance Media (XFML), a unit of China's Xinhua Finance. Its shares are down 33%, to 8.67, from their March offering price of 13, amid controversy about executive departures and the past financial dealings of certain controlling shareholders (Asian Trader, Barron's May 28). \u001d  So far this year, the London market has claimed 25% of global new-stock listings, Hong Kong another 11%, according to Thomson Financial. U.S. exchanges accounted for 20% of deal proceeds. \u001d  \"The Chinese and some South American companies are [coming to the U.S.], but not the European and Indian companies,\" Killian says. \"Sarbanes-Oxley is one reason, and alternative markets in Hong Kong and London are a lot more liquid than they were five years ago.\" \u001d  More foreign offerings could make their way to U.S. exchanges by early fall if the Securities and Exchange Commission succeeds with a proposal to allow foreign companies to state profits solely according to international accounting standards. Companies based abroad currently must file a second set of books to comply with U.S rules. \u001d  The stock market's continued health is key to the IPO market's success. If interest rates rise and investors' appetite for risk diminishes, the window for deals will slam shut. For now, however, the window is wide open, which spells good news for the issuers of new stock, and the buyers. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7d9dd47708e3818bcda0bf220c262142","symR":["ISLE"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":": Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc.

(BCE), Canada's largest telecommunications company, said Saturday it has reached an agreement to be bought by a group led by the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan for C$51.7 billion, making it the largest takeover in Canadian history. \u001d  The Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board in co-operation with U.S.-based Providence Equity Partners and Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC won out over several other bidders, BCE said in a statement. \u001d  \"It is gratifying to see that BCE's Board of Directors shares our vision for this initiative, and we are honored to lead the largest buyout transaction in Canadian corporate history,\" Jim Leech, senior vice-president of Teachers' Private Capital, the investment wing of the pension plan, said in the statement. \u001d  The pension plan was BCE's largest shareholder with a 6.8% stake. Leech noted that the plan has been a major BCE shareholder since the early 1990s \u001d  The investor group will acquire all of the common shares of BCE not already owned by Teachers for an offer price of C$42.75 per common share. \u001d  The all-cash transaction is valued at C$51.7 billion, including C$16.9 billion in debt, preferred equity and minority interests. \u001d  The Toronto-based Ontario Teachers Pension Plan - with assets of C$106 billion in 2006 - invests and administers the retirement funds for Ontario's 167,000 teachers and 104,000 retired teachers. Leech said BCE's headquarters will remain in Montreal. \u001d  BCE had other potential bidders, including New York-based Cerberus Capital Management LP with billionaire Hong Kong-based, Canadian citizen Richard Li's Pacific Century Group, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board with backing from U.S. buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. \u001d  Telus Corp. (TU) - Canada's second-largest telecom company - pulled out of the bidding last Tuesday. \u001d  BCE, which has more than 54,000 employees, had annual revenue of C$17.7 billion in 2006. It has 18.2 million customer connections, including 5.8 million wireless subscribers, 8.64 million phone lines, 1.94 million internet subscribers and 1.82 million satellite television subscribers. Besides Bell Canada, Bell Canada International and wireless telecom companies, BCE holdings include interest in CTVglobemedia, one of the Canada's biggest media companies. \u001d  \"This proposed transaction concludes a comprehensive and disciplined review of the company's strategic alternatives launched April 17,\" Richard J. Currie, BCE's chairman of the board, said in the statement. \"It will deliver substantial value creation for our shareholders. In addition, a majority of the equity will be owned by Canadians.\" \u001d  BCE chief executive Michael Sabia resisted suggestions of a takeover in the past, in the belief that his slimming and focusing of BCE, including an end to its conglomerate structure and a planned return to the Bell Canada name, would end a long period of flat stock-market performance. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 11:07 ET (15:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8120fa26488fccbd4c02721bdddfed0c","symR":["0272.HK","KYG811511131"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"HK Shui On Land's Unit Sells Stakes In 3 Units For CNY2.12B","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T06:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0272.HK","KYG811511131"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","RED","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  HONG KONG (Dow Jones)--Chinese developer Shui On Land Ltd.

The subsequent listings of three of China's so-called Big Four state banks raised $42.3 billion - riding a wave of China interest to exceed expectations. \u001d  Jiang said on the sidelines of a banking forum in Shanghai that international accounting firm Deloitte & Touche had already completed an audit of the Agricultural Bank, but the audit by the Chinese government audit agency, the National Audit Office, is still ongoing. \u001d  The two audits are viewed by analysts as an important step in establishing how much money the government should inject into Agricultural Bank of China to recapitalize it. \b \u001d  -By Rick Carew and Rose Yu, Dow Jones Newswires; 8621 6120-1200; rick.carew@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 02:24 ET (06:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"8409fdc374bf1625a42f1b215fc1839a","symR":["BBY","BOO","BSC","BX","EVST","VLO","XLE","US0865161014","US91913Y1001"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) The Trader: Doubts On Debt Weigh On -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BBY","BOO","BSC","BX","EVST","VLO","XLE","US0865161014","US91913Y1001"],"IndustryCodes":["CLO","ENT","EXT","FIS","OIS","OTS","REQ","RTS","SCR","SGD","TEX","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTF"],"Story":"\u001d  Shares climbed 6% Friday to 9.71, but are still off 10% over the past year as the company struggled to integrate a recent merger.

(BCE.T)  said Saturday it agreed to be acquired by the investment arm of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Providence Equity Partners Inc. and Madison Dearborn Partners, for $48.5 billion. \u001d  The move marks the largest buyout in the country's history and the telecoms industry globally. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  The deal includes $15.9 billion in debt, preferred equity and minority interests. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan is already BCE's largest shareholder. Under the deal, Providence will purchase BCE's shares for C$42.75, or $40.15, a 40% premium over the average first-quarter share price before it rose in late March amid rumors of a buyout. \u001d  On Friday, BCE's shares were priced at $37.79 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. \u001d  With a market capitalization of $30 billion, BCE dominates the telecom market in Eastern Canada, selling fixed-line, wireless, high-speed Internet and video services. The company's stock had stagnated in recent years as the company struggled to stay competitive. BCE had trouble signing up subscribers to its Bell Wireless cellphone unit and its landline division lost access lines to cheaper cable providers. Meanwhile, smaller rivals Telus Corp. (TU) and Rogers Communications (RCI) both saw overall growth. In April, Teachers began agitating for a sale. \u001d  BCE was widely expected to be taken over by its leading rival, Telus Corp. But in a surprise decision Monday, Telus decided not to submit a bid, citing \"inadequacies\" in the bidding process. Some observers say that Telus could still enter a hostile bid for its rival, but could be deterred by a hefty breakup fee. Telus could also wait until BCE is split into more profitable components and snatch up the pieces it wants, such as the Bell Wireless division, analysts say. \u001d  That left three major bidders to submit plans to BCE's board on Friday. Aside from Teachers, Cerberus Capital Management and the Hospitals of Ontario Pension Plan submited a bid, as well as the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., despite a last-minute pullout of partners Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec in Montreal and Onex Corp.

The BCE Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote to accept the offer. \b \u001d  Under the terms of the transaction, the investor group will acquire all of the common shares of BCE not already owned by Teachers for an offer price of C$42.75 per common share and all preferred shares at the prices set forth in the attached schedule. Financing for the transaction is fully committed through a syndicate of banks acting on behalf of the purchaser. The purchase price represents a 40% premium over the undisturbed average trading price of BCE common shares in the first quarter of 2007, prior to the possibility of a privatization transaction surfacing publicly. The transaction values BCE at 7.8 times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2007. \b \u001d  \"This proposed transaction concludes a comprehensive and disciplined review of the company's strategic alternatives launched April 17,\" said Richard J. Currie, Chairman of the Board of BCE. \"It will deliver substantial value creation for our shareholders. In addition, a majority of the equity will be owned by Canadians.\" \b \u001d  \"The transaction delivers to our shareholders the economic benefit of the work done to focus on our core business and to strengthen Bell with a new cost structure and new competitive capabilities,\" said Michael Sabia, President and CEO of BCE. \"All members of the investor group have outstanding track records in building strong and resilient enterprises and they share our commitment to customers, our employees and the communities we serve.\" \b \u001d  \"It is gratifying to see that BCE's Board of Directors shares our vision for this initiative, and we are honoured to lead the largest buyout transaction in Canadian corporate history,\" said Jim Leech, Senior Vice-President, Teachers' Private Capital, noting that Teachers has been a major BCE shareholder since the early 1990s. \"The Board has recognized our commitment to BCE's ongoing growth potential, through our proposed investment strategy. We made it clear in our proposal that we have carefully considered the potential for BCE and its ongoing status as a Canadian icon. We strongly believe that all BCE shareholders, Canadian consumers, and employees, including senior management, who will continue to direct the company from its headquarters in Montreal, will benefit from this transaction. We look forward to working together with BCE to make this a reality.\" \b \u001d  \"This is a unique opportunity to contribute to and participate in the growth of one of the world's most significant communications companies,\" said Jonathan M. Nelson, Chief Executive Officer of Providence Equity Partners. \"BCE offers state of the art services through its sophisticated network that extends throughout Canada. We look forward to working with BCE's talented management and employees and our partners to build on the strong platform that is in place for the benefit of all of the company's stakeholders.\" \b \u001d  The equity ownership of BCE would be as follows: Teachers Private Capital 52%, Providence 32%, Madison Dearborn 9% and other Canadian investors 7%. \b \u001d  The purchaser has obtained a debt commitment to finance the transaction subject to usual terms for these types of financings. The purchaser anticipates requiring BCE, Bell Canada and Bell Mobility to redeem outstanding redeemable debentures maturing up to August 2010 pursuant to their terms as of and subject to the closing of the transaction. The acquisition debt financing would become an obligation of BCE and be guaranteed by BCE's then subsidiaries (other than Bell Aliant Regional Communications Income Fund and Northwestel Inc.). As to Bell Canada, the purchaser's financing would comply as to ranking and security with the then existing Bell Canada debentures and medium term notes issued under the 1976 and 1997 indentures. In addition, the purchaser has obtained commitments to make available a combination of facilities in order to support the ongoing liquidity needs for the company. \b \u001d  The transaction is subject to the customary approvals, including CRTC approval for the transfer of Bell's broadcast license, and Industry Canada with respect to the transfer of spectrum licenses. \b \u001d  The transaction includes a break-up fee of C$800 million (US$751 million), payable by BCE in certain circumstances and a reverse break-up fee of C$1 billion payable by the purchaser in certain circumstances. The transaction will be completed through a plan of arrangement, which will require the approval of two-thirds of outstanding common and preferred shares, voting as a class. Shareholders will be asked to vote on the transaction at a special meeting, the details of which will be announced in due course. The company anticipates that the transaction will be completed in the first quarter of next year. \b \u001d  A proxy circular will be prepared and mailed to shareholders over the coming months providing shareholders with important information about the transaction. A material change report, which provides more details on the transaction, will be filed with the Canadian securities commissions and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and will be available at www.sedar.com and at www.sec.gov. \b \u001d  Legal advisors to BCE are Davies, Ward Phillips & Vineberg, Stikeman Elliott, and Sullivan & Cromwell. The bid process was led by Goldman, Sachs and Co. BMO Capital Markets, CIBC Capital Markets and RBC Capital Markets also acted as financial advisors to the company. Greenhill and Co. provided independent advice to the Strategic Oversight Committee of the BCE Board of Directors. The Board received fairness opinions regarding the consideration to be paid for common and preferred shares from the company's financial advisors. \b \u001d  Legal advisors to the investor group are Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Goodmans. Citi is serving as lead mergers & acquisitions advisor to the consortium.

And that could boost their shares. \"The rationale here is that earnings growth leads stock prices,\" says Michael Thompson, director of research at Thomson Financial. \"Stock prices reflect good earnings, and these are places where you will find it.\" If that's true, some financial stocks might be best left on the bench, next to home builders, auto makers and some retailers. \u001d  For the second consecutive quarter, the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 are expected to vault a sharply lowered bar. Analysts say corporate profits could grow 4.3% in the second quarter and 6.3% in the third, compared with year-earlier showings. For all of 2007, the black ink could rise by 7.8%. These estimates are much stronger than in April, when analysts feared that many companies would cut guidance amid worry about the U.S. economy. \u001d  In the past two weeks, several companies have reported financial results that beat expectations, including Walgreen (ticker: WAG), Oracle (ORCL) and Jabil Circuit (JBL). \u001d  True, there have been plenty of disappointments. FedEx (FDX) fell short, as did electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY), which also lowered guidance. Coffee-chain Starbucks (SBUX) said it would have a tough time hitting the upper end of its full-year guidance. \u001d  And earlier in June, investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bear Stearns (BSC) said that fiscal second-quarter profits had been squeezed by the nation's mounting home-loan defaults. Yet Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services chief investment strategist Sam Stovall says: \"There hasn't been any drastic last-minute resetting of the bar by companies and analysts. Nothing has compelled analysts to curb expectations.\" \u001d  Profits generated by energy outfits in the second quarter are expected to be up 2%, versus a previous projection of a 9% decline, Thomson Financial says. The sector faces tough comparisons to 2006, when earnings jumped 24.7%. \u001d  But Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer for Harris Private Bank, says that energy-sector profits this year could be 10% above expectations. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial now see a 3% gain for the companies this year; in April, they were predicting a 5% drop. \u001d  \"Estimates for earnings have been creeping up, and these are companies that make sure that sell-side analysts do not overshoot,\" says Doug Roman, director of equity management at PNC Financial Services. \"If they are managing estimates up, that's a very good sign.\" \u001d  The financial sector, however, will be a mixed bag. Insurers and brokerages should fare well. Profits at Morgan Stanley (MS) jumped 40% in the second quarter, fueled by revenue from stock trading and investment banking. But the problems of Bear Stearns' hedge funds have left a cloud over other investment banks. And growing credit woes and rising interest rates don't bode well for commercial banks, says Brian Belski, the U.S. sector strategist for Merrill Lynch. \u001d  With profits growing 14%, the industrial sector is likely to provide the biggest boost to second-quarter profits, with technology in second place at 9%. The industrial group is eclectic and includes aerospace, machinery and construction-equipment companies that generate large portions of their revenue outside the U.S. \u001d  The industrial sector has been one of the most stable in the S&P 500, with projected profit growth remaining largely unchanged. \"The economy is much stronger than people anticipated,\" says PNC's Roman. \"And large multinational companies such as Boeing [BA], Goodrich [GR] and Precision Castparts [PCP] are also driving earnings.\" \u001d  Projections for technology companies have gradually fallen since the start of the year, in part due to disappointing forecasts from computer-chip makers. \u001d  But with full-year profits expected to rise 14%, tech could surpass all other S&P 500 sectors in '07, fueled partly by share repurchases. \"It is no longer a stigma for a tech company to repurchase stock or pay a dividend,\" says Mark Demos, a portfolio manager with Fifth Third Asset Management. \u001d  Health care, meanwhile, could tie with industrials for second place in 2007. The sector enjoyed a 7.8% gain in 2006 and should see a 12% bounce this year, as pharmaceutical pipelines improve. Second-quarter profits could jump 7%, Thomson Financial predicts. \u001d  In sum, trading now at 15.6 times forward earnings, the S&P 500 does look pricey, compared with its expected long-term profit-growth rate of 8%. \u001d  But earnings comparisons look a lot better for almost every sector in 2007. And earnings at companies in the industrial, technology and health-care groups are growing strongly enough to keep their stock prices rising respectably in the coming 12 months. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"90f2daa9f16631cc0a94bc8266501ffa","symR":["AAPL","US0378331005"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) Up & Down Wall Street: Dear Lord! -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAPL","US0378331005"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","REA","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\u001d  E-mail: randall.forsyth@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"92504a9d0eba76cb378dec3ddf1b2eb6","symR":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ABN Amro: Bank's Asia Ops Attractive To Barclays, RBS","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T10:23:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 06:23 ET (10:23 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"98b0016d8eba5c853d6bb694a0d2771e","symR":["BCI.XX","BX","CAY.XX","CGJ.AU","CVC.YY","KKR.XX","MBL.AU","PEP.YY","PR.YY","TPG.XX","WOW.AU","AU000000CGJ7","AU000000MBL3","AU000000WOW2"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Australia's Coles Board Weighs Takeover Bids","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T07:02:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BCI.XX","BX","CAY.XX","CGJ.AU","CVC.YY","KKR.XX","MBL.AU","PEP.YY","PR.YY","TPG.XX","WOW.AU","AU000000CGJ7","AU000000MBL3","AU000000WOW2"],"IndustryCodes":["FDR","FIS","HIM","RTB","RTS","SCR","XATI","XDJGI","XISL","XORD"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MELBOURNE (Dow Jones)--Australian retailer Coles Group Ltd. (CGJ.AU) Saturday began deliberations on takeover bids, but the exit of a TPG Inc.-led consortium this week could take the edge off a potential A$20 billion price tag. \u001d  Local conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES.AU) and its private equity partners are in the box seat to secure Coles after the TPG group walked away, blaming the state of the U.S. credit market for its decision. \u001d  The withdrawal of the TPG consortium was a major blow to Coles' chances of generating a competitive auction. \u001d  Woolworths Ltd. (WOW.AU), Coles' main rival, was also expected to have made an offer by the deadline of 9 a.m. Saturday (2300 GMT Friday), but only for parts of the business. Woolworths couldn't be reached for comment. \u001d  Competition rules would prevent Woolworths from bidding for Coles' core food and liquor assets, with the two companies controlling around 70% of Australia's supermarket industry. \u001d  \"The board has received and commenced its consideration of proposals relating to the ownership of the company,\" a Coles spokesman said. \u001d  A Wesfarmers spokesman confirmed it had submitted a bid for the whole company. \u001d  If it succeeds, the takeover would be the biggest in Australia's history. \u001d  Wesfarmers, which is bidding with Europe's Permira, local private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners and Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd. (MBL.AU), made an indicative A$19.7 billion offer in April after securing a 12.8% stake in the retailer. \u001d  But the consortium's bid price isn't constrained by its initial A$16.47 a share proposal. A person close to the consortium Friday said the offer could be pitched around A$16.00, given the deterioration in the business. \u001d  Coles shares closed Friday at A$16.12 - down 2 cents. The stock has fallen more than 4% in the past few weeks amid concerns the TPG consortium was poised to abandon its bid. Three of its original members, including Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts & Co., pulled out last month. \u001d  Wesfarmers shares soared to a record close Friday at A$45.73as investors backed its chances of winning control of Coles. The Perth-based company is expected to make a cash and scrip offer. \u001d  If Wesfarmers' bid falls short of the board's expectations, Coles maintains it could recapitalize its core food and liquor business with TPG and sell off its non-food assets, Officeworks and Target, a person close to Coles has said. \u001d  Woolworths is expected to lodge a bid for Officeworks, and either of the discount department stores Target or Kmart. The two Australian chains Target and Kmart are fully owned by Coles, and aren't part of the U.S. chains. Analysts expect Woolworths' ability to extract synergies through its own retail businesses will see it lodge a robust bid. \u001d  But the likelihood of an alternative deal with TPG emerging is slim, two people familiar with the situation have said. Analysts say such an option would also be drawn out; putting further pressure on the performance of Coles' businesses. \u001d   TPG's consortium includes Carlyle Group LP and Blackstone Group (BX).

The Manhattan-based fund invests in China through a little-known group of Chinese companies that are listed in the U.S. and Canada. Shares of these fast-growing companies trade for about 10 times earnings, a fraction of the multiples in the Shanghai market. Siris, a former top-ranked retailing analyst,also brings his smarts to that sector. He likes a group of auto dealers, and is down on some high-flying restaurant chains. He is also is partial to a pair of strip-club operators. Since Guerrilla was founded in 2000, the fund has returned 15.6% annually. So far this year, it's up 15.9%. The 62-year-old Siris also runs a separate fund for Chinese investments. \u001d  Siris' investments can be risky. Barron's has interviewed him six times, most recently in 2004. One of his favorites then, a pet insurer, has fallen more than 90%. Another pick, Bon-Ton Stores, a department-store chain that he still favors, has nearly tripled. An orthodox stockpicker, Siris is not. \b \u001d  Barron's: Peter, What's your approach? \u001d  Siris: Our strategy is very simple. We're just stockpickers. We look to buy undervalued, under-followed stocks and short overvalued and over-hyped stocks. I will tell you that we haven't made any money in shorts. It's funny. I go around and talk to a lot of my friends who run hedge funds. Nobody is making money in shorts any- more. This hasn't been a good market for shorts, but we short stocks because we like to limit risk and because at some point the valuations will come back. \b \u001d  Q: Why isn't your fund any larger? \u001d  A: We've never marketed Guerrilla. Last week was the first time we marketed anything to institutions, and it was Hua-Mei Partners, our China fund, not Guerrilla. \b \u001d  Q: Tell us about your China investment strategy. \u001d  A: What we do in China is invest in U.S.- and Canadian-listed companies. It gets confusing sometimes. In China, there is the Shanghai exchange. Then there is the Hong Kong exchange. There's a big waiting list for companies to go public on these exchanges. Even now, for every company that goes public there are probably a hundred in the queue, and a lot of companies want money sooner rather than later. What some of them do is reverse mergers into shells of U.S. companies. So you have a company, and I'm just making up names, that once was New Mexico Silver and stopped doing business. All of a sudden, it merges with China Hospital and its name gets changed to China Hospital. \b \u001d  Q: What's appealing about them? \u001d  A: They report earnings in English, follow GAAP accounting [generally accepted accounting principles] and are SEC-compliant. While H shares in Shanghai are selling at 40 or 50 times earnings, these companies, which are growing 40% to 80% per year, are much cheaper. The average multiple now of the companies in our fund is about eight times next year's earnings. \b \u001d  Q: Why are they so inexpensive? \u001d  A: First, local investors in China can't buy. It's very complicated for a Chinese investor to invest here. Most Americans don't know about them. You can go to Best Buy and see the stores. You can't go to China 3C and see its stores. And in a few cases, management doesn't speak English. There's a lack of good information. A lot of these companies have no real analyst coverage. \b \u001d  Q: How large are they? \u001d  A: We own some that are small with market caps of $80 or $100 million and some of them have market caps in the billions. \b \u001d  Q: Really? \u001d  A: One of my favorite Chinese expressions translates to \"hang a lamb's head but sell dog meat,\" which means for a butcher to advertise lamb but sell dog meat. The problem with Americans is that they can't tell which companies are lambs and which are dogs. \b \u001d  Q: What's your edge? \u001d  A: I speak Mandarin. I started coming to China 34 years ago during the Cultural Revolution. I even wrote a bestselling novel about China in 1982 called The Peking Mandate. The change in China is unlike anything I've ever seen. Here's a country where for 10 years every school was closed. Anybody who had a dime more than anybody else got purged or was sent to Mongolia. And the people now are just on fire. I can be sitting here at 2 in the afternoon, which is 2 in the morning China time, and be getting e-mails from Chinese CEOs asking me questions. So what's going on there is pretty exceptional. \b \u001d  Q: Talk about some of the companies. \u001d  A: Take China 3C, a consumer-electronics retailer. Last year, sales rose five-fold. In the first quarter they did $85 million in revenues versus $13 million a year earlier. \b \u001d  Q: This is like a Best Buy in China? \u001d  A: Yes, China 3C [ticker: CHCG] operates leased departments in places like Wal-Mart and Carrefour. It had 913 stores at the end of the first quarter. It turned its inventory 50 times 50 times in the first quarter. If a U.S. retailer turns its inventory five times, it's thrilled. The company should earn about 55 cents a share this year, probably 80 cents next year. The stock is at 6 1/2. And it's the leading electronics retailer in China -- a market that is growing very fast. I don't know what you pay for that kind of growth, but it should be more than 11 times earnings. The market cap is around $300 million. \b \u001d  Q: What else do you like? \u001d  A: China Security & Surveillance Technology [CSCT]. This company is the leading player in the surveillance business in China. It's rolling up the surveillance market. All of a sudden the government wants more surveillance in the country. There's a law that mandates surveillance at every nightclub, every Internet cafe and every bar. \u001d  More important, there is a new law requiring every reasonably sized city to install surveillance equipment on every street. Sales and earnings have been doubling every year. The company should make $1.05 a share this year and $1.50 in 2008. The stock is about 14. Citadel [the big hedge-fund operator] has invested $110 million in the company. It's got superb management. \b \u001d  Q: You mention earnings estimates. Whose projections are you using? \u001d  A: Mine. In some cases, there are no analysts covering these companies. \b \u001d  Q: Give us one more Chinese stock. \u001d  A: How about General Steel [GSHO]? It has a great story. The company was founded by some farmers as the first privately owned steel company in China. It scavenged equipment that was being thrown away by a local government steel mill. Deng Xiaoping came and blessed it. It recently announced joint ventures with two big Chinese steel companies. General Steel should make about 40 cents a share this year, and next year as these joint ventures start to hit, it should make $1.50, with over $2 the year after. The stock is at 3.75. Eventually mainline analysts are going to pick up coverage of these companies because they're real businesses with exciting growth stories. \b \u001d  Q: You've followed retailing your entire career. Where do you see opportunities now? \u001d  A: In retailing, most people look at the demand side. I always focus on the supply side. Look at casual-dining restaurant companies like P.F. Chang [PFCB], Cheesecake Factory [CAKE], Red Robin Gourmet [RRGB], Buffalo Wild Wings [BWLD] and California Pizza Kitchen [CPKI]. They're growing 15% to 40% per year and generally have P/E multiples of 20 to 30. By my calculation, based on the rate they are opening restaurants, Americans are going to have to eat 28 meals a week out of the house by 2011 to justify these multiples. So unless Americans are going to get very fat or very rich or their houses are going to burn down, that's unlikely to happen. \b \u001d  Q: What attracts you in retailing? \u001d  A: We like the areas where supply is either contracting or there's consolidation. We like the auto dealers a lot. People say auto sales are going to go down, but dealers make their money on service. The more complex cars get, the more people take their cars to the dealer. The other interesting thing that is going to happen is that General Motors [GM], Ford [F] and Cerberus, or whatever Chrysler is called these days, are going to have to reduce the number of dealers. Here are some interesting numbers on annual unit sales per dealer: Toyota, 1,800. Honda, 1,300. Lexus, 1,500. BMW, 800. Mercedes, 700. OK? GM, 300. Chrysler, 300. Ford, 380. The average Toyota dealer sells six cars for every car the average GM dealer sells. What that means is a lot of GM, Ford and Chrysler dealers are losing money. The major U.S. auto manufacturers have got to reduce the number of dealers. So if you're looking over the next five years, you could see the number of dealers contract by a reasonable amount. \b \u001d  Q: What stocks do you own? \u001d  A: We own a few of them. Sonic is at 29 and should earn about $2.87 next year. United Auto Group is run by Roger Penske, who is a genius. It has invested a huge amount of money in the dealerships, which has hurt returns. The stock is at 21. It should make $1.50 this year, $1.75 next year. It has a lot of dealerships internationally and it will be selling the Smart car next year. [This week the company is changing its name to Penske Automotive Group (PAG).] \b \u001d  Q: What else attracts you in retailing? \u001d  A: Another area where competition is going away, interestingly, is department stores. After Federated bought May, it has been Macyizing the company. \b \u001d  Q: That's what Federated is called now. \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b04e67867a79a5d1f5c664390fc17472","symR":["BONT","BWLD","CAKE","CHCG","CPKI","CSCT","F","GM","GSHO","PFCB","PTT","RICK","US3704421052"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) A Fresh Eye On China Stocks -- And -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:10:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BONT","BWLD","CAKE","CHCG","CPKI","CSCT","F","GM","GSHO","PFCB","PTT","RICK","US3704421052"],"IndustryCodes":["AUT","CON","CSE","ENT","ICS","RCS","RES","RTB","RTS","SVC","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\u001d  A: Yes, it's Macy's with a ticker M. A lot of the Federated stores have been turned into Macy's. From an operating standpoint, that's a smart decision. Everything is rebranded and everything is now homogenized. There are two problems with that. First, in Macyizing everything, management has left a significant vacuum at the high end. When you had the old Federated and May Co., there were always a few stores that had really upscale merchandise because they were in places like Beverly Hills. As Macy's has Macyized everything, it cut out that upscale business and Nordstrom [JWN] has picked it up. Macy's has left a void. \b \u001d  Q: Any other beneficiaries of the Macyizing? \u001d  A: Bon-Ton Stores [BONT]. Not many people have heard of Bon-Ton, but it's the anti-Macy's, because it has kept the local names on its department stores. Bon-Ton first merged with Elder-Beerman and then bought Saks' department-stores business. Bon-Ton has kept the local names and the local merchandising in each of its markets for stores like Younkers, Herberger's and Carson Pirie Scott. So while Macy's has turned Marshall Field's into Macy's, Bon-Ton has left Carson Pirie Scott alone. \b \u001d  Q: Isn't Bon-Ton like a public LBO? \u001d  A: Yes. It took on a billion dollars of debt to buy the Saks business. It's a highly leveraged company. But it's paying down the debt. Bon-Ton has tremendous operating leverage and very significant operating efficiencies. Bon-Ton should make $3.25 a share this year and $4.65 next year. The stock is around 40. We think Bon-Ton has $8 a share in earnings power looking out two or three years. \b \u001d  Q: How about the strip club business? What attracts you to it? \u001d  A: Let me say that I've never visited a gentlemen's club. It's not my idea of how to spend an evening. But I recognize a good business when I see it. \b \u001d  Q: We're not sure if we believe you about visiting the clubs, but go on. \u001d  A: First, they have 90% gross margins. If you go into a gentlemen's club, they charge you a cover and a lot of money for drinks. Secondly, the girls who work there, the dancers, or what the industry calls the \"talent,\" pay $150 to $200 a shift for the privilege of working. It's my kind of business where you charge both customers and employees to walk in the door. \b \u001d  Q: The dancers presumably make enough money in tips to offset the fee they pay? \u001d  A: They make money in tips. Or they can be like Anna Nicole Smith, who started out working at Rick's Cabaret. That's where she met Howard Marshall, the billionaire she married. I asked one guy in the business, \"What's the biggest risk to your business model?\" He said if the government stops immigration from Eastern Europe. These companies net 35% to 40% pre-tax, after all their expenses. There are huge barriers to entry. Why? Because most people don't want them in their neighborhoods. There are big zoning restrictions. These companies can make acquisitions at three to five times earnings. Why? Because there aren't a lot of buyers. The church isn't going to buy one. We may laugh about it, but flash back 20 or 30 years ago, and people might have reacted the same way to an investment in a casino company. Now the funds that won't buy an MGM Mirage are few and far between. \b \u001d  Q: How do you play this sector? \u001d  A: There are two public companies that we like a lot. One is VCG Holding, ticker PTT, and the other is Rick's Cabaret, ticker RICK. This is a real business, one that takes management, where you can develop a national brand and have VIP cards that you can use in city after city. And the two leading companies in the industry have just a 1% market share. \b \u001d  Q: Is the strategy at Rick's and VCG to roll up a fragmented industry at attractive prices? \u001d  A: Yes. When you mention this industry to people, their first reaction is to smile and then they say, \"Gee, I didn't even know there were public companies.\" These companies need capital to grow. That's the good news and the bad news. The cash flow is huge because this is a very profitable business. So the rate that they can grow depends on their access to the capital markets. Having said that, Rick's could earn 48 cents this year. It's on a September fiscal year. And it could make 85 cents next year. The stock is trading about $9.50 a share. \b \u001d  Q: How about VCG? \u001d  A: It should make 58 cents a share this year and 90 cents next year, and the stock is trading at about $8. Rick's has a very good brand name. VCG has a little deeper management team. Rick's has the Rick's brand and it also has the Club Onyx brand targeted at African-American men. PTT has a bunch of different brands. \b \u001d  Q: People might worry about mob influence after watching The Sopranos. Is that a problem? \u001d  A: No. What you really have to look at in this business is management. VCG's president, Michael Ocello, is on the school board of a town near St. Louis. When he ran for the school board, his opponent said, \"You run a strip club.\" Ocello still won. The reality is these are well-managed public companies that have to follow all the rules, and they've walked away from business that they thought was dicey. People used to ask about mob influence in the trash business. That didn't stop Waste Management from making it a real business. People used to worry about mob influence in  gambling. That didn't stop Steve Wynn from getting rich. When these companies come around to talk to investors, you get a lot of the hedge-fund managers who want to hear their story. \b \u001d  Q: Let's end it on that note.

Shaw \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  TAIPEI (Dow Jones)--The board of Taiwan's Union Insurance Co. (2816.TW) on Friday agreed to sell a 75% stake for NT$1.5 billion (US$45.8 million) to an investment fund led by Tsai Eng Meng, the chairman of Want Want Holdings Ltd. (W08.SG), the insurer said in a filing to the Taiwan Stock Exchange late Friday. \u001d  The company had hoped to sell a controlling stake to a consortium led by Newbridge Capital, but the private equity fund's final offer was less attractive than Tsai's, said Kenny Ching, Union Insurance's deputy spokesman. \u001d  The fund led by Tsai will buy 150 million of Union Insurance's newly issued shares through a private placement at NT$10 each, the insurer said.    The transaction will close by mid-August, when Tsai will have the right to appoint a management team and to decide whether there should be further fundraising, Ching said. \u001d  Union Insurance, Taiwan's fourth-largest non-life insurer by market, suffered losses last year mainly because of loan defaults by companies of the Rebar Group. Union Insurance is also part of the Rebar Group. \u001d  The property insurer posted a net loss of NT$2.79 billion last year, according to a filing to the Taiwan Stock Exchange. \u001d  Earlier this year, Union Insurance said it plans to issue up to 350 million new shares through a private placement and was targeting specific strategic investors. \u001d  The insurer in January signed a memorandum of understanding to sell around US$100 million worth of new shares to a consortium led by Newbridge Capital, a unit of Texas Pacific Group. Swiss Reinsurance Co. was also in the consortium, Ching said. \u001d  While the Newbridge Capital consortium offered to buy the stake at the same price, it also requires other financial terms which makes its offer less attractive, Ching said.

That was just below the Fed's unofficial comfort zone of 1% to 2% for the first time in three years. \u001d  The yield on ten-year Treasuries ended Friday at 4.87%, down from 5.13% the prior week, while two-year yields slid to 4.87% from 4.92%. Big Ben, the market seemed to be saying, you're on the clock. \u001d  The housing recession and the related subprime-mortgage mess have forced Bear Stearns to embark on a bailout that could cost as much as $3.2 billion for one of its two troubled hedge funds. The nervousness is so palpable that the high-flying, high-yield, new-issue market virtually shut down last week, as a $3.6 billion financing planned by two private-equity firms buying out U.S. Foodservice was given the thumbs down by junk-bond investors. \u001d  \"The real economy\" is more worried about the sinking housing sector than core inflation, according to John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's. As the year began (\"Conflicting Crystal Balls,\" Jan. 1), he correctly predicted that the Fed would keep rates steady in the first half, as it has since mid-2006, following 17 rate hikes in a row. As the table on this page shows, he's offering  the same forecast for the second half. However, he says,  \"The likelihood of a [rate] cut is greater than a hike, despite the Fed's focus on inflation.\" \u001d  Lonski's opinion on 2007 is shared by a majority -- seven out of 10 -- of our forecasters. Two participants see a 25-basis-point, or quarter-percentage-point, cut by year-end, while one expects a half-point reduction. Their outlooks for 10-year Treasury yields range from 4.80% to 5.50%. \u001d  That yield \"should be 50-to-75 basis points higher now,\" says Andrew Stenwall, head of Nuveen Investments' taxable fixed-income group, because there's still too much liquidity in the market. He sees \"no contagion\" in financial markets from the subprime mortgage debacle, \"minimal\" risk of a recession, and believes the Fed has only been able to keep rates steady because of the housing slump. \u001d  But Thomas di Galoma, head of U.S. Treasury trading at Jefferies & Co., says \"the Fed will have to get in front\" of a deteriorating housing sector at some point and cut rates twice, by a total of 50 basis points, by the end of the year. Kevin Giddis, managing director of fixed income at Morgan Keegan, foresees just one 25-basis-point cut later in 2007. The continuing decline in housing and the subprime-mortgage meltdown \"won't be swept under the rug,\" he says. \u001d  Yet Colin Lundgren, head of institutional fixed income at RiverSource Institutional Investors, believes \"the housing market is in the process of bottoming out.\" And the submerged subprime-mortgage sector is \"more of a portfolio event than an economic event\" that will remain contained. That's why he expects the Fed to continue to stay its hand. \u001d  Two of the group, including Jim McDonald, who manages money-market funds at T. Rowe Price, expects the Fed to stand pat for now but see a rate hike in 2008. \"If [the Fed] is concerned about inflation, so am I,\" he says. \u001d  All agree that low unemployment supports the Fed's current stance. So Friday's jobs report could potentially produce more fireworks than the Fourth of July. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: tom.sullivan@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b94f2ba7ce3702a1dad9d172a05171eb","symR":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"ABN Amro Asia CEO: Hope For Stake In China's Huishang Bank","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T10:19:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 06:19 ET (10:19 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bbd5cc75d84e9025f1209cdd00b99396","symR":["ADP","CRM","ORCL","US0530151036","US68389X1054"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) Plugged In: Salesforce Vs.

It was in response to my feature story (\"A Tough Sell,\" June 25) predicting that Oracle would announce a contract win against Salesforce (ticker: CRM) in on-demand customer-relationship management, or CRM, services. \u001d  In an e-mail, Benioff asked: \"Where's the beef? Where's the beachhead?\" referring to a quote in the story that claimed Oracle (ORCL) was preparing to go after Salesforce's biggest corporate customers. To emphasize -- which Benioff is wont to do -- the CEO e-mailed me a video link of the hamburger ad that spawned the now-famous phrase. That,  I admit, was a nice touch. \u001d  So here's the beef. During the earnings call, Oracle President Charles Phillips announced several deals for his company's latest software-as-a-service, Oracle On Demand. Phillips revealed \"key wins\" from Fidelity Investments, ConocoPhillips (COP), Motorola (MOT) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP). That last one is a Salesforce customer. \u001d  \"ADP? We have 8,000 users at ADP,\" Benioff crowed. \"How many does Oracle have? ADP has 50,000 employees. I am sure someone, somewhere at the company could have\" Oracle On Demand. \u001d  Oracle didn't disclose how many on-demand users it has, but the world's largest business-software company just relaunched its upgraded service in April. During the quarter, revenue recognized from On Demand was up 74% from the  year-earlier level. \"Bookings were even stronger,\" Phillips added. \u001d  So assume Oracle's beachhead is tiny. But it's the launching point for a possible war. And if Oracle's ability to sell its on-demand service to an existing Salesforce customer is so benign, why is Benioff worked into a lather? \u001d  \"Just saying ADP is a customer is not interesting,\" Benioff said. \"It has a huge Oracle implementation there. We want to know the details.\" \u001d  Adding insult to injury, not only is ADP using Oracle On Demand, the Illinois-based payment processor is expected to become a reseller of NetSuite, another provider of on-demand business applications. NetSuite offers the entire enterprise-resource planning platform -- such as accounting, manufacturing and supply-chain applications -- as a service over the Internet to small and medium-sized companies. \u001d  NetSuite isn't a direct competitor with Salesforce.com -- yet. But it is a privately held start-up that's majority-owned by Benioff's rival and former boss, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. The company is expected to file for an initial offering in the very near future -- perhaps as early as this week. It is anticipated to be one of the year's hottest IPOs. A NetSuite spokeswoman wouldn't comment on ADP or a potential  offering. \u001d  During the earnings call, Phillips went on to say that enterprise customers are finding that Oracle On Demand's Internet interface is \"comparable\" to that of Salesforce. The previous superiority of Salesforce's product is \"not going to drive deals anymore,\" Phillips asserted. \u001d  If he's right,  Salesforce's strategy of going after big corporate customers is going to meet some serious resistance -- especially in pricing. Oracle can bundle its On-Demand product with traditional CRM software. \u001d  Said Phillips: \"We're taking this very seriously, and we have momentum.\" \u001d  Care for some cheese on that burger, Mr. Benioff? \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"be59f96f040e7d1428397aa916a836c4","symR":["AAPL","PALM","RIM.T","RIMM","T","CA7609751028","US00206R1023","US0378331005"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) iPhone Will Draw Power From RIM, Palm Shares","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAPL","PALM","RIM.T","RIMM","T","CA7609751028","US00206R1023","US0378331005"],"IndustryCodes":["CMT","CPR","CTS","FTS","TLS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTT","XSTX","XTSE"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Tiernan Ray \u001d  The reviews are in, and Apple's first cellular phone, the iPhone, is being saluted as a groundbreaking consumer product with enormous commercial potential. \u001d  That could be great for Apple, but what's it mean for Research in Motion (ticker: RIMM), maker of the ubiquitous BlackBerry, and Palm (PALM), producer of the Treo smart phone, arguably the leaders in data-oriented wireless gadgets? \u001d  It means their stocks will likely struggle for awhile. \u001d  Whether or not the iPhone sells 10 million units by the end of 2008, as Apple Chief Exec Steve Jobs has forecast, the gadget has convinced some observers that consumers increasingly will use cellphones to browse the Web for information, listen to music and watch videos. \u001d  It won't be easy for Research in Motion and Palm to prove they can dominate this new landscape the way they have their existing markets for corporate wireless e-mail and personal organizers, respectively. \u001d  At the moment, both stocks seem priced for continued prosperity that may be elusive. Following last Thursday's consensus-busting quarterly earnings of $1.17 a share, RIM shares sport a multiple of 34.5 times its next four quarters' earnings, and Palm, despite its report of a 43% drop in quarterly net income, still trades at 30.8 times, ahead of the 21 average for Motorola (MOT), Nokia (NOK), Ericsson (ERIC) and Qualcomm (QCOM). \u001d  Those healthy valuations are based on their expected success selling BlackBerries and Treos to traditional customers, while the real challenge will be adapting to a future providing information and delivering multimedia experiences, areas where neither company has an established hold. \u001d  RIM's grip on the market for business users, with about 9.6 million subscribers, insulates it for now from Apple, whose phone is expected to appeal to retail consumers. \u001d  But RIM is already carrying the battle beyond its BlackBerry franchise by selling gadgets to the masses: Its most recent offerings, the Pearl and the Curve, have added cameras and music playback to RIM's forte of corporate e-mail. \u001d  Not everyone's convinced RIM can broaden its market. \u001d  \"The share price is assuming a significant success in the consumer market outside of mobile e-mail that we are still not seeing,\" says Richard Windsor, an analyst with Nomura Securities in London who has the lone Sell rating on RIM stock. \"Upside is still being driven by small and medium enterprises.\" \u001d  The shares' fair value is just $138, claims Windsor, based on discounted-cash-flow estimates and comparable price-to-earnings multiples. \u001d  RIM has yet to prove it can do well at the new things for which Apple is being praised. The Web browser is awful on the BlackBerry Pearl, in Windsor's opinion, while RIM's devices that emphasize music playback have yet to sell in large volumes outside the business market. \u001d  It's still possible that RIM will deliver the goods: The company has the best radio engineers in the world, according to Peter Misek, an analyst with Canaccord Adams. RIM, he says, has the opportunity to strike alliances with content providers that could give its music and video abilities a boost. \u001d  \"RIM is going to become a content platform,\" says Misek, who Friday raised his price target on the stock from $225 to $275. Multimedia can expand RIM's potential market from 100 million global mobile e-mail users to 400 million consumers of music- and video-enabled smart phones. \u001d  But that long-term potential presumes RIM does as well or better with multimedia than bigger phone makers. These companies -- principally Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson --  already are incorporating e-mail capabilities similar to RIM's. \u001d  It's not impossible for RIM to adapt, but its rich valuation leaves little room for error. \u001d  Shorting RIM stock during its 145% rise over the past 12 months was not a great idea. That's why Fred Hickey, editor of The High-Tech Strategist newsletter and Barron's Roundtable member, is buying puts on RIM: It's a cheaper way to play the downside as RIM wades into the unpredictable waters iPhone is charting. \u001d  Palm faces more serious challenges because its Treo line of phones has changed little in recent years even as Apple geared up to offer better e-mail and Web browsing, with music to boot. \u001d  How badly the company's products have stagnated was clear from the tepid response to its recent release of Foleo, a kind of small laptop computer. \u001d  And Palm's Treos are squarely in Apple's sights. \u001d  \"Palm appeals to more or less the same group as Apple --  young people in their 20s and 30s, and owners of small businesses,\" says Lawrence Harris, who follows Palm for Oppenheimer and rates its shares Market Perform. \u001d  AT&T (T) has been slashing the prices of the Treo 680 by as much as 50% in the past month, observes Harris. Not a good sign on the eve of AT&T rolling out Apple's iPhone. \u001d  Palm's lack of direction prompted a recapitalization last month by private-equity firm Elevation Partners, which is plowing in $325 million of cash and adding $400 million of debt. The recap means a sweet $9 a share dividend, which may be an opportunity for investors to consolidate some of Palm's 15% rise this year and head for the exits. \u001d  To be sure, RIM and Palm's loyal audiences make both companies contenders in wireless information consumption. But the rich multiples on their stocks presume they've got the future figured out. With reviewers touting the innovations of newcomer Apple, both companies may have to go back to the drawing board. Investors don't have to join them. \u001d  --- \u001d  A version of this story appeared June 28 on Barron's Online. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"c1a379b35681f4109595f19269d5fc27","symR":["0165.HK","AGBC.YY","CEVER.YY","HK0165000859"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"China Official:Former Bank Regulator Is Everbright Grp Chmn","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0165.HK","AGBC.YY","CEVER.YY","HK0165000859"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","FIS","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SHANGHAI (Dow Jones)--China has named a former banking regulator, Tang Shuangning, to be chairman of China Everbright Group, the parent of China Everbright Bank Co., a senior regulatory official said Saturday. \u001d  The appointment of the former vice chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission is a step toward the reorganization of the State Council-controlled conglomerate as China Everbright Bank awaits a capital injection from the government. \u001d  Jiang Dingzhi, vice chairman and deputy party secretary of the CBRC, also said that the reform of Agricultural Bank of China is still under study. \u001d  He said a government audit of Agricultural Bank of China's books is still ongoing.

Sears \u001d  As plump and pluckable as perfect fruit on a tree, Apple sits atop the options market, reflecting the adulation of millions for the new iPhone. \u001d  In optionsland, which expresses excitement and fear via implied volatility, Apple's calls are among the most richly priced, based on anticipation that the Apple (ticker: AAPL) iPhone will be to cellphones what the iPod was to music. Naturally, such optimism is being met with skepticism (For more on Apple, see story page 15). \u001d  \"If ever there was an opportunity to buy the rumor and sell the fact, this is it,\" one market-maker said. For the past week, in particular, institutional traders have sold Apple's calls just as surely as the market maker said individual investors \"gunned up\" Apple's options prices. \u001d  Indeed, Apple's implied volatility, along with financial stocks shaded by subprime-mortgage fears, is one of  the highest of all mega-cap stocks in the  options market; in the hardware and semiconductor sector, Apple's implied volatility is the highest. While many expect iPhone to catapult Apple's $120 stock into the stratosphere, institutional traders think the stock may actually stumble. \u001d  Of course, no one is really willing to actually bet against the iPhone. The stock is, after all, up about 44% year-to-date, 112% the past year, and 1,329% during the past five years, a difficult stretch for some institutional investors. Such investors are monetizing their view that everyone is too excited about the iPhone by selling richly-priced call options. This is the same type of elitist contrarian reasoning that traditionally paces trading, and often proves right. Volatility, like a rubber band, snaps when stretched too thin. \u001d  To wager against the iPhone crowd and not the iPhone, some traders are selling slightly out-of-the-money August calls and buying stock, which allows them to benefit from Apple's high implied volatility. Others traders are initiating \"call spreads\" to bet the stock trades in a range, or even declines, once the iPhone is released. Goldman Sachs, for example, advised clients to buy August 125 calls and sell August 135 calls. Apple's August expiration options capture the iPhone launch, and also Apple's July 25 earnings report, which should be another stock-moving event. \u001d  Some individual investors who own Apple stock, and are worried about preserving gains (many, perhaps, whose kids are excited about the iPhone) are buying puts, especially those with August expiration, as puts are as inexpensively priced as the calls are richly priced. \u001d  The ripple effect of the iPhone is also affecting trading in AT&T (T), iPhone's U.S. distributor. Bullish out-of-the-money call trading in July and August indicates some traders expect AT&T stock to rise. And bearish expectations are hurting Research in Motion (RIMM), which makes the Blackberry, and Palm (PALM), maker of the Treo (See related story, page 16). The iPhone could push RIMM and Palm lower, so selling some out-of-the-money calls, or buying puts, makes sense for those seeking to profit from the headline risk that will likely smack the stocks. \u001d  So the iPhone seems to offer something for everyone. The only question left to decide is if more investors take the call, or not. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: steven.sears@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e16b940a61356ebdad232297f384e006","symR":["BAC","MWB.LN","GB0000427459","US0605051046"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"MWB Appoints Bk Of America To Find Buyer For Hotels -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T11:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BAC","MWB.LN","GB0000427459","US0605051046"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","REA","RED","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Marylebone Warwick Balfour Group PLC (MWB.LN) has appointed advisers to sell its Malmaison and Hotel du Vin assets for more than GBP450 million, The Times said Saturday, citing Chief Executive Richard Balfour-Lynn. \u001d  After the sale of the assets to Vector Hospitality collapsed, MWB has appointed Bank of America Corp (BAC) to find a new buyer, Balfour-Lynn confirmed, according to the paper. \u001d  The hotels are expected to be acquired by a property investment firm on a sale and lease-back basis, with MWB continuing to manage them, the newspaper said. \b \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.timesonline.co.uk \b \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9413 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 07:03 ET (11:03 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"e343f7326531bbf4ddc58243d08e07e9","symR":["AA","AL","AL.T","BBY","GIS","K","KALU","MXM","CA0137161059","US0138171014","US0865161014"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(7/2) Speaking Of Dividends: Kaiser Cleans Up Its Act","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AA","AL","AL.T","BBY","GIS","K","KALU","MXM","CA0137161059","US0138171014","US0865161014"],"IndustryCodes":["ALU","FOD","OFP","OTS","RTS","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XTSE"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Shirley A. Lazo \u001d  Kaiser Aluminum re-emerged last July from four years under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. And on Wednesday, it flexed its financial muscles by reinstating its dividend. California-based Kaiser (ticker: KALU) will pay an initial quarterly of 18 cents a share Aug. 17 to investors on its books July 27. The stock goes ex-dividend July 25. \u001d  Declared CEO Jack A. Hockema, \"With confidence in our financial strength, Kaiser's board is comfortable introducing a dividend while continuing to pursue significant investments in initiatives for the long-term growth of the company.\" \u001d  Traded on Nasdaq, the shares went from a 52-week low last August of 36.50 to a 52-week high May 10 of 89.24. Reflecting an uninspiring first quarter, they now change hands in the mid-70s. Kaiser was added to the Russell 2000 last week. \u001d  Once a far-flung enterprise of mining, refining and smelting operations, the company now has just 11 plants in North America, and one minority-owned smelter in the United Kingdom. With annual sales of $1.36 billion, it makes fabricated aluminum products, primarily for the aerospace, industrial and transportation markets. Maxxam (MXM), whose businesses include forest products, real estate and horse-racing, owns close to two-thirds of Kaiser's 20.6 million common shares. \u001d  Kaiser's Chapter 11 miseries resulted from the economic slowdown earlier this decade, weak aluminum prices and asbestos litigation. But with the aerospace, defense and general-engineering markets currently strong, it has ongoing contracts with companies like Boeing, Airbus and Lockheed Martin. \"We're very optimistic that this cycle has good legs to it and will extend out for a few years,\" said Hockema. Accordingly, it's investing $139 million to double capacity at its mainstay Trentwood rolling mill near Spokane, Wash. \u001d  Kaiser could figure in the proposed purchase of Canada's Alcan (AL) by Alcoa (AA), if Alcoa has to shed some assets to win regulatory approval. \"We have a lot of dry powder,\" Hockema said. \"We see ourselves as well-positioned to be a buyer of assets that are attractive for our portfolio.\" \u001d  For the sixth time in three years, General Mills (GIS) is again sweetening its quarterly common dividend, to 39 cents a share from 37 cents. Investors of record July 10 will receive the new payout Aug. 1. Ex-date: July 6. Yield: 2.66%. \u001d  Including predecessors, the Minneapolis company has paid dividends without interruption or reduction since 1898. The Big Board-listed shares set a 52-week high of 61.52 on June 4, and trade just a few notches below that level currently. \u001d  Archrival Kellogg (K), trading near 52, pays a 31-cent quarterly and yields 2.40%. \u001d  A Big-G brand sampling includes Cheerios and Wheaties cereals; Gold Medal flour; Betty Crocker and Bisquick baking mixes; and Green Giant vegetables. Its 2001 acquisition of Pillsbury doubled its size. Grain costs have soared as demand for the alternative fuel ethanol, made from corn, grows -- so farmers have shifted to planting more corn at the expense of oats. \u001d  For its fiscal '07 year, ended May 31, General Mills earned $1.14 billion, or $3.18 a share, up from fiscal '06's $1.09 billion, or $2.90. Revenue rose 6%, to $12.44 billion. The company expects fiscal '08 profits to advance 7% to 8%, or to $3.39 to $3.43 a share. \u001d  The biggest U.S. consumer-electronics outfit, Best Buy, Wednesday announced a $5.5 billion stock buyback, representing one-fourth of its market value. With  $2.8 billion in cash, it also boosted its quarterly common dividend  30%, to 13 cents a share from a dime. The respective payment and record dates are Oct. 30 and Oct. 9; the ex-dividend date is Oct. 4. The Minnesota company paid its first dividend in 2003 and has enhanced it annually. \u001d  The shares (BBY) change hands in the mid-40s on the Big Board and now yield 1.11%. Standard & Poor's rates Best Buy a Strong Buy. The big retailer's 52-week high and low are 58.49 and 43.51. \u001d  Best Buy also increased its planned store count in the U.S. and Canada by 400 outlets, for a target of 1,800. The company also says it remains committed to expansion in China. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 30, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"e5027b3cd8164aea0455ce809d8a6e39","symR":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"date":"2007-06-30","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"INTERVIEW: ABN Amro Hopes For Stake In China's Huishang Bank","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-30T10:53:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["30110.AE","ABN","BARC.LN","BCS","RBS.LN","GB0007547838","GB0031348658","NL0000301109"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","FIS","XAEX","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XFT1","XGTI","XNYA","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  SHANGHAI (Dow Jones)--Dutch bank ABN Amro Holding NV (ABN) hopes to take a strategic stake in Chinese regional lender Huishang Bank Co. and rapidly expand its own China network, ABN Amro Asia's chief executive said Saturday. \u001d  \"We would be interested in starting a strategic relationship with Huishang Bank under terms and conditions that are acceptable on both sides,\" Jeroen Drost, chief executive of ABN Amro Asia told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. \"That would be something we are very interested in.\" \u001d  He said ABN Amro isn't targeting a specific stake size, but rather a mutually beneficial strategic partnership. \u001d  Huishang Bank was formed in late 2005 from the merger of Hefei City Commercial Bank and several smaller credit cooperatives in Anhui Province.
