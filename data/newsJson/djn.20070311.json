(TSX: SYN) today released financial results and operating highlights for the year ended December 31, 2006. \b \bSynenco reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $3.9 million ($0.07 per diluted share) compared to a net loss of $5.9 million ($0.22 per share) in 2005. Net income was higher in 2006 as a result of increased interest income due to the larger cash investment balance maintained throughout the year. The higher 2006 interest income was partially offset by increased office and corporate costs related to Synenco's corporate build-out activity. \b \bMost costs incurred relate to the Northern Lights Partnership (NLP) project development activities and are capitalized. As a development stage entity, Synenco expects it will report net losses in most periods until project development activities are complete and operations commence. \b \bSynenco also reported consolidated capital expenditures of $109.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The consolidated capital expenditures include amounts incurred by the Northern Lights Partnership, in which Synenco's equity participation is 60%. Synenco's net ownership interest in consolidated capital expenditures was $71.1 million. Capital expenditures in the year are mainly comprised of drilling activities, engineering-related activities, technology-licensing costs, work on the Environmental Impact Assessments to support the regulatory applications for the Northern Lights project and capitalized corporate and personnel costs. \b \bCash expenditures in 2006 amounted to $78 million compared to the announced 2006 budget of $118 million, in both cases net to Synenco's ownership interest in NLP. At the end of 2006, Synenco's consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $406.8 million including NLP funds. Synenco's share of the total consolidated cash and cash equivalents available to meet its future obligations was $342.7 million. Synenco also reported positive consolidated working capital of $386.4 million at December 31, 2006. Synenco's share of total consolidated working capital available at December 31, 2006 was $329.3 million. \b \bA summary of Synenco's consolidated financial results as at and for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 is included below: \b \b \b    << \b    Selected Financial Information \b    (In thousands except per share data) \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    For the years ended December 31,                      2006          2005 \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    Interest income                                     16,503         3,324 \b    Personnel costs, net of amounts capitalized          4,454         4,401 \b    Stock-based compensation                             1,338         1,714 \b    Financing costs                                          -           817 \b    Office, corporate and other costs                    6,469         3,045 \b    Income tax expense (recovery)                          342          (781) \b    Net income (loss)                                    3,900        (5,872) \b    Net income (loss) per share \b      Basic                                               0.08         (0.22) \b      Diluted                                             0.07         (0.22) \b    Total assets                                       670,346       577,986 \b    Shareholders' equity                               439,437       424,843 \b    Common shares outstanding                           50,251        48,013 \b    ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \b    >> \b \b \b2006 operating highlights \b \bIn the fourth quarter, the company received updated independent resource estimates for the Northern Lights oil sands leases; that reflected an increase in the best estimate of discovered resource of 12 percent to 1.673 billion barrels (Synenco share 60 percent). \b \bDuring 2006, engineering and development work advanced in respect of both upstream and downstream. \b \b \b    << \b    -   In December, Synenco announced an updated capital cost estimate and \b        its overseas construction strategy for Northern Lights upstream \b        (mining and extraction). The capital cost was estimated in 2006 \b        dollars at $4.4 billion (Synenco share: $2.6 billion) in relation to \b        production of 114,500 barrels per day of bitumen for 30 years. The \b        capital cost estimate reflects anticipated savings from the announced \b        construction strategy of $1.2 billion (Synenco share: $0.7 billion). \b        Synenco announced that new downstream guidance would be available in \b        2007. \b \b    -   In November, Synenco completed the sequenced filing with the Alberta \b        Energy and Utilities Board and Alberta Environment for the upstream \b        regulatory application, which included the final environmental \b        effects assessments on behalf of NLP. On January 10, 2007, Alberta \b        Environment advised that the application was deemed administratively \b        complete. \b \b    -   In September, Synenco Energy filed an application with the Alberta \b        Energy and Utilities Board and Alberta Environment to construct and \b        operate an upgrader in Sturgeon County, Alberta on behalf of NLP. On \b        October 12, 2006, Alberta Environment advised that the application \b        was deemed administratively complete. \b \b    -   In August, Synenco Energy announced the conversion of NLP's northern \b        permit to a primary oil sands lease with a 15-year term. \b \b    -   In July, Synenco Energy signed a Memorandum of Understanding with \b        Agrium for the supply of hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur and carbon \b        dioxide from the upgrader to Agrium's neighbouring Redwater nitrogen \b        fertilizer operations on behalf of NLP. \b \b    -   In July, Synenco Energy signed two significant technology licensing \b        agreements on behalf of NLP: \b \b        -  An agreement with UOP Management Services Inc. to use its \b           Unicracking(TM) and RCD Unionfining(TM) technologies. Using these \b           technologies, the Northern Lights upgrader will be able to produce \b           a high quality synthetic crude oil or a lighter diluent product \b           for use in the transportation of bitumen. \b \b        -  An agreement with Kellogg Brown & Root International Inc. to use \b           its ROSE(TM) solvent de-asphalting technology that removes \b           asphaltenes from bitumen during the upgrading process. In the \b           Northern Lights configuration, the asphaltenes will be converted \b           to hydrogen in a separately licensed gasification process. \b \b    -   In June, Synenco Energy announced a licensing agreement with \b        GE Energy to use GE's gasification technology with the NLP upgrader. \b        The gasification of asphaltenes uses materials that would otherwise \b        be a waste product (requiring on-site storage and disposal) and is \b        anticipated to reduce the downstream project's reliance on external \b        energy purchases. \b \b    -   Also in June, Synenco Energy filed on behalf of NLP the first portion \b        of the sequenced upstream regulatory application with the Alberta \b        Energy and Utilities Board and Alberta Environment. \b \b    -   Earlier in June, Synenco Energy announced that NLP had retained \b        Citibank as the partnership's debt capitalization advisor to explore \b        global sources of project financing, evaluate various structures and \b        plan for debt capitalization that properly leverage both partners' \b        equity. \b \b    -   In May, Synenco announced the signing of a contract with \b        Jacobs Canada Inc. for NLP engineering services for the upgrader. \b \b    -   In April, Synenco announced an agreement with the joint venture of \b        Colt Engineering Corporation and AMEC Americas Limited for \b        engineering services related to NLP bitumen production. Under this \b        contract, Colt and AMEC developed the overall diagrams and plans \b        related to the bitumen extraction and froth treatment components of \b        the upstream project. \b \b    -   In March, Synenco announced contracts with: Jacobs Canada Inc. to \b        provide owner's engineering services; UMA Engineering Ltd. to provide \b        owner's engineering for on-lease and off-lease infrastructure; UMA to \b        complete the infrastructure DBM for the Northern Lights project; and \b        the consortium of UMA and Black & Veatch Canada Company, in respect \b        of the utilities and offsites DBM work. \b    >> \b \b \bAbout Synenco Energy \b \bSynenco Energy is a Calgary-based oil sands company, which, with a 60-percent interest, is the managing partner of the Northern Lights Partnership and operator of the Northern Lights project. (SinoCanada Petroleum Corporation, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of China-based Sinopec, owns the remaining 40% of the partnership and project.) Synenco Energy also holds a 100-percent interest in the McClelland oil sands lease adjacent to the Northern Lights project lands. Visit Synenco's Web site at www.synenco.com. \b \bAbout Northern Lights \b \bThe Northern Lights project consists of a planned oil sands mining and bitumen extraction project about 100 kilometres northeast of Fort McMurray, Alberta, and a planned heavy oil upgrader project in Sturgeon County near Edmonton. The project is designed to produce 100,000 barrels per day of synthetic crude oil for an estimated 30 years. Separate regulatory applications for each segment of the project were filed with the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and Alberta Environment during 2006. The Northern Lights Partnership also holds extensive coal lease applications in the Athabasca region in northeastern Alberta. \b \bConference call \b \bSynenco Energy will host a conference call to discuss 2006 results and provide a brief corporate update. \b \b \b    << \b    Date:     March 12, 2007 \b    Time:     9:00 a.m. Mountain (11:00 a.m. Eastern) Note: Daylight savings \b              time begins March 11. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 10:13 ET (14:13 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"0863ab582f1c835cbdce9e8cb9d8a487","symR":["UU","UU.LN","GB0006462336"],"date":"2007-03-11","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for United Utilities plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-11T09:32:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["UU","UU.LN","GB0006462336"],"IndustryCodes":["WAT","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  United Utilities plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0006462336 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 05:32 ET (09:32 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"08678dc1851b7e460775e59573763da6","symR":["WOS","WOS.LN","GB0009764027"],"date":"2007-03-11","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Wolseley plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-11T09:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WOS","WOS.LN","GB0009764027"],"IndustryCodes":["DIB","SVC","XDJGI","XFT1","XNYA"],"Story":"\u001d  Wolseley plc: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=WOS or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 05:58 ET (09:58 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"08779759933b2127b7b957228d4a795e","symR":["3962.FR","FR0000039620"],"date":"2007-03-11","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for Carbone Lorraine Corp.

Of THE ASSOCIATED PRESS \u001d  MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP)--A political scandal involving Colombian President Alvaro Uribe is making it difficult for President George W. Bush to convince the U.S. Congress that one of his best friends in Latin America is worthy of getting the largest slice of U.S. aid to the region. \u001d  Three days before Bush's visit Sunday, Uribe pleaded with the U.S. to continue a $700 million annual aid package that he says has helped stem the violence, corruption and drug trafficking that finance anti-government guerrillas. \u001d  \"I ask the world, I ask the United States, to support us. We haven't yet won but we are winning. And we will persist,\" Uribe told The Associated Press. \u001d  Democrats in the U.S., who control the Congress, are wondering how well the mostly military aid to Colombia is working. Some want more of the money to go to social programs, or suggest it might be better spent to help the nation strengthen its own team of prosecutors. \u001d  Over the past seven years, the U.S. has sent $4 billion to Colombia to combat the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The 15,000-strong peasant army, backed with drug profits, is on the U.S. list of terrorist groups. \u001d  \"I look forward to telling President Uribe that he can count on the United States defending that which we sent up to Congress,\" Bush told foreign journalists before beginning a five-country tour of Latin America. \u001d  Lawmakers also are following developments in the political scandal in which eight of Uribe's close allies in Colombia's Congress and his hand-picked former domestic intelligence chief have been jailed recently for allegedly colluding with paramilitary groups. \u001d  \"President Uribe has made it very clear that he is going to - he promotes and expects there to be a full investigation of any allegations,\" Bush said. \u001d  Bush said Uribe's pledge to fully prosecute wrongdoing shows he is a strong leader. \u001d  \"I believe that that leadership will stand him in good stead with our Congress,\" Bush said. \u001d  Bush is less confident about a pending trade deal with Colombia that still needs lawmakers' approval. \u001d  \"These are tough votes,\" he said. \u001d  Presidents have visited Colombia in recent years, but this will be the first time a U.S. president has stepped foot in the capital since President Reagan came in 1982. About 20,000 police and heavily armed troops will virtually shut off downtown Bogota to guard against a possible rebel attack. \u001d  On another issue of importance to both leaders, the U.S. embassy confirmed Saturday that U.S. and Colombian soldiers had conducted a joint operation in the southern stronghold of leftist rebels who are holding three U.S. military contractors. \u001d  The confirmation followed a report in Colombia's largest newspaper, citing unidentified sources, that two local residents had been detained in the late January operation and interrogated about the contractors' whereabouts. \u001d  \"U.S. personnel accompanied Colombian forces in the south and that's all I can say about it,\" said U.S. Embassy spokesman Marshall Louis. \u001d  The three employees of Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC), a large U.S. defense contractor, were captured by FARC in February 2003 when their surveillance plane went down. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 05:04 ET (09:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"0d09b9c9bc6cec58dbbe565db3b654c2","symR":["6758.TO","BRT.YY","EMI.LN","EMIPY","SNE","WMG","GB0000444736","JP3435000009"],"date":"2007-03-11","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Warner Music To Sweeten EMI Offer, Sources Say - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-11T13:11:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["6758.TO","BRT.YY","EMI.LN","EMIPY","SNE","WMG","GB0000444736","JP3435000009"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","CSE","ENT","MED","MOV","PUB","X225","XATI","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Warner Music Group (WMG) Chairman Edgar Bronfman is ready to return with another bid for EMI Group PLC (EMI.LN), The Observer newspaper reports Sunday, citing Wall Street sources. \u001d  The newspaper said Bronfman is prepared to sweeten his offer for the U.K. music company but has to at least get the nod from EMI that a deal is possible. \u001d  A spokesman for Warner Music Group declined to comment. \u001d  On March 2 EMI said it had received and rejected a non-binding proposal from Warner Music Group at 260 pence a share. \u001d  It said the proposal \"wasn't in the best interest of its shareholders and undervalues the company,\" and would lead to prolonged regulatory uncertainty and unacceptable operational risk at a critical time for the company. \u001d  The two companies previously had been in discussions last summer, but bid talks ended abruptly when a European Union court overturned clearance to another record company merger between parts of Sony Corp.

\b   (This story first ran Friday) \b \b \b   By Rachel Pannett and Susan Murdoch \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Warehouse Group Ltd. (WHS.NZ) chief executive Ian Morrice Friday said the discount retailer may be interested in acquiring some of the assets of Australia's Coles Group Ltd. (CGJ.AU). \u001d  The move could see New Zealand's largest listed retailer reenter a market it quit in difficult circumstances in November 2005 following the sale of its loss-making Warehouse Australia division. \u001d  Morrice told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview that Warehouse is interested in Coles' Target discount department stores and Officeworks, a network of business supply stores. Both are potentially up for sale as part of an impending A$18.6 billion-plus (US$14.5 billion) breakup of Australia's second largest retailer. \u001d  \"We would certainly be interested in Australia again for the right business,\" Morrice said. \"We'll obviously wait and see what develops and see whether or not a bid is viable and a timely move to make,\" he said. \u001d   Warehouse has the balance sheet strength to bid for the businesses, Morrice said, noting that a bid of more than NZ$1 billion \"wouldn't be a big challenge\". \u001d  \"We think there are a couple of businesses within Coles that are very complementary to the Warehouse setup in New Zealand,\" he said, tagging Target and Officeworks as strong businesses with great management. \u001d  Investment bank UBS has valued Target at A$3.9 billion, Officeworks at A$1.4 billion and Coles' discount department store Kmart at A$933 million. \u001d  Morrice's comments come at a time when Warehouse is itself in play, with rival supermarkets Australia-based Woolworths Ltd. (WOW.AU) and privately-owned Foodstuffs Ltd. seeking regulatory approval to mount bids. \u001d  They took defensive 10% stakes in Warehouse last year in response to its fledgling move into perishable groceries, with the New Zealand Commerce Commission to rule on the matter later this month. \u001d  \"The appeal of Warehouse is the unique sites, 85 stores throughout New Zealand, unmatched in New Zealand and unable to be replicated through greenfields rollout,\" said Macquarie analyst Warren Doak. \u001d  Woolworths is also considered likely to be interested in Target, although it has declined comment. Australia-based furniture and electrical retailer Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd. (HVN.AU) has said it may look at buying Officeworks. \u001d  \"Both those two businesses will be subject to an enormous amount of competition,\" said another analyst at major brokerage who declined to be named. \u001d  \"There's speculation mid-tier private equity firms are very interested. There's a lot people with very deep pockets across the board.\" \u001d  Coles has said it expects the sale process to take three to six months. \u001d  One or two private equity consortiums, variously including global buyout giants such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, Carlyle Group, Texas Pacific Group and Europe's Permira are expected to lodge bids for Coles. \u001d  A A$15.25 a share offer from a KKR-led consortium in late 2006 was rejected by Coles as inadequate and not put to shareholders. Coles shares ended Friday trade at A$15.72, valuing the company at about A$18.8 billion, while Warehouse shares gained 1.2%, spurred by the possible interest in Coles assets. \u001d  Warehouse appears to have put problems arising from its Australian foray behind it, Friday reporting an interim net profit of NZ$61 million compared with a NZ$7.96 million loss a year earlier. \b \u001d  -By Rachel

Jones)--Alliance Boots PLC's (AB.LN) board is to meet as soon as is practicable to discuss a potential 1000 pence a share offer, a spokesman said Sunday. \u001d  Several U.K. newspapers said the board would meet Sunday or Monday to decide whether the company will open its books to private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Alliance Boots Executive Deputy Chairman Stefano Pessina, who Friday said they had made a friendly takeover approach valuing Alliance Boots at GBP9.67 billion. \u001d  The Sunday Telegraph and the Sunday Express, citing unnamed people close to the company, say the board is likely to support the potential bid but may hold out for a higher price. \u001d  \"The board hasn't met yet, so any views on what they've decided is pure speculation, the Alliance Boots spokesman said. \u001d  He added board members would follow best corporate governance practices by not discussing the bid with each other or with involved parties such as Pessina or KKR executives. \u001d  Meanwhile, The Observer says at least one fund manager has contacted U.K. markets watchdog the Financial Services Authority about his concerns on a jump in Alliance Boots' share price before the company's statement Friday. \u001d  Shares in the company had risen sharply earlier in Friday's session, but analysts and traders had at the time dismissed the rise as purely due to \"Friday talk\". \u001d  Following the company's announcement, the shares closed Friday up 14%, or 115 pence, at 930 pence. \u001d  Last week, the FSA said it had found there was possible insider trading before one-quarter of takeover announcements in 2005. \u001d  Company Web site: http://www.allianceboots.com \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.telegraph.co.uk \u001d  Newspaper Web site:

(C) and Taiwan's Bank of Overseas Chinese (5818.OT) have postponed an announcement on an acquisition worth around NT$14 billion originally scheduled for Monday, a person familiar with the situation said late Sunday. \u001d  The postponement comes as New York Life Insurance Co. (NYI.XX) has requested to negotiate with Citigroup terms of a 10-year agreement it signed with the Taiwanese lender in 2005, the person said, who asked not to be named. \u001d  Under that agreement, New York Life bought a 4.5% stake in Bank of Overseas Chinese. In return, the bank will only sell insurance policies from New York Life. \u001d  The person wouldn't elaborate details of New York Life's request. \u001d  Citigroup and New York Life are expected to sort out the issue by Wednesday, the person added. \u001d  Citigroup's Taiwan manager Morris Li, Bank of Overseas Chinese Spokesman Weng Chien and New York Life officials were unavailable for comments late Sunday. \u001d  Because of the announcement's postponement, Bank of Overseas Chinese and Polaris Securities Co.

\u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--BMI British Midland Airways Ltd. is considering legal action if the U.K. government votes against the proposed 'open skies' deal between Europe and the U.S., The Observer newspaper reports Sunday. \u001d  It quoted Michael Bishop, BMI's chairman, saying BMI has considered its legal position, though \"it is not something we are making much of at the moment.\" \u001d  The U.S. and European Union two weeks ago announced a draft deal to free up air travel across the Atlantic, allowing each other's airlines to fly from any city in Europe to any city in U.S. and vice versa. \u001d  The deal would particularly benefit BMI since it would be able to start services from London's Heathrow airport to U.S. cities currently controlled by four airlines - British Airways PLC (BAB), Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines (AMR) and United Airlines (UAL). \u001d  The U.K. hasn't said whether or not it will try to veto the deal but U.K. Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander this week said the deal \"falls short\" in its scope and more work needs to be done before it could be approved. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.observer.co.uk \b \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow

ASIA) \b   By Phred Dvorak \u001d  WHEN Ray O'Connor was hired as marketing director for the U.S. unit of Japan's Topcon Corp. in 1993, his friends predicted disaster. \u001d  Japanese companies were notoriously slow to trust local managers and reluctant to adopt their ideas. Topcon, a maker of surveying and medical equipment affiliated with Japan's Toshiba Corp., was so traditional that U.S. workers warned Mr. O'Connor not to go home without saying goodnight to the boss. \u001d  Fourteen years later, Mr. O'Connor is still at Topcon. He now runs Topcon's biggest U.S. unit, which accounts for roughly one-quarter of Topcon's global revenue and half its profit. Last year, Topcon put him in charge of much of its European and Australian businesses as well. \u001d  The secret to his success: perseverance and working with the home culture. Mr. O'Connor wooed managers and engineers in Japan. He spent nine months re-engineering an acquisition after his Japanese boss initially balked. He didn't lobby for promotions, working for two years under a manager sent from Tokyo, then another six years as co-president of the U.S. business before getting the full title. \u001d  \"It was a step-by-step process,\" says the 44-year-old Mr. O'Connor. \"Some people don't have the patience for that.\" \u001d  Mr. O'Connor's story shows how local managers for foreign companies often must adapt to succeed. They need to win the trust of distant bosses who may be out of touch with local markets. And they must strike a balance between effective local leadership and sensitivity to corporate custom. \u001d  That can be especially challenging for companies based in countries -- such as Japan or South Korea -- with strong unspoken business traditions, says Bruce McKern, a professor in international business at Stanford Graduate School of Business. \"If the local manager isn't connected to the network of the company, it can be crippling,\" Mr. McKern says. \u001d  Consider Howard Stringer. The American-Welsh Sony Corp. executive won points with his Japanese bosses while running operations in the U.S., with deference to Tokyo customs and an easy-going attitude on pay and promotions. When he took over the CEO job in 2005, he moved carefully in Japan, waiting until late last year to gently shuffle top management. \u001d  Mr. McKern says local managers in foreign multinationals can help close the gap between themselves and headquarters by learning the language of the home country or spending time there. Any overseas experience can help managers understand how to navigate different cultures, he says. \u001d  Mr. O'Connor, an Irish civil engineer, joined Topcon after nine years at a U.S. maker of laser-guidance tools used on construction sites. At the time, Topcon's U.S. operation merely sold products made in Tokyo, and all of Topcon's overseas units were run by Japanese. But the company wanted to expand its optical-surveying tools into lasers and construction and hired Mr. O'Connor to help. \u001d  Mr. O'Connor quickly realized that he would need support from Japanese managers, and shuttled back and forth almost every month to pitch his ideas and explain the American market. He wooed product developers in Tokyo, letting them take credit for tweaks he'd suggested. He earned points early on when he refused to criticize Japanese engineers who couldn't make a prototype laser work for an important U.S. trade show. \u001d  \"I was really moved by that,\" says Satoshi \"Steve\" Hirano, the manager in charge of the laser, now a deputy division chief. \"I went back to Japan and told everyone that Ray could be trusted.\" \u001d  Mr. O'Connor's tactics paid off. In 1994, Mr. Hirano and another manager, Norio Uchida, backed Mr. O'Connor's plan to buy a California company that made software to automate control of construction equipment and invest heavily in developing new products. \u001d  Yukinari \"Bob\" Iguchi, the Japanese executive running Topcon's U.S. operations, was skeptical: Topcon had never done an acquisition that wasn't proposed by headquarters, and its engineers knew little about software. Mr. Iguchi balked, and Mr. O'Connor spent months persuading him to put the deal back together. When it was done, Mr. Uchida was assigned to run the acquired company. Mr. Iguchi says Japanese corporate custom didn't permit him to put a newcomer like Mr. O'Connor atop a unit. \u001d  Mr. O'Connor says he was happy to work under Mr. Uchida, and was more concerned about getting the new business started. \u001d  The new company lost money for four straight years. Messrs. Hirano and Uchida defended the business in Tokyo. Mr. Uchida says he was comforted because Mr. O'Connor always made his sales targets, and didn't complain about pay or push for a promotion -- even when Mr. Hirano was later sent from Tokyo to run the U.S. company as co-president. The unit began making money in 1998. \u001d  In 2000, Messrs. Hirano and Uchida backed Mr. O'Connor in another bid: a big, risky investment in a company that used satellites to determine an object's position. Mr. O'Connor wanted to use the technology to guide Topcon's surveying equipment, as well as construction machinery like bulldozers. But the $30 million price tag was more than Topcon had ever spent on an acquisition, and Topcon itself was losing money. \u001d  Again, Mr. Iguchi got cold feet, calling Mr. O'Connor to postpone negotiations the night before Mr. O'Connor was to leave for Tokyo. Mr. Iguchi says he wanted more time to persuade other board members to support the deal. Mr. O'Connor persuaded Mr. Iguchi to move ahead. Then the deal was nearly derailed by a breach of Japanese etiquette. Mr. O'Connor had given the CEO of the company Topcon was acquiring a $750 box of cigars. \u001d  Mr. Iguchi says he had intended to present the cigars himself, but that the incident \"wasn't so serious.\" In the end, the deal remained so controversial internally that Topcon's then-CEO refused to sign the papers. \u001d  These days, Topcon's Japanese executives are themselves adapting, as Mr. O'Connor's unit -- and overseas markets -- grow in importance. In the fiscal year ended Mar. 31, 2006, 65% of Topcon's roughly $870 million in revenue came from outside of Japan, up from 53% five years earlier. Topcon Positioning Systems, the U.S. unit that Mr. O'Connor was named to run in 2002, accounted for about half of Topcon's roughly $58 million in annual net income. \u001d  Last year, Mr. O'Connor was put in charge of world-wide sales and marketing for the positioning division. Topcon CEO Takashi Yokokura says that Topcon's medical-equipment division is considering copying the positioning unit's techniques, such as a more aggressive acquisition strategy and global technology and marketing meetings. Managers in the medical division are saying, \"'We want Ray O'Connor,'\" Mr. Yokokura says. \u001d  Mr. Uchida, now a Topcon director, says that Topcon Positioning Systems' latest acquisition in September -- of an Australian maker of equipment-control software -- was approved by Topcon's board in record time: one hour. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 17:30 ET (21:30

March 1, 2007, Precision Assessment Technology Corporation (\"Precision\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:PDT) has entered into a letter agreement with Bison Capital Equity Partners II, L.P., a private equity fund based in Los Angeles, California (\"Bison\"), with respect to a US$12 million equity investment in Precision. \b \bThe proceeds of the financing will be used to fund two acquisitions, to pay down existing debt and for general working capital and, when completed, will add to Precision's management depth. The financing is subject to fulfillment of various conditions, including formal documentation and receipt of approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\"). \b \bThe initial investment by Bison will involve the purchase by Bison of 8,000 shares of exchangeable preferred stock (\"Preferred Stock\") of a wholly-owned US subsidiary of Precision (\"Precision US\") for a subscription price of US$1,000 per share. The share provisions attaching to the Preferred Stock will contain certain restrictions, including restrictions on indebtedness, minimum EBITDA requirements, asset sales, acquisitions, capital expenditures and dividends. The Preferred Stock will bear a cumulative dividend of 10% per annum if paid in cash or common shares of Precision (\"PATC Shares\") and 12% per annum in the event such dividends accumulate and are not paid (subject to adjustment in the event Precision US is in default of certain covenants), and holders will be entitled to receive an extraordinary dividend on the fifth anniversary (the amount of which shall be dependent upon the number of shares of Preferred Stock redeemed by Precision US prior to the fifth anniversary). Any Preferred Stock not redeemed by Precision US by the fifth anniversary date will be exchanged by the holder for PATC Shares on the basis of 4,348 PATC Shares for each one share of Preferred Stock (the \"Exchange Ratio\"), subject to adjustment prior to closing based on financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006, with any accrued and unpaid dividends paid in cash at the time of exchange. The Exchange Ratio is also subject to standard anti-dilution provisions. The initial investment may result in the issue of up to 34,784,000 PATC Shares. Precision US has the right to repurchase up to 4,000 shares of Preferred Stock (\"Clean-up Right\"), which, if exercised, will reduce the number of PATC Shares issuable to 17,392,000. \b \bThe second investment by Bison will consist of the purchase by Bison of up to 21,703,743 PATC Shares, subject to adjustment prior to closing based on financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006, for a purchase price of approximately C$0.22 (US$.1843) per PATC Share for aggregate subscription proceeds of US$4,000,000. \b \bThe completion of each of the initial investment by Bison is subject to numerous conditions, including the concurrent completion of the proposed acquisition of BC2 Environmental Corp., a southern California drilling company, and the second investment is subject to the condition that either the eastern United States drilling services company referenced in Precision's March 1, 2007 news release (or an alternative) be completed. The proposed acquisitions also contemplate, subject to regulatory approval, the issuance of up to 4,006,500 PATC Shares as partial purchase price and, if applicable, earn-out consideration. The equity financing and the acquisitions are also subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals, including approval by the TSX. \b \bPrecision currently has 77,446,107 PATC Shares issued and outstanding on a non-diluted basis (83,406,614 on a fully diluted basis). If the Clean-up Right is exercised, the equity financing and the acquisitions may result in the issue of up to an additional 43,102,243 PATC Shares (representing 34.3% of the issued and outstanding shares following the equity financing and the acquisitions, or 55.6% of the current issued and outstanding). If all of the Preferred Stock is exchanged into PATC Shares, the equity financing and the acquisitions may result in the issue of up to an additional 60,494,243 PATC Shares (representing 43.8% of the issued and outstanding shares following the equity financing and the acquisitions, or 78.1% of the current issued and outstanding). \b \bThe equity financing will result in a new holding of more than 20% of the issued and outstanding PATC Shares by one security holder, which may be considered by the TSX to materially affect control. If all of the Preferred Stock is exchanged into PATC Shares, Bison will hold up to 56,487,743 PATC Shares (representing 42.1% of the issued and outstanding shares on a post-conversion basis). Currently, Conor Pacific Canada Inc. owns, or exercises control or direction over, 24,781,567 PATC Shares (representing 32% of the current issued and outstanding). Assuming all of the Preferred Stock is exchanged into PATC Shares by Bison, Conor Pacific's interest in Precision will be reduced to 18%. \b \bNo insider of the Company has any direct or indirect interest in the equity financing or the acquisitions, and all of the parties thereto are dealing at arm's length. \b \bShareholder approval of the equity financing and the acquisitions is required by the TSX. Precision is relying on section 604(d) of the TSX Company Manual, which permits the Company to provide the TSX with written evidence that holders of more than 50% of the PATC Shares are familiar with the terms of, and are in favour of, the equity financing and the acquisitions, in lieu of holding a shareholders meeting. The acquisitions and the first and second investments under the equity financing anticipated to close on or about March 15, 2007. \b \bAbout Precision - Precision provides drilling services for site assessment and remediation and groundwater assessment, monitoring and mitigation in the United States.

It adds the company will also take steps to free up orphan, or inherited, estates that have been built up over decades and redeploy its share of the capital to finance growth opportunities. \u001d  A Prudential spokesman said he couldn't comment on speculation but said the firm has committed to report on the review of its U.K. business by March 15. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.timesonline.co.uk \b \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9320 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 08:59 ET (12:59 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"765af231694f4cdd15bc965f121db4e7","symR":["EOS"],"date":"2007-03-11","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II (EOS)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-11T07:57:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EOS"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II (EOS): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=EOS or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 03:57 ET (07:57 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"768c44cbded9e94d65d55638b7bde59b","symR":["AMD.LN","GB0000116375"],"date":"2007-03-11","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for The Aim Distribution Trust Plc","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-11T09:26:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AMD.LN","GB0000116375"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  The Aim Distribution Trust Plc: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0000116375 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 05:26 ET (09:26 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"770e0a3e48b33514bf50f4224ec92cf0","symR":["AHCI"],"date":"2007-03-11","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Allied Healthcare International","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-11T07:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AHCI"],"IndustryCodes":["HEA","XDJGI"],"Story":"\u001d  Allied Healthcare International: The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=AHCI or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 03:07 ET (07:07 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"775ebcccfafe947b85d777be58a14d88","symR":["AFN.LN","GB0002789591"],"date":"2007-03-11","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report is available for ADVFN PLC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-11T07:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AFN.LN","GB0002789591"],"IndustryCodes":["FIS"],"Story":"\u001d  ADVFN PLC: The most recent annual report is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnweurope.ar.wilink.com/?ticker=GB0002789591 or call +44 (0)208 391 6028 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 03:00 ET (07:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"778d458b46618bf5b8954190448dd099","symR":["VGM"],"date":"2007-03-11","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade Munis (VGM)","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-03-11T09:49:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VGM"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF"],"Story":"\u001d  Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade Munis (VGM): The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available at no fee. \u001d  To order, visit http://djnewswires.ar.wilink.com/?link=VGM or call 1-888-301-0513 \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 05:49 ET (09:49 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"77bb5744dfac5fe73917b99e12bd3549","symR":["GAM"],"date":"2007-03-11","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"The most recent annual report, and if applicable, quarterly report, is available for General American Investors Co.

(ACH), which posted Sunday a 67% jump in 2006 net profit on higher output, said the company will continue to expand its aluminum operations as it expects to see alumina prices to fluctuate on rising capacity in the market. \u001d  The company, better known as Chalco, posted a net profit of 11.75 billion yuan ($1.52 billion) for the year ended Dec. 31, 2006, up from CNY7.02 billion in 2005. \u001d  The result was in line with the average CNY11.5 billion forecast of 21 analysts polled by Thomson Financial. \u001d  Earnings growth was helped by rising output of both alumina and aluminum. The company produced alumina of 8.83 million metric tons in 2006, up 23% on year. Production of primary aluminum grew 84% to 1.93 million tons. \u001d  Alumina is the raw material to produce aluminum. \u001d  Prior to the earnings result, analysts had said expected higher profits would be helped by an increase in output and strong selling prices of both alumina and aluminum. \u001d  Despite weaker alumina prices in the second half of last year, Daiwa Institutes of Research said it expected Chalco's 2006 earnings would benefit from strong alumina prices for a large part of the year, translating to an annual average selling price of about CNY3,663 a ton, up 12.1% on year. \u001d  Chalco didn't provide average selling prices of any products in its statement. \u001d  Xiao Yaqing, Chalco's chief executive, said the company recorded stable growth in production and profit in 2006. But the outlook for company's alumina operations is likely to be rough. \u001d  \"In future, Chalco will face a series of challenges, such as product price fluctuation, rising price of major raw and ancillary materials and intensifying market competition arising from rapidly expanding production capacity of alumina,\" Xiao said in a statement. \u001d  \"The high economic growth of the world and China are expected to persist, which will drive the growth of aluminum consumption and bring more room for development of the group,\" he added. \u001d  In 2007, Chalco will consolidate, merge and acquire suitable aluminum enterprises to expand its production capacity. It will also list its A shares while seeking new financing channels to meet development needs, the company said in the statement. \u001d  \"Chalco will accelerate the construction of key projects, focus on acquisition of resources and control,\" the company said. \u001d  Chalco has been expanding its downstream aluminum operations to mitigate the effect of intensifying competition in the alumina business due to a rising number of new entrants. \u001d  Chalco slashed the spot price of its alumina four times, or a total of 58%, between August and November because of higher domestic production. Before the price cuts, Chalco had been selling alumina at a spot price of as high as CNY5,650 a ton. \u001d  Early last month, Chalco raised the spot price of its alumina 50% to CNY3,600 a ton to match the higher prices of its rivals. \u001d  Chalco, the world's second-largest alumina producer by output after U.S.-based Alcoa Inc., said revenue last year rose to CNY61.90 billion from CNY37.83 billion. \u001d  Chalco, which is China's largest alumina and aluminum producer, said it will declare final dividend, translating into distributable profit of about CNY1.48 billion, after the completion of its share-swap plan and A-share listing. \u001d  Chalco received shareholder approval in February to offer CNY8.2 billion worth of its shares to swap with the remaining shares it doesn't own in unit Shandong Aluminum Industry Co. (600205.SH) and affiliate Lanzhou Aluminum Co. Ltd (600296.SH). \u001d  Under the plan, Chalco will issue 604.8 million of its new A shares to holders of Shandong Aluminum tradable shares. It will also issue 631.93 million of its new A shares to other shareholders in Lanzhou Aluminium. \b \u001d  -By Joyce Li, Dow Jones Newswires; 852-2802-7002; joyce.li@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END)

will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \b \b   By Stephen Power and Jason Singer \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  (Dow Jones) Ford Motor Co. (F) is nearing a deal to sell its Aston Martin brand, in what would mark the end of a six-month effort to unload the unit and free up cash at a time when the company's North American business is struggling. \u001d  Ford is likely to announce Monday the sale of its Aston Martin sports car division to an investor group led by international motor racing entrepreneur David Richards in a deal that values the brand at about GBP450 million, according to people familiar with the situation. \u001d  Ford, which is selling the iconic British sports car maker to free its resources to invest more in its core brands, will retain a 15% stake in the company, these people added. Richards is backed by Kuwait's Investment Dar, a holding company, among others. Richards is also chairman of Prodrive Ltd., an auto racing firm, but Prodrive isn't participating in the purchase, these people added. \u001d  A spokesman for Prodrive, Ben Sayer, declined to comment Friday on whether the company was in talks to purchase Aston Martin from Ford. \u001d  Aston Martin, the British brand most famous for its association with the James Bond films, is grouped with Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo in Premier Automotive Group, a collection of upscale European nameplates that Ford once predicted would generate nearly a third of its operating profit by the middle of this decade. PAG, however, has reported massive losses in recent years, including a $1.6 billion loss in 2005, mainly as a result of losses by Jaguar. Some analysts say a sale of Aston Martin could allow Ford to better reposition Jaguar as more of an up-market niche brand. \u001d  Disposing of Aston Martin would pare down PAG's losses and raise cash to fund a restructuring of Ford's loss-plagued North American operations. It would also amount to a scaling back of Ford's effort to turn PAG into a major player in luxury automobiles with the scale of upscale car makers such as BMW AG and DaimlerChrysler AG's Mercedes-Benz division. \u001d  Ford had hoped to use PAG to cash in on the boom in luxury-car sales over the past 10 years. But the strategy has been complicated by troubles at Jaguar, which has continued posting losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars despite several restructuring efforts and the addition of a small sedan that was supposed to lure younger customers. \b \u001d  -By Stephen Power and Jason Singer, The Wall Street Journal \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 09:40 ET (13:40

the National Audit Office's audit of Agricultural Bank of China can be completed in the first half of this year. \u001d  But the office's audit of the bank isn't a necessary step in its stockholding restructuring, Li Jinhua, auditor-general of the National Audit Office, added on the sidelines of the National People's Congress, the country's legislature. \u001d  At the beginning of February, Agricultural Bank of China Vice President Han Zhongqi said a concrete value for any sort of government recapitalization of the bank could only be decided after external auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International and the National Audit Office had delivered audits of the lender. \u001d  Agricultural Bank of China is the weakest of China's Big Four state banks and the only one yet to complete a financial restructuring and listing. \u001d  As part of the restructuring of the other three Big Four banks - Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd. and China Construction Bank Corp. - the government recapitalized them with fund injections ahead of their listings. \u001d  Agricultural Bank of China hopes to complete its financial restructuring in the second half of this year, Han said in early February. \b \u001d  -Victoria Ruan contributed to this story, Dow Jones Newswires; 8601 6588-5848; victoria.ruan@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones

(This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \b \b   By Stephen Power \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  (Dow Jones)--The head of Volkswagen AG's (VLKAY) luxury Bugatti sports-car unit is stepping down, becoming the latest high-level executive to quit his post following the resignation of CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder late last year. \u001d  A spokesman for Bugatti said Sunday that its president, Thomas Bscher, had submitted his letter of resignation within the past few days, confirming a report in the German magazine Der Spiegel that Bscher intended to leave his post. \u001d  Bscher's resignation comes two months after the resignation of Wolfgang Bernhard. Bernhard - a former member of Volkswagen AG's management board with responsibility for its core Volkswagen brand - left the auto maker at the end of January.    \"He's done a good job,\" the Bugatti spokesman, Georges Keller said of Bscher. \"He took the [Bugatti] project over when it was in trouble, and he took the whole thing on and put the car on the road. It's like in football. If you're going to retire, you want to do so when you're on top.\"    With a top speed of 407 kilometers per hour and a price tag of around EUR1 million, Bugatti's Veyron sports car has been a difficult project for Volkswagen management. Championed by Volkswagen's chairman, Ferdinand Piech, the car's development was plagued for years by technical problems and cost overruns, prompting Pischetsrieder - who succeeded Mr. Piech as Volkswagen CEO in 2002 - to recruit Bscher, a former Formula 1 race-car driver, to take charge of the project in 2003. \u001d       Although Bugatti has begun delivering Veyrons to customers, its future product plans are unclear. At the North American International Auto Show in January, Porsche AG CEO Wendelin Wiedeking told reporters that Volkswagen should not subsidize any \"toys.\" Wiedeking is a member of Volkswagen's supervisory board, and his company is Volkswagen's largest shareholder. \u001d     \"One rule we have to follow in the future is that every product has to make money,\" Wiedeking said. \u001d     Bscher could not be reached for comment Sunday. \b \u001d  -By Stephen Power, The Wall Street Journal \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  March 11, 2007 10:08 ET (14:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright

calls for the removal of a Starbucks (SBUX) coffee shop from Beijing's famed Forbidden City, saying its presence was a smear on China's historical legacy, the official Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday. \u001d  Jiang Hongbin, a deputy from the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, said he submitted a motion to the National People's Congress, the country's legislature, to close the outlet immediately, Xinhua said. \u001d  Starbucks \"can no longer be allowed to taint China's national culture,\" Jiang was quoted as saying. \u001d  The outlet has stirred controversy among Chinese nationalists ever since it opened in 2000 in a side hall of the 587-year-old former home of China's Ming and Qing dynasty emperors, now a museum visited by 7 million people each year. \u001d  Calls for it to close grew again in January when a television host launched an online campaign to toss it out.

Management believes that the Coleman Cable-Copperfield combination will result in one of the premier U.S. based manufacturers of electrical and electronic wire and cable products. \b \u001d  Copperfield, currently majority owned by Spell Capital Partners, is one of the largest private fabricators and insulators of copper electrical wire and cable in the United States.  Copperfield sells its wire and cable products to industrial distributors and OEMs which operate in a diversified set of end markets including electrical, recreational vehicle, transportation, appliance and welding cable sectors.  Copperfield estimates that its revenues and EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 will be approximately $520 million and $35.3 million, respectively.  The strategic acquisition of Copperfield broadens the scope of Coleman Cable's product offering, further strengthens its strategic relationships with industrial distributors and increases Coleman's end-market diversity. \b \u001d  Coleman Cable anticipates meaningful expense synergies from the realignment of the combined company's manufacturing footprint and the expected purchasing opportunities resulting from the combination.  Excluding expense synergies, Coleman Cable expects the acquisition of Copperfield to be accretive to earnings per share for 2007.  Coleman Cable intends to use debt financing to consummate the acquisition.  The transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions and approval by necessary regulatory authorities, is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2007. \b \u001d  \"Copperfield is an excellent strategic fit and a logical step in the continued growth and development of our business,\" said Gary Yetman, CEO of Coleman Cable.  \"This transaction represents a unique opportunity to acquire a preeminent industry player and seasoned management team that will significantly enhance Coleman Cable's position as a leading provider of wire and cable products in numerous niche industrial end markets.\" \b \u001d  Richard Carr, Copperfield's CEO, stated:  \"The entire Copperfield family welcomes the opportunity to join forces with Coleman Cable.  Our new platform will enhance the value proposition of both organizations and provide our diverse customer base with an even greater variety of products and services. Mike Frigo, Copperfield's COO, and I look forward to continuing our roles with the new company and being part of this exciting transaction.\" \b \u001d  Coleman Cable plans to have a conference call with its investors to discuss the Copperfield acquisition in early April, shortly after the closing. \b \u001d  Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC is serving as Coleman Cable's financial advisor for the acquisition.  William Blair has provided a fairness opinion. Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw, LLP, is acting as the company's legal advisor. Lincoln International LLC is serving as Copperfield's exclusive financial advisor and Fredrikson & Byron, P.A. is acting as legal advisor to Copperfield and to Spell Capital Partners. \b \b    Forward-Looking Statements \b \u001d  This press release contains, in addition to statements of historical fact, certain forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty.  Actual results could differ from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors including those mentioned in documents filed with the SEC by Coleman Cable, Inc.  Forward-looking statements are based on information available to management at the time, and they involve judgments and estimates.  There can be no assurance as to the timing of the closing of the acquisition, or whether the acquisition will close at all, or that the expected synergies and cost savings will be realized.  Factors that could cause results to differ from expectations include the level of market demand for the products of Coleman Cable and Copperfield, competitive pressures, economic conditions in the U.S., price fluctuations of raw materials, environmental matters, unknown or unforeseeable events or developments at Copperfield and other specific factors discussed in the Coleman Cable annual report filed with the SEC on Form 10K on March 22, 2006. The financial information about Copperfield is based on preliminary estimates, has not been audited and is subject to change upon completion of the audit. Coleman assumes no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future developments. \b \b    About Coleman \b \u001d  Coleman Cable, Inc. is a leading manufacturer and innovator of electrical and electronic wire and cable products for the security, sound, telecommunications, and electrical, commercial, industrial, and automotive industries.  With extensive design and production capabilities and a long- standing dedication to customer service, Coleman is the preferred choice of cable and wire users throughout the world. \b \b    About Non-GAAP Financial Measures \b \u001d  EBITDA means earnings from continuing operations before net interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization.  Other companies may define EBITDA differently and, as a result, Copperfield's measure of EBITDA may not be directly comparable to EBITDA of other companies.  Copperfield's estimated 2006 EBITDA results from the addition to Copperfield's 2006 net income ($15.8 million) of the following amounts:  interest ($12.7 million), taxes ($0 million, as a result of its LLC status) and depreciation and amortization ($6.8 million).  EBITDA included in this release should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity. \b \u001d  This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. \b \b    For more information, visit:  www.colemancable.com \b \bSOURCE  Coleman Cable, Inc. \b \u001d    /CONTACT: media, Richard N.
