These data were presented at the 43rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago. (June 1-5, 2007).  Pharmion's epigenetic anti-cancer products, which include Vidaza(R) (azacitidine for injection), MCGD0103 and oral Azacitidine, are being investigated in the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors and are the subject of poster and oral presentations at the Meeting. \b \u001d  An oral dosage formulation of Azacitidine would provide a more desirable and convenient route of administration for patients and clinical staff and eliminate injection-site reactions.  In addition, it would enable the evaluation of a low-dose regimen that could maximize demethylation and gene re-expression, as well as the evaluation of long-term or maintenance therapy. \b \u001d  The study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating single doses of orally administered Azacitidine in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or other solid tumors.  A total of four patients were enrolled and received study drug.  One patient received a 60 mg dose and three patients received a single 80 mg dose.  In each case, Azacitidine was well-tolerated and quantifiable in plasma. Following an 80mg dose the bioavailability of the oral formulation of Azacitidine was 18 percent relative to subcutaneous (SC) administered Vidaza.  Having established that acceptable plasma concentrations of azacitidine can be achieved with single oral dosing, this pilot study has concluded.  A multi-dose escalating study of oral azacitidine is now underway. \b \u001d  \"Oral azacitidine represents an extremely exciting opportunity,\" said Dr. Guillermo Garcia-Manero, Associate Professor of Medicine and Chief, Section of Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. \"The potential for a chronic oral demethylating agent will not only apply to MDS but to many other tumor types as well.

The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms.  Non- proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to Vidaza. \b \b    Important Safety Information \b \u001d  Vidaza is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol and in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors. In clinical studies, the most commonly occurring adverse reactions were nausea (70.5%), anemia (69.5%), thrombocytopenia (65.5%), vomiting (54.1%), pyrexia (51.8%), leukopenia (48.2%), diarrhea (36.4%), fatigue (35.9%), injection site erythema (35.0%), constipation (33.6%), neutropenia (32.3%) and ecchymosis (30.5%). Other adverse reactions included dizziness (18.6%), chest pain (16.4%), febrile neutropenia(16.4%), myalgia (15.9%), injection site reaction (13.6%), aggravated fatigue (12.7%) and malaise (10.9%). Because treatment with Vidaza is associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, complete blood counts should be performed as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. Because azacitidine is potentially hepatotoxic in patients with severe pre- existing hepatic impairment, caution is needed in patients with liver disease. In addition, azacitidine and its metabolites are substantially excreted by the kidneys and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function. Vidaza may cause fetal harm. While receiving treatment with Vidaza, women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant, and men should avoid fathering a child. In addition, women treated with Vidaza should not nurse. \b \b    About MDS \b \u001d  The highest prevalence of MDS is in patients over 60 years of age. According to the American Cancer Society and the Aplastic Anemia and MDS International Foundation, there are approximately 10,000-30,000 new cases of MDS in the United States each year. Survival ranges from six months to many years for the different subtypes of MDS. \b \b    About Epigenetics \b \u001d  DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are two of the more studied epigenetic regulators of gene expression. Epigenetics refers to changes in the regulation of gene expression. Epigenetic changes can silence gene expression and, unlike DNA mutations, may be reversed by targeting the enzymes involved. The silencing of key cell cycle control genes and tumor suppressor genes through these two mechanisms of epigenetic regulation have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in hematological malignancies and in solid tumors. Vidaza has been shown to reverse the effects of DNA hypermethylation with subsequent gene re-expression and likewise MGCD0103 has been shown, in vivo, to reverse the effects of inappropriate deacetylation resulting in gene expression reactivation. The epigenetic approach to cancer therapy is that rather than using molecules that kill both normal and tumor cells, the silenced genes are reactivated through targeted epigenetic therapy, re-establishing the cancer cell's natural mechanisms to control abnormal growth. \b \b    About Pharmion \b \u001d  Pharmion is a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative products for the treatment of hematology and oncology patients in the U.S., Europe and additional international markets. Pharmion has a number of products on the market including the world's first approved epigenetic drug, Vidaza(R), a DNA demethylating agent.

(Nasdaq: REGN) today announced encouraging preliminary results from two Phase 2 studies in advanced ovarian cancer and lung cancer with aflibercept (VEGF Trap) an anti-angiogenic agent targeting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor. Aflibercept (VEGF Trap) is being developed by Regeneron in collaboration with sanofi-aventis. The companies will present data from the lung cancer study tomorrow. These are the first reported results from a late-stage development program consisting of single-agent studies and planned Phase 3 trials in combination with common chemotherapy regimens in several different solid tumor types. The presentation reviewing the advanced ovarian cancer trial and the poster describing the lung cancer trial will be available on the Regeneron website (www.regeneron.com on the Events page, under the Investor Relations heading) later, after they are presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). \b \u001d  The first study, selected for an oral presentation at ASCO, is an interim analysis of a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial investigating two doses of single-agent aflibercept (VEGF Trap) in patients with recurrent platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer. While the study remains blinded with regards to dose, the combined preliminary results of the two dose levels demonstrated anti-tumor activity as evidenced by an 8 percent partial response rate and 77 percent achievement of stable disease in heavily pre-treated patients who have failed multiple other treatments. Aflibercept (VEGF Trap) has been well tolerated with the typical class effect of anti-angiogenic agents (hypertension and proteinuria were the most common adverse events). \b \u001d  \"For this refractory group of advanced ovarian cancer patients who have already received three or more previous courses of treatment, there are few therapeutic options available. These interim results indicate that the VEGF Trap may offer an acceptable safety profile, and the VEGF Trap has shown encouraging signs of activity not only in terms of response rate but also durable stable disease, lowering of a biochemical marker of ovarian cancer, and improvement in ascites,\" stated Robert L. Coleman, M.D., Professor and Director, Clinical Research, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Department of Gynecologic Oncology. \"The VEGF Trap may one day represent a new treatment regimen for these seriously ill patients with few available alternatives.\" \b \u001d  The second study is presented as a poster at ASCO and is a Phase 2 single-arm study conducted in patients with platinum-resistant and erlotinib-resistant adenocarcinoma of the lung (the most common type of non-small cell lung cancer). \b \u001d  Regeneron and sanofi-aventis plan to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss these Phase 2 results and determine the next steps in the development program for the aflibercept (VEGF Trap). The ongoing single-agent studies of aflibercept (VEGF Trap) will be complemented by a large Phase 3 program combining aflibercept (VEGF Trap) with standard chemotherapy regimens in five different advanced solid tumors: colorectal, non-small cell lung, prostate, pancreas and gastric cancer. \b \u001d  Sanofi-aventis plans to make a first registration submission to regulatory agencies as early as 2008 for the VEGF Trap. \b \u001d  \"We are encouraged with the results we are seeing with the aflibercept (VEGF Trap), especially the evidence of biologic activity and the preliminary safety results in both trials,\" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President of Regeneron Research Laboratories. \"We are further pleased with the commitment by sanofi-aventis, whose capabilities in oncology drug development will play an important role in completing the broad development of aflibercept (VEGF Trap).\" \b \u001d  \"Our interest for VEGF Trap is driven by its unique characteristics and its high potential in most tumor types. Our alliance with Regeneron and the ambitious development program we are moving forward are reflecting the increasing commitment we have to Oncology,\" said Dr. Marc Cluzel, Head of Science and Medical Affairs, sanofi-aventis. \"We have a great aspiration for this product, for the further development of our company in oncology, and for improving the care of patients with cancer.\" \b \b   About the Ovarian Study (Abstract # 5508) \b \u001d  This study is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial investigating two doses of single-agent aflibercept (VEGF Trap) in patients with recurrent platinum-resistant or refractory epithelial ovarian cancer. The primary endpoint is a comparison of the objective response rate of two different doses of the aflibercept (VEGF Trap): 4.0 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and 2.0 mg/kg delivered by intravenous injection every two weeks. Secondary endpoints are time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), CA-125 protein level reduction, and time to CA-125 progression, as well as safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and health-related quality of life measures. \b \u001d  From June 2006 to April 2007, 162 patients were randomized and evaluated for efficacy from 44 centers in 12 countries (Europe, Canada, and the United States). A total of 13 partial responses have been observed (8 percent). Disease has been assessed as stable in 77 percent of patients at 4 weeks with 41 percent of patients demonstrating durable stable disease at 14 weeks. CA-125 protein levels, a surrogate marker for disease activity in ovarian cancer used to measure response to treatment, have been reduced by more than 50 percent in 21 patients (13 percent of the 162 patients evaluated). Of the 24 patients with advanced ovarian cancer who experienced ascites, 7 patients (29 percent) have experienced complete disappearance of the ascites, and 13 patients (54 percent) have experienced no increase in ascites during treatment. Tolerability has been similar to other molecules of the same class, hypertension being the most common grade 3/4 side effect (16 percent). Notably, only 2 of the 162 patients (1.2 percent) experienced bowel perforation, both of whom have recovered. Recruitment in this trial is continuing, and the companies expect to enroll approximately 200 patients in total. The study remains blinded. \b \b   About the Lung Cancer Study (Abstract # 7627) \b \u001d  This study is a Phase 2 open-label, single-arm, multi-center trial. This trial is evaluating an aflibercept (VEGF Trap) dose of 4.0 mg/kg delivered every two weeks to patients with platinum-resistant and erlotinib-resistant adenocarcinoma of the lung. The primary endpoint is response rate. Secondary endpoints are safety, duration of response, progression free survival, overall survival and quality of life. \b \b   About Ovarian Cancer \b \u001d  Most ovarian cancers are either ovarian epithelial carcinomas (cancer that begins in the cells on the surface of the ovary) or malignant germ cell tumours (cancer that begins in egg cells). More than 28,000 new cases in the US and 22,400 in Europe were diagnosed in 2004 and almost 14,400 patients in the US and 18,500 patients in Europe died. \b \b   About Lung Cancer \b \u001d  Lung cancer has been the most common cancer globally since 1985 and, in 2002, 1.35 million new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed, which represents about 12.4 percent of all newly diagnosed cancers. Lung cancer accounts for 29 percent of all cancer deaths and causes more deaths than breast, colorectal and prostate cancer combined. There are an estimated 1.18 million lung cancer deaths annually. In the US, the most recently available figures from 2002 show that 100,099 men and 80,163 women were diagnosed with lung cancer. In the European Union (EU), lung cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer, with 243,600 people diagnosed in the year 2000. Lung cancer does not only affect developed nations; nearly 50 percent of lung cancer cases in 2002 were reported in developing countries. Among US men, incidence rates have significantly declined since 1984 from 102.0 per 100,000 in 1984 to 77.8 per 100,000 in 2002. Since 1998, the lung cancer rates in women have stabilized after a long period of increase. \b \b   About aflibercept (VEGF Trap) in Oncology \b \u001d  The VEGF Trap is a fully human soluble VEGF receptor fusion protein with a unique mechanism of action. It is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, which binds VEGF-A more tightly than monoclonal antibodies. It blocks all VEGF-A isoforms plus placental growth factor (PIGF), another angiogenic growth factor that appears to play a role in tumor angiogenesis. The VEGF Trap has a relatively long half-life of approximately two weeks. Other anti-VEGF drugs have been approved for certain cancer indications and neovascular age-related macular degeneration. \b \b   About sanofi-aventis \b \u001d  Sanofi-aventis is one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, ranking number one in Europe. Backed by a world-class R&D organisation, sanofi-aventis is developing leading positions in seven major therapeutic areas: cardiovascular, thrombosis, oncology, metabolic diseases, central nervous system, internal medicine and vaccines. Sanofi-aventis is listed in Paris (EURONEXT: SAN) and in New York (NYSE: SNY). \b \b   Forward Looking Statements \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 12:00 ET (16:00 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"11e75237acee2e814a290c91c1992d04","symR":["ACOR","AGL","BDY","BLG","CVNS","ORNG","PKTR","PSAI","SJCK","VTRU"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/4) 13D Filings: Investors Report To The SEC","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T04:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ACOR","AGL","BDY","BLG","CVNS","ORNG","PKTR","PSAI","SJCK","VTRU"],"IndustryCodes":["ADV","BTC","CLO","CMT","DRG","HEA","HIM","HPD","HPR","ICS","MED","RTS","SVC","TEX","TSX","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \u001d  13Ds are supposed to be filed within 10 days of an entity's attaining more than 5%of any class of a company's securities.

Chapman believes there is \"an extremely high level of interest\" among other building-supply companies and private-equity firms to acquire the company. Chapman Capital has 2,189,239 shares (7.4%). \b \u001d  Packeteer (PKTR) \u001d  A group including Elliott Associates asserts that Packeteer has \"leading technology\" in one of the networking market's fastest-growing segments, but has been unable to capitalize on it. Elliott says the business segment in which Packeteer operates is becoming \"increasingly competitive\" and that the technology might prove \"extremely valuable to a larger acquirer looking to enter the wide-area network optimization market,\" or to supplement its product lines. The Elliott group beneficially owns about 2.27 million shares (6.3%). \b \u001d  Vertrue (VTRU) \u001d  Brencourt Advisors opposes One Equity Partners' $48.50-a-share bid for Vertrue as too low. Brencourt believes that there are other ways to increase shareholder value. Brencourt encouraged the board to revisit a leveraged recapitalization of the company's balance sheet and to use those proceeds to fund a special dividend to shareholders. Brencourt Advisors holds 938,581 shares (9.66%). \b \u001d  Bradley Pharmaceuticals (BDY) \u001d  CEO Daniel Glassman offered to buy the drug developer for $21.50 a share. If the offer, which he submitted to a special committee of Bradleys' board, succeeds, he'd take the company private.

Kennedy International Airport drew attention to what counterterrorism experts have warned could be a key target. \u001d  On Saturday, three men, one of them a former member of Guyana's parliament, were arrested and one was being sought in Trinidad as part of a plan that intended to \"cause greater destruction than in the Sept. 11 attacks\" in a neighborhood surrounding the airport, according to an indictment. \u001d  It was the first threat against Buckeye Pipe Line Co., which operates petroleum conduits in 18 states, the company said. Its pumping facility in Linden, New Jersey, has 45 storage tanks that pump turbine fuel, gasoline, diesel and other fuel and heating oils through two 12-inch pipes to customers in New York City, including JFK and LaGuardia airports. The network totals 35 miles within the New York City alone. \u001d  Roy Haase, a spokesman at Buckeye Partners LP (BPL), in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, declined to discuss details of the plot or the security measures of the company, which operates pipelines ranging more than 5,000 miles. \u001d  \"There was a time when we would brag about our safety and security features, but we would not do that now, for fear we would be undermining them,\" Haase said. \u001d  Buckeye works closely with federal Homeland Security officials, the FBI, New York fire and police and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the area's three major airports, Haase said. \u001d  \"We have been kept fully informed and apprised of this potential threat from the very beginning,\" Haase said. \u001d  Authorities called the plot \"chilling,\" though it never got beyond the planning stages to kill several thousand people and destroy parts of New York's borough of Queens, where the line runs underground. \u001d  An explosion's force would depend on the amount of fuel under pressure and likely would be \"restricted\" and not travel up and down the line, said Richard Kuprewicz, a pipeline expert and president of Accufacts Inc., an energy consulting firm that focuses on pipelines and tank farms. \u001d  \"That doesn't mean wackos out there can't do damage and cause a fire, but those explosions and fires are going to be fairly restricted,\" he said. \u001d  While pipelines have been the target of terrorism in the U.K., Colombia and Turkey, records show only one other recent threat against a pipeline in the U.S. \u001d  A report prepared for Congress last year said that federal authorities have warned of Al Qaida interest in pipelines as targets, especially the Alaska pipeline that handles 17% of U.S. domestic crude oil production. \u001d  \"To date there have been no known Al Qaida attacks on TAPS or other U.S. pipelines, but operators remain alert,\" it said. \u001d  In 2006, a Pennsylvania man was arrested for allegedly plotting to sabotage the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) and other petroleum facilities in New Jersey and Wyoming. There is no record that he was charged. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 20:39 ET (00:39 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"179ef1d863c86a077e584653d55afcc0","symR":["DCS","FGF","GDV","TDF","KDHAX"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/4) Fund Of Information: A Good Deal In Fundland: Closed-Ends","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DCS","FGF","GDV","TDF","KDHAX"],"IndustryCodes":["CEF","ZFU"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Lawrence C. Strauss \u001d  The portfolio's 10-year annual return of 10.52% bests the Standard & Poor's 500 by 2.47 percentage points, placing it in the top 20% of its Morningstarpeer group. \u001d  But for those investors looking for another way to get exposure to this fund family, there is Dreman-Claymore Dividend & Income (DCS), a closed-end that's very similar to its open-end cousin. As of late last week, the closed-end fund traded at an 11% discount to its net asset value. Translation: investors can buy these assets for less than 90 cents on the dollar. \u001d  \"If you can buy a dollar's worth of earnings power for 95 cents, that can be a good thing as long as that earnings power is stable and well-managed,\" says Anne Kritzmire, managing director of closed-end funds at Nuveen. \u001d  As the Dreman example illustrates, closed-end funds can be a good way for investors to put their money with managers and fund families they like, especially if these funds trade at a discount to their net asset value. A quick cautionary note about these funds, however: \"Some people think that closed-end funds are like bonds and that they will go to par, but they don't always do that,\" says Kritzmire. \u001d  Unlike open-end funds, which issue and redeem shares, closed-ends have a fixed number of shares that typically trade on an exchange. So the manager doesn't have to worry about keeping cash on hand to meet redemptions. That can favor closed-end funds, which can put all of their money to work, especially in a rising market. \u001d  They also offer income to investors looking for yield, often with the help of leverage. Dreman-Claymore Dividend & Income currently yields 5.23%, according to Morningstar, compared with 1.56% for DWS Dreman High Return Equity. \u001d  Tom Roseen, a senior research analyst at Lipper, says that \"closed-end discounts have narrowed over the last six or seven months to some of the lowest discounts we've seen in five or six years in some cases.\" \u001d  Still, some marquee managers' closed-funds are trading at sizable discounts, including: Gabelli Dividend & Income (GDV); SunAmerica Focused Alpha Growth (FGF); and Templeton Dragon (TDF). All these portfolios traded at double -digit discounts to their net asset values late last week. \u001d  These closed-end funds are far from being clones of the open-end funds within their firms. Exceptions are the Dreman-Claymore Dividend & Income and DWS Dreman High Return Equity, which share many holdings and a concentrated approach. \u001d  Another factor is expenses. The Dreman open-end fund has an annual expense ratio of 1.11%, versus 1.47% for the closed-end fund, according to Morningstar. Consider, however, that the open-end fund's A shares have a front-end load of 5.75% but that investors can buy into the closed-end fund for about $10 a trade via a discount broker. \u001d  However, investors should vet these funds carefully before jumping in. Kritzmire of Nuveen says it's important to ask \"how is it leveraged and what do you think about the cost of that leverage?\" \u001d  It's also important, she says, to discern whether a fund's distributions -- often dividends -- are sustainable. And Roseen cautions investors to keep an eye out for funds that dip into their capital to make distributions. \u001d  --- \u001d               Scoreboard \b \u001d       Real Estate, Latin America Shine \b   -- U.S. diversified equity funds gained an average 2.07%, beating the broad market's surge of 1.59%, in the week ending Thursday, according to Lipper, Reuters' fund-tracking arm.

Both drugs are designed to inhibit proteins involved with cancer growth. \u001d  Results from an on-going, Phase II study of Sprycel involving 35 patients who had not been previously treated with Gleevec showed they had so-called \"high response\" rates to the drug. Gleevec is considered standard treatment for patients newly diagnosed with CML. \u001d  However, Bristol-Myers is studying whether Sprycel would be effective as a first treatment for CML. Novartis also has developed a second-generation Gleevec drug, known as Tasigna, that's pending approval with the FDA. \u001d  The Sprycel study, led by researchers The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, looked at 35 patients who were enrolled in the study between November 2005 and December 2006. The goal is to eventually enroll 100 patients. Of the 35 patients, 31 were considered evaluable and had been in the study for at least three months. \u001d  So far only one patient has failed therapy, meaning the disease has gotten worse, said Ehab L. Atallah, the lead researcher who is a doctor in Anderson's leukemia department. \u001d  \"Our hypothesis is that treating with dasatinib first will produce an earlier response, which may translate to a better overall survival,\" Atallah said. \"We haven't proved that here, but these early results are encouraging.\" \u001d  Overall, the study showed that 77% of patients at three months had a so-called complete cytogenetic response meaning the CML can't be detected by a certain laboratory test. At six months, 92% of patients in the study had a complete response and 95% of patients in the study at the one year mark had a complete response. \u001d  Atallah said 15 patients had to temporarily stop Sprycel treatment during the study because of side effects that included infection, nausea and headache. \u001d  About 4,500 people receive a diagnosis of CML in the U.S. each year, and an estimated 20,500 people are living with the disease, according to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. \u001d  Before Gleevec, the median five-year survival rate for CML patients was about 50%. Now the five-year survival rate is 95% with Gleevec. \u001d  In an interview, Claude Nicaise, the vice president for Sprycel development at Bristol-Myers, said the company planned to discuss with the FDA and European drug regulators setting up larger clinical trials for Sprycel as a main CML treatment. \u001d  Because Sprycel is already on the market, doctors could use it off label as a first-line CML treatment. Nicaise said the company has no evidence that's happening and said Sprycel is being used in patients who fail Gleevec. \u001d   -By Jennifer Corbett Dooren, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9294; jennifer.corbett@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 19:48 ET (23:48 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"1dac454679a4cde6e3417ae0640d2c8d","symR":["BMY","DNA","LLY","RHHBY","ROG.VX","CH0012032048","US1101221083","US5324571083"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Genentech's Avastin Helps In Lung Cancer; Mixed Sales News","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T12:30:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BMY","DNA","LLY","RHHBY","ROG.VX","CH0012032048","US1101221083","US5324571083"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSMI","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Peter Loftus \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Adding Genentech Inc.'s (DNA) Avastin cancer drug to a certain chemotherapy regimen produced a modest improvement in a measure of survival of people with an advanced form of lung cancer, a new study found. \u001d  But the study could have negative financial implications for Genentech and its majority owner, Roche Holding AG (RHHBY), because it showed a lower dose of Avastin was just as good as a higher dose. If doctors begin to prescribe lower amounts of the drug, it could slow the drug's sales growth. \u001d  Avastin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October to be used in combination with a different chemotherapy regimen - carboplatin and paclitaxel - to treat non-small-cell lung cancer. The new study tested Avastin in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine. \u001d  Non-small-cell lung cancer is the most common form of lung cancer, which is one of the deadliest and most prevalent forms of cancer. \u001d  Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif., had said in February the new study met its primary goal of prolonging progression-free survival, which measures the time until patient death or tumor growth. Full results are set to be presented Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. The new study was conducted by Roche of Switzerland. \u001d  Genentech has signaled that the finding that a lower dose of Avastin was effective could hurt the drug's sales. FDA's approval of Avastin in lung cancer last year was at the higher dose, albeit with a different regimen of chemotherapy. \u001d  Ian Clark, executive vice president of Genentech's commercial operations, told analysts in April the presentation of the new study data at ASCO may cause an \"increase in the number of physicians who decide to treat certain patients at this lower dose level.\" Genentech has said the study wasn't designed to compare the two dosage arms. \u001d  Genentech recorded $1.7 billion in U.S. Avastin sales in 2006, up 54% from the year before. The drug, which works by starving tumors of needed blood supply, is also approved to treat colorectal cancer. Data from a separate study of Avastin in kidney cancer patients is set to be released later Saturday, and is among dozens of Avastin studies being presented here. \u001d  The latest study involved more than 1,000 patients across Europe, where the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine is more commonly used than in the U.S. Cisplatin is sold under the brand Platinol by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY), while gemcitabine is sold as Gemzar by Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY). Avastin isn't yet approved to treat lung cancer in Europe. \u001d  Some patients received a lower dose of Avastin plus chemotherapy, others received a higher dose plus chemotherapy, and a third group received chemotherapy alone. The study found that people on the lower dose had median progression-free survival of 6.7 months, versus 6.5 months in the higher dose group and 6.1 months among those on chemotherapy alone. \u001d  The study also found that 34% of people in the lower-dose group had tumor shrinkage, versus 30% in the higher-dose group and 20% among chemotherapy alone. \u001d  \"We did observe a similar treatment effect in both Avastin\" groups, said David Schenkein, Genentech's vice president of clinical hematology and oncology, in an interview. \u001d  Side effects, however, were slightly higher in the Avastin groups. The most common serious side effects were high blood pressure, experienced by 9% in the high-dose Avastin group, 6% in the lower-dose group and 2% in the chemotherapy alone group. Avastin is known generically as bevacizumab. \u001d  Avastin is given by intravenous infusion. It's expensive, though last year Genentech said it would cap the overall expense of Avastin at $55,000 a year per eligible patient for any FDA-approved indication. \u001d  \"These findings demonstrate that bevacizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin is another effective treatment choice for patients with this disease,\" said Christian Manegold, a professor of medicine at the University of Heidelberg in Germany and lead study author, in an ASCO press release. \u001d  -By Peter Loftus, Dow Jones Newswires; 215-656-8289; peter.loftus@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 08:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"2049eccab2cc5cb5629768f1401bda80","symR":["RBS.LN","GB0007547838"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Tchenguiz Targets UK's Buy-To-Let Sector -Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T14:24:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["RBS.LN","GB0007547838"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","REA","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XST5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Property tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz is bidding to become one of Britain's largest residential landlords with a GLB500 million venture to take advantage of the exodus from the buy-to-let sector, the Financial Times of London reported Saturday. \u001d  Tchenguiz is to agree a deal with the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.LN) on Monday, which will see the creation of a fund that is intended to grow to GBP500 million over five years before being floated, the newspaper said. \u001d  According to The Financial Times the company, First UK Residential, will buy homes \"off-plan\" 18 months before they are completed and later let them to people unable to get on the property ladder. \u001d  The fund will be seeded with an initial GMB100 million in cash and debt, the newspaper said. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.ft.com \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9259 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 10:24 ET (14:24 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"208d3f0551dc7d0be6002544e27a7624","symR":["0004.HK","0020.HK","HK0004000045","HK0020000177"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"HK Wheelock To Raise Stake In Affiliate Wharf To Over 50%","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T12:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["0004.HK","0020.HK","HK0004000045","HK0020000177"],"IndustryCodes":["IDD","REA","RED","XDJGI","XHSG"],"Story":"\b \u001d  HONG KONG (Dow Jones)--Hong Kong investment and property holding company Wheelock & Co.

(NYSE:DNA) today announced that a Roche-sponsored, randomized placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study of Avastin(R) (bevacizumab) in combination with interferon alfa-2a therapy increased the median time patients with first-line metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) lived without their cancer growing or spreading as defined by progression-free survival (PFS). Patients receiving Avastin plus interferon alfa-2a therapy experienced a 59 percent improvement in PFS (based on a hazard ratio of 0.63) compared to those receiving interferon alfa-2a therapy alone. \b \u001d  The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) today featured the results of the trial, known as AVOREN, in a press briefing at its 43rd Annual Meeting in Chicago. These data were also highlighted in a plenary session by Bernard Escudier, M.D., head of the immunotherapy and innovative therapy unit at the Gustave-Roussy Institute, Paris, France (Abstract #3 - Monday, June 4, 2:30 p.m. CDT). \b \u001d  \"Patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma often express elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF,\" said Dr. Escudier. \"These data suggest that specifically blocking VEGF with Avastin may provide important clinical benefit for patients with this difficult-to-treat disease.\" \b \u001d  \"These Phase III results were significant because kidney cancer remains a disease where new and better treatments are needed,\" said Hal Barron, M.D., Genentech's senior vice president, Development and chief medical officer. \"This is the fourth kind of cancer in which Avastin has demonstrated positive results in a Phase III study, reinforcing our belief in the potential of specifically targeting VEGF in a broad spectrum of solid tumor types.\" \b \b   Study Results \b \u001d  The 59 percent improvement in PFS can also be referred to as a 37 percent reduction in the risk of cancer progression or death, as calculated by the hazard ratio (HR) of 0.63. Patients who received Avastin plus interferon had a median PFS of 10.2 months compared to 5.4 months for patients who received interferon alone (pless than 0.0001). The tumor response rate was 31 percent (95/306) in the Avastin plus interferon arm, compared to 13 percent (37/289) in the patients who received interferon alone. \b \u001d  Adverse events in this study appeared to be similar to those previously reported for interferon and for Avastin. The most common adverse events that occurred more often in the Avastin plus interferon arm included bleeding, hypertension and proteinuria. Severe (Grade 3 or greater) fatigue occurred in 23 percent in the Avastin arm compared to 15 percent in the interferon alone arm. Other Grade 3 or greater events that occurred more often in the Avastin plus interferon arm included proteinuria (22 percent vs. 0 percent), hypertension (4 percent vs. 1 percent), hemorrhage (3 percent vs. 0 percent), venous thromboembolism (2 percent vs. 1 percent), gastrointestinal perforations (2 percent vs. 0 percent) and arterial ischemia (1 percent vs. 0 percent). \b \b   About the Trial Design \b \u001d  The study, which included 649 patients worldwide, was originally designed to measure an improvement in overall survival. However, in prior consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulatory authorities, the primary analysis endpoint was revised to assess improvement in PFS, defined as the length of time the tumor did not grow or patient death did not occur. Secondary endpoints of the study included overall survival, time to progression, time to treatment failure, overall response rate and safety profile. The study protocol specified an interim overall survival analysis be performed at approximately 50 percent of events. That interim analysis showed a trend toward an increase in overall survival. However, the final survival data are not yet mature and will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting. \b \u001d  Another Phase III study of Avastin in combination with interferon in first-line mRCC is being conducted in the U.S. by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, a national clinical research group sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. The results of this trial have not yet been reported. In addition, Genentech is planning a randomized study of Avastin in combination with other targeted agents in mRCC. \b \u001d  Renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer, accounting for nine out of 10 cases, and fewer than 10 percent of late-stage kidney cancer patients live five years following diagnosis. According to the American Cancer Society, there will be 51,190 new cases of kidney cancer and 12,890 kidney cancer deaths in 2007 in the U.S. \b \b   About Avastin \b \u001d  Avastin is a therapeutic antibody designed to specifically inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that plays an important role in angiogenesis and the maintenance of existing blood vessels throughout the lifecycle of a tumor. By inhibiting VEGF, Avastin is designed to interfere with the blood supply to a tumor, which is thought to be critical to a tumor's ability to grow and spread in the body (metastasize).

For full prescribing information and Boxed Warnings on Avastin, visit http://www.avastin.com. \b \u001d  The FDA approved Avastin on February 26, 2004, as a first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with intravenous 5-FU-based chemotherapy. Avastin is also indicated in combination with intravenous 5-FU-based chemotherapy for second-line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. On October 11, 2006, the FDA approved Avastin in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. \b \b   Avastin Safety \b \u001d  Avastin has a well-characterized safety profile in its approved indications with more than 200,000 patients treated to date. The most serious adverse events associated with Avastin across all trials were gastrointestinal perforation, wound healing complications, hemorrhage, arterial thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), neutropenia and infection, nephrotic syndrome and congestive heart failure. The most common adverse events in patients receiving Avastin were asthenia, pain, abdominal pain, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, stomatitis, constipation, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, dyspnea, exfoliative dermatitis and proteinuria. \b \b   About Genentech \b \u001d  Founded more than 30 years ago, Genentech is a leading biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures and commercializes biotherapeutics for significant unmet medical needs. A considerable number of the currently approved biotechnology products originated from or are based on Genentech science. Genentech manufactures and commercializes multiple biotechnology products and licenses several additional products to other companies.

These data were presented at the 43rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, Ill. (June 1-5, 2007).  Pharmion's epigenetic anti-cancer products, which include Vidaza, MCGD0103 and oral Azacitidine, are being investigated in the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors and are the subject of poster and oral presentations at the Meeting. \b \u001d  \"As we continue to evaluate alternative dosing and schedules for Vidaza in MDS, and its potential in solid tumors, we are increasingly impressed with the activity this drug has in multiple tumor types,\" said Patrick J. Mahaffy, president and CEO of Pharmion.  \"These studies will help provide us with insight not only into the continuing development of parenteral Vidaza, but, in particular, provide us direction for the development of oral azacitidine.\" \b \u001d  Tolerability and hematologic improvement assessed using three alternative dosing schedules of azacitidine (Vidaza) in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) - R. Lyons; Abstract #7083; June 2, 2007; 8am-12pm; McCormick Place Convention Center, S Hall A2) \b \u001d  Interim results from a Phase II, multi-center, open-label trial comparing three alternate dosing schedules of Azacitidine (AZA) in patients with MDS were presented in a poster session on Saturday, June 2.  Patients were randomized to one of three regimens that were repeated every four weeks: AZA 5-2-2 (75 mg/m2/day x 5 days, two days off therapy, two additional days at same dose as the first five days); AZA 5-2-5 (50 mg/m2/day x 5 days, followed by 2 days off therapy and five additional days at the same dose as the first five days); and AZA 5 (75 mg/m2/day x 5 days). \b \u001d  Of 122 patients who had received two or more cycles of therapy at the time of evaluation, 61 percent experienced hematologic improvement (HI), defined as major or minor in at least one cell line.  This reflects HI of 53, 70 and 60 percent in the AZA 5-2-2, AZA 5-2-5, and AZA 5 arms, respectively. \b \u001d  Across each of the three alternative dose regimens, 65 percent to 80 percent of patients who were red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent at baseline achieved transfusion independence. Comparable beneficial effects on transfusions were demonstrated in all patients and in low-risk patients for both RBCs and platelets. \b \u001d  To determine whether response/improvement can be maintained after six cycles, the study includes a 12 month maintenance period, in which patients are re-randomized to one of two arms: AZA 5 every four weeks or AZA 5 every six weeks.  Ten patients have completed 18 treatment cycles. \b \u001d  These data indicate that the three alternative azacitidine dosing schedules have safety and efficacy profiles consistent with the FDA-approved regimen. Alternate dosing schedules may offer patients and clinicians a more convenient schedule by eliminating weekend treatments.  Vidaza was the first demethylating agent to be approved by the FDA and the first approved treatment for all five subtypes of MDS. \b \u001d  The combination of azacitidine (Vidaza) and valproic acid is safe and active in advanced solid tumors - A.O. Soriano; Abstract #3547; June 2, 2007; 2-6pm; McCormick Place Convention Center, S102a \b \u001d  Results were reported this afternoon from a Phase I study of Azacitidine, a DNA hypomethylating agent, in combination with valproic acid, an HDAC inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study, which included patients with advanced forms of 10 different solid tumors, evaluated the safety and activity of the two compounds in combination. \b \u001d  Of 55 evaluable patients, 14 patients, or 25 percent, were observed to experience stable disease in a variety of advanced solid tumors.  The duration of the patients' stable disease was four to 12 months, with a median of six months. \b \u001d  These data show that the combination of the two compounds was safe and active in patients with advanced solid tumors  The data also indicated that the maximum tolerated dose of azacitidine when used in the combination was 75 mg/m2.

The FDA approved Vidaza, the first in a new class of drugs called demethylation agents, for treatment of all five MDS subtypes, which include both low-risk and high-risk patients.  These subtypes include: refractory anemia (RA) or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) if accompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions; refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB- T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). \b \u001d  Vidaza is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow.  The concentration of azacitidine required for maximum inhibition of DNA methylation in vitro does not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis.  Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation.  The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non- proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to Vidaza. \b \b    About Epigenetics \b \u001d  Azacitidine is the first of a new class of anti-cancer compounds called epigenetic therapies. DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are two of the more studied epigenetic regulators of gene expression. Epigenetics refers to changes in the regulation of gene expression. Epigenetic changes can silence gene expression and, unlike DNA mutations, may be reversed by targeting the enzymes involved. The silencing of key cell cycle control genes and tumor suppressor genes through these two mechanisms of epigenetic regulation has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in hematological malignancies and in solid tumors. These key growth control genes can be re-expressed in cancer cells when DNA hypermethylation is reversed by Vidaza and/or inappropriate histone deacetylation is inhibited by MGCD0103. The epigenetic approach to cancer therapy is that rather than using molecules that kill both normal and tumor cells, the silenced genes are reactivated through targeted epigenetic therapy, re-establishing the cancer cell's natural mechanisms to control abnormal growth. \b \b    Important Safety Information \b \u001d  Vidaza is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol and in patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors. \b \u001d  In clinical studies, the most commonly occurring adverse reactions by SC route were nausea (70.5%), anemia (69.5%), thrombocytopenia (65.5%), vomiting (54.1%), pyrexia (51.8%), leukopenia (48.2%), diarrhea (36.4%), fatigue (35.9%), injection site erythema (35.0%), constipation (33.6%), neutropenia (32.3%) and ecchymosis (30.5%).  Other adverse reactions included dizziness (18.6%), chest pain (16.4%), febrile neutropenia (16.4%), myalgia (15.9%), injection site reaction (13.6%), aggravated fatigue (12.7%) and malaise (10.9%).  The most common adverse reactions by IV route also included petechiae (45.8%), rigors (35.4%), weakness (35.4%) and hypokalemia (31.3%). \b \u001d  Because treatment with Vidaza is associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, complete blood counts should be performed as needed to monitor response and toxicity, but at a minimum, prior to each dosing cycle. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 19:02 ET (23:02 GMT)"},{"md5ID":"30f9318358c5b288dfefd08b100c8e74","symR":["ICE","ISE","NDAQ","X.T","CA8730281042"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/4) Streetwise: The Bull Battles Fatigue","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ICE","ISE","NDAQ","X.T","CA8730281042"],"IndustryCodes":["SCR","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XTSE"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Michael Santoli \u001d  And so, after a biblical seven years of wandering, the Standard & Poor's last week finally surmounted its former all-time closing high, set near the apex of the market bubble in 2000. \u001d  Is this a moment to celebrate or lament, a sign of reassurance or foreboding? \u001d  Probably all of the above. \u001d  First, let's look at the index, the S&P 500, which made this roundtrip. In reality, the 500 stocks in the index today would have exceeded their 2000 high a good while ago.That is, the index as it stood at the prior peak in 2000 was top-heavy with irrational hope, capitalized in tech and telecom stocks, with a slug of accounting frauds layered in. (MCI WorldCom was worth $128 billion then.) \u001d  This, of course, is the nature of indexes, built to reflect the investor preferences of any given moment, no matter how manic. But the mountains of market cap that crumbled made for a particularly daunting path back for the S&P. \u001d  There's a sense out there on the bullish side of the Street that merely circling back to March 2000 levels means that it's early days for this bull market, that we're somehow owed much more. \u001d  Yet the equal-weighted (as opposed to capitalization-weighted) version of the S&P 500 has been above its 2000 high since late 2003, and has risen 160% since its October 2002 bear-market low. The small- and mid-cap benchmarks have been in record territory since last year. The \"average stock\" long ago reached new heights, and it carries a higher valuation than it did in the silly season of spring 2000, when a handful of mega-caps and profitless tech confections distorted the indexes. \u001d  Investors who believe they deserve more from the market may not recognize that the Vestek index of all shares, weighted by market value, is up 22.1% in the past year, 15.6% annualized over four years and 10.7% over five. \u001d  Of course, fortune has been known to give us more than we truly deserve, which is where the current market outlook comes in. Perhaps the most constructive take on stocks today is that the easy-money, buyout-enabled global-asset lift will drive stocks to overshoot on the upside, with share prices exceeding earnings growth and the debt-to-equity arbitrage shrinking the supply of stock. \u001d  It remains exceedingly difficult to quarrel with the sturdiness of the weekly tape. And the market has earned the benefit of the doubt, even if we're now seeing short-term signs of buyer's fatigue and narrower leadership. \u001d  Speaking of the Biblical resonance of the number seven, Steve Leuthold in this week's Q&A draws the analogy between today's market and that of 1987, when stocks melted up through the summer in the fifth year of a bull market during a pre-election year under a second-term Republican president as interest rates climbed. \u001d  This is not to say that a crash is in the offing, but simply that the bull market might be entering a higher-risk phase, one dependent on rally-chasing new money and heavy deal flow. True, stock valuations aren't as high as they were in '87, thanks to copious energy and financial earnings and lower absolute interest-rate levels. Indeed, the market was up more than 40% from the low of 1986 to the summer high in 1987. Right now, the market is 26% above last year's low. \u001d  So, for those confident that history will rhyme, here's a bit of advice: Stay in the game but watch the clock. \u001d  There are three elements of the market's enthusiasm for the shares of global stock exchanges: industry consolidation, electronic trading and the derivatives boom. \u001d  TSX Group, parent of the Toronto Stock Exchange, is a play on all three. And yet the stock is generally neglected by U.S. investors and trades at an attractive discount to other exchanges. \u001d  TSX (ticker X.CN or X.TO) has shown impressive earnings growth of more than 30% over the past five years, and its return on equity exceeded 60% last year. \u001d  It has a ton of natural-resource listings, its trading volume has expanded nicely, and it has joint ventures with the electronic International Securities Exchange (ISE) and InterContinental Exchange (ICE) to trade derivatives. Nasdaq Stock Market's (NDAQ) recent deal to buy Scandinavia's OMX Group shows that the global-exchange merger trend is quite alive. \u001d  TSX has a market value of $2.9 billion (Canadian) and is valued at less than 17 times forecast 2008 earnings. Risks for investors include a potential waning of interest in natural-resource stocks and a stated -- but not imminent --  threat by Canadian banks to start a rival exchange. \u001d  TSX executives will speak at a Sandler O'Neill conference this week in New York. Perhaps it will help the company emerge from unwarranted obscurity. \u001d  --- \u001d  e-mail: michael.santoli@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"373f95bc166540d86c1bc4e80525e8bf","symR":["LLY","US5324571083"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Study Supports Activity of GEMZAR(R) (Gemcitabine HC1 for Injection) in the Treatment of Early-Stage Breast Cancer","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T19:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["LLY","US5324571083"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"Five Phase III Early-Stage Breast Cancer Studies Underway With GEMZAR \b \b \u001d  CHICAGO, June 2 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- GEMZAR(R) (gemcitabine HC1 for injection), approved in combination with paclitaxel (Taxol(R)) in the first- line, post-surgical treatment of metastatic breast cancer, was the subject of a study presented today with encouraging results in the pre-surgical treatment of breast cancer. The study was presented at the 43rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). \b \u001d  Results showed that adding GEMZAR to the current standard-of-care treatment was a promising regimen for patients with stage II-III breast cancer. Eli Lilly and Company, the manufacturer and marketer of GEMZAR, also cited five completed or ongoing Phase III trials which will further study GEMZAR as a chemotherapeutic foundation for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. \b \u001d  Today's Phase II study (Abstract # 595(i)) evaluated the addition of GEMZAR to the current standard-of-care of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel in patients with stage II-III breast cancer. The treatment schedule was a dose-dense sequential neoadjuvant (pre-surgical) chemotherapy combination, meaning that the combination was administered at shorter intervals between treatments. Results showed a promising regimen in terms of pathologic complete response (pCR-the absence of invasive tumor in the breast). In addition, patients who tested positive for the HER-2 gene also were given trastuzumab (Herceptin(R)) and demonstrated additional response. \b \u001d  \"The data released today reflects our ongoing, aggressive research plan involving GEMZAR as a key therapeutic foundation for the treatment of breast cancer,\" said Allen Melemed, M.D., medical director, global oncology at Lilly. \"We are encouraged with the activity GEMZAR has shown in this breast cancer study.\" \b \u001d  Enrollment has been completed in one trial, and is ongoing in an additional four, Phase III early-stage breast cancer studies evaluating the addition of GEMZAR to commonly-used treatment regimens. Two adjuvant (post- surgical) therapy trials, NSABP B-38 (4,400 patients) and TANGO (3,000 patients), will compare the addition of GEMZAR to the paclitaxel arm of each study. A third adjuvant trial, SUCCESS (3,600 patients), will compare the addition of GEMZAR to a docetaxel-based regimen. Two additional trials, which are neoadjuvant specific, NSABP B-40 (1,200 patients) and Neo-TANGO (800 patients), will evaluate the addition of GEMZAR to the paclitaxel or docetaxel arm of the treatment regimen. For more information on these studies, log on to www.lillytrials.com or www.clinicaltrials.gov. \b \b    More About ASCO Abstract # 595 \b \u001d  The trial enrolled stage II-III breast cancer patients (with a median age of 45), including inflammatory tumors, a type of breast cancer that causes the breast to swell, redden and feel warm. Of the 73 patients enrolled in the study, 42 (57.5%) were classified as T2; 12 (16.5%) as T3, and; 19 (26%) as T4, which included 13 patients with inflammatory tumors. A T-classification represents the stage of the tumor with T4 being the most advanced. A biopsy was performed before treatment for the biomarker component of the study. \b \u001d  Patients received a first sequence of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (90/600 mg/m squared) for three cycles followed by a second sequence of paclitaxel and GEMZAR (150/2500 mg/m squared) for six cycles. Treatment was administered on day one, every two weeks, with growth factor support. HER-2 positive patients (20 patients, 27.3%), were given trastuzumab (2 mg/kg with a loading dose 4 mg/kg) concomitantly. Afterward, the patients underwent surgery, radiotherapy and adjuvant hormonal therapy according to institutional practice. \b \u001d  All patients from the study showed response to the regimen. Of the entire study group, 27 (36.9%) patients achieved a pCR (absence of invasive tumor in the breast), with 50% representation from the HER-2 positive patients who also were given trastuzumab. Forty-seven patients (64.4%) underwent conservative surgery. \b \u001d  The grade 3/4 hematological toxicities were: leukopenia in six patients (9%); neutropenia (a decrease in white blood cells) in eight patients (12%), and; anemia (a decrease in red blood cells) in one (2%). Nausea (13%) and vomiting (15%) were the most frequent grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicities. Asymptomatic decrease in cardiac ejection fraction was observed in one patient treated with trastuzumab with subsequent normalization. \b \b    About Breast Cancer \b \u001d  Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women, affecting nearly one out of every eight women.(ii)  The disease is diagnosed in more than 1.1 million women worldwide each year.(iii)  Breast cancer progresses in stages based on tumor size, how the cancer affects the lymph nodes and whether it has metastasized to other parts of the body.(iv)  In general, individuals with earlier stages of disease have better chances for long-term survival and recovery. \b \b \b \b    GEMZAR \b \b \b \b    Indications \b \u001d  GEMZAR in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy, unless anthracyclines were clinically contraindicated. \b \u001d  GEMZAR is indicated in combination with cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with inoperable, locally advanced (stage IIIA or IIIB), or metastatic (stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer. \b \u001d  GEMZAR is indicated as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced (nonresectable stage II or stage III) or metastatic (stage IV) adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. GEMZAR is indicated for patients previously treated with 5-FU. \b \u001d  GEMZAR in combination with carboplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer that has relapsed at least 6 months after completion of platinum-based therapy. \b \b    Important Safety Information for GEMZAR \b \u001d  Myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity with GEMZAR therapy. \b \b    Contraindication \b \u001d  Known hypersensitivity to GEMZAR. Anaphylactoid reaction has been reported rarely. \b \b    Warnings \b \u001d  Infusion times of GEMZAR longer than 60 minutes and more frequent than weekly dosing have been shown to increase toxicity. \b \u001d  Pulmonary toxicity has been reported with the use of GEMZAR. In cases of severe lung toxicity, GEMZAR therapy should be discontinued immediately and appropriate supportive care measures instituted. \b \u001d  Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and/or renal failure have been reported following one or more doses of GEMZAR. Renal failure leading to death or requiring dialysis, despite discontinuation of therapy, has been rarely reported. The majority of the cases of renal failure leading to death were due to HUS. \b \u001d  Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death, has been reported very rarely in patients receiving GEMZAR alone or in combination with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. \b \u001d  GEMZAR is Pregnancy Category D. GEMZAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. \b \b    Precautions \b \u001d  Use caution in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or hepatic insufficiency. Administration of GEMZAR may exacerbate underlying hepatic insufficiency. \b \u001d  The optimum regimen for safe administration of GEMZAR with therapeutic doses of radiation has not yet been determined in all tumor types. GEMZAR has radiosensitizing activity and radiation recall reactions have been reported. \b \u001d  It is not known whether GEMZAR or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. \b \u001d  The effectiveness of GEMZAR in pediatric patients has not been demonstrated. \b \u001d  The toxicities of GEMZAR observed in pediatric patients were similar to those reported in adults. \b \b    GEMZAR clearance is affected by age as well as gender. \b \u001d  Patients receiving therapy with GEMZAR should be monitored closely by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. \b \b    Monitoring and Dosage Modifications \b \b    Dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity may be required. \b \u001d  Serum creatinine, potassium, calcium, and magnesium should be monitored during combination therapy with cisplatin. \b \u001d  Patients should be assessed with a CBC, including differential and platelet count, prior to each dose of GEMZAR. Modify or suspend therapy according to the Dosage Reduction Guidelines in the full Prescribing Information. \b \u001d  Hepatic and renal function (including transaminases and serum creatinine) should be evaluated prior to therapy with GEMZAR and periodically thereafter. \b \b    Adverse Events \b \u001d  The most severe adverse events (grades 3/4) with GEMZAR plus paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with MBC were neutropenia (48%); alopecia (18%); leukopenia (11%); anemia (7%); fatigue (7%); thrombocytopenia (6%); ALT elevation (6%); and neuropathy-sensory (6%). The most common adverse events (all grades) were nausea (50%); fatigue (40%); myalgia (33%); and vomiting (29%).

Racanelli \u001d  In late April, Citigroup analyst Jeffrey Sprague published a report that jarred General Electric and Wall Street. In some quarters, the shock has yet to wear off. Among other things, Sprague outlined a partial break-up of the Fairfield, Conn.-based company, in which its NBC Universal division, the consumer-oriented GE Money unit and the company's real-estate businesses could be spun off. Such action, he argued, theoretically would value GE at 45 a share, about 10 points higher than where it was trading. Sprague's note catalyzed debate about the stock, which barely has budged in the past three years, and lifted the shares 3%. GE closed Friday at 37.45. \u001d  In an interview with Barron's, the analyst says GE could be worth even more than 45 if investors give the slimmer, trimmer and more focused company a higher price-earnings multiple, and its spun-out units a premium valuation. Investor reaction to his analysis was \"overwhelmingly positive,\" Sprague says. \u001d  GE Chairman Jeffrey Immelt called the report \"provocative\" and \"logical,\" but said it didn't make him change his strategy. \"If we find businesses that we're not running well or could be spectacularly valued by somebody else, we'll capitalize on those opportunities,\" he said. \u001d  Immelt noted that GE hasn't been lax about making changes in the past; some $80 billion of acquisitions and $45 billion of dispositions have occurred on his watch, which began in 2001. \u001d  Vocal complaints by shareholders of Citigroup (ticker: C) show the market's largest companies aren't exempt from such pressure. \"There is a point where they are going to have to do something,\" says Paul Jackson, a money manager who runs his own firm in Newton, Mass. Jackson has owned GE for a while, but if other stocks keep rising while this one stalls, \"there might come a time when our clients tell us to sell GE,\" he says. \u001d  Matthew McCormick, of Cincinnati money manager Bahl & Gaynor, is blunter. \"[GE] has to find a way to reward shareholders, or someone will come in and force them to make changes for shareholder value,\" he says. \u001d  For Immelt & Co., the clock is ticking. \u001d  -- V.J.R. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3b9e967456ed3c13f9fca39c43c5370d","symR":["DELL","INTC","MMM","US2470251099","US4581401001","US88579Y1010"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/4) Downshifting Into Neutral On Stocks","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T04:03:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DELL","INTC","MMM","US2470251099","US4581401001","US88579Y1010"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","FIS","IDD","SEM","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Sandra Ward \u001d  Interview With Steven Leuthold \u001d  Chief investment strategist, Leuthold Group \b \u001d  All it took was an e-mail alert from the folks at Leuthold Group informing us their major trend index, which takes the pulse of all sorts of market measures, had slipped to neutral after deteriorating from a peak in mid-March. That gave us a good excuse to check in with the grand poobah of the renowned Minneapolis research and money-management outfit to see which way the investment winds are blowing. Gas prices be damned, what better way to kick off Memorial Day weekend than by paying a visit to Leuthold at his summer home on the Maine coast and hearing what's on his mind. \b \u001d  Barron's: A year ago, you and I were discussing how a new bear market might have just begun. It hadn't. Now where do we stand? \u001d  Leuthold: Our disciplines turned negative a year ago and we became defensive and moved our asset allocation down to 30% in equities and we stayed with that for about 3 1/2 months. We got back into the market when our indexes improved. The original signal was a false alarm. It's the price you pay sometimes for being defensive. Our whole credo is making it and keeping it, and we try to get out of the way if we think we're headed for trouble. It was premature and, in retrospect, it was wrong. \b \u001d  Q: But your work on market trends is flashing a warning sign again. \u001d  A: Our market work remained positive, on balance, until a few weeks ago, when it downshifted to neutral. We've got 180 components in the major trend index and what has caused it to shift has been an acceleration of inflation, in commodity prices, and the very recent increase in rates. That's occurring against the backdrop of an economic expansion that is long in the tooth by post-World War II standards of duration and magnitude. This cyclical bull market has now run about 14 months longer than the typical cyclical bull market. The S&P 500 is up 95% from trough to peak, versus an average of 80% [see chart on facing page]. As a result, we've moved to neutral. We are 50% in equities, compared with 70% at the first of the year. \b \u001d  Q:How do you balance this with the flood of liquidity that keeps coming into the market? Is that a factor in the major trend index? \u001d  A: I went back through our Green Book and read what I wrote in 1987. \b \u001d  Q: Why '87? \u001d  A: Because we also turned negative in 1987 prematurely, about two or three months prematurely, and people thought we didn't recognize a new era of valuations. The two things Wall Street was talking about to support the market before the terrible October decline was the huge amount of liquidity and the big shrink in equities. Then liquidity was coming from Japan because Japanese brokers had started selling U.S. stocks. The big equity shrink was partly the result of LBOs, but mostly from companies buying back their own stock. There were other parallels. Breadth was deteriorating and investors were gravitating to big-cap stocks from small-cap stocks. There was an acceleration of inflation, which we are seeing now. There was an acceleration of interest rates, and the market kept going up in the face of higher rates, although, back then, the rise in rates was greater. There were a lot of similarities. \b \u001d  Q: There was also a real-estate boom. \u001d  A: Yes, there was. More to the point, though, this is an old market. It is mature by historical standards since World War II. We've had two economic expansions of 8 and 10 years under Reagan and Clinton, and people have come to believe that those are normal. But the average economic expansion has actually been about five years since World War II. \b \u001d  Q: Here we are at five years from 2002. \u001d  A: In terms of magnitude, the cyclical bull market has overshot. \b \u001d  Q: You mentioned all the similarities to '87. What's different today? \u001d  A: The valuation level in the S&P 500 is not as extended as it was back then. Then it was selling at 20 times earnings, now it's selling at 15 1/2-16 times current earnings. But if you normalize the earnings, we may be looking at peak earnings for the S&P or very close. Also, the S&P is much cheaper than almost any other aspect of the market. \u001d  By our estimation, were the S&P to go back to median valuation levels, it would decline about 13% from current levels. But mid-caps and small-caps would decline about 25% or 30% because the universe of 3,000 stocks we cover in those categories are in the 97th percentile of valuations historically and at about 21 1/2 times normalized earnings. In terms of normalized earnings, the S&P 500 is in the 81st percentile, so it's modestly overvalued. We are starting to see a shift where large-caps are winning by a small margin over small- and mid-caps. That is also typical of what we saw in 1987. \b \u001d  Q: What about sentiment? \u001d  A: What happened then philosophically was also very much like what might be happening today. At the end of 1986, institutions thought the market was overvalued and they became cautious. Then the market had a big move up in January 1987 and people were sitting there with defensive positions and thought, \"Uh-oh, the market is going up.\" And it kept going up. Finally, there was a point of capitulation as managers who were lagging behind the S&P 500 and their peers threw in the towel and bought stocks. We haven't seen that happen yet this time around. We could see it happen pretty soon. We've already seen it happen with the hedge funds, which, if you look at the ISI Group's numbers, are about as long as they could get. \b \u001d  Q: What about the public? \u001d  A: The public isn't participating. Net inflow into U.S.-focused equity funds this year is about $16 billion. That sounds like a lot of money, but a year ago, at this same time, it was $38 billion-$39 billion. We are seeing the market making new highs and yet there have been weeks of net redemptions. \b \u001d  Q: Are they still going overseas? \u001d  A: They are. Net inflows into foreign funds, as of a few weeks ago, was about $69 billion, compared to the $16 billion into U.S. funds. It is performance-chasing. One thing you can bet on is that when we get to extremes, the public is going to be wrong. One of the few bullish sentiment factors in this U.S. market is that the public has not come in. The question is whether they will. \b \u001d  Q: We're approaching the 10th anniversary of the big Asian financial crisis. Any thoughts about whether we are going to find ourselves in a similar situation? \u001d  A: It is possible. We still have 8% in foreign markets, and it's all in emerging markets. That had been as high as 15% a couple of years ago, then we moved it to about 6% and since the first of the year we've been slightly increasing it. Our biggest single position is 2% in China. I ask myself every day if this parabolic advance in the Chinese market is the end of the road. \u001d  Right now, we don't think so, but maybe as we get closer to the 2008 summer Olympics, the market will begin to discount a correction. We just did a study on stock multiples of companies with more than $1 billion in market value in China and the average is 32 or 33 times earnings, whereas in Japan they were 42 to 43 times earnings at the 1989 peak. But I don't think there is any way that China is going to quit investing in dollar-denominated securities, though they could allocate more to euro- or even yen-denominated securities or maybe other currencies in the Middle East. But unless the U.S. is stupid enough to raise a major threat of restricting or taxing imports, which it looks like some politicians would like to do, there will be peace until after the Olympics, and we are not likely to see some type of a trade war. \b \u001d  Q: What's the impact on U.S. companies? \u001d  A: A trade war could really hurt when you consider that about 48% of the earnings in the S&P 500 come from foreign operations. The long-term average of up-to-down earnings, from 1984 to date, is 1.68. Today, with 90% of our earnings, the current up-to-down ratio is 1.16. The only times we've seen it lower than that was in the past two recessions. That is kind of scary. It shows the breadth of earnings advances is being focused more and more in the large-cap stocks. They are the 3Ms (Ticker: MMM), the Intels (INTC) and the Dells (DELL) that have big foreign operations and are global. \b \u001d  Q: There seems to be quite a few instances of \"only-in-a-recession\" data coming out. \u001d  A: We are going to see two quarters of negative GDP by the time we get to mid-2008, which would be the official definition of a recession. Earnings may not reflect that because we have exported so much of the labor function. But it looks like maybe the consumer, for the first time in my lifetime, might actually be tapped out. I'm not expecting any huge decline or a new secular bear market or anything like that. But we certainly could see a 25% to 30% kind of a correction, which would be a normal cyclical bear market. That's my opinion, but as I have often said, our numbers are more reliable than our opinion and right now our numbers are neutral. \b \u001d  Q: What influence are hedge funds and private equity exerting on the market? \u001d  A: Our preliminary numbers show the price private-equity firms are paying to buy out companies is 33% to 40% higher than a year ago, based on cash flow. And everybody and his brother is running screens as to who the next likely leveraged-buyout candidate will be. It turns out everything is an LBO candidate. There has never been any kind of a technique, including any kind of portfolio management, that can't be defeated as an effective strategy by too much money and that's exactly what we are seeing happen. But the fallout in the stock market probably is going to be quite a long way away. I don't think private equity is going to be the thing that sinks the stock market. The negative stuff is going to come when two years or three years or four years down the road, private capital attempts to regurgitate these companies and sell them back to the public after they have stripped all the assets out of them or taken their big dividends and so on and so forth. \b \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:03 ET (04:03 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3d0e6e56f07b42fbfca4948ec0c44fa5","symR":["WTB.LN","GB00B1KJJ408"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Whitbread To Sell David Lloyd Leisure For GBP940M -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T13:28:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["WTB.LN","GB00B1KJJ408"],"IndustryCodes":["RES","XDJGI","XFT1"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Whitbread (WTB.LN) is to announce the sale of its David Lloyd Leisure chain for almost GBP940 million to London & Regional, the property investment firm that owns Next Generation Clubs, The Times of London reported Saturday. \u001d  According to The Times a formal Stock Exchange announcement is expected on Monday. \u001d  London & Regional, which is controlled by the billionaire Livingstone brothers, is understood to have beaten off intense competition from MidOcean Partners and Buckingham Securities, the newspaper reported. \u001d  The Times also said that Scott Lloyd, the chief executive of Next Generation Clubs and son of David Lloyd, will run the enlarged business, although there were rumors that Neil Gillis, the former Esporta chief executive, had been approached about the role. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.timesonline.co.uk \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9259 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 09:28 ET (13:28 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"3de6ab8212d57e6ac7fdc4b02839a0a1","symR":["DNA","RHHBY","ROG.VX","CH0012032048"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Second Phase III Study of Avastin Plus Chemotherapy Shows Improved Progression-Free Survival in First-Line Non-Squamous, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T12:38:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DNA","RHHBY","ROG.VX","CH0012032048"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","XDJGI","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSMI","XST5"],"Story":"\b    -- Results Add to Avastin Data in Most Common Form of Advanced \u001d                           Lung Cancer -- \bCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 02, 2007-- \u001d  Genentech, Inc. (NYSE:DNA) today announced that a Roche-sponsored, randomized placebo controlled Phase III clinical study (AVAiL) demonstrated that Avastin(R) (bevacizumab), studied at two different doses in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy, significantly increased the time patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lived without their disease advancing, as defined by progression-free survival (PFS). The investigator-assessed analysis showed similar improvements in PFS among patients in the two Avastin plus gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy arms compared to the chemotherapy alone arm. \b \u001d  Patients receiving 15 mg/kg of Avastin plus gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy experienced a 22 percent improvement in PFS (based on a hazard ratio of 0.82) (p-value = 0.0301) compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone, and patients receiving 7.5 mg/kg of Avastin plus gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy experienced a 33 percent improvement in PFS (based on a hazard ratio of 0.75) (p-value = 0.0026) compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Broadly overlapping confidence intervals (the range of plausible values that would likely contain the real effect) in the Avastin treatment arms compared to chemotherapy alone suggest the two Avastin arms had a similar treatment effect on PFS when compared with the control arm. No new safety signals for Avastin were observed in the study, and there were no clinically meaningful differences in safety between the two dose arms. \b \u001d  These results were presented today at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 43rd Annual Meeting in Chicago during an oral symposium by Christian Manegold, M.D., professor of Medicine, Heidelberg University, University Medical Center, Mannheim, Germany (Abstract # LBA7514 - Saturday, June 2, 2:45 p.m. CDT). Results for overall survival data, a secondary endpoint of the trial, are not yet mature and will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting. \b \u001d  \"The data showed an increase in the time patients lived without their cancer growing or spreading when Avastin was administered with cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy, a standard regimen used to treat advanced lung cancer,\" said Professor Manegold, principal investigator of the study. \"The positive AVAiL results add to the body of evidence to support Avastin's use in the most common form of lung cancer.\" \b \u001d  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Avastin for the first-line treatment of unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic, non-squamous, NSCLC in October 2006. The approval was based on the positive results of a pivotal U.S. Phase III trial (E4599) that studied a 15 mg/kg dose of Avastin administered every three weeks in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen to treat first-line NSCLC in the U.S. The trial showed a 25 percent improvement in overall survival for Avastin plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone and an investigator-assessed 52 percent improvement in PFS (hazard ratio = 0.66). Avastin is the first FDA-approved therapy to extend survival beyond one year in patients with advanced NSCLC in a Phase III trial and the first therapy in a decade to improve on standard first-line treatment for advanced lung cancer. \b \u001d  \"We believe some U.S. physicians will consider these new data when making decisions about how to use Avastin in their practices, while others will prescribe Avastin based on the dose and chemotherapy combination that showed improved overall survival in the U.S. pivotal study,\" said Hal Barron, M.D., senior vice president, Development and chief medical officer. \"This study is important for patients and physicians because it provides information about Avastin's potential efficacy with a second chemotherapy combination in lung cancer.\" \b \u001d  According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), lung cancer is the single largest cause of cancer death among men and women in the U.S. and is responsible for nearly 30 percent of cancer deaths each year. The ACS estimates that more than 213,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer and 160,000 Americans will die of the disease in 2007. \b \b   Study Results \b \u001d  The 22 and 33 percent improvements in PFS respectively in the 15 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg Avastin treatment arms can also be referred to as 18 and 25 percent reductions in risk of cancer progression or death, as calculated by the hazard ratios. Median PFS was 6.5 months in the 15 mg/kg Avastin plus chemotherapy arm, 6.7 months in the 7.5 mg/kg Avastin plus chemotherapy arm and 6.1 months in the gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy alone arm. The tumor response rates in patients with measurable disease at baseline were 30 percent (101/332) in the 15 mg/kg Avastin plus chemotherapy arm and 34 percent (110/323) in the 7.5 mg/kg Avastin plus chemotherapy arm, compared to 20 percent (65/324) in the chemotherapy alone arm. Duration of tumor response was 6.1 months in both Avastin-containing arms compared to 4.7 months in the chemotherapy alone arm. \b \u001d  Safety was similar to previous studies of Avastin in NSCLC. In AVAiL, the most common severe adverse events were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Severe (Grade 3 or greater) neutropenia occurred at 36 and 40 percent respectively in the 15 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg Avastin arms, compared to 32 percent in the chemotherapy alone arm. Severe thrombocytopenia occurred at 23 and 27 percent respectively in the 15 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg Avastin arms, compared to 23 percent in the chemotherapy alone arm. Grade 3 or greater anemia was 10 percent in both Avastin arms, compared to 14 percent in the chemotherapy alone arm. \b \u001d  Grade 3 or greater pulmonary hemorrhage occurred at 0.9 percent in the 15 mg/kg Avastin arm and 1.5 percent in the 7.5mg/kg Avastin arm, compared to 0.6 percent in the chemotherapy alone arm. Bleeding occurred at 4 percent in both Avastin arms, compared to 2 percent in the chemotherapy alone arm. Severe venous thromboembolic events occurred in 7 percent of patients in both Avastin arms, compared to 6 percent of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm. Severe ischemic events occurred at 3 and 2 percent respectively in 15 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg Avastin arms, compared to 5 percent in the chemotherapy alone arm. Severe hypertension occurred at 9 and 6 percent respectively in the 15 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg Avastin arms, compared to 2 percent in the chemotherapy alone arm. \b \b   Trial Design \b \u001d  AVAiL was an international study that enrolled 1,044 patients with previously untreated, advanced, non-squamous, NSCLC. Patients were randomized to receive cisplatin (80 mg/m2 on Day 1) and gemcitabine (1,250 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8) chemotherapy every three weeks for up to six cycles plus either Avastin 15 mg/kg or Avastin 7.5 mg/kg every three weeks (until disease progression), or placebo. Physicians and patients in the study were blinded to treatment with Avastin but not dose. The primary endpoint was PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first event of progression or death. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, time to treatment failure and safety. \b \b   About Avastin \b \u001d  Avastin is a therapeutic antibody designed to specifically inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that plays an important role in angiogenesis and the maintenance of existing blood vessels throughout the lifecycle of a tumor. By inhibiting VEGF, Avastin is designed to interfere with the blood supply to a tumor, which is thought to be critical to a tumor's ability to grow and spread in the body (metastasize).

For full prescribing information and Boxed Warnings on Avastin, visit http://www.avastin.com. \b \u001d  The FDA first approved Avastin on February 26, 2004, as a first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with intravenous 5-FU-based chemotherapy. In addition to the supplemental indication in advanced NSCLC, Avastin is also indicated in combination with intravenous 5-FU-based chemotherapy for second-line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. \b \b   Avastin Safety \b \u001d  Avastin has a well-characterized safety profile in its approved indications with more than 200,000 patients treated to date. The most serious adverse events associated with Avastin across all trials were gastrointestinal perforation, wound healing complications, hemorrhage, arterial thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), neutropenia and infection, nephrotic syndrome and congestive heart failure. The most common adverse events in patients receiving Avastin were asthenia, pain, abdominal pain, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, stomatitis, constipation, upper respiratory infection, epistaxis, dyspnea, exfoliative dermatitis and proteinuria. \b \b   About Genentech \b \u001d  Founded more than 30 years ago, Genentech is a leading biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures and commercializes biotherapeutics for significant unmet medical needs.

(IMCL) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) and overseas by Merck KGaA (MRK.XE), was approved by U.S. regulators last year to treat head and neck cancer. But the approval was for its use in combination with radiation therapy, or as a single agent when platinum-based chemotherapy has failed. In Europe, it's approved in combination with radiation therapy. \u001d  The new study, funded by Merck KGaA of Germany, could support wider use of Erbitux as a first-line treatment in combination with chemotherapy in head and neck cancer patients. The drug also is approved to treat colorectal cancer. \u001d  The new study involved about 440 patients in Europe with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Most were cancers of the larynx or pharynx. Roughly half were given chemotherapy plus Erbitux, while the other half got chemotherapy alone. \u001d  The study found that median overall survival in the Erbitux/chemotherapy group was 10.1 months, versus 7.4 months in the chemotherapy-alone group. ImClone had disclosed in April that the study met its primary endpoint, but full details are scheduled to be presented Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, in Chicago. \u001d  \"The survival benefit is among the longest ever seen in a large clinical trial among these patients,\" Jan Baptist Vermorken, a Belgian oncologist who led the study, said in an ASCO press release. \u001d  The most common side effect in those taking Erbitux was an acne-like rash, which was treatable and abated over time. \u001d  The European study was one of several Erbitux studies scheduled to be presented at ASCO. The drug's marketers are hoping new clinical data will support wider use of the drug and boost sales. Last year, Bristol-Myers recorded $652 million in Erbitux sales, up 58% from the year before. \u001d  On Monday, results of a closely watched trial of Erbitux in previously untreated colorectal cancer patients will be released. These data might also support wider use of Erbitux because the drug is currently approved to be used in colorectal cancer after chemotherapy has failed. ImClone already has said the study met the primary endpoint of increasing median duration of progression-free survival. Progression-free survival measures the time from start of treatment until tumor growth or patient death. \u001d  -By Peter Loftus, Dow Jones Newswires; 215-656-8289; peter.loftus@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 08:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"402420f32bf778b715c890e3d0c9d0a0","symR":["AAPL","US0378331005"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Hidden iTunes Info Sparks Privacy Fears - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T16:21:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AAPL","US0378331005"],"IndustryCodes":["CPR","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNQ1","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Privacy fears were sparked after it emerged that Apple embedded personal details into music files bought from its iTunes music store, The Times in London reported Saturday. \u001d  Technology Web sites examining iTunes products discovered that personal data, including the names and e-mail addresses of purchasers, were inserted into the files that Apple uses to distribute music tracks, The Times said. \u001d  According to the newspaper, the information is also included in tracks sold under Apple's iTunes Plus system, where users pay a premium for music that is free from the digital rights management (DRM) intended to protect against piracy. \u001d  The Electronic Freedom Foundation, the online consumer rights group, said it was possible that the data could be used to \"watermark\" tracks so that the original purchaser could be tracked down if a track appeared on a file-sharing network, the newspaper said. \u001d  An Apple spokeswoman was unable to comment, The Times added. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.timesonline.co.uk \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9330 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 12:21 ET (16:21 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"44c8d1fc696149aabde56d15a5c6ed24","symR":["BMY","DNA","LLY","RHHBY","ROG.VX","CH0012032048","US1101221083","US5324571083"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"UPDATE: Genentech Drug Helps Modestly In Lung Cancer >DNA","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T17:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BMY","DNA","LLY","RHHBY","ROG.VX","CH0012032048","US1101221083","US5324571083"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSMI","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Peter Loftus \b   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Adding Genentech Inc.'s (DNA) Avastin cancer drug to a certain chemotherapy regimen produced a modest improvement in a measure of survival of people with an advanced form of lung cancer, a new study found. \u001d  But the study could have negative financial implications for Genentech and its majority owner, Roche Holding AG (RHHBY), because it showed a lower dose of Avastin was just as good as a higher dose. If doctors begin to prescribe lower amounts of the drug, it could slow the blockbuster drug's sales growth. \u001d  \"You are going to see physicians use the lower dose,\" said Christopher Raymond, a Baird analyst. However, he said it's possible that would be offset by increases in the number of lung-cancer patients who use Avastin. \u001d  Avastin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October to be used in combination with a different chemotherapy regimen - carboplatin and paclitaxel - to treat non-small-cell lung cancer. The new study tested Avastin in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine. \u001d  Non-small-cell lung cancer is the most common form of lung cancer, which is one of the deadliest and most prevalent types of cancer. \u001d  Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif., had said in February the new study met its primary goal of prolonging progression-free survival, which measures the time until patient death or tumor growth. Full results were released Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. The new study was sponsored by Roche of Switzerland. \u001d  Genentech has signaled that the finding that a lower dose of Avastin was effective could hurt sales. FDA's approval of Avastin in lung cancer last year was at the higher dose, albeit with a different regimen of chemotherapy. \u001d  Ian Clark, executive vice president of Genentech's commercial operations, told analysts in April the presentation of the new study data at ASCO may cause an \"increase in the number of physicians who decide to treat certain patients at this lower dose level.\" \u001d  On the other hand, the lower dose appeared to have a better safety profile, which could make it attractive to more patients, thus helping sales, said Baird's Raymond. \u001d  The study wasn't designed to directly compare the two dosage arms. Some cancer doctors at ASCO, including the study's lead author, said Saturday that an additional, large trial would be needed to directly compare the two dose levels of Avastin before they could conclude that a lower dose is just as good. \u001d  \"It must be a large, very expensive trial,\" Christian Manegold, professor of medicine at the University of Heidelberg in Germany and the study's lead author, said at a press conference Saturday. \"I don't know whether this will ever be happening.\" \u001d  Genentech recorded $1.7 billion in U.S. Avastin sales in 2006, up 54% from the year before. The drug, which works by starving tumors of needed blood supply, is also approved to treat colorectal cancer. \u001d  Data from a separate study showing Avastin was effective in kidney cancer patients also was released Saturday, and is among dozens of Avastin studies being presented here. \u001d  The latest study in lung cancer involved more than 1,000 patients across Europe, where the combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine is more commonly used than in the U.S. Cisplatin is sold under the brand Platinol by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY), while gemcitabine is sold as Gemzar by Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY). Avastin isn't yet approved to treat lung cancer in Europe. \u001d  Some patients received a lower dose of Avastin plus chemotherapy, others received double the lower dose plus chemotherapy, and a third group received only chemotherapy. \u001d  The study found that people on the lower dose had median progression-free survival of 6.7 months, versus 6.5 months in the higher dose group and 6.1 months among those on chemotherapy alone. \u001d  The improvement was relatively small, but doctors said it was significant. \"It is clinically important,\" Manegold said. \"We are dealing with a very difficult to treat cancer.... We are ready to accept small steps forward and there's no doubt this is a significant step forward.\" \u001d  The study also found that 34% of people in the lower-dose group had tumor shrinkage, versus 30% in the higher-dose group and 20% among chemotherapy alone. \u001d  Side effects were slightly higher in the Avastin groups versus chemotherapy, but the lower dose of Avastin had fewer serious side effects than the higher dose. The most common serious side effects included high blood pressure, experienced by 9% in the high-dose Avastin group, 6% in the lower-dose group and 2% in the chemotherapy alone group. \u001d  Avastin, which is known generically as bevacizumab, is given by intravenous infusion. It's expensive, though last year Genentech said it would cap the overall expense of Avastin at $55,000 a year per eligible patient for any FDA-approved indication. \u001d  -By Peter Loftus, Dow Jones Newswires; 215-656-8289; peter.loftus@dowjones.com \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 13:41 ET (17:41 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"4ba7f1fac81cebd6a68c856630126724","symR":["AZA.MI","IT0003918577"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Auditors Deal Fresh Blow To Alitalia - Newspaper","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T16:25:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AZA.MI","IT0003918577"],"IndustryCodes":["AIR","XDJGI","XMIB"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Alitalia (AZA.MI), the Italian flag carrier that has been up for sale since November, was dealt a fresh blow when it transpired that Deloitte & Touche, its auditors, might not approve the 2006 accounts because of the uncertainty surrounding the airline's future, The Times in London reported on Saturday. \u001d  Newspaper Web site: http://www.timesonline.co.uk \u001d  -London Bureau, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9330 \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 12:25 ET (16:25 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"528951137605a77b63ea143585ece914","symR":["500300.BY","532538.BY","INE047A01013","INE481G01011"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"India Aditya Birla May Cement Sales 2.71M Tons, +4.75% On Yr","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T07:55:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["500300.BY","532538.BY","INE047A01013","INE481G01011"],"IndustryCodes":["BLD","XDJGI"],"Story":"\b \u001d  MUMBAI (Dow Jones)--India's Aditya Birla Group said Saturday that cement sales in May rose 4.75% on the year to 2.710 million metric tons. \u001d  Cement production for the month grew 3.7% on year to 2.705 million metric tons, it said in a statement. \u001d  Aditya Birla Group's cement companies include Grasim Industries Ltd.

Legal costs may well swallow up the one euro a share in offer cash that the consortium has set aside to cover LaSalle-related litigation. Holland-based ABN has agreed to sell LaSalle to Bank of America (ticker: BAC) for $21 billion, but the deal is being contested in court by the consortium banks, which view it as a mere ploy to thwart their bid for ABN itself. \u001d  So ABN Amro (ABN) shareholders should count on only 37.40 euro a share from RBS (RBS.U.K.) and friends, not 38.40 euros, trimming the premium to Barclays' 34.41 euro all-share offer. And while the consortium has identified more synergies in a linkup with ABN than Barclays (BCS) has, its estimated integration costs are significantly higher -- 6.8 billion euros versus 3.6 billion euros. (One euro equals about $1.34.) \u001d  In pitching their bid below 40 euros a share, while talking up the ease with which they will cover their cost of capital, the three banks in the RBS consortium -- the others are Dutch-Belgian Fortis (FOR.Netherlands) and Spain's Banco Santander (STD) -- argue that extracting savings out of ABN Amro will be both easy and difficult. \u001d  But if ABN Amro's cost controls are as loose as rumored -- nobody understands ABN's costs, least of all ABN, goes the RBS jibe -- perhaps investors have been wrong to question Barclays' capacity to extract significant synergies through a takeover. And Barclays isn't taking on the risks inherent in a three-way carve-up of the big Dutch bank. For example, plans by Fortis and Royal Bank of Scotland to continue to share some ABN back-office services might be harder and more costly to achieve in reality than in theory. \u001d  Of course, the outcome of this takeover fight to a large degree rests in the hands of the Dutch courts and how hard-nosed Bank of America plans to be in its battle to buy LaSalle, which has headquarters in Chicago. \u001d  The RBS consortium does still look to hold an advantage over Barclays, if the legal obstacles can be overcome, and should it have the opportunity or need to sweeten its offer. The separate geographic and business-line overlap that RBS, Fortis and Santander each have with the ABN Amro units they covet explains the 4.2 billion euros in cost savings they expect, compared with Barclays' 3.5 billion euros. RBS CEO Fred Goodwin says that because ABN Amro is thinly stretched by business line and geography, it's a good fit for his bank and its partners. \u001d  The three banks' good merger track records do lend credibility to the idea that they'll achieve those savings. And they have unconditional funding in place for the 71 billion euro offer, including a 79% cash component, without straining their balance sheets. But there's a long way to go before the final shots are fired in the battle for ABN. \u001d  --- \u001d  Matthew Curtin is a contributor to The Skeptic, a column on which this European Trader is based. \u001d  --- \b                         DOW JONES GLOBAL INDEXES \b \bRegion/ \bCountry \b   DJ Global          DJ Global           DJ Global     Point \b    Indexes,           Indexes,            Indexes,      Chg.    % Chg. \b Local Curr.

Recently, rates started rising to levels that made a lot of people sit up and take notice. \u001d  A: The 30-year went up to 5.01%. The 10-year went to 4.90%, temporarily. They are probably going to go higher. The reason they are going higher is that we have to be competitive in the rates we are paying, because rates are going up in Germany and the U.K. It is very weird because at the same time you are looking at T-bill rates going down and the spread between T-bills and the Fed funds is very wide now. But it has reversed the inversion of the yield curve, which a lot of people point to as being a positive thing, because they are scared of that inversion. The inversion itself isn't negative but we are seeing higher longer-term rates building. I think we'll get to 5.60% on the long bond. \b \u001d  Q: In how long? \u001d  A: Within six months. What that does is put another strain on the whole housing industry because it has a direct impact on mortgage rates, especially since they have curtailed the interest-only mortgages and the \"liar's loans.\" People's mortgage payments are going to be higher, and that is going to hurt the sales of new houses, probably. \b \u001d  Q: Steve, where are you looking to make profits from this market? \u001d  A: We should focus on foreign markets because there is intrinsically stronger growth there. The U.S. is a mature economy. The emerging countries are not. I am not sure China is the place to go.

Racanelli \u001d  Few companies \"get\" globalization better than General Electric, with its far-flung interests in energy and aviation, health care, entertainment and finance. \u001d  Countries large and small seek GE's assistance for pressing needs like power-generation and water desalinization. The company sells more wide-body jet engines to India than to the U.S. And GE has been an a notable beneficiary of China's miraculous boom. \u001d  The explosive growth of emerging markets could help power GE's revenue sharply higher in coming years, leading to even more robust and sustainable gains in the company's earnings, and a share price of around 50, more than 30% above current levels. Within five years Fairfield, Conn.-based GE will get 55% to 60% of its revenue from outside the U.S., compared with 50% now. \"Whenever I feel bad about the company, I leave the country,\" Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt recently told clients and suppliers. \"They love us outside the U.S.\" \u001d  GE also is widely admired at home, with one glaring exception: on Wall Street, where its shares have been stuck in the mud for years. At 37.45, the stock (ticker: GE) sits right where it traded in 2004, and sharply below its 2000 peak of 60. General Electric sports one of the biggest market capitalizations in the world -- $385 billion -- but its failure to outperform the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, which has doubled from its 2002 lows, has earned it the sobriquet \"the stock everyone loves to hate.\" \u001d  A recent report by Citigroup analyst Jeffrey Sprague has ignited a debate about the merits of spinning off certain GE divisions to enhance the company's value. GE's response has been muted so far, but the drumbeat for action could grow louder if the stock stays put, especially as the broad market soars. \u001d  The knocks on GE are many, and some are justified. It's a mega-cap stock in a market that has favored small and midsize stocks. It's a conglomerate that makes everything from jet engines, power turbines and locomotives to movies, mortgages and MRI machines -- at a time when investors value simplicity. \u001d  The quality of its earnings has been criticized, as profits have benefited in recent years from a low 17% tax rate and low loan-loss provisions, trends that might not continue. Also, the company has had to restate earnings back to 2001 to adjust its accounting of derivative transactions. The move was insignificant from a dollars-and-cents perspective, but dented investors' trust nonetheless. \u001d  Above all, the Street is alarmed by the growth of GE's finance business, which has outpaced its more storied industrial operations in recent years. Commercial Finance, which generates large loans, and GE Money, the consumer and small-business financial-services unit, together accounted for 29% of last year's revenue of $163 billion, compared with GE Infrastructure, which contributed 30%, and GE Industrial, which chipped in 21%. But finance generated 51% of the company's profits of $20.8 billion, compared with 39% in 2001. \u001d  Finance companies garner lower price/earnings multiples due to their thin margins and exposure to interest rates, and GE is no exception. Its shares trade for 17 times 2007 expected earnings of $2.22 a share, down from about 28 times earnings in 2001, the year Immelt took the reins from the legendary Jack Welch. \u001d  Yet GE -- and the world -- have changed greatly since the Immelt era began, in ways that make the company far more valuable and suggest the future will be kinder to its stock. No company of its size can change its spots quickly, but GE has made big moves to alter its business mix. Among other things it has sold off slow-growing units like insurance and plastics, and beefed up faster growers such as health care and aerospace. This year alone, GE sold GE Plastics to a Saudi chemicals company, and bought the laboratory-diagnostics business of Abbott Laboratories (ABT). \u001d  Far more important, the global economy is growing by a healthy 4% a year, and emerging economies by even more, creating new and inviting markets for GE's industrial and infrastructure products. The company's flagship infrastructure segment enjoys operating margins of nearly 20%, and is likely to see sales grow by 15% to 20% annually in the next few years. \u001d  As a welcome consequence of these trends, GE has reached the so-called tipping point, where the profit contributions from its non-financial businesses are poised to exceed those from finance. \"For the first time in maybe 20 years, our set of industrial businesses can grow equal to or faster than our financial businesses,\" Immelt says. \u001d  That's good news for the company's earnings, and its shares. GE has guided analysts to expect earnings per share of $2.18 to $2.23 this year, up from $2 in 2006, while the Street has penciled in profits of $2.49 for 2008 and $2.80 for '09. Immelt won't comment on estimates for future years, except to say that \"every expectation I would have is that '08 looks like '07,\" so long as the global economy stays the course. \u001d  Al Beimfohr, a principal at Knightsbridge Asset Management in Newport Beach, Calif., notes that GE is expected to earn $3.20 a share in 2010, and yields 3%. Apply today's price-earnings multiple to those profits, he says, and add in GE's annual dividend of $1.12 a share, and the shares could be worth a price in the mid-50s in three years. That would represent a total return of 15% a year. \u001d  The bullish case for GE doesn't require multiple expansion, but fans such as Jack De Gan, a money manager at Harbor Advisory in Portsmouth, N.H., argue the company ought to trade at a premium to the market. Its earnings have been more stable and faster-growing over the long term than those of the S&P 500, and its debt is rated triple-A. \"GE's stock tends to outperform when margins are increasing and earnings per share exceed the S&P 500,\" he says, noting that GE is the firm's biggest holding. \u001d  Wall Street's gloomy view notwithstanding, GE's profit outlook probably is better today than it has been in years. Just consider the worldwide surge in travel, and its implications for GE's aviation business. \u001d  Ascend, a London-based aviation consultant, estimates the world's Western-built commercial-airline fleet will increase by about 27%, or 5,900 planes, in the next eight years, mostly in response to huge demand from Asia. The Asian market also is driving the growth of the jet-leasing industry. John McMahon, CEO of Genesis Lease (GLS), a jet lessor in which GE has an 11% stake, says lease rates are rising 5% to 10% a year, and demand for planes \"far exceeds\" deliveries from manufacturers, whose backlogs stretch out three to five years. \u001d  In addition, the U.S. airline industry is undergoing a revival. Many carriers are in the black again, but with 40% of the nation's fleet averaging 18 years of age, their upgrade needs are substantial, says Roger King, an airline analyst at CreditSights. He figures that U.S. carriers need to spend $14 billion a year on planes, or $280 billion in the next 20 years, just to keep the fleet's mean age at 12 years. Opportunities for airplane suppliers are \"outstanding,\" he adds. \u001d  GE's jet-engine business and GE Commercial Aviation Services, its jet-leasing business, will be prime beneficiaries, both at home and abroad. GECAS already leases about 1,450 jets. \u001d  Rising demand for power generation in the U.S. and elsewhere will be another big driver of GE's earnings in coming years. The Edison Electric Institute, a utility-industry association, projects that capital expenditures of investor-owned utilities, some 75% of the industry, will rise 15% this year, to about $70 billion. The EEI sees \"a steadily increasing trajectory for capital expenditure for some time to come.\" In addition to greater electricity demand, U.S. utilities must make up for below-average investment rates in the early years of the decade. \u001d  \"The U.S. power market has turned up pretty dramatically,\" says Douglas Egan, chairman and CEO of Competitive Power Ventures in Silver Spring, Md., a builder and manager of power plants around the country, and a GE client. Electricity usage has grown to the point where excess power capacity soon will be largely absorbed. The market for turbines, a GE specialty, is getting tighter, and \"we expect we'll need a fair amount of turbines in the next few years,\" Egan says. \u001d  The developing world's appetite for new power plants and equipment, as well as other infrastructure projects, will dwarf that of the U.S. and Western Europe in the next decade. China alone is expected to build about 25 airports, Immelt notes. The Chinese Ministry of Railways spent nearly $20 billion on railway construction last year, according to the government-controlled Xinhua News Agency. Passenger transport grew 8.5%, while cargo rose nearly 7%. \u001d  China plans to build more than 200 railway projects in the next five years, involving a total investment of more than $150 billion. \u001d  India is no slouch, either. The nation's state railway said in May's International Railway Journal that it expects freight traffic to rise 50%, and passenger traffic by 35% in the next five years. India will invest $45 billion to $50 billion to accommodate that growth. \u001d  In a recent interview with Barron's Immelt said, \"You've got emerging-market countries investing in new capacity, and developed countries investing to fix capacity.\" \u001d  He notes that GE's business in India will increase by 30% this year, and \"could grow at that level for a number of years.\" Immelt sees GE's infrastructure revenue rising by 10% a year in the next five to 10 years, with the overseas portion of sales increasing by 10% to 15% \"for a long time.\" \u001d  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"66128b912665171579d159574ae08b67","symR":["BARC.LN","BCS","CS","CSGN.VX","ENE","MER","CH0012138530","GB0031348658","US5901881087"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"SEC Supporting Enron Shareholders In US High Crt Case -Report","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T22:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BARC.LN","BCS","CS","CSGN.VX","ENE","MER","CH0012138530","GB0031348658","US5901881087"],"IndustryCodes":["BAN","BNK","ELC","GAS","SCR","XDJGI","XFFX","XFT1","XGTI","XNYA","XRUS","XSMI","XSP5","XST5","XSTF"],"Story":"\b \u001d  WASHINGTON (AP)--The Securities and Exchange Commission has decided to support shareholders suing Wall Street banks for damages over Enron Corp.'s (ENE) collapse in a significant case before the Supreme Court, according to a newspaper report Saturday. \u001d  The Enron shareholders' $40 billion lawsuit contends that Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER), Barclays PLC (BCS) and Credit Suisse Group (CS) should be held equally liable as Enron Corp. as participants in the energy company's massive accounting fraud. Thirty states took the shareholders' side, and the SEC's widely awaited position has been viewed by some observers as a key test of the agency's leanings on questions of investor protection under Chairman Christopher Cox. \u001d  The SEC has asked the Justice Department's solicitor general, who represents the government's view in Supreme Court cases, to file a court brief in support of the Enron shareholders' position, The Washington Post said, citing unnamed people familiar with the SEC's decision. \u001d  SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment Saturday. \u001d  In recent weeks, unions, state regulators and plaintiffs' attorneys have been pressing the SEC to intervene in the case on the side of the Enron shareholders. \u001d  The shareholders appealed to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled in March that they cannot proceed with their class-action lawsuit. The high court is expected to hear arguments in the case in its next term that begins in October. \u001d  Dan Newman, a spokesman for Enron plaintiffs' law firm Lerach Coughlin, said Saturday the firm had not been informed of the SEC's intention to support the shareholders' position. \u001d  \"But if it's true that the SEC has affirmed their long-standing opinion that all fraudsters can be held accountable, it's a positive step for investors, taxpayers, financial markets and victims of corporate misconduct,\" Newman said. \u001d  Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, filed bankruptcy in December 2001 when accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of dollars in debt. The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension plans. \u001d  The attorneys representing the shareholders argue that the Wall Street investment banks played key roles in Enron's \"scheme to defraud.\" Under a 1995 law, a single defendant can be held liable for paying the entire amount of damages if the judge determines that the defendant knowingly violated the securities laws. \u001d  The SEC's position in the case appears to be in line with its legal arguments in recent years in lower courts. The agency has said that an investment bank may be deemed a \"lead violator\" if it intentionally engaged in a deceptive act in a scheme to defraud shareholders. The idea expounded by the SEC was that sort of deception can be made by acts as well as words. \u001d  Still, a number of union leaders, investor advocates and politicians voiced concern in recent months that the SEC could refrain from taking a stance in the case or side with the investment bank defendants. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 18:04 ET (22:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"6708ff2a78b05eb61d6bbf34b3713485","symR":["SLB"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Gunmen Kidnap 4 Foreign Oil Workers In S Nigeria -Police -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T09:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLB"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  The U.K. embassy in Nigeria had no information on a missing Briton, and the company and other embassies weren't immediately reachable for comment. \u001d  In what appeared to be a first, the gunmen wore uniforms that resembled those of one of Nigeria's two police forces, and they were able to enter the compound and leave again without firing a shot, said Ogbaudu, speaking by telephone. \u001d  He noted that both uniforms - black for regular officers and green for elite mobile police known by the abbreviation Mopol - are simple in appearance and easily duplicated.

Violence continued Saturday, with gunmen seizing four more foreign hostages, and the main militant group insisted it wasn't ending its struggle. \u001d  After the one-month grace period, \"we will resume attacks on installations and oil workers in the delta with greater purpose,\" the MEND spokesman wrote in an e-mail to reporters. \u001d  Officials in Yar'Adua's nascent administration were not available for comment. \u001d  While the southern Niger Delta region has long been roiled by violence and militant activity, the MEND militants have brought the violence to a new level. \u001d  Armed with heavy weaponry and schooled in sophisticated military and propaganda tactics, the militants have blown up oil installations and attacked boats carrying oil workers. \u001d  Their 18 months of attacks have cut nearly one-third of Nigeria's usual 3 million barrel-per-day production, helping send prices toward all-time highs on international markets. \u001d  While ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo branded the militants criminals and made no mention of the region in his farewell speech to the nation last week after eight years in power, Yar'Adua made clear upon taking over that he believed the crisis in the Niger Delta was one of his stiffest challenges. \u001d  More than 200 foreigners have been seized since MEND launched its campaign. Criminal gangs with no obvious political aims have taken up the practice this year. \u001d  In announcing its intention to halt attacks, MEND released the six hostages it admitted to holding, saying the liberation of the four Italians, one American and one Croatian taken hostage May 1 was an olive branch to the government. \u001d  The group said it would continue the kidnappings of foreigners, which have become a near-daily occurrence and no longer affect oil prices overseas. But it said Saturday's release showed \"a preparedness to dialogue with a willing government.\" \u001d  The Italian foreign ministry confirmed the hostages' release, saying they were with officials from their employer, U.S.-based Chevron Corp. (CVX). \u001d  Kidnappings continued in the region over the weekend, with gunmen wearing security force garb abducting four foreign oil workers - a Briton, a Pakistani, a Dutch national and a French citizen - from their compound in the southern region's main city, police said. \u001d  The gunmen wore uniforms that resembled those of one of Nigeria's two police forces, and they were able to enter the compound and leave again without firing a shot, said Rivers State Police Commissioner Felix Ogbaudu, speaking by telephone. \u001d  He noted that both uniforms - black for regular officers and green for elite mobile police known by the abbreviation Mopol - are simple in appearance and easily duplicated.

An investor must be patient. But when a situation finally arises where the probabilities are heavily weighted in favor of an investment, he adds, the patient investor should act decisively. \u001d  That's the apparent situation in energy  -- opportunities abound and the probabilities definitely pointinthe investor's favor. \u001d  Last month, at least four U.S.-based oil refineries unexpectedly had major operational problems. Gasoline inventories continued to decline to levels well below the five-year average. They now stand more than 6% below the levels in the same period last year. \u001d  While inventories dropped, demand for gasoline in the U.S. kept climbing. It increased year-over-year by more than 2%. Measured by days of supply, inventories fell to under 21 days of demand -- the lowest level in the last 50 years. \u001d  Refining processes have become much more complex. When a processing link in the refining sequence breaks down many times the whole unit has to be shut down or is forced to run on a reduced-output basis. The last new refinery was built in the U.S. over 30 years ago, so unexpected equipment failures frequently occur. \u001d  One possible stock play on creaky refining infrastructure is Tulsa's Matrix Service Company (ticker: MTRX), which provides repair and maintenance services to the refining, distribution and pipeline sectors. \u001d  The picture is similar worldwide: Demand for crude oil continues to increase with economic growth, while productive capacity grows more slowly. \u001d  The International Energy Agency forecast last month that daily global demand for oil will increase by 1.8%, or 1.5 million barrels per day, to 86 million barrels a day in 2007. If total daily oil demand does reach or exceed that level by later this year supply will have a hard time keeping pace. \u001d  Mexico announced last month that production from the Cantarell field, the second largest one in the world by output, declined 17% in March from year-earlier levels. This decline was mitigated by increases in production from the nearby KZM field. Total crude oil production year-over-year from Mexico was down 5%. Venezuela nationalized its oil fields last month, taking control from the major oil firms that had been operating and developing them. Nigeria, exporting over 1 million barrels of oil per day to the U.S., recently completed elections that were deeply flawed. While the ruling party won in a landslide, opposition parties have promised mass protests. Violence continues to flare in many oil-producing regions. \u001d  Saudi Arabia, considered the only country in the world with the capacity to lift production easily, announced it might not increase crude oil output after 2009. Some analysts have expressed concern about the health of its Ghawar field-the largest producing site in the world -- and the new statements only raise more questions about the ability of the Saudis to increase production. \u001d  The decline in production from major fields will not be reversed quickly. Technology can enhance production but it also accelerates the depletion of existing fields. \u001d  What companies can benefit? Those that are able to ratchet up production to meet demand. A domestic crude-oil producer that fits the bill is Arena Resources (ARD), which has increased production of oil and equivalents by 76% year-over-year and is well positioned for further gains. \u001d  In general, natural gas, too, is waning. The rate of decline for conventional wells is rising: High production is followed by rapid exhaustion. Technology -- including directional drilling, fracturing and 3D seismic imaging-allows producers to maximize their production rates. As a result many conventional wells are emptied at a pace unimaginable two decades ago. Annual decline rates that were 14% in 1990 are now nearly 31%, and rising. \u001d  These sorts of declines have hastened the shift to unconventional sources, such as shale gas, tight sands and coalbed methane. Unconventional resources comprised 56% of domestic gas supply in 2005, up from 22% in 1990. Extraction from these resources generally requires more support from services. \u001d  Among the service beneficiaries: OMNI Energy Services (OMNI) (seismic); Pioneer Drilling (PDC) (drilling); and Natural Gas Services Group (NGS) (compression). \u001d  The global market for liquefied natural gas is expected to more than double in the next five years due to rapid growth in Asian demand. A speculative play is InterOil Corporation (IOC), a small firm with nine million acres under license in Papua, New Guinea, site of a potentially significant natural gas find. \u001d  Charlie Munger wouldn't put Berkshire Hathaway's money into these kinds of stocks because the companies are too small to affect the huge insurer's performance. But global energy trends are creating opportunities where, to paraphrase Munger, probabilities strongly tilt in favor of the investor. And the patient investor should act decisively. \u001d  --- \u001d  JOSEPH DANCY, an adjunct professor of energy law at Southern Methodist University, runs the LSGI Venture Fund (LsgiFund.com).

Results of the Phase III study, led by the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and supported by Schering-Plough, were presented today by Alexander Eggermont, M.D., Ph.D. at the 43rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. \b \u001d  \"Advanced stage melanoma remains difficult to treat and a need still exists to find treatment options,\" said Alexander Eggermont, M.D., Ph.D., lead investigator and head of the department of surgical oncology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. \"These findings demonstrate the benefit of an increased relapse-free survival (RFS) despite no difference in overall survival.\" \b \u001d  Median RFS was 34.8 months in the pegylated interferon alfa-2b arm vs. 25.5 months in the observational arm (p-value 0.01). Median distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was 45.6 months in subjects receiving pegylated interferon alfa-2b therapy versus 36.1 months in observational arm (p-value 0.11). \b \u001d  The response to therapy appeared to be most pronounced in a subgroup of subjects with only microscopic nodal involvement (patients with positive sentinel node(s) who experienced both increased relapse-free survival (RFS) (p-value 0.02) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (p-value 0.03). This group of patients constituted \b \u001d  43 percent of the trial population. At present, because of the increased use of sentinel node staging(1), this patient population largely constitutes the majority of patients diagnosed with stage III disease. \b \u001d  In the study, participants reached a median 88 percent and 83 percent relative dose intensity, or percent of planned dose intensity, during the induction and maintenance phases, respectively. Forty percent (251 subjects) ceased pegylated interferon alfa-2b therapy due to toxicity or patient's withdrawal of consent, while approximately 23 percent of subjects continued into year 4 and 5 of treatment. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities, mostly grade 3 in severity, were reported in 45 percent of subjects in the pegylated interferon alfa-2b arm versus \b \u001d  12 percent in the observational arm. These events included primarily Grade 3 fatigue, hepatotoxicity and depression. An ECOG 0-1 Performance Status was maintained in 83 percent of patients during the maintenance phase. These data represent the planned final analysis with a median follow-up of 3.8 years; study participants will be followed for survival for a total of 10 years. \b \b    About the Study \b \u001d  This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of long-term pegylated interferon alfa-2b vs. observation. Researchers enrolled 1,256 subjects with stage III melanoma. Participants were given pegylated interferon alfa-2b at a dose of 6 microgram/kg/week for an eight week induction phase followed by 3 microgram/kg/wk (maintenance phase), for total treatment duration of 5 years. \b \u001d  \"We are pleased with the results of this important study,\" said Robert J. Spiegel, M.D., chief medical officer and senior vice president, Schering-Plough Research Institute.  \"Patient follow-up will continue to assess long-term treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and overall survival.\" \b \b    About Peg Interferon \b \u001d  Pegylated interferon alfa-2b is not approved in the United States for treatment of melanoma.  In the United States, pegylated interferon alfa-2b is indicated for use alone or with ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients with compensated liver disease who have not been previously treated with interferon alpha and who are at least 18 years of age. \b \u001d  Interferon is a protein produced naturally by white blood cells that stimulates the growth of certain disease-fighting blood cells in the immune system. Pegylated interferon is a longer-acting form of interferon. It is made by attaching an inert molecule called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, to the alpha interferon molecule. This process increases the size of the interferon so it is eliminated from the body more slowly. Pegylation allows for once- weekly dosing rather than the three-times-weekly dosing required for standard interferon. \b \u001d  Schering-Plough Corporation is a global science-based health care company with leading prescription, consumer and animal health products.

But most analysts agree that some upside remains in Australia's resources sector, as it continues to ride the China-generated mining boom. \u001d  Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index, recently around 6,300, has more than doubled since May 2003, fueled by an economy in its 17th year of expansion, a flurry of private-equity-driven takeover plays and an unemployment rate at a 32-year low. At the same time, the inflationary pressures that prompted three interest-rate hikes in 2006 now appear relatively contained. \u001d  Says Chris Richardson, a director of consultancy Access Economics, \"Things are strikingly sweet and will [likely] stay so for at least 12 months, but . . . the risks in this market are bigger than most people allow.\" Shane Oliver, AMP Capital Investors' chief economist, sees the bull market entering its third and final phase, in which it will rise \"faster than earnings on the back of overexuberance and investor enthusiasm.\" Yet, he adds, Australian resource stocks have been relative underperformers despite booming commodity prices. \u001d  BHP Billiton (ticker: BHP.Australia) and Rio Tinto (RIO.Australia), two of the world's largest miners, are trading, respectively, around 12 and 13 times current-year earnings.That compares with close to 19 times for Australia's top 200 industrial stocks -- up from about 14 a year ago. The view that BHP and Rio are cheap has sparked speculation that they could fall prey to private-equity buyouts. The possibility of BHP taking out its smaller rival Rio in an A$100 billion-plus deal, has also been contemplated by analysts, along with speculation that Rio could be eyeing Canadian aluminum producer Alcan (AL). \u001d  Credit Suisse analysts estimate that BHP is trading on a P/E of 6.9 times, based on a 12-month forward curve that plots commodities and currency -- well below its recent 8 to 12 range. This suggests that the stock could be rerated to as much as A$54 a share. However, the broker's 12-month target price is A$37.58. \u001d  A strengthening Australian dollar -- near a 17-year high against the greenback -- creates a headwind for the global miners. But this is partially offset by commodity prices, which tend to rise in tandem with the local dollar. \u001d  But offshore earnings of Australian companies without such a natural hedge are at risk. Michael Birch, a portfolio manager at Wallace Funds Management in Sydney, says that companies whose earnings could be crimped include slot-machine maker Aristocrat Leisure (ALL.Australia), insurer QBE Insurance Group (QBE.Australia) and retailer Billabong International (BBG.Australia). Stocks that could benefit from a lower cost base include food and beverage group Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AustraliaAU), transport group Toll Holdings (TOL.AustraliaAU) and airlines Qantas Airways (QAN.Australia) and Virgin Blue Holdings (VBA.Australia). \u001d  As for private-equity firms, the failure of some recent deals, such as the TPG and Macquarie Bank-led A$11 billion bid for Qantas, has led a few market watchers to wonder whether their influence has peaked. However, Oliver says that, in the near term, three key buyout attractions remain: low capital costs, high return on capital and underleveraged companies. \u001d  --- \u001d  Susan Murdoch is a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires in Melbourne. \u001d  --- \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"73091f229c359de8170229bafbf4d0b6","symR":["CEPH"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Cephalon Arsenic Drug Effective At Treating Leukemia -Study","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T23:16:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["CEPH"],"IndustryCodes":["DRG","XDJGI","XNQ1","XRUS"],"Story":"\b \u001d  By Jennifer Corbett Dooren \u001d  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \b \u001d  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Adding an arsenic compound made by Cephalon Inc. (CEPH) to other treatments for adults with a rare form of leukemia significantly improved survival, according to final results of a study presented Saturday. \u001d  Earlier this year, the National Insitutes of Health released preliminary results of the study so that doctors could consider adding the drug as part of early treatment for the disease. \u001d   Cephalon sells the arsenic compound under the brand name Trisenox. It is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with APL, but only after they failed previous treatment with other drugs. \u001d  The study involved patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, which is diagnosed in about 1,500 people each year. Overall the results of the study, which was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting, showed that adults with previously untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia, or APL, who had standard chemotherapy to induce remission of their disease and then received the injectable chemotherapy drug arsenic trioxide to maintain remission lived longer than those who only received standard chemotherapy. \u001d  The study involved 582 patients who were enrolled between June 1999 and March 2005. Patients were divided into groups, with some receiving standard treatment and others also receiving arsenic trioxide. \u001d  The study showed the percentage of adult patients who remained alive and in remission, or free of relapse of their leukemia, three years after diagnosis was 81% for those whose treatment included arsenic trioxide, compared with 66% of patients who received standard treatment. The study was led by Bayard Powell, M.D., the section head of hematology and oncology at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. \u001d  According to the National Cancer Institute, standard chemotherapy regimens produce complete remission rates of approximately 70% among patients with APL, meaning the leukemia isn't detectable after initial treatment.

Data on SUTENT(R) (sunitinib malate), as well as the investigational compounds CP-751,871 and axitinib (AG-013736), were presented at the 43rd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. \b \u001d  \"Pfizer is committed to developing innovative treatments for people with non-small cell lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in the United States,\" said Charles Baum, MD PhD, head of oncology development at Pfizer. \"We are encouraged by the positive data presented today, which support our multi-faceted approach to targeting cancer cells.\" \b \b   Sunitinib malate Data \b \u001d  New data were presented from a phase II study demonstrating the anti-tumor activity of sunitinib malate, a multi-kinase inhibitor with anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative activity. The study examined the safety and efficacy of single-agent sunitinib malate (37.5 mg/day given on a continuous dosing schedule), in 47 previously treated patients with advanced, recurrent NSCLC, who had received one to two prior chemotherapy regimens. The objective response rate was 2.1 percent. 17 percent of patients had stable disease, and observed median overall survival was 37.1 weeks. The study also showed median progression-free survival of 12.3 weeks, and demonstrated a tolerable safety profile. Most common adverse events included fatigue, dyspnea and diarrhea. \b \u001d  These findings further support the rationale for evaluating the role of sunitinib malate in advanced NSCLC in a phase III program which Pfizer plans to initiate later this year. \b \b   CP-751,871 Data \b \u001d  Also presented was an interim analysis of an ongoing, phase II, randomized, non-comparative, multi-center study of CP-751,871. This study evaluated 73 patients with late-stage NSCLC. 46 percent of patients treated with CP-751,871 combined with standard care (paclitaxel and carboplatin) achieved an objective response -- meaning the tumor either partially or completely disappeared. In a subset of patients with non-adenocarcinoma (a form of NSCLC), 52 percent of those receiving the combination of CP-751,871, paclitaxel and carboplatin had objective responses. Approximately one-third (32 percent) of patients receiving paclitaxel and carboplatin alone had objective responses. CP-751,871 was well tolerated as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin; the most common adverse events were hyperglycemia, fatigue, neutropenia, and neuropathy. CP-751,871 is part of a treatment approach known as signal transduction, which blocks specific cellular signals important to cancer cell growth and survival. CP-751,871 targets and inhibits signaling on the IGF-1R pathway. \b \u001d  \"Non-small cell lung cancer is a complex cancer with limited treatment options,\" said Daniel Karp, MD, Professor of Thoracic/Head & Neck Medical Oncology at the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center. \"It is very exciting to be working with this new class of compounds targeted at what appear to be a critical pathway in the development of lung cancer. The data presented at ASCO on CP-751,871 support further research in an effort to expand the range of therapies available to physicians, allowing them to better tailor their treatment approach to each individual patient.\" \b \b   Axitinib Data \b \u001d  Promising results were also seen with axitinib, an oral and selective inhibitor of VEGFR 1, 2, 3 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, 3). An open-label, multi-center phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of axitinib in 32 patients with advanced NSCLC, 78 percent of whom had received prior chemotherapy. Axitinib demonstrated activity as a single agent with an objective response rate of 9 percent and median overall survival of approximately 15 months. Axitinib was also well-tolerated in this population. The most common adverse events were fatigue, anorexia, diarrhea and hypertension. Axitinib is part of the therapeutic approach known as anti-angiogenesis, which means it works by inhibiting blood vessel formation, thereby starving tumors of blood and nutrients needed for growth. \b \b   PF-3512 676 \b \u001d  The company is also developing PF-3512 676, a novel immunotherapeutic based on Toll-Like Receptor 9 agonism. Of the agents Pfizer is investigating for NSCLC, this is in the most advanced stage of development. Data is not being presented at ASCO but accrual of two phase III clinical trials was recently completed. \b \b   PF-676 \b \u001d  PF-676 is a toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 agonist, which stimulates dendritic cells to trigger a cytokine and chemokine cascade and subsequent T-cell activation. Two phase III clinical trials of PF-676, one with paclitaxel plus carboplatin, the other with gemcitibine plus cisplatin, began recruiting patients in November 2005 and completed accrual in April 2007. These studies are international, multi-center, open-label, two-arm, randomized phase III trials. The total enrollment for each study is approximately 800 patients. \b \b   About SUTENT(R) (sunitinib malate) \b \u001d  SUTENT is a multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate. \b \u001d  Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT. \b \u001d  Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. \b \u001d  Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with standard antihypertensive therapy. CBCs with platelet count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with SUTENT. \b \u001d  In an ongoing clinical trial of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), fatal pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in two patients, both with squamous cell histology. SUTENT is not approved for use in patients with NSCLC. \b \u001d  The most common adverse reactions are fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspensia, abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding. \b \u001d  For more information on SUTENT and Pfizer Oncology please visit www.pfizer.com. \b \u001d  DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information contained in this release is as of June 2, 2007.

Expectations for the product have helped fuel a 50% increase in the past 18 months in shares of the Abbott Park, Ill.-based health-care concern, which closed Friday at 56.30. \u001d  But investors may be overlooking the fact that most of Abbott's profits come from its slower-growth, lower-multiple pharmaceutical division, not jazzy technologies. And some prominent doctors have started questioning the safety and efficacy of one of Abbott's best-selling drugs, TriCor, which helps patients lower triglycerides, a type of non-cholesterol fat. \u001d  Several cardiologists and nephrologists with whom we spoke or corresponded via e-mail are concerned that fenofibrate -- the generic name for TriCor -- may cause a decline in kidney function. Kidneys filter the blood and clean it of toxins. Even a small decline in their function might allow plaque to build up in the arteries, and has been shown to result in an increase in cardiac events. \u001d  Other doctors, the Food & Drug Administration and Abbott executives say there is no reason for concern. \"There is no indication that renal [kidney] adverse events are being increased\" due to fenofibrate use, says Jim Stolzenbach, head of dyslipidemia development at Abbott. Fenofibrate has been marketed in Europe since the 1970s through Laboratoires Fournier, now a unit of Brussels-based Solvay Group, which developed the drug. Abbott has marketed it in the U.S. under license since 1998. The company has had no indication of problems. \u001d  TriCor is expected to contribute 5%, or $1.2 billion of Abbott's 2007 estimated revenue of $22.3 billion. But it is likely to chip in 7%, or about 20 cents, of the company's $2.82 a share in earnings. Analysts predict sales of the drug will grow by double digits in the next few years. Abbott also plans to reformulate it and combine it with a statin, to create a third product that takes aim at both triglycerides and bad cholesterol. \u001d  At the least, the debate about fenofibrate may remind investors that Abbott gets more than 70% of its profits from pharmaceuticals, though it enjoys a price-earnings multiple well above the drug-industry average because of its stent business. The company's shares trade for 20 times this year's estimates, and 17.4 times 2008 earnings forecasts of $3.23 a share, compared with Big Pharma's average '08 P-E of 15.1. If Abbott were to trade at a pharma multiple, its stock would be more than 10% lower. If the TriCor business comes under pressure, it will be lower still. \u001d  Concerns about fenofibrate center on creatinine, a substance produced by the muscles and eliminated by the kidneys. A rise in creatinine typically indicates some sort of kidney malfunction. Fenofibrates and other fibrate drugs have been known to result in elevated creatinine levels. A study published in March in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, showed that 19 patients, or 38% in a control group that took fenofibrate, saw their creatinine levels rise above what is considered the upper limits of normal. \u001d  \"There is concern raised by the finding but it is not definitive,\" says Nissen, who most recently raised safety concerns about GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) diabetes drug Avandia, and previously alerted the industry to safety issues surrounding Merck's (MRK) painkiller, Vioxx. Though further tests would need to be done to say definitively that TriCor harms the kidneys, Nissen doesn't prescribe the drug, noting \"I have concerns about its safety.\" \u001d  Dr. Joanne Bargman, a nephrologist and professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, published a paper a few years ago noting some of her patients with kidney insufficiency experienced worsening function while on fibrates. Their creatinine and urea levels both rose. \"I suspect fibrates have one of the most unrecognized potentials for nephrotoxicity,\" she says. \u001d  Bargman doesn't recommend fibrates for patients with kidney problems, and suggests monitoring creatinine levels in all TriCor users. Abbott warns that patients with serious kidney disease should not take TriCor. \u001d  Nissen's findings were of particular note, as they came in the wake of a correction to a major study of diabetics who took fenofibrate for five years, known as the FIELD study. The original write-up on the FIELD study, which was supported by a grant from Laboratories Fournier, acknowledged that fenofibrate had failed to decrease deaths in diabetics caused by coronary heart disease. However, the study still was deemed a success because it showed a 19% reduction in coronary-heart-disease events and a 15% reduction in total cardiovascular events among patients who took fenofibrate. \u001d  The FIELD study data, published in 2005, were adjusted to account for the fact that more patients took statins in the placebo group than the fenofibrate group. But a correction to the study in October indicated the statin adjustment was done improperly. As a result, the reduction of coronary-heart-disease events fell to 9%, and the decrease in total cardiovascular events to 4%. \u001d  \"The drug did not work in the study,\" says Dr. Howard Weintraub, Clinical Director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at New York University Medical Center. Creatinine levels also rose for patients in the FIELD study, which has left Weintraub questioning whether patients taking fenofibrates experienced reduced kidney function, and whether that caused a build-up in arterial plaque that offset the drug's benefits. The authors of the FIELD study are analyzing kidney function in patients now, and are expected to publish their findings. \u001d  \"There is no indication that the poor result (from the FIELD study) was due to renal harm,\" says Abbott's Stolzenbach. He also points to some of the study's positive outcomes, including a 21% decline in coronary revascularisation, or angioplasty, a decline in retinopathy requiring laser treatment (retinopathy is a common eye disorder in diabetics), and a decline in albuminuria (protein in the urine), which indicates the kidneys may be improving. \u001d  A Solvay spokesman indicated in an e-mail that \"fenofibrate treatment had a particularly beneficial effect\" in patients with no prior cardiovascular disease. He noted there were 25% fewer coronary events and 19% fewer CVD events in these patients. \u001d  Dr. Michael Davidson, executive medical director at Radiant Research, a pharmaceutical-research company, and director, preventitive cardiology, at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine, also doesn't believe fenofibrates cause kidney malfunctions. He notes that renal failure occurred less frequently in the group taking fenofibrate in the FIELD study than in the placebo group. \u001d  It is unclear whether the increase in creatinine results from a decrease in kidney function or an increase in creatinine production by the muscles as a result of taking fenofibrate, Davidson says. Once fenofibrate is stopped, creatinine levels return to normal. \"We don't see any increase in adverse events related to an increase in creatinine levels,\" he adds, noting there aren't many drugs available to lower triglycerides. \"We have to do the best we can with what we have.\" \u001d  TriCor is Abbott's fourth-largest drug. It's No. 1 seller is Humira, for rheumatoid arthritis, which JPMorgan estimates will contribute $2.8 billion of revenue this year. Sales could grow by 20% or more in coming years as the company applies to use it for other indications. Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals last year, which should boost '07 growth. \b \u001d  Abbott's nutritional business will contribute 19% of revenue, and includes several well known baby-formula brands. Revenue will be flat this year, rising by mid-single digits thereafter, according to analysts. \u001d  Abbott has agreed to sell most of its diagnostics business to General Electric (GE) for $8 billion (see page 25). Its remaining assets will account for 7% of revenue, and are likely to grow at a mid-teens rate. \u001d  The company's fourth division, specialty products, will generate 11% of revenue, but has garnered disproportionate attention because of the superior performance of Abbott's Xience stent in recent studies. Specialty-products revenue is expected to rise 42% this year and 33% next year, before decelerating just as sharply. \u001d  Abbott bulls like Michael Weinstein, a medical-device analyst at JPMorgan, expect the company's shares to trade up to the mid-60s in the next year, as total revenue grows 9% and earnings per share rises by low double-digits. \"Our intent is to provide consistent and reliable top tier growth,\" says Richard Gonzalez, Abbott's president and chief operating officer. \"I think we're undervalued.\" \u001d  That all depends, however, on the P-E multiple you think Abbott deserves. The company theoretically could be worth around 51 a share if its pharma profits, an estimated $2.12 this year, were to fetch 16.6 times earnings, and its other assets were to trade for an average medical-device-industry multiple of 23. Remove 20 cents of profit from TriCor, or even a portion of those earnings, and Abbott's value could fall to 48-49. \u001d  In sum, the stock is pricey at 56, especially as questions about TriCor seem destined to grow. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7570242a3baafea9e0618e918df04c17","symR":["12777.FR","DIS","INTC","QCOM","UMG.XX","VIA","VIAB","FR0000127771","US2546871060","US4581401001","US7475251036","US9255243084"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"=WSJ: Amp'd Mobile Files For Chapter 11 Protection -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T20:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12777.FR","DIS","INTC","QCOM","UMG.XX","VIA","VIAB","FR0000127771","US2546871060","US4581401001","US7475251036","US9255243084"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","CMT","MED","MOV","SEM","XCA4","XDJGI","XDJI","XENX","XES","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b \u001d  Bill Stone, president of Amp'd Mobile, confirmed that the company filed for bankruptcy protection. \u001d  Stone said the company was forced to make the move because its business has been growing fast in the past 6 to 8 months and couldn't keep up with the growth. \u001d  \"We are pretty confident we'll come out stronger,\" Stone said in an interview. \u001d  Amp'd Mobile offers a wide range of videos, music and games to distinguish itself from other carriers.

Consider options contracts on companies that make fiberoptic switches and other gear that phone and cable outfits use to build their networks. \u001d  Barron's Online recently wrote that tech stocks could see a \"meltup\" this summer as short sellers rush to cover their positions. The communications-equipment vendors within the Standard & Poor's 500 Index comprise one out-of-favor group that could pick up between now and late September. The S&P Communications Equipment Index this year has lagged behind the S&P 500, rising only 4.8% versus the index's 8.1%. \u001d  It may not pay to be long-term holders of the stocks if a correction follows the meltup. So here are three other strategies: \u001d  Investors who already own communications stocks can sell covered calls, locking in an exit price for their shares while generating extra income. Those who don't own any can sell put options, making a little money while waiting for the possibility of a meltup. (There is a time-honored adage among put sellers: Don't sell puts on a stock you wouldn't want to own.) Lastly, investors willing to forgo income in return for less risk may sell shares of Nokia (ticker: NOK) or other stocks they already own while buying calls, which give the investor an opportunity to get back into the stock later on if shares do, indeed, experience a meltup. \u001d  Sales at many communications-equipment vendors are growing in the mid-to-high-single digits on a percentage basis, pretty much in line with the 4% by which capital expenditures may rise at service providers this year, according to a recent report by equipment analyst Ittai Kidron with CIBC World Markets in New York. That makes the near-term outlook for communications stocks relatively stable, a good scenario for selling options contracts rather than buying shares outright. \u001d  For those who already own some shares of Ciena (CIEN), which sells fiberoptic equipment to phone companies, a good way to make money without too much risk might be to sell its October calls with a strike price of $35. Based on a call premium of $3.50 per share, that would bring the seller of a call-option contract (on 100 shares) $350 upfront. \u001d  If Ciena shares surge, the call seller would miss out, but he has at least locked in capital gains to date. (Ciena shares are trading at about 24 times next year's estimated earnings per share, below the industry's average 22 times.) \u001d  Substantial income might be made by selling longer-dated put options on Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), in particular, the January puts with a strike price of $10 a share, which could earn the seller $770, based on put premiums of $7.70 a share. \u001d  With a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 13 times next year's expected earnings per sharer, Alcatel's valuation would seem to support more upside than down. The company is the midst of a turnaround, thanks in part to cost-cutting by CEO Patricia Russo. \u001d  Lastly, investors who took Barron's Online's encouragement to buy Nokia shares last fall may want to cash in some profits and buy calls, a strategy known as \"stock replacement.\" Nokia shares are up 40% since that Oct. 17, 2006, article. \u001d  Make no mistake: Generating summer income requires monitoring the contracts that one buys or sells. But if the market is headed for a meltup, followed by a correction, putting a little extra effort into options could be better than holding stocks beyond Labor Day -- only to find the gains have gone the way of a summer romance. \u001d  --- \u001d  Steven Sears, the options editor at Barron's Online, contributed to this report. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7a74a51ecbf686184b020fb413f2ea36","symR":["EOA.XE","EON","HNZ","DE0007614406","US4230741039"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/4) Speaking Of Dividends: Power Trip","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T04:05:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EOA.XE","EON","HNZ","DE0007614406","US4230741039"],"IndustryCodes":["FOD","MUT","OFP","XDAX","XDJGI","XES","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5","XST5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Shirley A. Lazo \u001d  German power and chemicals giant E.ON generated hefty gains in its stock price last week when it took the wraps off a package of strategic initiatives that will return billions of dollars to shareholders. E.ON, which is on track to transform itself from a conglomerate into the world's leading electricity-and-gas utility, has divested assets worth more than $80 billion over the past several years. Investors had been critical of the company's use of its cash, however, and had moved on to other, albeit smaller, European utilities. \u001d  In an effort to win them back, E.ON, with annual sales of some $91 billion, will spend up to $9.4 billion buying as much as 10% of its stock by the end of 2008. E.ON's American depositary receipts, which trade on the Big Board under the ticker EON, set a 52-week high Wednesday of 55.95. \u001d  Furthermore, the company will boost its annual dividend by 10% to 20% through 2010. E.ON paid a gross $1.5123 an ADR May 11 ($1.19321 net), for a 2.73% yield. During the past four years, payouts have climbed by 14% to 22%. Disbursements were initiated in 1998 at the rate of an adjusted 39.2333 cents an ADR. \u001d  In a press release, E.ON said that it would put another $80.58 billion into capital investments by 2010 to expand its \"business and achieve targeted growth in its core European market and adjacent growth regions.\" Its \"extensive new build-and-investment program will increase the company's generating capacity by about 50% by 2010.\" \u001d  Dusseldorf-based E.ON has set a target of raising adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to $16.62 billion by 2010, for an average annual increase of about 10%, from $11.26 billion in 2006. It expects most of the gains to come from cost reductions and new power plants. In three of the past four years, adjusted cash flow has advanced above 10%. \u001d  Since its steady earnings enable it to borrow cheaply, E.ON plans to take on more debt to accomplish its goals. It aims to have three euros (one euro equals $1.34) of what it calls \"economic net debt\" for each euro of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Its current ratio of economic net debt to adjusted Ebitda is 1.5. (The company has $24.39 billion in economic net debt and $15.81 billion in adjusted Ebitda.) Economic net debt includes financial liabilities, plus pension and asset-retirement obligations, minus cash and other funds. \u001d  E.ON plans to invest $8 billion in Turkey, Southeastern Europe and Russia. It had tried to buy Spanish peer Endesa (ELE) for around $56 billion, but will have to settle for a compromise with rival bidders, giving it assets in Spain, France and Italy. Standard & Poor's sees that as a big positive for E.ON, since it believed the price to achieve a merger was too high. \b \u001d  Another dividend increase is on the menu for investors in global food giant H.J. Heinz. The 138-year-old Pittsburgh company boosted its quarterly common payout 8.6% Thursday, to 38 cents a share from 35 cents. This is the fourth consecutive annual hike since Heinz (HNZ)slashed dividends 33% in early 2003 to help lighten its debt load. Disbursement will take place July 10 for holders of record June 25. The stock goes ex-dividend June 21. Heinz has paid uninterrupted dividends since going public in 1946. \u001d  \"This increase reflects the accelerating momentum of our businesses around the world and our commitment to return approximately 60% of earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends,\" said chief executive William R. Johnson. He noted that the new payout gives the stock a 3.2% yield, which puts its return in the top 12% of the S&P 500. The shares, which trade on the Big Board, are near their 52-week high of 48.73, set on April 19. \u001d  Heinz boasts No. 1 or No. 2 brands on five continents, showcased by its namesake ketchup. Looking ahead to fiscal 2008 (ending April 30), Heinz forecasts earnings of $2.54 to $2.60 per share, versus fiscal 2007's $2.38. CEO Johnson said the company plans to launch more than 200 products to meet consumer demand for \"healthy foods.\" \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:05 ET (04:05 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"7a787b8ead9c4e17c5835f5876ac8934","symR":["AGE","ASN","CSV","DELL","DJ","JOYG","SCI","STEI","WB","US2470251099"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/4) The Trader: The Cliffhanger Market","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AGE","ASN","CSV","DELL","DJ","JOYG","SCI","STEI","WB","US2470251099"],"IndustryCodes":["BNK","CPR","CSV","MED","PUB","REA","REI","SCR","TRQ","XDJGI","XFFX","XGTI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5","XSTX"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Kopin Tan \u001d  No, it's not easy. Seriously. Navigating the stock market requires skill, and luck. There's more to it than buying every dip and following the herd. And sometimes -- don't laugh -- stocks go down. It's just that one would never have known watching the market in recent months. \u001d  The government said last week that the economy grew just 0.6% in the first quarter, the dreariest pace in nearly five years. Chinese markets staggered after Beijing tripled taxes on stock tradesto cool speculation. But U.S. stocks marched right on to new heights. \u001d  With the Standard & Poor's 500's March 2000 record within sight, money managers had crowded into the passing lane, overlooking yellow flags like the slowing U.S. economy, rising interest rates, and soaring gasoline prices. Notes from the Federal Reserve's May meeting -- showing policy makers still optimistic about the economy -- provided the ballast buyers needed to step on the pedal. \u001d  The S&P 500 finished the week up 21, or 1.4%, to a fresh all-time high of 1536. The Dow Jones Industrial Average resumed its habitual record smashing and climbed 161, or 1.2%, to 13,668. Both benchmarks have rallied in eight of the past nine weeks, and the Dow stands just 2.4% from the optimistic 14,000 target most bulls had set for year end. \u001d  Small stocks, which began outpacing their bigger peers in mid-May, continued their stealth outperformance. The Russell 2000 Index jumped 24, or 2.8%, to a record at 853. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased 57, or 2.2%, to 2614. Each of the benchmarks enjoyed their best May in years. The Dow is up 4.3% for the month, the S&P 500 up by 3.3%; the Nasdaq, 3.1%; and the Russell, 4%. The S&P 500 has risen in 11 of the past 12 months. \u001d  So where does that take us? To a peak populated by the fretfully invested. Most money managers cannot afford to fall behind this relentless rally, but their discomfort increasingly is evidenced in diligent option hedges and record short bets. \u001d  They're nervous for good reason. The S&P 500 has climbed an impressive 5.5% from its Feb. 22 high, but the rally finds feeble corroboration: The Dow Jones Transportation Average is up just 2.5%; financial stocks are flat; and market breadth recently turned negative for two straight weeks, for the first time since last July. \u001d  Utility stocks, a classic leading market indicator, also suffered their sharpest pullback of this bull market when the Dow Jones Utilities Average tumbled 4% before regrouping. \"A peak in utility stocks can have a long lead time over the rest of the market, often a number of months, so we do not believe this is an imminent negative,\" notes Miller Tabak's chief technical strategist, Philip Roth. But it's another fluttering yellow flag to watch. \u001d  Rising bond yields -- with the 10-year Treasury yield now pushing 5% -- further cuts into the argument that stocks look cheap relative to bonds. \u001d  But the worries were lulled, for now, by the reassuring slosh of liquidity, with deals inked at the usual assertive pace. Last week saw a $22 billion bid for the apartment real-estate trust Archstone-Smith Trust (ticker: ASN), Wachovia's (WB) $7 billion offer for the regional brokerage A.G. Edwards (AGE), and the start of a possible auction for Dow Jones (DJ). See page MW4. Companies also offered hope on the earnings front, with Dell (DELL) posting strong results and trimming 10% of its workforce. Joy Global (JOYG), a mining-equipment company recently profiled in Barron's (\"Chomping Its Way to Paydirt,\" April 23), jumped 10% after it issued a buoyant outlook. \u001d  Sure, China's skid last week wasn't greased by fears of a global-liquidity crunch, as was the case in late February, and the worrisome gross-domestic-product reading has already receded in the rearview mirror. Investors looking ahead saw a more benevolent batch of data last week pointing to increased manufacturing, renewed consumer confidence, and companies' adding 157,000 jobs in May without wage inflation. \u001d  This sets up a delicate equilibrium: wobbly housing and auto sectors supported by the rest of the U.S. economy, whose modest growth is stoked by a weak dollar and strong global demand. How long the stock rally can extend will depend on the durability of this balancing act. And no, it's not easy. Seriously. \b \u001d  Wall Street itself begins at a river and ends at a cemetery, so it's no wonder traders are flocking toward the death business. Funeral services companies are recession-proof and virtually immune to a slowing economy or rising rates -- the market's two biggest fears right now. There's a built-in degree of certainty with the steady supply of customers. And strong cash flow within the fragmented industry makes buyouts plausible and mergers likely. \u001d  So-called \"death-care\" providers have revived over the past year, none more so than Service Corp International (SCI). As the biggest funeral-services provider in the world, the Houston company has become the sector's go-to stock, its $4.1 billion market-cap squarely within buyout firms' sweet spot. \u001d  Shares have jumped 90% since August and are running 32% ahead of their 200-day moving average. The stock is beloved by street analysts, momentum traders, growth investors and even defensive portfolios. But is this as good as it gets? \u001d  While death is inevitable, SCI's continued surge is not. A 2006 acquisition of rival Alderwoods boosted year-over-year profits, but volume on a comparable basis has declined (by 5.5% last quarter, for example). SCI was able to offset that drop by ratcheting up revenue per funeral by 5.9% last quarter to $4,908, and has shrewdly shifted its focus from selling commoditized merchandise to providing more value-added services. \u001d  But gross margins pushing 23% could weaken over time if, for instance, the trend toward cremations continue. The rate of cremations is expected to grow from about one-third today to 50% by 2030, and while companies pad value with memorial services, cremations cost less and offer thinner margins. \u001d  At about 14, SCI shares trade at 27 times projected '07 earnings, versus about 19 times for lesser rivals like Carriage Services (CSV) and Stewart Enterprises (STEI). \u001d  \"Much of the anticipated success for the year is priced into the stock,\" says John Ransom, a once-bullish Raymond James analyst who downgraded the stock last month. \"Moreover, investors may have to brace for deceleration in the second half of 2007,\" after first-quarter cash flow was boosted by large, recently-completed cemeteries, as well as one-time sale of some assets. \u001d  SCI may one day become a compelling buy again. And it's got good geographic reach, with more than 1,500 funeral homes and 400 cemeteries in more than 45 states and eight Canadian provinces. \u001d  But SCI's heft also makes it a more likely acquirer than target in the consolidating field. And debt that is 3.5 times total capital will limit the returns buyout firms can wring from it. Barron's was prematurely cautious about SCI (see \"Drat!

Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth fund (TRBCX). These businesses entered a down cycle after the dot-com crash of 2000. \"GE has been underappreciated,\" he adds, noting that cycles also play to the company's strength. Puglia's fund holds GE stock, and bought more recently at around 35. \u001d  While heavy machinery is sexy again, GE's other businesses also confer advantages. \"When you buy GE you are buying a diversified portfolio [of businesses] for safety and consistency of earnings growth,\" says Matthew McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor in Cincinnati. \u001d  GE Healthcare, for example, which specializes in diagnostics, is \"the demographic place to be,\" says McCormick, whose fund also has been adding to its GE stake. Immelt expects Healthcare sales to grow 10%, and earnings by 10% to 15% this year. Healthcare accounted for 10% of '06 revenue. \u001d  And for all the complaints on Wall Street that GE Money and Commercial Finance drag down the company's valuation, both businesses continue to do well, showing earnings gains of 15% apiece last year. \u001d  Like other GE supporters, Al Beimfohr, of Knightsbridge, thinks the market is unfair in its assessment of these assets. Any buyer would have to pay \"far more\" for them, he says, than GE's current multiple would suggest. \u001d  Longer term, the company's finance units could sustain annual profit growth of 10%, Immelt says. GE Money derives about 75% of its business from overseas, where its market share is low, leaving plenty of room for expansion. \u001d  Subprime-lending problems in its WMC mortgage unit hurt consumer-oriented GE Money in the first quarter, but the company has ended its participation in this dicey corner of the mortgage market. \u001d  One GE business that went through tough times last year was NBC Universal, which includes the company's NBC television properties and its Universal Studios movie and theme-park business. NBCU profits fell 6% on the year, to $2.9 billion, a reflection in part of NBC's fourth-place status among television networks. Profits rose 6% in this year's first quarter, although revenue was flat. GE expects entertainment-division sales, which accounted for 10% of 2006 revenue, to be flat in '07, with profit growth of zero to 5% for the year. \u001d  \"The worst days are behind us,\" Immelt says of NBC, which has had some nice hits, like the TV show Heroes. Still, NBCU's ungainly fit with the rest of the company is at the heart of calls for GE to sharpen its focus on infrastructure, possibly by spinning off divisions. \u001d  A key component of any GE comeback will be margin expansion in the company's industrial business. Last year industrial operating margins rose to 15.5%, compared with 13.5% in 2004. Immelt has said GE will get margins up by one percentage point this year, and surpass the company's previous peak of 18.1% margins in 18 to 24 months. \"It is going to happen,\" he declares. \"It is seared on my forehead and every forehead of every GE manager.\" \u001d  Keith Sherin, the company's chief financial officer, says several factors will contribute to the increase: higher industrial sales, an improved business mix, cost cuts to general and administrative spending and rising service revenue, which is sometimes forgotten by investors. Each big piece of equipment GE sells usually is accompanied by a service contract with profit margins in the high-20% range. Service revenue totaled $33 billion last year. \"Probably the most valuable part of GE is the installed base of equipment we have built,\" Sherin says. \u001d  If GE can achieve its margin goals, profits will keep growing by double digits, just as S&P 500 profit growth settles into the single-digit range. At the same time, the company could benefit from a revaluation of big-capitalization stocks, long prophesied but slow to arrive. In the 12 months ended April, the S&P 500 index doubled the performance of the small-cap Russell 2000 index -- the first time that has happened since the late 1990s. Small- and mid-cap earnings estimates already have dropped to the single digits, says Dirk Van Dijk, research director at Zacks Investment Research. \u001d  As GE's margins expand, look for investors to warm to the shares. After all, with the stock so \"hated\" there are few sellers left, and many would-be buyers on the sidelines. \"GE's P/E has compressed to the point where earnings growth will carry the day,\" says Walter McCormick, head of value equity at Evergreen Investment Management. \"GE is a coiled spring.\" \u001d  The biggest caveat for GE is global growth. The ripple effects of an economic recession in China or India would be felt just as surely in Fairfield. But setbacks in the world's emerging markets also would clobber the stocks of many other companies, which don't offer the strength and diversity of GE's portfolio. \u001d  Immelt has compared his efforts to restructure that portfolio to changing a tire on a moving Ferrari. The image is arresting, but not quite right. GE is more like a lumbering 18-wheeler, which takes awhile to get up to speed but is hard to stop once it gets going. At long last, the gears are starting to shift. Goodbye, mud. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"98eeabf97b3434bf9601c8db7149c465","symR":["DIS","VIA","VIAB","US2546871060","US9255243084"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"=WSJ: Amp'd Mobile Files For Chapter 11 Protection -Source","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T20:47:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DIS","VIA","VIAB","US2546871060","US9255243084"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","XDJGI","XDJI","XFFX","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \b   By Li Yuan \b   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL \b \u001d  Start-up wireless carrier Amp'd Mobile filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late Friday night, according to a person familiar with the situation. \u001d  The move marks the latest of several failed wireless ventures that focused on bringing video, music and other content to cellphones. \u001d  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.) \u001d  Amp'd has close to 200,000 subscribers and has advertised its brand name heavily.

Their answers were used to determine quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity, a pre-defined endpoint. \b \u001d  The analysis showed that patients treated with TORISEL had 38 percent greater time without symptoms and toxicity than those receiving interferon- alpha alone (6.5 months vs. 4.7 months, respectively; P=.00048).  When results of the questionnaires were incorporated into the analysis, patients treated with TORISEL had 23 percent greater quality-adjusted survival time than those receiving interferon-alpha alone, a significant 1.3-month increase (7.0 months vs. 5.7 months, P=.0015). \b \b \b    About Abstract 5033: Correlation of Survival With Tumor Histology, Age and \b    Prognostic-Risk Group for Previously Untreated Patients With Advanced \b    Renal Cell Carcinoma Receiving Temsirolimus or Interferon Alpha \b \b \u001d  Investigators conducted planned and post-hoc analyses to assess the influence of tumor cell type (clear-cell renal cell carcinoma vs. other renal cell carcinomas), age (younger than 65 years vs. 65 years and older) and prognostic-risk group (intermediate risk vs. poor risk) on survival in patients treated with TORISEL or interferon-alpha. \b \u001d  TORISEL increased overall survival and progression-free survival regardless of tumor cell type compared to interferon-alpha.  Median overall survival in patients with clear-cell tumors, the most common form of RCC, was 10.6 months among patients treated with TORISEL versus 8.2 months for interferon-alpha, and median progression-free survival was 5.5 months versus 3.8 months, respectively, as determined by independent assessment.  For patients with other tumor cell types, differences in median overall survival and progression-free survival were even greater.  Median overall survival was more than twice as long in patients treated with TORISEL compared with interferon-alpha (11.6 months vs. 4.3 months), and median progression-free survival was nearly four times longer (7.0 months vs. 1.8 months, respectively). \b \u001d  Among patients younger than 65 years, both overall survival and progression-free survival were longer in those treated with TORISEL (12.0 months vs. 6.9 months and 5.9 months vs. 3.1 months, respectively) compared with interferon-alpha.  There was no statistical difference between the two arms in overall survival or progression-free survival for patients aged 65 and older. \b \u001d  Researchers also examined survival endpoints based on patients' prognostic risk.  About three quarters of patients with advanced RCC enrolled in the TORISEL arm or interferon-alpha arm of the study were classified as having poor prognostic features.  Of these patients, those treated with TORISEL had significantly longer overall survival (10.2 months vs. 6.0 months, P=.0272) and progression-free survival (5.1 months vs. 2.3 months, P=.0440).  The study did not include enough patients with intermediate prognostic factors to allow for meaningful assessment of differences in survival. \b \b    About TORISEL \b \u001d  TORISEL is an mTOR inhibitor indicated for the treatment of advanced RCC. In in vitro studies using cancer cells, mTOR inhibition blocked the translation of genes that regulate the cell cycle. mTOR inhibition also resulted in reduced levels of certain cell growth factors involved in the development of new blood vessels, such as vascular endothelial growth factor. \b \b    Important Safety Information \b \u001d  Hypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms, including, but not limited to anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, and chest pain have been observed with Torisel. \b \u001d  The use of Torisel is likely to result in increases in serum glucose. This may result in the need for an increase in the dose of, or initiation of, insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agent therapy. The use of Torisel may result in immunosuppression.  Patients should be carefully observed for the occurrence of infections, including opportunistic infections.  Live vaccinations and close contact with those who received live vaccines should be avoided. Due to abnormal wound healing, use Torisel with caution in the perioperative period. \b \u001d  Cases of interstitial lung disease, some resulting in death, have occurred with Torisel.  Some patients were asymptomatic and others presented with symptoms and required discontinuation of Torisel treatment and/or corticosteroids, and/or antibiotics. \b \u001d  The use of Torisel is likely to result in increases in serum triglycerides and cholesterol.  This may require initiation, or increase in the dose, of lipid-lowering agents. \b \u001d  Bowel perforation may occur.  Evaluate fever, abdominal pain, bloody stools and/or acute abdomen promptly. Renal failure, sometimes fatal, has occurred.  Monitor renal function at baseline and while on Torisel. \b \u001d  Women of childbearing potential should be advised of the potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant. \b \u001d  The combination of Torisel and sunitinib maleate resulted in excess toxicity. \b \u001d  The most common (incidence greater than or equal to 30%) adverse reactions observed with Torisel are: rash, asthenia, mucositis, nausea, edema, and anorexia.  The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence greater than or equal to 30%) are anemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipemia, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated serum creatinine, lymphopenia, hypophosphatemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated AST, and neutropenia. \b \u001d  Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 and inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect concentrations of the primary metabolite of Torisel.  If alternatives cannot be used, dose modifications of Torisel are recommended.

Savitz \u001d  Everything old is new again. That's how things felt in Carlsbad, Calif., last week at D: All Things Digital, the Wall Street Journal's fifth annual technology conference. Hosted by Journal reporters Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher (the Journal and Barron's are both owned by Dow Jones), D annually attracts the tech sector's best and brightest. This year's speaker lineup was the most glittery yet, featuring a host of industry royalty: Microsoft (ticker: MSFT) Chairman Bill Gates and his college pal, CEO Steve Ballmer; Apple (AAPL) chief Steve Jobs; Cisco Systems (CSCO) boss John Chambers; Revolution Health CEO and former AOL chief Steve Case, and Google (GOOG) CEO Eric Schmidt, among others. There were notable product announcements from Palm (PALM), RealNetworks (RNWK), Microsoft and Apple, and a truly landmark on-stage discussion between Gates and Jobs, moderated by Kara and Walt. (At D, first names are enough, unless you happen to be named Steve.) \u001d  The interview with Gates and Jobs Wednesday night received a flood-tide of press and blog coverage, so I won't eat up many column inches to describe the scene in detail. (You can find video of the event at d.wsj.com; I wrote extensively about the presentations at D on my Tech Trader Daily blog, online at blogs.barrons.com.) But I will tell you that they spent a lot of time reminiscing about the old days, about the crucial role each played in the other's story. \b \u001d  There was a brilliant piece of old video footage that showed a mock \"Macintosh-software dating game\" hosted by an astoundingly young Steve Jobs, interviewing would-be software suitors Bill Gates, Mitch Kapor (from Lotus, publisher of the seminal spreadsheet software 1-2-3) and Fred Gibbons (from Software Publishing, creator of Harvard Graphics). In a nice touch, both Kapor and Gibbons were sitting in the audience last week while Gates and Jobs chatted on stage. \u001d  There weren't huge insights for investors from the discussion, except this one: While both of these companies have struggled at various times, in the long run they have generated huge value for investors by taking risks, keeping a long-term perspective and providing products that their customers want. \u001d  The discussion drew a standing ovation. I wrote on my blog that it felt like a Beatles reunion, but I think in retrospect it felt more like Connors and McEnroe after they went five sets on center court in Flushing Meadows, or Frazier and Ali after pounding each other for 12 rounds. Two champions, graying but nimble, still sparring, linked forever by their shared successes and failures. With Gates getting ready to head into full-time philanthropy, this may have been the last time to get them talking in public; do yourself a favor and watch the video. \b \u001d  D is no Demo; there were only a handful of product announcements, but almost all were worth noting. RealNetworks unveiled a new version of its RealPlayer software, adding the ability to capture -- and then burn -- streaming Web video; I'm guessing that will cause a new round of anxiety about protecting copyrighted content online. Microsoft announced Surface, a coffee-table computer with a cool touch screen, aimed first at hotels and casinos; no game-changer there. \u001d  Apple revealed a deal to give access to YouTube videos via the AppleTV box. While at some level a modest new feature, it underlined Apple's intention to add functionality to AppleTV -- and was symptomatic of the current obsession with YouTube, a subject that came up over and over again in the on-stage conversations. On the day the news came out, by the way, Apple's market value topped $100 billion for the first time. \u001d  After the Gates/Jobs love-in, the biggest buzz at the conference probably was over Palm's introduction of a new device called the Foleo. As I noted in a series of posts on my blog, the Street had been speculating for weeks about the appearance at D by Palm founder Jeff Hawkins, who had promised to unveil a new third category of device for the company to go along with its PDAs and Treo smartphones. Much of the speculation centered on the possible introduction of an ultramobile PC, which was almost but not quite right. \u001d  Palm describes the Foleo as a \"mobile companion.\" It looks like a small laptop, with a full-sized keyboard and small LCD Screen; it is the same width as the Lenovo ThinkPad X60 I am using to write this column, but slightly thinner and about two-thirds as high. But it isn't quite a full-fledged laptop. \u001d  For starters, it runs Linux, not Windows. It has no hard drive, just flash storage, although the company won't say how much. It has some sort of embedded processor as a brain, rather than the X86 chips that power most laptops. The company thinks of it as a way for mobile travelers to do e-mail and browse the Web; the laptop links to your smartphone via Bluetooth, and then syncs up with the e-mail on your device. (It doesn't go directly to Exchange or other back-end e-mail systems.) The device can use WiFi to access the Internet. The Foleo is priced at $599, though it will be $499 initially after a $100 rebate. \b \u001d  The consensus at the show was that the Foleo was a monumental dud: Too pricey to be a companion to a cellphone, but not full-featured enough to replace a full-powered laptop. It didn't help that Hawkins performed one of the all-time bad demos; he talked about the device for 10 minutes before actually demonstrating it; half-way through, people were streaming to the exits. It looked like the 7th inning of a blowout at Chavez Ravine. \u001d  For months now, there have been rumors on the Street that Palm might be up for sale; theoretical suitors include Motorola (MOT) and Nokia (NOK) and various private-equity firms, but the chatter has faded lately. I would not be surprised to see the rumors mill heat up again, though. The Foleo is looking like a loser, which could trigger increased conviction that the company's Treo phones could gain wider acceptance in the hands of a handset maker with deeper pockets. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: eric.savitz@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b18ea80536cdd82e3e49fccc8e2bdb75","symR":["EGLRX","IGLAX","IRFAX","KIRAX","NGREX"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/4) In Real Estate, It's Time To Go Global","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T04:09:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["EGLRX","IGLAX","IRFAX","KIRAX","NGREX"],"IndustryCodes":["REA","REI","ZFU"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Peter Slatin \u001d  Seven fat years. that's what investors in U.S. real-estate investment trusts enjoyed through 2006, as REITs perennially outpaced the broad stock market. Alas, that run is ending. Through 2007's first five months, two key gauges of their performance (the FTSE Nareit Equity REITs index and Morgan Stanley's MSCI U.S. REIT index) were up 2.36% and 3.59%, respectively, versus gains of 7.89% for the S&P 500, 9.39% for the Dow and 7.34% for the Nasdaq Composite. \u001d  Given the state of the U.S. housing market and the concern about the subprime-mortgage morass, this unhappy trend is likely to continue. So, where's the best place for individual U.S. real-estate investors now? Probably abroad, especially if the dollar's weakness persists. \u001d  It's no secret that capital from around the world has flooded into U.S. real estate in recent years. German, Middle Eastern, Australian and Japanese money has bought trophy buildings, major real-estate companies and shares of U.S. REITs. Now, however, some foreign real-estate markets look more enticing than America's. However, tapping into them poses a challenge. \u001d  Intelligently investing in individual properties outside the States requires more knowledge than the typical small investor possesses. And while there's a diverse range of publicly traded foreign-property stocks, information on many is difficult to get, compared with data on their U.S. counterparts. And even when it can be found, it has to be put into the context of local and regional political, business and economic conditions -- something not easily understood without extensive research. \u001d  The best approach might be to invest in a U.S. fund that specializes in foreign properties. What's made this easier is that several major overseas real-estate markets, including those in Japan, France and, just this past January, the U.K., have gone through REITification. Germany will be next. It's gearing up for a phased introduction of the trusts later this year. The existence of such REITs makes it easier for U.S. funds to invest in specific areas of foreign-property markets. \u001d  Barron's looked at dozens of funds that target international real estate. Our goal: to find five that appear particularly attractive. Our picks follow: \b \u001d  The best place to start is in the world of index funds. There has been an explosion of international real-estate indexes in the past few years in anticipation of the creation of such funds. Right on schedule, the first was launched in July 2006 by wealth manager Northern Trust. The Northern Global Real Estate Index Fund (ticker: NGREX), is pegged to the FTSE EPRA/Nareit Global Real Estate index. The index covers 320 stocks, and NGREX, which touts itself as the first fund indexed to the global real-estate market, includes about 95% to 99% of them at any one time. Its holdings are roughly 30% Asian, 50% North American and 20% European, with REITs accounting for about 65% of its portfolio. As of May 30, the fund had net assets of $872 million and had achieved a year-to-date return of 5.8%. Admission is reasonable: The minimum investment is $2,500. \u001d  A relative newcomer is the Kensington International Real Estate Fund (KIRAX), which  has returned 32% since its inception 13 months ago. Through May 30,  it was up 6.7% this year, well above many peers. While the fund is young, Kensington itself has a solid history as a real-estate-investment manager. KIRAX currently has $248 million in assets under management; it's at a point in its growth where it has a bit of heft but also some agility. The fund buys companies with institutional-quality assets and active managements in markets as diverse as the U.K. -- where it likes urban retail-property specialist Shaftesbury (SHB.U.K.) -- and Singapore, where it favors regional player CapitaLand (CAPL.Singapore). Initial investment: $2,000. \u001d  One long-time stalwart of truly global real-estate investing is the Alpine International Real Estate Fund (EGLRX), which has an easily crossed minimum-investment threshold of $1,000. It has returned an average of just under 28% over the past five years. This year, through May, the $1.58 billion fund was up 13.7%. Manager Sam Lieber likes private-equity-type investments, as well as stocks. He invests in a broad range of  assets, ranging from Orient-Express Hotels (OEH) to private-equity player Banyan Tree Holdings. That lets him tap into  deals made by globetrotting, opportunistic investors. \u001d  The biggest name in real-estate mutual funds is Cohen & Steers, and the Cohen & Steers International Realty Fund A (IRFAX) has performed solidly in its short two-year life, with a 7.14% return year-to-date and a 2006 total return of 43.9% (the fund's front load is 4.5%). Like Alpine, the price of admission is just $1,000. Unlike Alpine, the $3.8 billion fund favors blue-chip realty stocks in Europe, Australia and Asia; among its holdings are Australia's Westfield Group (WDC. Australia) and British Land (BLND.U.K.). \u001d  Our final selection, ING Global Real Estate Fund A (IGLAX), has $1.46 billion in net assets. It returned 5.33% this year through May, while offering a 4.01% yield. Its five-year average return is 25.2%. (Its front load is 5.75%.) The fund's hallmark is consistency: Its three-year return is 29.8%. IGLAX -- which has an entry point of $1,000 -- invests primarily in international blue-chips, from U.S. majors like Simon Property (SPG) to Japanese giants like Mitsui Fudosan (8801.Japan) -- a good foundation to build on. \u001d  --- \u001d  Peter Slatin is editor of The Slatin Report, an online real-estate newsletter (www.TheSlatinReport.com). \u001d  --- \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"b3eb68784550155e5ea0addabc80a23f","symR":["DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","AU000000NWS2"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/4) Up & Down Wall Street: Quickie Tour","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T04:06:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["DJ","NWS","NWS.AU","NWSA","AU000000NWS2"],"IndustryCodes":["BRD","MED","PUB","XDJGI","XFFX","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Alan Abelson \u001d  What's up? \u001d  Besides the stock market, of course. Well, as it turns out, quite a few things. None as noteworthy, needless to say, as the Standard & Poor's 500 index hitting a new all-time high, but deserving of passing mention nonetheless. \u001d  In Iraq, according to officially unconfirmed reports-the only kind that are even vaguely reliable from that bloody mess of chaos still parading as a country -- there are plans afoot to turn the surge, which seems only to have intensified the mayhem, into a splurge, once the minor impediment of where to scrape up the necessary additional forces is resolved. \u001d  After all these years, the U.S. and Iran sat down and held a conversation. The only thing they never got around to discussing was Iran's hell-for-leather drive to join the nuclear club. Meanwhile, just in case the negotiations take an errant turn, Iran has been busily adding to its reserves of American hostages: four so far and counting. \u001d  President Bush and Vladimir Putin will indulge in a spot of summiteering early next month in Kennebunkport, Maine. This time, when he peers into Mr. Putin's eyes to evaluate his soul, we respectfully suggest that Mr. Bush insist that the Russian remove his contact lenses. And we trust the president is going to have a taster on hand when the two sit down to dinner. \u001d  Andrei Lugovoi, the ex-KGB agent the British have fingered as the prime suspect for the fatal poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, an unabashed critic of the Kremlin who had fled to Britain from Russia a few years back, cleared up who had actually done away with Litvinenko. It was, charged Lugovoi, none other than the British secret service, in retaliation, perhaps, for having been served some sour borscht by Mrs. Litvinenko. \u001d  Fred Thompson, the former senator and current actor, is throwing his hat into the ring of candidates for the GOP presidential nomination. The smart money is betting that this is one ham that will lay an egg. \u001d  Al Gore, meanwhile, is waiting in the wings, hoping to weigh in as the Democratic choice. Trouble is, unless the call comes soon, at the rate Mr. Gore's waist is expanding, they're going to have to build an addition to the wings. \u001d  An old pal and canny investor, Ron Baron, who runs the eponymous and enormously successful mutual-fund complex, knows a bargain when he sees one: He shelled out a mere $103 million for 40 acres in East Hampton, an all-time record high for residential property. Ron was particularly lucky in that he got the last subprime mortgage extant. \u001d  Wall Street is by no means the only bountiful venue around; quite the contrary, as we've pointed out more than once, the globe is jumping with strong economies and boiling stock markets. The Swedish economy, for example, hasn't been so hot in seven years, and the stock market is up a quite unshabby 10% so far this year. \u001d  No surprise, then, that Stockholm like, oh, say, Greenwich, Conn., is aburst with evidences of obscene abundance (we're grateful to the folks at Canaccord Capital for supplying chapter and worse). Just to cite one example of exquisite excess, Nordic-style: A yoga studio for dogs, where they can enjoy massages and the usual amenities offered by such establishments (Swedish pooches need some relaxation after a trying day helping their masters gleefully count their kronor). \u001d  We'd obviously be remiss in providing even the sketchiest chronicle of significant events if we failed to include the apparent change of heart of the Bancroft family in deciding to consider the $60-a-share offer by Rupert Murdoch for Dow Jones. We profess no inside information, but we must own up to a great melancholy at the prospect of the company changing hands. \u001d  Dow Jones, after all, has been independent for 125 years, and while we haven't been an employee quite that long (it just seems that way to some of our grumpier readers), it has been a dream of a place for a journalist to work. And not least of the reasons has been the judicious stewardship of the Bancrofts, who have quietly but zealously over the generations acted as guarantors of the integrity of The Wall Street Journal and Barron's and an impervious shield against the various malevolent pressures that such publications are inevitably subject to. \u001d  What also made Dow Jones such an enviable place to work was that the company was run by truly dedicated journalists like Warren Phillips and Peter Kann, terrific guys in their own right, possessed of extraordinary professional smarts and admirably unruffled temperaments (they were dealing, after all, with reporters, writers and editors, among humanity's most undisciplined members). \u001d  It particularly pains us to witness Warren's and Peter's infinite lessers, who couldn't run water and are journalists in pretense only, scurry out from under the rocks to besmirch their legacies. Last we checked, Warren and Peter were both human and on occasion erred -- who hasn't? But they were absolutely vital to Dow Jones' evolution into journalistic paragon. And, by any definition, that's an incomparable achievement. \u001d  Despite the big breakthrough by the S&P 500, topping that historic peak reached in the final days of the great 1990s-2000 bubble, and despite signs of stock rapture run amok in the Street, the market lost some vim and vigor as June edged May out of the calendar. A touch of buyers' fatigue, perhaps, or some other mild indisposition. \u001d  Of course, it's always possible that so many investors have gotten rich in such a hurry that they can afford to take four-day weekends. But it's also possible that investors literally had trouble coping with prosperity and read the seemingly bullish news on May employment and the latest survey from the purchasing managers as meaning the Fed would be dissuaded from any inclination to cut rates in the foreseeable future, which is the only time-span Wall Street pays the slightest heed to. \u001d  And although we're loath to suggest something so unlikely, it's at least conceivable that a few folks with nothing better to do (or maybe they're bears who couldn't afford to fill up their tanks for a quickie trip to the beach) took a close look at the slew of economic reports that came tumbling down the pike last week and found there might be less there than the headlines suggest. \u001d  Just by way of illustration, when released Friday morning, the employment numbers seemed to herald a very smart recovery in jobs in May from April's punk showing. But, on closer inspection, such a benign reading, alas, proved a mite less buoyant. \u001d  There were a grand total of 157,000 additions to payrolls last month, according to the Labor Department, after a meager 80,000 new jobs in April, while the unemployment rate held at 4.5%. Fine and dandy -- except the details weren't especially. \u001d  For one thing, nearly two-fifths of the jobs were in the usual health-care and bars and restaurant sectors, which, unless things have changed drastically overnight, are not big payers. For another, manufacturing, where a paycheck is usually more than a living wage, continued its downward spiral, losing some 19,000 slots. Temporary employment, which our trusty friends at the Liscio Report, Philippa Dunne and Doug Henwood, note is often a portent of things to come, lost ground. \u001d  And, supposedly, construction was unchanged. Considering the devastation in housing, we flat-out don't believe that. Somebody who doesn't know a pick from a shovel must have made the tally. \u001d  Moreover, the so-called household report, which bulls used to gush over until the numbers went south, registered a job gain of only 66,000, after a drop of 70,000 in April. And it also, comment Philippa and Doug, \"showed signs of slack developing in the labor market.\" \u001d  There were other indications that far from being tight, as the bulls on the economy contend, the labor market is manifesting some troubling trends. Folks not officially in the labor force but who'd love a job increased by 155,000 to the \"highest level since early 2006.\" That suggests the real unemployment rate is over 5%. And thousands more toilers are working part-time because they can't latch on to full-time jobs. \u001d  Finally, there's the weird workings of the Bureau of Labor Statistics'\"birth/death\" model, that concoction described in this space last week that was devised to estimate the number of job gains and losses by outfits too new to be covered by the monthly payroll survey. What's so nice about it, especially in Washington's not entirely unbiased view, is that it can make a bad report look tolerable and a tolerable report look great. \u001d  Last month, for example, this exercise in statistical fantasy added 203,000 jobs. Which, as Philippa and Doug observe, was 46,000 more than the entire gain reported in the official tally. We don't know, we're sorry to admit, the name of the wizard who conjured up the birth/death model. But any right-thinking citizen who treasures good news and finds himself in his favorite watering hole ought to lift a glass in gratitude to him or her. Unless, of course, he's filling a job that is strictly an illusory statistic. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"bf8533961d52e3be01b3148b826ab7fc","symR":["ALEA.LN","FIG","BMG015751024"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Fortress Investment To Push Alea Offer Despite Resistance -FT","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T16:58:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["ALEA.LN","FIG","BMG015751024"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","INS","INU"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG), the U.S. hedge fund and private equity group, will persist with a GBP168 million offer for London-listed reinsurer Alea Group Holdings Ltd.

(Nasdaq: ISIS) today announced preliminary data from a Phase II clinical trial of OGX-011 in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). Data were presented by Dr. Kim Chi, Study Chair and a medical oncologist at BC Cancer Agency - Vancouver Centre, representing the National Cancer Institute of Canada - Clinical Trials Group at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago. \b \u001d  Eighty-one patients with metastatic or locally recurrent prostate cancer refractory to hormone therapy were randomized to one of two treatment arms to receive either 640 mg OGX-011 per week in combination with docetaxel and prednisone or docetaxel and prednisone alone. As of May 14, 2007 all 81 patients had been followed for a minimum of 4.8 months. Currently, 22 percent of patients are still receiving study treatment and all patients continue to be followed. \b \b \b    Summary of Preliminary Results from this Ongoing Study: \b \b    -   The median duration of progression-free survival was 7.3 months in \b        patients who received OGX-011 plus docetaxel and 5.8 months in \b        patients who received docetaxel. \b \b    -   Disease progression occurred in fewer patients who received OGX-011 \b        plus docetaxel: \b \b        -   Progressive measurable disease as the best response occurred in \b            4 percent of patients in the OGX-011 plus docetaxel arm and in \b            22 percent of patients in the docetaxel arm. \b \b        -   PSA progression as the best response occurred in no patients in \b            the OGX-011 plus docetaxel arm and in 10 percent of patients in \b            the docetaxel arm. \b \b    -   While response rates for both measurable disease and PSA assessments \b        in the study arms were similar, disease stabilization, by both \b        assessments, occurred in more patients in the OGX-011 plus docetaxel \b        arm. \b \b        -   Stable measurable disease as the best response occurred in \b            73 percent of patients in the OGX-011 plus docetaxel arm (median \b            duration 9.7 months) and in 52 percent of patients in the \b            docetaxel arm (median duration 7.6 months). \b \b        -   PSA stabilization (i.e. PSA non-response/non-progression) \b            occurred in 45 percent of patients in the OGX-011 plus docetaxel \b            arm and in 32 percent of patients in the docetaxel arm. \b \b    -   The primary endpoint of PSA response was seen in 20 of 40 patients \b        who received OGX-011 plus docetaxel. This number of responses met the \b        criterion for declaring this combination of interest to explore \b        further. PSA response was seen in 21 of 40 patients who received \b        docetaxel, indicating this arm also met the same criterion. \b \b \u001d  \"These preliminary data support the continued development of OGX-011 in prostate cancer,\" said Dr. Chi, medical oncologist at the Vancouver Prostate Center and the BC Cancer Agency, and the lead investigator in the study. \"Follow-up evaluation of all patients at the completion of study treatment and at six months post treatment will provide additional information that will allow us to conduct further assessment of the therapeutic activity of OGX-011.\" \b \u001d  \"Data from a previously conducted Phase I study in prostate cancer suggest that OGX-011 can effectively regulate its target, clusterin, a protein expressed by tumor cells and associated with treatment resistance,\" said Scott Cormack, president and CEO of OncoGenex. \"We are encouraged with the preliminary results in patients who received OGX-011, particularly the high rates of disease stabilization in both assessments of measurable disease and PSA. These data support our further evaluation of the therapeutic potential of OGX-011 in prostate cancer.\" \b \b    Study Design and Safety Results: \b \u001d  The study was designed as a non-comparative Phase II study. Any differences observed between study arms were not designed to be subject to statistical analyses but instead, were intended to guide future development of OGX-011 and to provide preliminary guidance regarding activity and tolerability. Patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms to receive either 640 mg per week of OGX-011 by intravenous infusion in combination with docetaxel and prednisone or docetaxel and prednisone alone. \b \u001d  The median number of cycles of chemotherapy administered was 8 in patients who received OGX-011 plus docetaxel (range 1-10) and 6 in patients who received docetaxel (range 1-10). \b \u001d  The investigators concluded that treatment with OGX-011 was well tolerated. All 81 treated patients were evaluable for non-hematological and hematological adverse events. The following events (all grade 1 or 2) were documented more commonly in patients given OGX-011 plus prednisone and docetaxel than patients given prednisone and docetaxel alone: fever (50 percent and 15 percent), rigors/chills (60 percent and 7 percent), sweating (25 percent and 12 percent), sensory neuropathy (70 percent and 49 percent) and limb edema (38 percent and 27 percent). The majority of patients experienced granulocytopenia and neutropenia, with similar frequency and magnitude in each arm. Grade 3/4 lymphopenia was more common in patients receiving OGX-011 plus docetaxel (53 percent) than in patients who received docetaxel (20 percent). In general, the toxicities were consistent for the adverse event profile for docetaxel and prednisone. There were 11 serious adverse events (SAEs) reported for each study arm. \b \u001d  The study was supported by a grant from the Canadian Cancer Society through the National Cancer Institute of Canada and coordinated by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG) based at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, which is also funded by the Canadian Cancer Society. The study was further supported by OncoGenex, Isis and an unrestricted grant from sanofi-aventis. \b \b    About OGX-011 \b \u001d  OGX-011 is designed to specifically inhibit the production of the cell-survival protein, clusterin. Clusterin production is associated with treatment resistance in many cancers and in response to various cancer treatments, including hormone ablation therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Preclinical studies have shown that inhibition of clusterin can disable the tumor cell's adaptive defences, render the tumor cells susceptible to attack with a variety of cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, and facilitate tumor-cell death. OncoGenex and Isis are collaborating on development of OGX-011, which is the subject of five ongoing Phase II studies evaluating the safety and activity of OGX-011 in patients with prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. \b \b    About OncoGenex \b \u001d  OncoGenex is committed to the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients. OncoGenex currently has three product candidates in development: OGX-011, OGX-427 and OGX-225. These product candidates are designed to selectively inhibit the production of proteins that are associated with treatment resistance and that are over-produced in response to a variety of cancer treatments. OncoGenex' aim in targeting these particular proteins is to disable the tumor cells' adaptive defenses, render the tumor cells susceptible to attack with a variety of cancer therapies including chemotherapy, and facilitate tumor cell death. More information on OncoGenex and the company's pipeline is available at www.oncogenex.ca. \b \b    About Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \b \u001d  Isis is exploiting its expertise in RNA to discover and develop novel drugs for its product pipeline and for its partners. The Company has successfully commercialized the world's first antisense drug and has 17 drugs in development. Isis' drug development programs are focused on treating cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Isis' partners are developing drugs for cancer, and inflammatory and other diseases.

The company's stock (ticker: NYT) did rise almost $1, to $26.05, Friday on the Dow Jones (DJ) news, but it remains below its 52-week high of $26.90 and at roughly half its 2002 peak. Dow Jones shares jumped $7.94, to $61.25, as investors bet that News Corp. (NWS) Chairman Rupert Murdoch would boost his $60-a-share offer or that another bidder would emerge. \u001d  The Sulzberger family, which controls the Times through supervoting stock, has adamantly opposed a sale. Says a Times investor: \"The family has drunk the Kool-Aid,\" meaning the Sulzbergers believe that only they can be true guardians of the editorial independence of their beloved newspaper. The price of Times options doesn't suggest that investors are betting on a sale. \u001d  A sale looks unlikely, but the Sulzbergers now may be more willing to consider taking the Times private, to forestall a possible hostile bid. The Times -- arguably print journalism's ultimate trophy property -- could appeal to a corporation like Google (GOOG) or to an ego-driven billionaire or two. The Sulzbergers do have the power to reject any takeover bid, but it would look bad -- and be a poor example of corporate governance -- for them to scorn an offer of $35 a share or more. \u001d  The stock-market value of the Times company is a modest $3.8 billion and its debt stands at about $900 million, following the sale of its TV stations in May. As Barron's noted in a bullish article last fall (\"Ink-Stained Opportunity,\" Nov. 13, 2006), the Times could be worth $35 on a sum-of-the-parts basis. The value probably is higher now. If the Sulzbergers, who own 20% of the company, were to buy the remaining 80% for $35 a share, it would cost them $4 billion. \u001d  To finance such a deal, the Times could sell its regional newspapers, About.com and the Boston Globe. These assets could be worth $2.5 billion or more before taxes. The Times also has $500 million in equity in its new Manhattan headquarters, plus other assets -- including 17% of the Boston Red Sox -- worth another $250 million. If all these assets were sold, the Times still would have ample debt, but the family would fully control its prized asset, the New York Times newspaper, which produces $275 million in annual cash flow. \u001d  With iron-clad control of the Times, the family has no need to do anything, but given the potential sale of Dow Jones, the Sulzbergers may have to reconsider their options. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d4e473330aa50744a4c59310f75d1f60","symR":["VOD","VOD.LN","GB00B16GWD56"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/4) Follow-Up: India Calling: Vodafone's Promise","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T04:08:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["VOD","VOD.LN","GB00B16GWD56"],"IndustryCodes":["CTS","TLS","XDJGI","XFT1","XGTI","XISL","XNYA","XST5","XSTT"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Vito J. Racanelli \u001d  Vodafone's stock has been on a tear, up nearly 50% since last fall as a result of improved investor sentiment on the stock and on the European telecoms group in general. \u001d  Markets are applauding the restructuring and cost cuts that the giant, European mobile-phone service provider is carrying out. Investors also like the company's big recent moves into fast-growing emerging markets like Turkey and India. \u001d  The hope is that intense competition and price erosion in the European operations -- 80% of sales and operating profits -- are stabilizing. Lately, there's even vague speculation that Vodafone might interest private-equity buyers, though that's probably a stretch in view of the company's huge market capitalization of $170 billion. \u001d  Last week, the company announced that revenue increased 6% to GBP 31.1 billion in the year ended March 2007. The adjusted earnings per ordinary-share and the dividend both rose 11% to, respectively, 11.26 pence and 6.76 pence, for a yield of about 4.1%. (Vodafone narrowed its basic loss per share to 8.94 pence from 27.66 pence. The bottom-line red ink was generated by heavy writedowns of assets in Germany and Italy, and investors tend to look at the adjusted results.) \b \u001d  A few years ago Barron's highlighted Vodafone's growth prospects and its long-term allure (\"Right Numbers,\" May 3, 2004). Vodafone exceeded the 20%-40% price rise we predicted, though earnings growth wasn't as strong as we had expected and the stock rise took longer than we had thought. \u001d  The American depositary receipts, which closed Friday at 32.24, have returned a total of 46%, about equal to the European telecom group. That's lower than the 60% return over the same period from the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 index, of which it is a member. Much of Vodafone's jump came in the last nine months, and a strong British pound has helped dollar- based investors. The London-traded shares closed Friday at 163 pence. \u001d  \"The earnings were more or less in line with expectations,\" says Roberto Cominotto, an analyst at Bank Julius Baer, which holds the stock. The fiscal 2008 outlook given by the company -- continued strong emerging-market growth and a challenging but a stable Europe -- was \"relatively positive,\" he adds. \u001d  Indeed, Vodafone's outlook at this point isn't nearly as rosy as it was three years ago, but nonetheless Barron's is modestly bullish. \u001d  The $10.9 billion acquisition last month of a 67% stake in India's Hutchison Essar mobile-phone group will stand Vodafone in good stead a year or two from now. Something like 6-million new Indian subscribers get a mobile phone each month, and this country of over 1 billion has just a 15% penetration rate, so the growth potential is enormous. Excluding Essar subscribers, Vodafone has 206 million subs, of which half are in emerging markets. \u001d  The key question for the stock is whether the developing markets expansion will more than make up for a potential continuing decline in Europe, where the industry's penetration is over 100% and Vodafone's operating margins slipped to 38.5% last year from 40.1%, notes Joe Sterling, a portfolio manager with American Century, which doesn't own Vodafone shares. \u001d  The stock's valuations of about 14 times consensus EPS estimates for fiscal 2008 is a bit higher than the group's 12.5 times, though not overly rich, says Stijn Elebaut, an analyst at SG Private Banking. With a nice dividend yield and a supportive broad market, investors who don't mind some volatility could do well to wait for the Indian riches to come through. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:08 ET (04:08 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d50dacaf861765b8fea5c10b52a424c4","symR":["AB","EV","IDXX","TROW","WOOF","WYNN","BARAX","BSCFX"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/4) Profile: First-Hand Analysis","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T04:04:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["AB","EV","IDXX","TROW","WOOF","WYNN","BARAX","BSCFX"],"IndustryCodes":["AMG","CNO","CSV","MDS","XDJGI","XISL","XNQ1","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI","XSP5"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Ilana Polyak \u001d  Profile: Andrew Peck \u001d  Portfolio Manager \u001d  Baron Asset Fund \b \u001d  Back when Andrew Peck was a young analyst --  which wasn't that long ago -- his boss Ron Baron told him to book a flight to Mexico. The iconoclastic growth-fund manager wanted his protege to see the pioneering outsourcing effort of the Libbey Glass operation there up close. \u001d  A business trip to Mexico might seem like a marvelous perk for an up-and-comer, but it turned out the glass and tableware maker's plant was in the dusty industrial town of Monterrey. It was also mid-summer, and the factory didn't have air conditioning. \"I always seemed to end up with those awful assignments,\" says Peck, of his formative lessons in first-hand company research. \u001d  Mostly, however, Peck's had a pretty smooth, comfortable rise in the Baron organization. In 2003, the Stanford business and law-school grad was plucked from the analyst ranks and installed as day-to-day portfolio manager of the Baron Asset Fund (ticker: BARAX), the firm's flagship investment vehicle which he co-runs with its namesake. This year, he's also gotten to share more of the responsibility for the 15-person research department with Baron, who serves as chief investment officer, and Cliff Greenberg, manager of Baron Small Cap (BSCFX). \u001d  \"Ron Baron is trying to build a sustainable organization and not have everything reliant on Ron Baron,\" says Kerry O'Boyle, an analyst who covers Baron Asset for fund researcher Morningstar. \"He's clearly thinking about what's next.\" \u001d  Although Baron, 64, has made no mention of retiring, the new generation of managers will help shape the funds that bear his name. In its 25-year history, Baron Capital has developed a reputation for savvy, price-conscious stock-picking among companies with solid long-term growth prospects that can double their earnings within about four or five years. Although it runs an Internet-related fund, Baron mostly avoids tech shares, and its portfolios tend to be relatively concentrated. \u001d  Lately, Peck, 38, has logged many hours on the Chinese island of Macao, evaluating the growth prospects for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), his fund's top holding. \u001d  Over the years, Ron Baron has invested in several of casino-operator Steve Wynn's companies. When Wynn went public in 2002 at $13 a share, the Baron funds loaded up. \"Casinos and gaming are something that Ron Baron has done for 20 years,\" O'Boyle points out. \"It's always been a favorite theme of his.\" Wynn shares recently traded at about 98, meaning investors in the IPO have enjoyed a roughly seven-fold return. \u001d  Although Peck's co-management of Baron Asset post-dates the Wynn investment, he continues to hold a positive view of the gaming trend, especially in Macao. \"There are 300 million people who live within a three-hour flight of Macao. So it's become the Las Vegas of the East,\" he says. \"Macao is the largest gaming market in the world.\" \u001d  Wynn is one of two outfits with a license to operate casinos on the island, and the company now owns a 600-room hotel and casino, with several others in various stages of development. In addition, Wynn owns 52 acres of land on the Cotai Strip, not far from downtown Macao, plus some 142 acres of land on the Las Vegas Strip. Peck values the Macao property at about $1 billion and the Vegas land at roughly $3.5 billion, which he doesn't believe is fully reflected in its share price. \u001d  Peck has a price target of 165 for Wynn shares in 2009, based on projections of $1.2 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, up from $700 million this year. In the following seven to 10 years, Wynn can generate another $10 billion in equity value, or $100 per share, by developing the two tracts of land, Peck maintains. \u001d  It should come as no surprise that Peck has adopted Baron's views about stocks since he spent five years as an analyst at the firm, first as a summer associate during his Stanford days and then as a generalist. \u001d  \"What's really unique about asset management, at least the way it's practiced here at Baron, is that within the first week on the job, you can sit down with CEOs of large public companies and be in a position to ask them probing questions,\" he says. \u001d  A young lawyer wouldn't have such an opportunity for years, something Peck couldn't countenance. And who did Peck meet during his first weeks as a summer associate in 1998? Ralph Lauren, head of the clothing and design empire whose shares are still in the fund. \u001d  These personal meetings, together with the sometimes gritty on-site inspections in out-of-the-way places, have served the fund's shareholders well. For the last three years, a timeframe that encompasses Peck's tenure, the fund is up 19% on an annualized basis through May 30, according to Morningstar. That places Peck in the top 9% of his mid-cap growth peers and beats the Standard & Poor's 400 Mid-Cap Index annually by 3.15 percentage points. \u001d  Like Baron, Peck is fond of pinpointing large trends that will have a positive impact on a company's prospects. One that he particularly likes is the aging of the baby boomers, especially the effects on health care. But it's not human health care that's most interesting for Peck, it's pet health care. \"The profile of a pet owner is a baby boomer who is in their peak saving and spending years,\" he notes. \u001d  These owners, he says, spend freely on their furry companions and expect the same quality of care they themselves receive. What's more, they're not reluctant to pay for pricey medical procedures out of pocket. So Peck expects 8% to 9% industry growth for the next few years, far outpacing inflation. He added VCA Antech (WOOF) and Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) in the last year. Together, they control the vast majority of veterinary labs in the U.S. VCA alone has nearly 55% of the $450 million market. \u001d  In addition to its diagnostic labs, VCA is on a buying spree, absorbing veterinary practices into its nearly 400-clinic network. As a result, it \"has tremendous pricing power for its laboratory services,\" he says. \u001d  Peck expects VCA to earn $3 a share by 2011, up from $1.16 in 2006, and he has a price target of 75 for the stock, which last week was trading at about 39. He sees Idexx earnings hitting $7 a share in 2011 from $2.67 a share in 2006. He maintains a target of 150 for Idexx shares; they're now at 89. \u001d  The same baby-boomer trend has also led Peck toward a handful of asset-management companies, which he believes can ride the saving-and-retirement trend. Again, Morningstar's O'Boyle sees the hand of Ron Baron, who has long had a penchant for the stocks. Peck's contribution, in 2005, was AllianceBernstein (AB), which was added to holdings that include T. Rowe Price (TROW) and Eaton Vance (EV). \u001d  Peck is convinced that despite the scuttlebutt about Americans' lack of savings, for a great many people, retirement saving is a key preoccupation, and baby boomers are in the thick of their accumulation for this lofty goal (See \"Savings Myth,\" Barron's, May 28). \"These businesses are benefiting from the rising equity markets; they're gaining market share and the money they're taking in is coming in at high incremental margins,\" he says. \u001d  AllianceBernstein is capitalizing on investor interest in volatile, yet potentially rewarding, hedge funds. Since 2003, assets under management for these performance-fee based vehicles has doubled. AllianceBernstein has vowed to keep a lid on alternative-investment costs, which should help sustain the fat profit margins. \u001d  Again, Peck expects the firm's earnings to double to $8 to $9 a share by 2011, with the recent stock price of 91.40 making a roughly commensurate jump toward 175. \u001d  \"You need meaningful scale to make this business profitable,\" he says. \"And no one is coming in and starting new, big mutual funds.\" \u001d  That's cause for comfort for both AllianceBernstein and a one-time investment analyst turned fund manager. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"d5462fa54a01c7df62e7135d87893ea1","symR":["SLB"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Gunmen Kidnap 4 Foreign Oil Workers In S Nigeria -Police","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T08:41:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["SLB"],"IndustryCodes":["EQS","OIE","XDJGI","XISL","XNYA","XSP5"],"Story":"\b \u001d  LAGOS, Nigeria (AP)--A group of gunmen wearing security force uniforms invaded a compound in southern Nigeria and kidnapped four foreign oil workers without firing a shot, police said Saturday. \u001d  The abduction occurred overnight at the oil-services firm Schlumberger Ltd.

(PFE) drug shrank tumors in people with thyroid cancer, according to results of a small study released Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. \u001d  The Pfizer compound, axitinib, is designed to block the creation of blood vessels that feed tumors, similar to Genentech Inc.'s (DNA) Avastin, which is used to treat colorectal and lung cancers. Axitinib is a pill taken twice daily, however, while Avastin is given periodically by intravenous infusion. Pfizer is studying axitinib in several types of cancer including those of the kidney and pancreas, and it's not yet approved by regulators. \u001d  Thyroid cancer is diagnosed in about 30,180 people a year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. Most cases are curable thanks to surgery and radioactive iodine treatment, and thyroid cancer has a five-year survival rate of about 97%. \u001d  But some patients don't respond to surgery or radioactive iodine, and there are few other options. Pfizer studied axitinib in these patients. \u001d  About 60 patients with advanced thyroid cancer took axitinib, and about 22% of them experienced tumor shrinkage, according to an ASCO press release. \u001d  The tumor shrinkages lasted from about one to 16 months. In an additional 50% of patients, tumors stopped growing. Also, blood tests showed lower levels of the protein known as vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, which is believed to play a role in creation of blood vessels that feed tumors. \u001d  Side effects observed in the Pfizer-funded study included fatigue, high blood pressure and protein in the urine. \u001d  The Phase 2 study didn't compare axitinib with anything - such as another drug or dummy pill - but Pfizer plans a Phase 3 study in certain subtypes of thyroid cancer that will compare axitinib with a dummy pill. \u001d  If Phase 3 results are positive, Pfizer would probably file for regulatory approval of axitinib. \b \b         Avastin Effective In Kidney Cancer \b \u001d  A separate study released at ASCO Saturday showed that adding Avastin to the previous standard treatment for an advanced form of kidney cancer nearly doubled progression-free survival. Progression-free survival is a measure of time from start of treatment until death or tumor growth. \u001d  In the study of about 650 patients, some received a drug called interferon, which was the standard treatment for certain kidney cancers until newer drugs came on the market over the past two years. The rest received interferon plus Avastin. \u001d  Progression-free survival was 10.2 months in the combination group that included Avastin, versus 5.4 months in the interferon-alone group, according to an ASCO press release. Severe side effects included fatigue, loss of strength and protein in the urine. \u001d  Avastin appears to be the latest in a series of drugs to show effectiveness in treating kidney cancer, which previously had limited treatment options. Since late 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved three new treatments for kidney cancer: Nexavar from Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX) and Bayer AG (BAY); Pfizer's Sutent; and, just last month, Wyeth's (WYE) Torisel. \u001d  About 38,890 new cases of kidney cancer were estimated to be diagnosed in the U.S. last year, while about 12,840 died from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society. Avastin was tested in an advanced stage of the most common form of kidney cancer, renal cell carcinoma. \u001d  Avastin was tested with interferon and not the newer drugs because the trial was started in 2004, before the other drugs hit the market. Future studies may test Avastin directly against the newer drugs, as well as in combination with some of them. \b    Sanofi-Aventis, Regeneron To Present First VEGF Data \u001d  Sanofi-Aventis SA (SNY) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN) will present the first look at data from an on-going Phase II study of patients with advanced ovarian cancer using a drug known as \"VEGF Trap\" later Saturday. The drug is designed to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor, a protein found in the bloodstream and secreted by tumors. \u001d  So far researchers have enrolled 162 patients out of a planned 200. Patients currently in the study were enrolled from June 2006 to April 2007. So far 13 patients, or 8%, treated with VEGF have had a so-called partial response, meaning their disease has improved and 41% of patients had so-called stable disease when measured 14 weeks or about three months after starting treatment. \b \u001d  -By Peter Loftus, Dow Jones Newswires; 215-656-8289; peter.loftus@dowjones.com \u001d  (Jennifer Corbett Dooren contributed to this report) \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 12:00 ET (16:00 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ebe42733bab5754a19f14e5157821130","symR":["BLC"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099],"Headline":"Barron's(6/4) How To Fix An Old-Media Stock","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T04:07:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["BLC"],"IndustryCodes":["MED","PUB","XDJGI","XNYA","XRUS"],"Story":"\b   (From BARRON'S) \b   By Andrew Bary \u001d  Not all old media is dead.

In April, a private-equity group paid a stiff 15 times pretax cash flow for TV stations owned by radio giant Clear Channel Communications (ticker: CCU). Most media companies fetch eight to 10 times estimated 2007 cash flow. Nexstar (NXST) and Lin TV (TVL) are exploring \"strategic alternatives,\" which could lead to the sale of each. \u001d  In a fragmenting media world, network TV stations still draw big audiences, attract significant political advertising and have been gaining viewers -- at the expense of cable networks. Wall Street also is excited about the prospect for higher retransmission fees, collected by network affiliates from satellite and cable-TV operators that carry their channels. These fees are pure profit. \u001d  The Street's newfound appreciation for TV is bullish for Belo (BLC), a venerable Texas media company that owns an attractive group of 19 TV stations, including an affiliate of ABC in Dallas and of CBS in Houston, both the top-ranked stations in their markets. Belo also owns four newspapers, led by the Dallas Morning News. \u001d  Citigroup Global Markets analyst Eileen Furukawa last week lifted her rating on Belo to Buy from Hold, and boosted her price target on its stock to 25 from 19. Belo's shares, which have been trading around 22, could go as high as 30 if Belo is willing to separate its broadcasting and newspaper divisions. \u001d  \". . . A breakup of Belo would unlock tremendous value for shareholders by reducing the conglomerate discount that is currently assigned to Belo shares,\" Furukawa wrote in a client note. Belo has one of the best collections of TV stations outside those owned by the networks. In 11 of their 14 TV markets, Belo stations rank No. 1 or 2. The company's desirable stations are in high-growth areas, notably Texas and the Pacific Northwest. \u001d  The stumbling block to a Belo breakup: The controlling family -- descendants of George Bannerman Dea-ley -- has shown little enthusiasm for splitting the TV and newspaper businesses. Like the New York Times (NYT), Washington Post (WPO) and Barron\"s publisher Dow Jones (DJ), Belo has supervoting stock that's owned by the controlling family. The family controls an estimated 20% of the shares outstanding. \u001d  On Belo's first-quarter earnings call in April, CEO Robert Decherd, a family member, was asked about the best way to unlock value for shareholders. His reply: \"We have a strong bias towards operating these businesses and building shareholder value over the long horizon.\" Decherd noted that since Belo went public in 1981, Wall Street's views on the relative merits of newspapers and TV periodically have shifted. Company executives weren't available for comment last week. \u001d  Even if Belo keeps both its broadcasting and newspaper businesses, it could reward shareholders with a dividend boost. Belo should generate $1.60 a share in free cash flow this year. The current annual dividend of 50 cents provides a yield of 2.2%. \"Belo could easily take the dividend to 5%,\" Furukawa says. Alternatively, Belo could boost its buyback program by taking on more debt. Belo's equity-market value is $2.3 billion. It has $1.3 billion of debt, equal to three times annual cash flow. \u001d  In the first quarter, Belo's TV division produced about half of its $354 million of revenue and more than 70% of its $91 million in operating cash flow.  Belo's newspaper revenue was down 11% and cash flow was off 10%. Overall, Belo's first-quarter profits fell to 15 cents a share, from 16 cents a year earlier. Furukawa projects 2007 profits of $1.05 a share, down from $1.19 in 2006. \u001d  The average pure-play TV stock fetches 13.4 times projected 2007 cash flow (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Put a 13.4 multiple on Belo's projected 2007 TV cash flow of $317 million, and it yields a stock price of $20.60, after subtracting corporate expenses, Furukawa says. Investors effectively are paying little more than one times cash flow for the newspapers. Put just an eight multiple on their cash flow, and the stock is worth $30. \u001d  Given the family control, investors may need some patience. Yet with institutional holders  restless, TV stations fetching high prices and Belo's stock  where it was a decade ago, the heat's on CEO Decherd to do something. Shareholders need only look at the drama playing out at Barron's parent, Dow Jones, to see the possibilities. \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."},{"md5ID":"ee700b5544e7d0594474312f3f02ca3a","symR":["12057.FR","REGN","SNY","FR0000120578","12057.FR","REGN","SNY","FR0000120578"],"date":"2007-06-02","ret":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"ret5":[-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099,-0.00099],"Headline":": Results of VEGF Trap (Aflibercept) -2-","GmtTimeStamp":"2007-06-02T16:00:00.000000000","CompanyCodes":["12057.FR","REGN","SNY","FR0000120578"],"IndustryCodes":["BTC","DRG","XCA4","XDJGI","XENX","XES","XISL","XNYA","XRUS","XSCI"],"Story":"\u001d  This press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.

If you haven't heard by now, the long-feuding Microsoft chairman and Apple chief executive shared the same stage for a joint interview for the first time in many years during The Wall Street Journal's D: All Things Digital conference last week. \u001d  The computer-era contemporaries reminded everyone, and probably themselves, that they have a lot more in common than not. The two billionaires displayed a rekindled mutual respect during a volley of compliments as they strolled down memory lane, much to the chagrin of the few in attendance perversely hoping for a return to their Ali-Frazier past. \u001d  Gates was a gentleman, expressing genuine appreciation for Jobs' intuition and general aesthetic \"taste.\" In turn, Jobs praised Gates' early recognition that software would rule the personal computer age and his ability to form pragmatic partnerships with other strong-willed technologists. While politely choreographed, the meeting was a slice of history that will undoubtedly provide ample soundbites for generations of television biopics to come. \u001d  Earlier in the conference, Jobs appeared separately to unveil Apple's partnership with Google's You Tube. The deal allows users of the Apple TV media hub -- a computer that ties the Internet and stored music, photos and video to home entertainment centers -- to watch videos from the popular online video service on their big-screen televisions, as opposed to computer monitors. The conference was a coming-out party for the You Tube Guys, Chad Hurley and Steven Chen, who could be sighted everywhere. \u001d  During his You Tub demonstration, Jobs referred to tepid-selling Apple TV as a \"hobby\" rather than a \"business\" on par with the company's three full business lines: the Macintosh, the iPod and, after late June, the iPhone. The Apple CEO instead focused on the success of the new Intel-powered Macs. \u001d  \"That was a huge thing to do, and I think we did it very well,\" he said, referring to the transition to Intel chips. Jobs pointed out that Apple's computer sales now are running about three times ahead of the industry average, underscoring that Macintosh sales are as vital as ever. Jobs also predicted that notebook sales could dominate destktops to the extent that \"notebooks will be 80%-90% [of the personal computers] that we sell.\" \u001d  Early last week, Apple shares (ticker: AAPL) jumped on the relatively benign news that iTunes would begin selling some songs that will work on players other than iPods. They closed the week up 4%, at $113.62. \u001d  Jobs' salesmanship is legendary, and his ability to reverse  field rivals that of seasoned politicians. At a previous D conference, the Apple CEO vowed to avoid the cellphone business. Now, a couple years later, he is promising not only to deliver the best cellphone in the business, but the best wireless phone combined with the best portable music player, best keyboard display and best mobile Internet capability. \"It's the real Internet in your pocket,\" says Jobs of the iPhone. So confident is Jobs about the device that he predicts that established handset firms will copy his hardware design but fail to duplicate his software. Smartphones are really \"software wrapped in really wonderful hardware,\" Jobs preached. But his good friend Gates could have told him that. \u001d  --- \u001d  E-mail: mark.veverka@barrons.com \u001d  --- \u001d  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \b \u001d  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\u001d  June 02, 2007 00:02 ET (04:02 GMT)\u001d  Copyright (c) 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."}]
